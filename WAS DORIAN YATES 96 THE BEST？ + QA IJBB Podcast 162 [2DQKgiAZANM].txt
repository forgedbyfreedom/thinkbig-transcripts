every shot every shot is very shot so I mean you know you can criticize the torn bicep because the front double was kind of you know it hurts the front double by 96 his arm had recovered a bit like it was a lot better than it was in 94 he had just torn it so like it was he legitimately they could have you know taken the title from him and it would have been arguable for sure a 95 it was still like you know a problem visually 96 he got a little better here hey everybody welcome to it's just bodybuilding episode 162 on your host Bigron Park L. my co-host Dusty Han Shah our triple co-host and

want to throw something in here real quick that I had to read because I thought it was pretty amazing and I just got it through to my thing so as a lot of you guys know mutinistored sponsoring the show and we talked about what it's been this month so three episodes that mutinist sponsor in the show and the reason it's not a big push they didn't ask for ads or anything like that they just wanted to be the title sponsor the show and this is actually from a a listener Paul Thomas sent this in with his order hello I just made an order with you guys and I really appreciate you guys gave me a buy one get one half off deal now however the main reason I decided to order from you guys is because of Ron Park low and dusty handshoffers it's just probably podcast I was unable to put either of their discount codes in because I had received the other offer from you guys but I wanted to make sure to give them credit because I want to know I'm supporting them they're awesome looking forward to trying my new pre work out from you guys thank you so it's colato sweet sick that he sent that awesome that actually mutin sent that to Ron and I Ron hasn't seen it yet and thank you very much Paul

the rounds going to check on that he's like is that really 21% you really about the fucker it is that's the thing wait don't let the truth get in the way did you just did you notice that hat look at look at the cowboy the cowboy hat what's that cowboy hat I want to see you the cowboy hat on you Ron I do too that's my old cowboy hat that I used to bartend in during the rodeo days and it's just hanging on my the rodeo days now wait the rodeo days well there'd always be like you know like in the summertime there might be a rodeo in the city or something sort of you were in cowboy hats at week okay you know there's Calgary stan pede like they have their job best the biggest one in the world so through two weeks there there are wearing cowboy hats you know so there's all that sort of thing and we're in the Canada where I'm from is there's you know there's always a rodeo in every city at some point of the year nice I would like for this very first YouTube question for Ron to wear the cowboy hat during the answer can we get that can we get that we make that we can we can do that we can yes all right I'm so happy right now because Ron's got his cowboy hat there we go and there we go nice that works Emily's losing her mind right now like she's actually in physical pain this is way too small for my head like it doesn't really fit I'd you know you were taking growth back then so yeah no no it's just like I think for Halloween you know I was a cowboy for Halloween one year that sort of ship but I just always had this dumb hat I don't even remember where I got it I think I bought it for a costume and then it just was always my dumb cowboy hat and I was just kind of kept it it was funny okay let's go first question question got one question all right this is from Ryan Mansfield longtime supporter of the program please give you 20 minute answer part of the patreon and and and he's a really intense trainer too I've seen his videos over on Instagram says guys a question for the next show which version of Dorian Yates what is the best in your opinion I know so many say 93 Olympia because let's face it it was pretty much the best physique ever to grace the Olympia stage ever but my personal favorite is the 96 German Grand Prix there is a video on YouTube of the pre judging where it's just Dorian hitting the mandatory is and to me it's the most mind bending package I have ever seen could you review the video on the show and give your opinions great show been here since it's just bodybuilding episode one so we actually I pulled this up and I got to get rid of some other stuff like porn and stuff that you guys can't see on my screen here all right we're good we're gonna go like this we're gonna go like this and then I think if I just hit this we'll go to full screen we should be good how's that look guys got damn yep so this is one of the best videos of all time this is crazy and you got it in mid that stage lighting looks pretty fucking awesome and you know Dorian's condition is just just you know he he really had it down pat yeah he was so hard there too just Dorian was always like even you know he was just so dry yeah he had it down pat his body his body handled water and sodium and carbs very well you know what would you say what's his favorite what's your favorite shot of his front lot spread is the kind of like the standard by which all front lots of spreads of you know the back the back double the back lat the side try I think those were his four this four main shots yeah glutes the hands and we can't really look at this you know I think it's just amazing good yeah I know the back double you know yeah like the muscle on the back see sets up to Christmas tree here fuck you yeah you know people people forget people forget what the previous champions you know accomplished yeah that's just how it always is you know but man you know that condition that amount of mass on his frame is 260 pounds here for sure yeah you know at least yeah that's nasty just a ran wrap you know every shot every shot is very incredible so I mean you know you can criticize the torn by sap because the front double was kind of you know it hurts the front double by 96 his arm had recovered a bit like it was a lot better than it was in 94 he had just torn it so like it was he legitimately they could have you know taken the title from him and it would have been arguable for sure 95 it was still like you know a problem visually 96 it got a little better here yeah you know just training putting muscle on it and getting it you know filling out and stuff but but I'd say my favorite is still 93 because he had no injuries the front double was like he literally won the front double in 93 yeah right as opposed to like how he says being last in the front double and then winning the other poses right so so I'd say my favorite version of Dorian is the one I saw in person 10 days after the 93 Olympia because that's right there that front double I think the thing that I see here and I know those two years after there's so much going on I don't even see his biceps yeah I could write that's a thing I don't see them there's too much going on like I think if you if you didn't know it was torn like for example that for that physique right there still win six Olympias right in my opinion you don't I mean I mean he's that good and I don't know that he was ever that that's the best video version of him I've ever seen because you can really see the the condition like we talked about a million times like you know Chris the Cito telling me that as good as Dorian as in videos it has nothing compared to what he looked like in person and that video was like really like fuzzy looking and he still looked just absolutely crazy yeah yeah is anyone put that much like separation and every single muscle at that size since him even Ron that's crazy that's the detail you know bonkers yeah okay thanks for the hat Ron appreciate it thanks for our we appreciate you yes one time only branding back to branding sorry about that me alright what are we doing are we going for more YouTube questions you guys have questions you want to do or what's what's the game plan we're going to go on YouTube going all right okay cool all right that's okay Maddie C says question for next time do you guys have any guilty pleasure music either to train to or just that you really enjoy sometimes lady Gaga and follow boy get me amped in the gym don't judge me that's a good question it's a good question I don't a guilty pleasure well like the odd time I listen to something that that's still my wheelhouse but not my training wheelhouse like the other day I put on the album holes album you know the big one they had with this on it and doll parts live through this yeah so I trained to live through this the other day it was fucking great album man there's lots of anger in that album yeah it's fucking play it's plenty pissed off you know it's so yeah that was that was actually kind of a fun little you know step out of my normal you know wheelhouse but guilty pleasure music I listened also to weird stuff when I'm driving in the car I put on like the other day I was listening to Jim crochet like I don't know if you guys know Jim crochet yeah amazing singer songwriter from the 70s he only made a couple albums and they was killed in a plane crash and he never got to be like you know he never got to make 10 albums and become like a David Bowie or you know massive star like he would have been but kind of like Hendrix you know came fast made like two amazing albums of like legendary hits that you've probably heard a million times and just don't know but yeah anyways Jim crochet's like awesome but that's like my relax music you know all right all right hmm well you just got you know what so I used to listen to a lot of music and then at a certain point it was actually when I got in recovery I like I stopped listening to all the stuff I used to listen to and a lot of it was real dark and I think that was part of the reason why and I hadn't committed to music in a real strong way for a long time and then I discovered like really nasty, grimy dubstep and I fell in love with it and it's like it's my thing now and there's some of that stuff is just like so intense and hard but in a completely different way than any music I used to listen to was so I really only listened to it when I trained and I'm kind of like when we've talked about like trying new hobbies and stuff like to me I'm a novice so like I'm like oh what is this you know it's like different then like the style it sounds a little different what is this and it like has a reggae influencer or something and and I just have a lot of fun with that and I'll find like just a set on sound cloud you know it'll be like an hour long and I'll listen to that whole thing while I train sometimes I'll find one I really like and then I'll listen to that one on repeat you know like the next time I train there'll be some stuff in there like that I never would expect like there's one track that they use some Katy Perry music but the way they like amp it up and stuff it's like it all comes together and I'm like fuck yeah I like Katy Perry but then I go listen to the real Katy Perry song and like this is a let down but like I'll listen to it in the dubstep mix where it's like all hard nasty in Victoria doesn't like that stuff so I always have to do it with the headphones because she doesn't want me to like jam the house out with it she says it sounds like robots having sex yeah it sounds like rat sounds like rat kun's fucking in garbage cans pretty much I'm okay with that and I get I get it's not for everybody Scott you could not have answered that more flawlessly because I was first stunned by the answer I was blown blown away then you threw Katy Perry in the mix just to fuck with him more and you made the the statement I like Katy Perry and you're like no I don't it was just a lot going on there and then I ended it with rat kun's fucking in a garbage can I mean this is where you took us here that sounds like pretty much yeah I wanted to insert the question because I'm like I went on a journey just now and I was like oh I got I got nothing I got nothing and the only reason I'm answering is because it reminds me of like a guilty pleasure but it will shock Ron I don't really like rap hip-hop kind of music when I'm training but sometimes Lil Wayne goes throughout the entire workout with me I've done that to you yeah it's good I'm like and I mean I love him anyways but that's not usually music for the gym for me and Ron's considering unfriendly me on Facebook right now no no I can't understand that's what's like like Rich Piano was said angry white music and angry black music as long as you're angry or because you go yeah that's a you ask Rich what do you like he go angry white music and anger black music fucking that's that's my thing so yeah I think that he's amazingly talented too like this was like a rabbit hole situation where one day I was I think we were driving across I I just put on his Spotify yeah yeah it's like really love it new all of his songs yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like an hour and a half into it I was like so you're possibly my favorite rapper ever I had no idea so yeah I'm right right yeah very talented unlike the shit that I had listened to with the kids in the car now it's funny I I I the other day listen to an entire car s1 album oh yeah because my my buddy Frank put up a flat land clip the kind of one viral everyone was sending it to me the one with the tire ripping on the ground that you sent to me no way there's a car s1 rap song he uses in that clip and I was like oh fuck I love this song so then of course I like Apple music to car s1 and like you know through a whole album on fucking yeah it was pretty cool so you did join the Spotify train I promise I'm on the Spotify train but the problem is is the gym uses my Spotify all the time I never know when it's using it or not and I like Apple music too it's awesome I use Apple music I used to exclusively until this year and I still go back because I like how it connects me to other music which is sweet you know or like you said the bonus tracks now are kind of cool okay Scott you won that battle by a long shot moving on I'm gonna have to skip past literally five questions because we got like so many music questions on this episode okay we can we can like filter him in you know as we go uh Barry kitchen also big time supporter of our channel he's part of the patreon he comments like every episode thank you so thank you Barry he says great duet we all know who he is and he's just not the only one you discussed about how trend isn't necessarily needed you can use other things that are actually safer for your health and your mental health maybe speak on that next episode yeah um well he's right yeah 100% right listen trend is probably the most effective steroid for just being a being an animal ox steroid androgenics steroid like it's I don't know is there anything stronger than trend balloon for you know nitrogen retention and recovery and but some people shouldn't take it man some people can't fucking handle their trend their their brain does not like those that powerful of an androgen there's it there and then there's other people it's not necessarily gonna be good for their health their blood work could get I've seen people as blood work get like destroyed with like one contest cycle of trend hmm it's just mean some people just can't take certain drugs right we know this hmm so not everyone can take trend that's what people have to get through their thick skull not everyone should take it some people can take trend it's like oh yeah I threw in a couple hundred ms a trend and yeah the prep went really well yeah I felt good you know sleeping alright I don't really know what they're talking about with the sweat staying like you know and then there's other people that are like oh my god I can't sleep with this trend I'm not sweating every night I feel like shit my heart's racing I arguing with my wife like a kale it's just like I don't know maybe I'm just not maybe I'm just not hardcore enough anymore it's it's trend doesn't make you a better bodybuilder no that's a thing and also two doses man like get your doses straight like man I've had guys win shows this year good clients win shows doing 50 makes a trend every second day the last six weeks right right so like and then I talked to other guys I'm like oh how much trend you is and like oh 600 I'm like Jesus 300 was staple for me when I was competing I would take 300 a week which I thought was pretty pretty heavy um because of what it was you know 300 a week Monday Wednesday Friday and fortunately I have an you know absurd blood work ability so that was never an issue and the worst thing about trend for me was actually just taking it the actual act and the role of the dice and wondering since I always like to put off taking drugs till nighttime if I was about to fuck up my whole night for 20 minutes coughing but yeah I don't think it's not necessary and the only thing is the question I think they were asking is what would you replace it with you're not replacing it you're not recreating trend in another way but what would you have a client take so you're gonna fill that hole well I mean it's not a DHT derivative it's technically a 19 nor but I would just use like you know master on instead or something you know what I mean you know when straw master on test that's if that's a great that's more than enough you don't have to have trend in there you know it's um you mean you guys gotta you gotta realize it not everything works for everybody the same and your health is different than other people's health you know some people just can't do certain things you know I know okay all right what's next a question for everybody what is your favorite meal that your wife or significant other makes like when she makes it you get super excited it doesn't have to be your typical meat chicken rice meal easy question hopefully that can be answered quickly unless you have a story behind it hello well dusty your girlfriend is a Latina she has to be able to throw something down what is it well here's a shocker that I love playing with number one she gets that all the time people guess where she's from she's actually a town man oh okay but but we leave it alone because everyone assumes we're like you're Latina that's fine and on that note she blinds at me with the greatest chicken parm sandwich in the history of the world once because I was like I want chicken parm but I was thinking like the pasta and then she was like I'm gonna make it because I wanted to order from someone I was like okay she was you want that or sandwich I was like fucking you know sandwich makes everything better you can do that sandwich and literally it was one of those things you know like usually if somebody makes just something you turn it up a little it was good but you make it a little extra good verbally you know I had to turn it down a hair because I didn't want to appear like I was alive right I was like what a fuck is this yeah I literally celebrated out loud when the girls didn't want any because I knew that meant that I could eat more later yes so that without I'm getting emotional oh that's funny oh well that's one of the top five dishes that anyone has ever made for me I was like and of course she doesn't want to show she'll never hear these compliments it's perfect yes so that's it yeah I'm I'm thinking to request that this weekend thank you for that question the coolest thing while Emily's made me like I can call her if I'm coming home from the airport and can you cook a meal for me I'm starving whatever and she'll have a meal ready when I get home and she she knows exactly how to cook my food so she'll just as a great job but one time she went to girls and she got all the raw ingredients for my favorite meal so she got like a steak and she got the dough for the pizza and the sauce that they use and she got all the individual ingredients of my favorite restaurant meal and she cooked them at home and it was awesome like she'll have fantastic meat yeah it was great so I had like an Earl's meal but it was home cooked by her so you're gonna say like and not oh good story's not done and she cooked the whole meal in lingerie and heels oh it's with an apron on let's keep her right there she had an apron on for safety we have a lot of anybody burns it's about there you go think splash well I have to say this oh Scott not only which I've experienced this meal without the laundry without her making it just at the restaurant with him before but she not only made it from at home but kept him from going across the street because it's literally across the street from this house it would take him yeah yeah a solid seven minutes to get there had to walk that's love that's what that is but they never make it in lingerie thank god no no come for whatever you're home you see it which is ready there you go man that's great Victoria when we first started dating made this shepherd's pie for me in fact yeah I bought this like one of those big cast iron like Dutch oven things a decade ago right a decade ago when I was like it was on sale and it was beautiful it was really expensive but it was a really good price I was like oh you know what I'm gonna buy that because I can't use that now make meals with it I never used it once it was in the cover above the refrigerator the one that you can't really even get too very easily and it lived there for like a decade yeah yeah yeah so Victoria comes into my life and she's like going through the coverage and she finds it I was like oh yeah that's my you know blah blah fancy oven thing and she's like oh whatever you cooked it I was like well I'd never been years like the label still out of the cardboard still inside of it you know so she made a shepherd's pie in it and it was legit the best shepherd's pie I had ever had in my entire life unfortunately she used a recipe so she can't recreate it but I said that's okay we can continue to try you know we just experimented right every week honey exactly you can try what's in what's in the ideal shepherd's pie I don't even know that's part of the the magic but it's you know it's a ground to me right she was beef and and then it had you know potatoes like mashed potatoes on the top and then it's cooked on yeah there's veggies in there and stuff and then it's cooked on so you can cut it like a slice of pie and what's nice about it is this thing was huge so you could just any time a day the left overs were even better you know and I mean just cut a slice out throw it in the microwave and boom there's carbs there's your protein perfect yeah little insulin should the gym this should be something we talked to her about when she's on the show if she ever joins us yes yeah bring it up yeah definitely we'll get the correct shepherd's pie recipe get it down by that point and then we can give it to our viewers what I have you want until then okay there's no other knowledge to share with us all right what's next okay young king question for the next episode what what y'all think of using anover in a growing phase you just covered that yeah use this whatever you want man I don't know good enough they all work they all work yeah just some degree for whatever you want will move on yeah move on okay okay um question oh fuck yes question for the next show is 263 total testosterone really low for 47 year old man yes yep you should get some TRT yeah transcend company dot com check them out that's where you need to go trust me that's a carrier dead series though like you have no idea how bad you feel right now that's the problem with when when people's hormones change it doesn't happen overnight yeah probably in his early 30s it sort of ticking down right so you don't realize it's happening but had you went to bed at 29 feeling the way you did then and woke up the next day feeling like you do today you probably would have went to the hospital because something is wrong you woke up you just just walked or flascent penis to the bathroom to pee you could do all these things you could not do when you were 29 so here's the thing there's there's guys out there there's guys out there where things happen suddenly like I know guys that are like 31 and all of a sudden they feel like garbage and they go and their test doubles like a hundred yeah and they're like fuck so when it falls off a cliff people notice and they go to the doctor and they ask around they're like something's wrong right but when it goes down for the rest of them for the rest of people their hormones change gradually like dust he was saying and those are the people that don't notice it like that and they wind up being like in their 50s before they think oh is there something I can do to feel better whereas the guys that have it like fall off a cliff on them because of some whatever genetic predisposition or whatever the fucking reason is they're the ones they go to the doctor right away because they notice it so so easily so just keep that in mind then you should get that fix or you'll be stunned because it's funny but it's actually not healthy to leave your levels low so all the same side effects happen to like low test the classroom gets fucked up fucking blood we go to shit like all the same things happen to you yeah so very key I think that's and the brutal part is is a lot of doctors will fight you on it I'm dealing with that right now with a 35 real client this doctor's like nope you're in range you're fine I'm like yeah you're an idiot he literally but your muscle mass is declining you've lost five seconds of muscle mass in this desire to to get out of bed and do anything go to work is down yeah and every single sign this says you need to horn on's fixed he has his doctor's like nope you're in range yes and they're linking now directly linking decline in muscle mass to your when you die like when your muscle mass declines it continues to decline your metabolism changes and everything declines and lean body mass is important obviously not I'm not saying that being clinically obese with pure muscle mass is the ideal but but you know what I mean like you take a normal athletic person and you just slowly take muscle off of them and they will eventually just die and it's linked to when you die so you want to keep you know that that healthy muscle mass that allows your body to you know keep you know keep firing and keep active and all that stuff because you know the less muscle mass you have the more inactive you become and the less you do stuff and quality you know it's just super important so again transcend company dot com dusty 20 check out knock 20 bucks off the bill we'll get your shit legally you know to fight with your doctor nice like yeah or remember bigron 20 no you can if you're gonna do that you can go take a run on on that mutination or i am you dot com you know you just won less percent off than I do all right not true county Richards what are our people she comments literally she's like the first person every episode she's you're supportive thank you Connie I think we talked a little bit about this but because it is Connie I wanted to bring it back up absolutely what love the trio's thoughts on a D load weeks and be rest days when you feel like one versus scheduled just love to train and not competitor always looking for looking to grow and gain strength hard trainer not wussy though and go love okay I I was always better at rest days and I was D loads because that was I just I've talked about this before I didn't I didn't have for like a great deal of the time I was in the gym I was probably too OCD about training intensity and I didn't really have any gears other than all out you know and it was like I started looking back I had like a huge chip on my shoulder like if I was in there I was gonna try to kill myself to so many I had to like like that couldn't dishonor the place by not you know I mean like that's sort of thing so if it was time for something it was time for just days off like a week off for four extra days off in a row or something like that I just wasn't good at D loads I obviously now like with all the stuff we've come to learn the last decade and about you know just periodization of training as really like you know it really become more structured for a lot of people and all that sort of stuff so D loads are a lot more you know common but yeah my generation wasn't really good at them I think the unplanned days off I think are genius because Connie you love to train you already said that if you feel like you don't love to train that day and it's happened for a few days like it's one thing we got power through we all have those power through workouts that's yeah yeah but when you have two or three days in a row when you're someone who loves the train then you're right you take a day off I just last week held two days ago was when we were in Vegas at a client couple complaints I was like take four days off just don't train yeah you'll be fine after that like he doesn't need a D load I already know that you just need to mimic where the four camp run pull it directly out of my ass no idea why that was for just take four days off and we'll go actually I think it probably put him through the end of the week which probably why I went for see that's funny you know to to dusty he pulled the four out of his ass but I see it differently he he did a calculation he already did the calculation on how many days would it take for me to get pissed off and want to train again and then facturing this person's current exhaustion level and their goals run it through a filter of I am super fucked up this is probably less fucked up individual I'm dealing with and the number four came out it's a great number it probably was a great number you know it's one day it's like two days is like okay I had two days off third day really want to train yeah fourth day I don't care who you are if you're serious bodybuilder day force tough yeah you're like fuck you know and you're chomping at the bit so dusty dusty was playing psychological games with that client but he knew exactly I appreciate you pumping me up like that now pretend that I agree you know it's for you you made the calculation and didn't even know it right well I'm so smart I had a I had the same the same thing in reverse with the cedo we had done a brutal year of I mean we worked together the whole year I didn't do I mean it was just awesome year of bodybuilding so I decided after the second show the year I was like I'm gonna take a couple weeks completely off because when I had gotten my when I had gotten my hernia done I was out for a pretty decent amount of time and after that I had the best results in my life best gains so I was like I don't know four just one of those periods off because then when I come back the gains will be awesome because I've learned this so that's what I'm going to do and so I told christening's like great idea that's fine four days in it was getting brutal like I was wanting to go to the gym like six days and I texted my my man this is this is fucked man I texted him again one more time and he goes okay this is doing more problems than the more damage than he's like you're obviously rested and now you're just pissed off he's like go back to the gym and it was funny because that's it was accurate like I literally was creating cortisol by not going to the gym because I had committed you know and that's the problem with having something wrong with your brain is if I say I'm doing something that I have to do it even once it's a bad idea you know even when I'm in the back of the cop car I'm like that was bad I knew that shit in the dunn it but no he did tell me that and I immediately went back to the gym and it's exactly what you're saying around like I was only a few days in and I was irritated that I wasn't going to the gym yeah you know and in reverse I had a period just barely when we when we were an abacation I had been blasting all year more or less I did not have any desire to train the entire time I was out of the country not even once was I like oh maybe I'll go ahead to jump none you know so it's like oh my body apparently needed this you were out of your regular schedule too I bet like if it would have been you know you're at home I bet you would have been like I'm supposed to be the gym yeah today with mimosas oh I believe there was there was six or so mimosas every morning that might have played a role anyways thanks Connie all right back to music here cluster for the next show Ron and whoever wants to answer do you listen to the grateful dead no but I get it I appreciate deadheads for what they are and who they are and I thank them for their contribution and there's drugs modern music I thank them for their their yeah their their contribution to western culture right and it's a medium go sorry what's that let's listen to this Canadian go just no they're an important no I don't now let me explain why they're awesome yeah no but they're like they're one of those bands they got some songs I really like they've had some cool tunes over the years you know they're not a huge like hit band like no you know they're jam band right a lot of their songs are real like psychedelic wacky sort of you know they're not a lot of their stuff made the radio but some of it did you know we all know their songs we just don't realize they're grateful dead songs I guarantee it you know so I get to know I got a friend that I got a friend that goes and watches them every year at like the gorge in Washington oh yeah and it's like they got a hike in and everyone's super tripping on acid and it's just crazy in there and the grateful dead play for like four hours and yeah just you know crazy trips yeah I knew people who followed them and then after that they went to fish the fish that band fish and they followed fish after that like I knew a girl who literally would buy like a couple packs of hot dogs and had a little grill and then she'd sell the hot dogs in the parking lot and that would help her to pay for gas to get to the next show and that's like literally what she did her and her boyfriend yeah yeah that's another band that fish and grateful dead are both in that same little sub genre like ultra hippie cult bands you know yeah yeah all right another music question which band should have been an MTV unplugged so that's a good question because it depends on what you mean like when did when did they end that when was the last MTV unplugged I'll get to have to be during that era no because I want better answers right you know what I mean yeah when was the last MTV unplugged 2000 to wait no that doesn't sound right it the show aired regularly from 1989 to 1999 and less frequently from 2000 to 2009 so it was after a long time oh okay there's only a couple of the couple of that really stand out there was a bunch of them that were good but I'm just it's hard to remember them all you know what I mean like I remember for instance I think Cheryl Crow did one and it was actually really great because I I love Cheryl Crow that's a guilty pleasure artist for me oh yeah I was a huge show crow fan I went siren concert and everything so she's fantastic but um I don't know artists it should have done one and didn't that's tough you know did Metallica do what I'd be interesting I'm doing a little research here just so you know I'm not sure if Metallica ever did an unplugged so I did the top 15 unplugged ever just to get a feel for who was on it's like you said I don't remember many of them they're fine so it's in chains I remember those yeah 1988 Metallica did one okay 15 rod Stewart 14 kiss 13 oasis 12 was Paul McCartney foreign hill in 2011 Neil Young in 93 Alicia Keys in oh five oh whole in 1995 the year after Kurt's a ledge suicide I'm going with alleged now yes that was a conversation that we had in Vegas this weekend really Mariah Carey in 1992 I loved her when I was younger just for the record yeah forward Hello cool Jay a tribe called twest quest in 1991 why why Eric Clapton in 92 Allison chains I do remember that one that's one of the best ones yeah Jay Z in 2001 do I want to hear Jay Z doing I'm well I don't really get hip hop on MTV I'm plugged they're just they're just yeah that's not what it I don't know so it's thing everyone has a lot of things stuff now here we go we're going to Pearl Jam and oh Cliff hangar oh well at least we know he left on Pearl Jam we know where he is if I think he said Pearl Jam was two we know what number one the phone we know and we know and number one is I wanted to pause before the number one so we get dramatic the answer we already knew which was Nevada you know it's actually the you know all the questions are all the scrolling where am I going here the picture that you use for all of them is just Nevada yeah yeah yeah yeah I guess Jay Z got one the rest are all the vomit except for Jay Z he's got a picture that's funny there's a funny story behind that I'm plugged to because I guess there were hersled didn't go well and they hadn't played together for like a little while and they'd never really tried to do a whole acoustic set oh really yeah like they didn't like it was kind of winged it and you know Kurt wanted to bring the two brothers on from the meat puppets to play guitars on a few songs and there's a couple songs where Kurt doesn't play guitar he just sits in sings and they hadn't really jammed with those guys at all like there was no you know what I mean like it wasn't really and I guess rehearsal didn't go that great and they were worried about how it sounded and everything and and then they just went out and that's what happened and then it just turned out to be like you know kind of magical live TV huh I love about that kind of stuff not live but they were quite yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we had one more it is not a question it's just a comment or a suggestion from Jesse he says we need a little side shield we're run just rants about something LOL call it rons rants we've heard this before with a statin popular demand yeah it is popular demand but the problems we have to find something that he hits him in this fucking soul yeah you see only way rong goes off oh yeah one mellow but you never know where it what it's gonna be like it lip syncing you know it's just like I didn't know it's gonna set you off run why no it's a same in reverse too like I got to be honest yeah it does not upset me the ronos he's pizza with a fork knife I don't give it to that no people wanted to have him incarcerated really you know really and the thing is I don't realize how flexible I am I like eating my pizza with a fork a knife but but this week dusty and I had some pizza and I just went right in with my hands folded it up like a savage everybody like a savage but that's cause the reason I like pizza with a knife in fork is if you're sitting on a restaurant never when else is eating like a salad or steak and you're like eating with your hands and it's like guys you know what I mean not like that but everyone was kind of getting in there and it's kind of messy and it's you know it's a team building effort it was all good well see people don't realize though too now that I've derailed the show once again that ron doesn't like messy things to be really awesome so like if I said hey run you want you want to go have some chicken wings with me right now you'd be like no I'll salt and pepper wings but I don't like yeah it's all covered in sauce yeah like those yeah oh salt and pepper's great I had sea salt and vinegar holy shit it was like salt and vinegar chips they were amazing I'm not even a jam sorry now I'm really in loss all right we're back give me more scottler I gotta go with that I'm not that was it I'm tapped out fuck it tapped out those are okay those two guys yes I'm pulling them up as we speak actually I think this is there's there's one some of these are directed directly to me but I thought this is a good one so I'm asking all of us do you and your significant other and or wife yes that is you Scott do you share finances and what are your thoughts on this and I I like this question because I do not I do not let anyone touch my money so what we do is everything gets split which makes plenty of money so we just split everything but the reason I don't like that is because I don't want you to buy me an absurd birthday present with my money I don't want that and vice versa like I surprise you it's like I've always had so funny when someone's like I bought you a new car I'm like know you bought the family of fucking expensive payment every month you didn't do shit you it's 1100 a month because you're a dick now if you want to buy me a car go perfect you know because we do so our finances what the way it's shared is but there are things that go into investments and things like that where it's like I don't forget you owe you $400 for this and this and this but beyond that I don't even show what you do there money and vice versa so I've just never liked that it's good and I don't think me personally there's nothing wrong with it doesn't have to be an even split like if you make $40,000 a year and I make $300,000 a year I'm not like all right mortgage is $8,000 so get me your four like you know it's not gonna work but yeah yeah I just find that a lot of people my experiences that money causes problems for people so I just take it all the equation what about you guys right well yeah we just sort of keep everything so simple like we just never bothered mixing anything you know just go about our business you know we both do well we're both aware of how we're doing and we talk about it and like we're really you know communicative and all that stuff but yeah we just sort of like just you know you know you're she's responsible like she doesn't do dumb shit you know so I don't worry you know we talk about what we're doing all the time like I am thinking to do this you know I'm gonna buy this I'm gonna get this and I'm like oh yeah okay like it just it's never it's ever something that's problem so yeah like totally get it 10 to pick up tabs randomly though you must know this runs on a fray to pick up a three or four or eight hundred dollar tab at dinner just because he has a moment so you know that would be something that some couples might have I'm terrible but I make up for it in another way I'm really terrible at buying gifts for people I feel like I'm a bad shopper so I like you know like pick up the tab once in a while there you go make sense how about you Scott well since we got married and since she's from another country yeah that's another dimension yeah we got a we got a bank account together because that that gives her legitimacy here in the US that we needed yes so that was our main driver for that otherwise you know I mean I have everything I had since before the relationship as does she and we have that pretty much separated at this point but I foresee things joining more as we go you know like as it becomes as it becomes necessary you know right yeah yeah cool yeah oh yes so I'm the only questions I'm not looking for my next question weird um but uh no oh this is a good one because Ron knows the answer the arsenal strength in climb fly how did it hit for you Ron? Ron might have a leg let's see no he doesn't no no fine okay good it's me I'm I'm seeing the leg and Ron oh okay um well the movement felt good but the one problem I had with the arsenal version of that machine was um you could only load 25 palm plates on it because the loading posts were really close together at the back so you could only load 25 palm plates and you had to like I mean I didn't fill it but I came close to filling it and it doesn't could did I fill it? you did I? oh okay I guess I filled it and so that might be a problem for guys I want to go heavier than that because I wasn't trying to go heavy and no I was just trying to do like a good heavy set for camera but nothing crazy um but uh but yeah since I used another brand the fitland one that we have at West Coast the loading posts are farther apart so you can put 35's or even 45's on and so you could stack a lot more weight on it you know not like I put a ton of weight on that machine but I see other guys put a fair amount on there and they're cranking out good reps you know so you might not be heavy enough you just got to try it out I haven't seen the fitland one but also by moving the weight out even if you did the same amount of weight by moving it out the way the motion works you're actually going against gravity sooner so the same five quarters would be heavier on your muscle on that so yeah because that was my issue with the arsenal too was we were three exercises deep when we got to it and we were I was wrapping out like it wasn't a pause and I'm not I'm not strong in those movements so that's how I know it's a problem and I started noticing that the average gym go were in there you know I mean a good shape but not like a bodybuilder had three quarters aside it only held five yeah yeah so yeah okay that's that okay this one seems easy to me but I'll ask it because everyone wants to know this primarily with Scott for some reason okay I made that part up oh would you rather have an itchy nose or an itchy but hole for the rest of your life who that be weird either way especially on camera you know what I'm saying yeah we're taking your co-cad yeah yeah or you can't deal with it yeah be a lot that's a tough one you're doing this all time yeah because you couldn't really touch it constantly but I would I never really hard time or you just feel like itchy ass crack like I'm just filling around yeah I'm wondering if you could like put some you could put some like numbing cream on your butt hole every day for your nose it's called cocaine yeah it's like a sick numbing grace or I'm cocaine on your asshole yeah just put some cocaine on your asshole I've heard that work so many ways yeah hello cocaine paste for nothing all right so what we've got this is we have drug problems yeah or we would we would if I have we actually was a lot cocaine yeah that's awesome okay here we go this is good for you guys because I don't give a shit if my last meal of the day is an hour before bed how does that affect the timing of my G8 shots and now run those by don't give me my head just hurts yeah I don't know I tried it all with timing G8 and I never really noticed a difference I just noticed if I was on G8 or not that's to be honest I'm with you guys and I think that honestly anybody who's watching this should take this as a lesson because you'll find videos on YouTube probably that are like today we're going to discuss the optimal timing for your G8 dose stay tuned yeah but listen we're talking to two guys that legitimately we're pro body builders in an era that it's difficult to turn pro and the guys that have developed literally 300 pound physique and this is their answer that's that's my contribution to this conversation yeah no that's true yeah one thing though is like you know the timing and the management of all that stuff you know it's just it's not worth your stress you know what matters more is your G8 good that's what matters make sure G8 is good you know but yeah there's a lot of stuff like that you know you like you throw the day your insulin levels are going up and down because you're managing you know protein turning it you know mean those turning into glucose and you know food coming in and out of your system and you're your blood sugar and insulin levels are doing this all day long within that normal range you know and you just to try to time thing is perfectly all the time as far as that like when the G8 hits the blood stream and I don't know it's very difficult and there probably is an optimal time but does that mean that it's like let's say there's the optimal time to take your G8 and then there's like you know does that mean that it's 10% better than other times or is it 0.001 percent better than other times right it might technically be better but is the better even scalable to what happens in your physique well that's the the big question so John Jewett is a wealth of knowledge and you know what he has to see he goes deep on these things and so one day he put up that growth hormone the best time to take it was all of it before bed okay so I literally when people would ask I'd say well John said that you take it but I did that a lot like it so that was my but I always credited him I was like John said there was a study I didn't read it I'm gonna fuck this is when you take it and so one day he messaged me and he said well technically that's only if you're up to six I use or less and then it alters and and I I appreciated him shooting that over but be I responded once second my daughter's gonna go crazy you and we open that's the come out um so I said but be I still not change in my answer because I don't care people who are asking that they're focused on that obsessing with it and like you said Ron I guarantee you if I had used my growth at the optimal time whatever that is split it the way I was supposed to my physique would not have been visually better by the end of my career so my answer and that Jose gave because I asked him at one point just because I thought I knew the answer I was like when do you suggest clients use their growth hormone he said when they won't forget yeah right I think yeah those those those things are important you know one of the things I think people get confused about is the they're afraid that if they take it one their insulin is high that it's not gonna work you know because the thing is is it with like the the growth hormones are creating peptides you do want to be in an allot insulin state when you use that stuff but if you're using exogenous growth hormone that is a drug that is his own thing it doesn't have to convert into anything when you put that into your body it is in your body period I would say the only thing to consider would be if you were specifically trying to get it use it for fat loss that you are gonna get a better effect on an empty stomach like say if you're taking it a and fasted before cardio maybe you're gonna get that fat burning effect that fat burning effect would be blunted with insulin but in the big picture is it really gonna make a difference I don't think so yeah it's hard to say you know I don't think it will I really don't think it would you know another supplement question what makes pro hormones bad compared to regular steroids you're talking about the fact that they're looked at that way like people like me go ahead well I mean from what I've seen they're actually like worse on your liver mostly I mean they're all oral so as far as I've seen some of the blood work on sarms is actually like not worth it's like the risk reward benefit you know like how effective are they versus what's what's your blood work look like what you're using them and you know as far as I know they're not they're they're not the best in in those situations I've just never seen anybody do anything on sarms that was really you know like anywhere near what we're seeing with testosterone you know the proof is in the pudding I don't know an extension to that that I'll add is so anyone I've ever known who has never used pro hormones or anything like that when they do their first cycle of low dose whatever it's a 10 to 20 pound holy shit what just happened I've had clients that are like I've never done any drugs I've never done this in that and then they'll go on a cycle and it's as if they've been on gear for years they get almost nothing and I'm like just shit real it's absolutely real I don't know it's happening like have you done pro hormones pro steroids yes I have then you've already used drugs it doesn't have that same effect and I know you know the scientists in the world are pissed off at this statement because it's not 100% accurate but I've seen it I've never seen someone who's done a bunch of pro hormones or pro steroids turn around use regular gear and get that hit interest there he had it you know so I just think what you're doing is you're taking a lesser product with equal or more side effects why right right yeah that's kind of the gist of it generally seems to be so so okay I got time for one more and then I got a pick up I got to go pick up Jamie the giant and take them to the gym oh nice he's here in town right now hell yeah yeah by the way I got to say hell yeah on the show frequently and we have people that comment about how I say hell yeah some of some people like it some people probably don't but okay I'm okay with it thank you I'm hell yeah to it yeah yeah now I've realized that you just said it again that you do say that I say when I'm like really you know a supportive of something like Jamie the giants in town hell yeah you know it's exciting stuff it is this is a quick one and easy one um is it hard for you to transition into different workout phases bulk recomp etc or was it when you were doing this no I just dropped the hammer all the time I was like real I was a type of guy that was really excited for the change like Monday morning I started my diet and it's like fucking bone and very like aggressive and you know right into it you know yeah we said it was was you always said too that like you were happy to not have to eat as much right yeah yeah I was relieved except the first couple weeks of dieting were always rough because I you know I'd cut back on my shakes and stuff I tried to get more solid food and get the veggies going and get like you know because I came from that school that I was believed like you know when you veggies with all your meals it like you know really gets things going and you know get your intake up there and yeah you know to mean so what do you just got you know it depended on the year I guess but I mean I'm with Ron and that I'm excited for that change you know I'm excited for that that transition so I'm I'm all I'm all about it if if I had to start if I wasn't focused like really strong on the diet and then I had to really clean it up it might take me a little while like there was a year that I remember I wasn't eating quite enough and then I wanted to start dieting and I was like oh you know I'm gonna need to add another meal in and I really didn't want to add that meal in at first and it was like you know two weeks I kind of went into it but yeah for the most part I'd say I'm with Ron and that one yeah how about you Doug? it's just a matter of for me it was just this was the process yeah so it was never and actually I had a conversation with Ron about some separate of the weekend but he drove home a point that was great which was once you have decided on a goal the work required to reach that goal you have no choice there's no you know there's no there's nothing you can do with it you just go so if I wanted to be a really good bodybuilder then if it was time to die it it was time to die it fuck off and if it was time to grow then you just eat and you do what you have to do it's not optional I've never I'm not something who ever was like oh I'm looking forward to going to New Cardio this morning I never liked it you just do it I hate eating food in large amounts I've hated it my entire career sound optional you want to get bigger now shut up eat the food so yeah you know Ron put that into effect with everything and it literally made me realize it and Ron get the wording right for me because it hit good but it's like there's one of those things where I really thought it was like that's so true once you choose any goal go yeah I was just dusty asked me a question about that and I think I started talking about how I my dad was a farmer yep and so like you know they're watching the weather right they're watching the forecast they're trying to find the perfect time to seed you know they're going to seed the crops at the right time you have to make sure it's done freezing you know you want it to be like winter time to be over with you've put the crop in the ground and you have to get it in the ground as fast as possible because you know everything's a race to the end of the season to get it off again you know and and then when it's time to take the crop off you know you have 2,000 acres to harvest and the forecast says that it's going to start snowing in four weeks so you know you got to get that crop off in four weeks like you don't if it requires you to work 20 hours a day you don't have a choice like there is no choice the work is already dictated to you like you have to get it off before it snows you know you there's no if you have to hire other farmers that are done there crops to come in with their machines and pay them a thousand dollars a day to help out then that's what you do you don't like even do the math you just automatically just do it just no matter what and you barely sleep and you do 20 hours shifts and you know what I mean you just get it off and you don't have a choice and that's how I was felt about prep like there you know like like I'm in prep now like I'm my whole life has like changed like it's fine I can handle it now manage it but it's it's all running through this filter now you know yeah I just I just like that because when you it was a conversation I had nothing with bodybuilding but it literally applies to everything you can possibly think of once you choose the goal the work is already dictated you what has to be done has to be done and so when you take that mentality you don't have to think about it you there's no thought of do I want to do cardio this morning do I want to eat this extra 1500 calories right now because it's off season but matter if you want to you are to decide what the goal was and you said you want to put on 10 pounds of tissue before next year's show you've got nine months before prep it's no it's go you know so yeah simple so I think if you look at things like that that question about transitions being rough disappears because it's not a choice you can't waste it's why I've always hated some of the ways that people fall off a show as they waste four months of off season coming off the perfect way into the off season yeah I love the old school I mean Chad Nichols I know used to tell guys you need to get your weight up as soon as possible go yeah that's what he told me get your weight up as soon as possible you know get big so okay well thanks everybody remember me even supports the show you can go on
