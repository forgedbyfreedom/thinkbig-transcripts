I'm going right. Simple. Yep. I'm going right. I'm going right. I'm going right. I'm going right. The whole thing is little feeding. That's great. You can actually just sit with that. I'll put another. We're up the trailer. Hmm. This is the way. You're hairless, you can put two. I think you're going right. I think you're going right. But I think you can be a cookie bar. To be. I think you want to be an air. I'm going to be on the other machine right next to it doing the thing. I mean you got your, you got your, your square. Square, square, square, square. You'll be a brownie cake. Something that you'll, for say right. It's like confetti cake and I really want to eat it. That was too easy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like old-school. Realizes that nobody needs to use it. I don't, don't miss every other store. What is up YouTube? This is an exciting day. We are kind of scouting a new venture that we're working on. We partnered with Mr. Barron. Mr. Harvesty, a part of our bond streets. Check them out on the 3M app on street. This is the bakery of some new project we're working on. They're literal treats. We're first thing we're coming up with Rice Krispies Quests. We're going to bond all the EATs. I have them some time pre-worked. We're going to have them every week. We're going to make a really good protein packed one. And then we're going to come up with a bunch of treats after that. So we're kind of scanning our bakeries where they're making some of the samples right now. And just checking out the facility, making sure it's all good. Up to date, not the ship we want to see. So it's fun. It's exciting. And the ship. So far it tastes absolutely amazing. We love this. We want to make sure the facility is actually someone we want to do better. So here we bond, dumb, Matt. And some other guys helping us kind of scale the place. We're just going through the bakery right there. If you just saw it and then we're headed to another warehouse. And for my amy. So we're chillin' for getting some lunch after a train later. And just enjoying the beautiful sunny day. Because it's minus 40 degrees right now. And you can't have that. And I am happy to be in Florida. So check out the place. So all this here is where your barger or my maid. Okay? So here's where we make the barger. So here's where we make the barger. So the maid's to transfer the pot down here. And have two people here pouring on the top. And then to have two people checking this stuff here. And then just three people. So I have three. So it's a total 7.7 people working on it. Here's a very small. Here's our room. Okay. Okay. So now we're just making the train. We're doing the barger if you can't make a big one. Otherwise it gets nothing cut. But I think you can make a meat bun. Okay. You guys should be something you're cooking. But we sell the package. It's probably pretty far. Yeah, it's about small. It's a bit small. Delicious. I need our per flavor in there to make the bag of flavors. You can add it in all the sauce. I think it's per taste. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Very good. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna finish it with my mom. I'm gonna finish it with my mom. I'm gonna finish it with my mom. I'm gonna finish it with my mom. I'm gonna finish it with my mom. I love this part. I might drop it. I don't know. No, that's how it's talking. It's a huge kind of thing. I think that's a good thing. Obviously when you let it sit in a bit, it gets a little bit of firm. Yeah. I don't know. I think that might be a good thing. It's something we'll check in touch. There's a little rest. Thank you very much. All right, brother. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's a bit of a bar. It's a bit of a bar. It's a bit of a bar. That's really good. It's really good. It's in the guideline for the bar. It's a bit of a package. It's only six inches wide. You're saying five inches wide. It's a verdict on taste, I think. 10, 10. That one's 12. Yeah. I'm going to be the cream of 13. I think I can tell you the pretty pebble taste of that. It's just like, I can admit it tastes better. I just love cooking. That's very nice. Why do they ever go? Hey. I don't want to be real. I'm filling up. Save an environment. Okay. I see one for the planet. You over the planet. One liter of smart water at a time. That's a bit of a bar. It's like smart, smart, smart. You're smart. What? What? What? What? What's the number? Yeah, it's in there. What's the number? How? How is the coming of a cinematographer? That's the right word. Yeah. That's actually got some really cool shit for a r-plan that they're doing. So we got a fancy camera. So stay tuned for that on the r-plan. But it's armed day. My first official armed day since the Biceps Air. I'm going to really light on myself. I'm not lying on everything honestly because I do shoulder day or chest day. I get so sore now. My chest is even. Just because I'm so untrained. That it's like the first time you ever go to the gym you train legs. I'm sore. You're like, yeah, that's my whole body right now. I'm just falling apart. So I'm using back in there. And I'm trying to do movements that I haven't done a while because I'm doing it like so I'm doing close grip bench. Work on my stability. I'm going to do a two-place for like eight reps or so. So I'm going to do a shitty little arm day. Hopefully. Give my arms back to being where they were. And then these are bigger. I think they're stuck in the getting. So. I'm doing. I'm almost. I'm full. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm not gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Why are you talking to you? The shirt is so big. I don't know why I put it on. The band looked like I wouldn't wear any pants. When they told me to tell me to tell my skin. It looked like a fucking jacket. I didn't do it on purpose. I looked in the mirror and I was like, fuck, they look like a stupid side. I just took him to my shirt and looked really stupid. But yeah, that's it. Like Calvin Mr. First, the exercises of my warm-out-plush workout. Because he played on a crazy horrible video for focusing on getting good men. But I didn't do it for this. But my chiceps are fucking so sore right now. Trying to do this, I'm just literally just had the worst arm day in my life. And all I do is I'm trying to show you two days ago. So, I do one more set here. And overhead, doing two-by-step thing. You get the fuck out of here because I'm not going to do my arm tomorrow. If I push it too hard, I like air pod pros better. These things aren't a flab and they're like this little thing. It goes in your upper ear to so they stay in, which is cool. But it makes me feel your itchy. And I like it. You can air pod pros with the wind. ** curves two fingers umphpture** ** tied hip-hop sounds** ** wounded voice ** ** sharp footsteps** такие meaningless ideas, yeah! ** strong pressure** Have you been making some fun together? I don't know. In the room. 500,000.. Because 38,000 When I got here a lot of available things to help out. That was good! I bought some V-Biceps Matter food... Did I just decide to use it any more? And I burned it every five days! I know that Salt-1,000 I'm really not exhilarating workouts for the timing, but I'm just gonna go to like 78% earlier on my biceps and just gonna go. I'm not really happy, however you heard, make sure I'm not re-heating it, make sure I think progressively do more and more weight, I'm doing zero pain. If I feel any pain I'm gonna have to back off and feel a little bit more imaging or something, but right now there's no pain so just to go. I really have to use this period of training for it so I'm gonna have perfect mind muscle connection and then when I get strong keep that and I'll be good to go. So that always fucking, I'm going to lay it, I just wrap it out too quick, slow down just squeezing. About the biceps didn't hurt, but you're so tight for me like this, but not like movies through a range of motion, but I feel like on the other side of my throat here, it's just tight and not hurt. Don't wash your tongue. Now this is dry for you it was very cold, but Iemployed it with the soft bars ... I did, well I could have fished the red. Not to put any pressure on you though. We're almost looking at the eggs. When I start working here again, only to help too. We can do some like this. We gotta do a few like days up at the barn. But I'm gonna start calling it the barn. That gym I go do at the middle nowhere. I'm just really happy. Remember you sell myself as a machine with the heavy in it. It's full stacking up at it. Got to move things. I'm just really happy. Remember you sell myself as a machine with the heavy in it. It's full stacking up at it. Got to move things. I'm gonna put you in a milk egg tonight so we'll have a chance. I'm just supposed to drop out of it. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna do it. It's that latin to maybe really play. Yeah, I think it needs an elbow to feel like it's playing. I was like sweating after I was just... Yeah, that was really rough. If you've been need as way better as a mind-caf thing, just put it. But never know. For everyone who's better here to build restaurants. It's so scary to drop the weight. I'm currently in lowercase slowly. It's not trying to hurt myself. And our mockery feels really good. It felt tight on the curls over there. But I feel nothing on this. It didn't hurt after so soon. It could have caused it. It's positive. It's not really good. It's not trying to hurt myself. The norm actually feels really good. It felt tight on the curls over there. But I feel nothing on this. It didn't hurt after so soon. It was positive thinking. Honestly, it's not a proper prep until you enter something. It's a normal now. But you drink the last time. No drink to the gas. Well, I'm seeing it earlier now. So a degener said so by the time. I don't know. But I said, I said, I said, I'll ask how my said nothing bad was going to go happen. I mean something bad happened. But I'm saying, oh wow, nothing bad did happen. This has been like a perfect prep. But I'm saying something bad will happen. Oh, okay. Something bad stuff. You know what? I'm not putting that on the universe. I'm kidding. Whatever happens will happen. It will make do with what comes because it's what we always do. So I'm going to say it. What? What the hell?куюама and Dallas. Fuckin',zinho. How is just gonna murder make them so weak? Oh, what? You're gonna be... Oh, you want to eat back in the trained RokuВE gonna tell you. Well, I mean, whoever's planning a list of barbecue players, yeah, you got there gonna go with that me. Though I'm eating a fucking 7 barbecue players. I'm going to 4. Live over one. What kind of angelos are you gonna to hype over you to have got that shit? áHaja, wherever gonna Dallas, I'm doing it better. I'm doing it. We at Hanukkah are doing a Ben Dallas. Probably going to be announced right now, so maybe we'll be able to buy off maybe not. Maybe we'll be on Instagram. But we're going to do a Ben Dallas going down the chair with them for a while. We'll be like if someone are Q and A mean greet, I think we're going to do as where has. So, stay tuned for that information. But we're really going for barbecue. So, that's what I'm going to be doing. We're going to be our apple and this work out. A short blog. What? Short blog. I did two, I did a fucking Cambridge Curls earlier and tried to throw a big syndrome before I came here. But like my arms are sore as fuck and I have a pump right now. So, come on. Next work out. I'll tell you if I can even move my arms back for this. Where is the window? I'll see the tear. That's it. That's it. That's it. That was what it was actually down here. So, is it a little right there? No tear. I don't even have a spot right now. So, I'm going to be back to it. So, yeah, I'll see if we wrap on the blog I guess. Lots of push-in coming. I just got into the bakery today. Bon, the treats are going to be launching in the next two months. I believe. Once everything is quite away, they're working out. It's a run-in packaging and getting ready to go. So, we're really looking forward to that. You got to go and love them. They're going to love them. They're fucking crack them. Happy to come here on my office, isn't it? They're going to say to eat them. Also very exciting. We finally are updating my app right now by training app. I'm going to talk about it a while because it's been under a lot of construction. But it's fucking pretty much done right now. But really, like, interactive, weight tracking now. I guess you could thought I don't know what we're looking for. But it's really easy to use the weight tracking so you can track your sets, reps, and the amount of weight that you do this read it. And nutrition is almost done too. So, you still sign up for it. It's deep on fitness.com. But when it comes out, I'm going to be running through all the new features on the app. I'm excited about that. And it's time to get huge. My bicep didn't tear through this arm there. So, first arm day back, right around. We'll be in Texas. So, if you were training with H-Dub, bone after five feet. So, sit tuned. Thank you for watching. Peace out. Peace out.
