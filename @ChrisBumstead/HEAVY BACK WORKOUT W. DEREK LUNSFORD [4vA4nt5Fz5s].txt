Okay. Why are you forcefully hitting him your supplements? You have forcing him. Please, you get pumped out. Big boy. Two slats or two big, uh, fucking, he comes out of this. GEEE! GEEE! Where you got one more setting you? You go. What? You go. Hiding over here, I'm done. What? What? What do you say? What happened? What? What? I thought you might have worked with me. What's this?

What's the? What's the? It's not raw. Why are you forcefully hitting him your supplements? You have forcing him. He needs to get pumped out. I believe it's for you. That was a good way, Apple. How's that? Yeah. Very potent. There's a lot of stuff you drive through. Fuck, I don't know. Do you guys think I'm going to free the horrible idea, but I've also drink truly with the water today, so I'll be okay. Oh, you're going to be alright. What is up YouTube? Day three, training with the trolls. You trolls today. What's up YouTube? Honey Rambad. What's the king of dad jokes? Yeah, there was even a bad joke. Yeah, there was even a bad uncle present. Especially when you asked, I wrote a little bit of a window because he couldn't tell there was marijuana leaves or fucking flowers on our steering wheel. That was a bad move. And she said she had weed in the car, but it wasn't on the steering wheel. There was this young girl driving her car and she had flowers on her steering wheel. It looked like weed because you know there's a little water leaf. But it looked like weed. Exactly, but it looked like weed. And he's literally like, I'm going to ask her. And he's like, well, then you're going to run like, scaring this poor girl. No, she wasn't. She was like, oh, honey, I follow you on Instagram. You know, she actually got pretty excited afterwards. She's like, they're flowers, but I have weed in my couple of days. And so I was partially right. She's like, thank you guys great to meet you. Have a good day. She asked for some weed though. No, it's the no weed zone. No, no. Sorry to interrupt. It's back. The little guy named Derek Lonesford. Are you ready? He's in here too. Would you care? No. No. I was trying to wait till peak off season. The train was in. I've tried to wait till peak off season. Well, that's why it's not going to get any more off season than that.

It's far as to feel it in the rest. Training is good. Training is always good, but now I got to get home. Get the food in. I'm going to get back to the back room. So once we start doing that, I think we'll really start packing on. So good. We'll show up next to lunch. And then we'll prep. Yeah. Yeah.

Why don't take it off? She has to not say it. All right, so that's a wrap on today's workout. Moving to the open. Just kidding. That's a good workout. Grateful to be training out with some of the short kings of the industry. You didn't hear me. But short kings of the industry that we just had. Yeah. I'm literally the best of luck and in there. Huh? Short people. Say some of our short people. Better watch. Short kings. Well, I lose a bunch of weight and come to the classic. I don't think you're going to ever make it. Yeah. Like you said, when we retire, we'll just switch the dishes. That's like a plant. Yeah. So we're hungry because we've been setting up too long. So we're going to go search for some food. We'll see you later. What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? You've got to come to my easy dog. How to do it? Everything. There we go. You're going to pause the ride. I'll go second. Second. Second. Where are you? I'm shooting the second. Oh, shit. That's the last for a ride. Oh, it's the last. Yeah. It's the last minute. I'm saying it's pretty much you should do like three weeks. What was about what we're going to do here? That's a lot of a big help. Yeah. But now we're doing the old plan. Like we're going to take it up. How are you doing? You're doing well. You're doing good? Good. Thank you. Do you want again? Yeah. Ridiculously busy. Try and have to think about it. Yeah. Yeah. Here we're going to do a Dubai. We'll go some ice. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. I said. Wait, there'll be a, you know. I don't think. Yeah. I don't think. Ready? Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. It's funny. I don't get to introduce people that often, that create the response that this guy creates. When I walk back there, we're afraid to see a long line. I always say, when you see a long line, what you know what that means. You know what means that somebody in particular is at the head of these days, because it's turned out where he has become such a great ambassador for the sport, for the industry. And I know a lot of you guys are here to see him, to meet him, to get to take a photograph with him. If you're so fortunate, to take a selfie with him, because I'm into you post on your social media, you then will become a big deal. So it is my great privilege to welcome the rain champion of the classic physical Olympian division. One of the all-time greats, one of the greatest who ever do it, please welcome Steve! All right. What is up Pittsburgh? You know what's funny, you can get us know me. I still get angry because I don't want what's video, I don't even know what I'm doing. But when you're presenting to me with the opportunity to have them come up and talking from my crowd, or take my clothes off and post on your back seat right now, while here I am. I'm standing here with my toe. Also, it's pretty hilarious. My mom called me and every time she got these shows, she sees these guys. She's like Christopher. Are you getting it? I guess you guys? I'm like, wow. If you see big grabbing stamps in back there, you got to like 330 pounds. Probably 70 pounds have your knee in short of the knee. Shonslory does probably two feet shorter than me, so it's way more than me. So, there's no chance I'm getting that big enough. Don't worry about that. Well, that being said, that's what you got there in sports night. You got there in front of the street, you're very rare, that you got to get on stage, let alone together. Maybe not being the best shape of your life, but I can guarantee you, but probably the biggest, and then equally as in person to see, and something that probably even more rare to see. So, if you guys are fans of what I really, together in pre-hello the street, if you're watching the image, show the pro show, give us aspirations. Step on to see it one day, this show to be at right now, this is full of just formation and inspiration. So, I hope you got there, I'm enjoying it, enjoying the show. I want to give a quick thing to the man used, man used, man used, showing, or putting on the show, I agree here. It's beautiful show that you get back to see if it's very, very good. And then bring us absolute great talent, but I'm going to show for you guys. So, they can have a blast with the man he's in, and it's beautiful show that's what I'm going to do. And also, tell the better it's tonight, we're putting on a show for you guys. So, show a long got a tooth, give a while, they rarely have a complotist. And I'm not going to talk to you guys until it's almost tonight, but look at sports, you've got all the boys, you know, be up to be held a show, go for number five. I would appreciate all you got the new support. I love being at this show, there's some stories of everybody back there, and memories of show and felt them, because they made people come to the show, they made the people, what you do is run the city into the culture, history of the city, it's super cool to be a part of now, I've been here for a lot of years, but being here now, I'm hearing no stories and I hope looking part of some of those memories from the I'm truly grateful. So, for yourself, I hopefully, you guys can sit back and join the show, and just get the huge round of applause because you're a bunch, but I'm not going to show. Thank you. Oh, I'm here at C.Con. Damn. And we're going to come to the camera to get my office stage to see you, sir, family. Being here, came up with a business together with a club called PDW, who's probably going to bring me many, many years ago. So, we can't argue here, we're going to just like you, Chris. And of course, we can't let you out daisy, my friend. Because a few boys, please, the nurse, said you're going for number five. If you have some good memories, we'll all make us a little bit of a baron, but see if I'm just a gentleman, man, right? I can ask the goal in question, Chris. No, you're not ever an actress in question. The classic physique division was good and not that modern, you know, brand new. What was you have done in your career, or what you had for your, there was no classic physique division? I don't have a little tired. I'm going to lie in 2016, I shouldn't have thrown out the no-good bodybuilder and had you wait, I had you wait, I'm super ready to wait. At 6 o'clock, we're on the wrong, we're on the wrong side of the stage. I know a lot of the judges were there just a week, so thank you for that, bro. I kind of appreciate it. But I honestly, with ready to look at that, I didn't have a, I didn't think I had a future in open mind, but it wasn't something for me, so it's probably a recent little year every day. When I'm setting my stage up, I'm so grateful for the classic physique division. I think it's open up to such a bigger variety, so people to watch the sport, kind of coming to it, to a more modern age thing. And now we have all the divisions kind of checked out, we've got the day mass mass suits, the short mass mass suits, and the times the guy had this, you've got everything something for everybody, so I'm very grateful for something for me, this guy who's impacted the joy and beauty in my life, and everything I need to enjoy today, so it's just a great full day. Man, this is something I think that helped a different domestic world of men. If this division doesn't exist, it's a big bond, doesn't exist, at least in the Turkey, you know, now he's a massive huge father. You know, it's fun watching the divisions come alive, when you think about it, there was no 2012 divisions, we might not know the name like Suits, so I think there was no class physique division, we might not know the response that the new guys are in fact, a couple of bigger stars in the world. The one question that I know you must get at a lot is talking about whether or not you want to make the transition into the open division. I know that's something you have to hear a lot. So if the benefit of the thousands here in the millions watching around the world, what are some of the things that go through your mind when that question is presented as you evaluate that possibility. I don't know if it's so much what goes through my mind, but so much of who goes through my mind. I see people in my brother, I see people like that, you know, see people like that, they walk here, they write me in my mind. I don't know what goes through my mind. And obviously the first step possible in my head is like just so grateful to be where I'm at. You know, like I said, plastic could be just given me a beautiful life. And so many moments that I will never forget ever come out of the seed in life and to remind me of the one in the stage. And like it's giving me so many moments, so many experiences, so many people in my life that I can never think of living there. So I'm sure joy where I'm at in present, enjoying the journey and the kind of fun. Okay, good up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Before I go, I'd like to say that people ask me all the time, what is it about Christmas and what's the fascination? Why are we also wrapped up in your life and your story? And the way people respond to you is it's without rival. And I always say, I sum it up in the one simple word, and this is something that you're out there, you are aspiring fitness, celebrity, a bodybuilder, or somebody who is trying to connect with fans, I will sum up Christmas secret in one word, and it is often ticketing. There is perhaps no one who puts themselves out there exactly as they are, the way that you do Christmas and for that, we switch you. Thank you. If you want to be a star, I would love to be a project. First, when I make my call, I'll be a wish. No, I'll be a wish. All right, so it's gonna be wrapped on Pittsburgh. Got the train with Seth, got the train with Derek, the good work out, got to meet a lot of people, very grateful for it. Not great flight to go up on the stage and talk. I am, but I go up and down to my ability to speak last one I did my Emmy, did a great job this time I trashed it. I started racing, I got nervous, I was like fuck, I don't know what I'm saying, and I just lost it. This is what it is, you know, maybe one day I'll be good at public speaking, but you think that the amount of time I've been on stage would get better, but I'm nervous to tell every single time, so this is what it is, welcome to the life of Seabum, I guess it'll never change, but I just gotta keep doing it until I get better, because that's the only way to do it. But that being said, I appreciate you guys watching. Back to Florida for a few days and then we're going off to Italy on a nice little trip, so hopefully me and Calvin can get like two videos or so this week, so I was no gap of content like crazy when I'm traveling, but they probably will be, just forgive us for that. Thank you for watching, appreciate you guys and I'll see you guys next time.
