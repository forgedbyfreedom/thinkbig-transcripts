It's hard. It's hard. Are you not used this level, Worma? No, I'm not used to it. I'm just a fire. Are you going to get me to get you a fire? I'm going to get you a fire. I put you on your plate. I'm going to get you on plate. So you'll start grabbing some plates. I don't know. Christmas viewers don't know what a sunshine set is. Sension set. Okay. So this is kind of a bitch test we call it. So this is what's going to wake you up and see who's willing to work. So we are going to start here with Chris and I will do five plates. So we're going to do around a 12. So 12 reps. He racks it. So when he racks it, pat in and I are going to put a plate on it's side. So then he's going to do five reps. We're going to do five reps. We're going to do five reps again. Another plate. Eat side. Five more reps. Another plate. Until he can't go any more. So I think it's the opposite of a drop set. So everybody does drop sets. We want to make it harder. So we're going to do a Sension set. So it's increasing plates each round. I think it's going to go as long as you can. So the goal here probably for him and I is probably going from five plates up to 10 each side. So you like I said 12, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5. For her, I don't know. We're going to see what she can do. So I'm excited to see that. You just say homie. 10 plates. Yeah, you're going to change with 10. Chris. We need more patty. I like. Can I do this up two there? Just up two. Get that key. We're going to both. We're going to both. Yeah, I'm first. Okay. Yeah. I'm going to wrap it and then you're both going to put one plate on. Then you go set sets of five. Oh wait, are we going to alternate here? No, no, just me. I'm saying there. So I do 12. I wrap it. You put it on like a five. Wrap it. Put it on a five. As many five as you can. So we're going to go. This is to get to 10. Yeah, I'm going to get to 10. I might make sure you're spot.
