Just retired off my baseball season. Came back at the end of the year. You know, had a little rough finish last year, but that didn't happen because I wasn't actually in the NBA until about... When did you go in like the final quarter of the season? The final few games of the season. And you know what this is the one that counts. It's the four-piece baby. So, chainling my inner MJ. I have to tell you guys, if you missed it, he used to lace his own shoes, every single game. How to do it. This is me. We need him to pick week. Friday. Day before pick week begins. And I'm lacing up the Chicagos. I'm gonna be wearing them. Like I'm sitting my closet till they deteriorate. I'm gonna wear them. And I'm gonna love them because... This is my favorite Jordan shoe. Maybe the Chicago lows are my favorite because I like lows better. But these remind me of Spider-Man. Because Spider-Man, I will wear these too. And all the movies. He just like fucking ran through the city in $2,000 shoes. I'm not a very cool. But yeah, we're lacing these up. I'm gonna wear these at the gym today, I think. So, you know, each...

Maybe Sunday. And then wrap those up. And, Vegas, baby. You guys don't know. 2017, 2018, 2019. Stayed in a similar hotel to this. That will not be named. And then in 2019, me, Matt Calvin, stayed here with Courtney. And it was like the first year at one. Calvin was vlogging with her first prep series. Maddie was here fucking just grinding. Helping dude. Fucking God's work. Calvin's annoyingness shit at me. Corti's doing God's work. He's got a lot of time for me. So it feels good to have the team here. And very grateful to have the boys back in the hotel. That was a show that we named. And the gym and do what we do. So good vibes here. Calvin literally found the same picture in the same room that they were in. So it feels good to be back in Vegas. And I gotta tell Sam and eat. And we're going to go with Jim and knock it apart. There's a lot of terrible stuff like I rather live. I think it protects like a fine foot for a little bit. Alright guys, just here in Vegas. First working on Vegas last official chest Vegas. You're all going to be the week of the last workout. I'll probably do a little chest mix. We get some points just kind of like burning out a little bit. Like in our body day, chest back arm show. Like making stuff up. Right now this is mainly chest much a little bit of delts at the end. These workouts. There's no PR as we know nothing about the carbs are even lower right now. So over what I mean a little bit later. So I gotta make wait. Time to bring down my weight. So over 240. Well over 240. So we've got to come down a bit by next Wednesday. But you know how to be a job done. Some wake masks up. Getting my chest pump or lack thereof. And push what I got left in me because this is grand time. Less than five workouts left I guess. So we're going to do rocks. So nothing glorious to be workout. It's fun to normally have to feel a weight. By the first three reps I'm like, oh just late I can go up. And how late that felt in the first three reps I could typically add like another. I'm going to five to a plate on top of that. But I know right now how fatigue day in by the time I hit six reps my strength is like I'm going to come in and back up to be smart right now. Really my ego behind and understand that I'm significantly weaker. Ten reps at least. Eight to ten reps. I got it. The first two got to be easy. I'm going to fatigue quick. So I just got to keep a lighter load and focus on the contraction. Let's do it. What I can. That's it. That's it. That's it. What are you trying to test? Yeah, yeah. We'll get it. Sorry.
