What are you doing? Laterking joking. No. No. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. I told you I would laser his neck or whatever you want. You know what's crazy? That thing was probably made for five dollars somewhere on the world. I spent four grand. You're? No, sort of got my patley's or bar for my bet. It's only a certain voltage that that narines can get. So my bet's always told me she had three on. I know. It's a real light bulb. That was. I told her. Chris I've all this over his kidneys and everything. Come on. Come on Chris. Come on. You're one. Two. Four. Come on. Come on. What's that? I want to put this on the air. You're gonna put this on the air. No, that's it. I'm sick. What's up? You're sick. I've been fucking pushing this off season lately and my belly is just not adjusting food. We're great right now. I had to take these binders for the mold that I have. It's supposed to bind everything up. Push it through me. And I think it's just making all my food just sit in my belly. So I've been trying to breathe them brutal. I know my drink like a leader. I've watered with my pre-workout just like hydrate. I just did that right now. My belly is even more full. So I started blocking on a treadmill. I never do that pre-workout but I had to move cash my breath. I came back to life because I'm dead and turning this fucking juicy pump right now. I took a scoop of leuker savage. I see your pure good coming down like a month and I'm fucking jones. So hopefully it gets me a good pump. Good work, it's going off. The fourth of July so happy birthday America. I should make a markup. I'll give it a go. It's one for America. That was heavy. My rope pushed out strength. Getting stronger faster than my overhead stretch strength. So I started. Fuck it. Drop setting instead of super setting. Alright, so I've been putting in low script cash. This is a name for the second one where some weird press. I'm going to do it in between a low script bench press. I'm pressing it and then bring my handle a little bit higher. So it falls here a little bit. You sit up a press where I'm down here. And it just allows a little bit more bend. More like elbow flexions. I can make my triceps engage more. This is one of the few things that I can put a decent load on. It's a hurting my shoulder. Like weighted dives, dips, machines and stuff. So I've really hurt my lathe. So I've been doing these a lot. Did I feel good? I put the bench on one inkline. Not quite 45. Like you would have to put it on flat. So again, the flat hurts me a little bit more. This one's allowing me to press for my triceps a little bit more. So yeah, this is one of my heavy load triceps. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. So I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. Alright, moving on to some biceps right now. I'm going to try and super set this and then this before. They're giving it a shot. I'm going to do pre-trip our curls over there. I'm going to do a little bit lower than I'm doing spider curls. I'm going to do a little bit higher. Higher your elbow comes up through your head right there. The head is a contraction on your bicep. The more I salated it is, the way less weight you have to do. So I'm going to do some basic pounds on that. I'm probably going to keep it light over there if you like. Easy bar for 25, maybe 10 on this side. See how it goes. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. Take some more of these things. Be a little bit ambitious with the tens on here. It's a really good job. I'm not going to lie. It's like experimenting. I'm going to drop the weight. You might go behind. The next set hopefully in my fucking 6 reps and maxing fucking preacher biceps. I'm not out here trying to tear bicep. Don't want that again. Braggies? So fucking 10. Like I'm on the go and now I'm going to go stinger. I need you to do a giant scalving. Yeah. Fuck, I forgot to take my preaching. You're what? I'm pretty sure. Have you seen the show The Witcher? No. Bro. Favorite TVC? Yellowstone's supposed to come up with summer. The Witcher's way better. Fucking Henry Kavill. I'm so mad though. He quit in Superman. Roll in the Witcher role in the same year. I don't know what the fuck wrong with that guy. I suddenly go see the new Nolan movie. Open hammer? Yeah. Everyone's braving. I can start a bit better. Yeah, it's more green to the barbecue though. Are you too good by that comment? No, but I want to wrap her now. Four director? No. I've made my decision. I don't want to come out anymore. Who would have the deal? But then I thought about it. Yeah, I'm the real one. But then I thought about it. I realized that I don't have the necessary requirements to store a K footage. Do you know the SD cards for the rapper are two terabytes each? Two terabytes. The drives I use for your entire year is four terabytes. I know if you're trying to say people watching but no one knows what that means. People will know. So what do you think of the level of lens? That's my dilemma. You're going to have a fun day. I guess you're going to have a good day. So what do you think of the guy who has a lot of energy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright, so last video I said I was gonna answer some questions in the comments. When I got a funny one, I put a funny question, but I led to some funny game of my class. They asked me my opinion of what I think of the question thrown around over what do you think of the clout around the trenchlands? What is it about the trenchlands? So watch the first video I've ever watched of them. I'll help you come and invent them. I got to say it pretty fucking funny. I laughed at it. I'll start by saying, I'm proud of this because I use a PED to treat that blatantly obvious. I don't like promoting it or using it at the forefront. I truly believe that as I've lowered it, I can focus more on the importance of training in YouTube. I've become a lot better by the way. So that's what I try and preach, so I don't really appreciate people preaching drugs in the unit community. So that being said on the positive notes, the dudes are fucking around. And they're told that I just, I know the trenchlands is almost like a joke name, because they're just fucking trolls. But the video I've been reading people love them is they don't have a fuck with people think about them. They act like idiots, they fight each other, fuck around, make stupid jokes. And they just happen a good time. They train hard to fuck and they're living life and they're enjoying it. I think the whole world wants to live a life where they don't go to the fuck with people think about them and they're kind of presenting that. The second thing they represent is like a fucking brother, they're brothers and they love each other. And they remind me of two people that would like fucking fight with death. Against each other or to protect each other. I think everybody really wants that kind of like relationship with a friend or a girl. So respect that. So finding the positive and why I think people love them. So they don't go fuck with people think and the girls. So who doesn't want to control like that? But yeah, I don't see it pretty fucking funny video. I'm gonna knock on my eye. I'm not trying to give them a platter or anything, but it was humorous. I laughed at it. Probably never gonna watch another video in my life, but I'm glad I watched the one because I got a good laugh. That's my humble opinion. It's like a kind of my grudger or... I'm a grudger or exactly. Like you watch his dog? What? Are you watching his dog? Is it out? Yeah. No, I gotta watch the countermeasured guy's dog and Chikilo and Yildog. I love Jack and apparently it's dope. My grudger dog's dope. It's like, talky, arrogant, like a little fucking it, like, but funny. Yeah, but then like over time he like got humbled. I'm humble, but like he really like what he looks like values of like family and loyalty. Which has always been like a forefront, but like he cleans into it lately. Because he's on it more. There's always something about that like arrogant little dude that people just love to go watch. Like Michael Jordan. Most of the people like love to hate him. He was fucking cocky. He was the go and he backed it up and just people just fucking love to watch that. That's me by it. You can far pull her opposite of my personality treat, but something to admire that is something that fuck the people think about him. I mean, they do, and they hide it, but teach their own. It's like that saying, it's like you can hate him, but you can't stop watching him. He's a... I stop watching, but I enjoyed what I did watch. I'm not going to be a guy saying I hate him. I hate him like that, but I don't know the... Dude's funny enough. Is that a really nice? Yep. You're a man who has a beard. What's in? What's in? What's in? What's in? What's in? What's in? Oh yeah, forgot. She was only Cargo. She's broken, so. What's in? Michael, my girl. Nice, thank you, what would I say? Hi, camera. Hi, I'm true. I'm this guy's time to get fucking here. He hasn't gone to camera, like literally too much. I know, I'm like... Look at it, look at your plethora of fucking... Yeah, she has a full-on sanctuary. You've been to do something less. Oh yeah, this is... You're at the grounding mattress. I got that. Yeah, she's here. She's here. Oh, she's staring. What? She's here. Oh. Oh. Oh. Nothing's changed. She's... She's still mowing. She's still the same old... You know? She's the baby, what? Same old, girl. She's the one. She's the one with her dress. Oh, yeah, that's the one. Are you just a touch? Calment. You're supposed to agree with me. Not a group of dress. No. I brought that magazine in because I knew you would like it, right? What is it? Did you buy it? It's cars. Yeah, I knew. I knew. I knew. See that right there? That's what I'm getting. But not like a readable. So he's getting guys. 69, come on, R.L.S.3. That actually is one of the... Actually, technically is one of the childhoods. Can he have one? Well, when he's staying, when his staying got stolen. He never got a camera. They gave him a fucking charger. Can't you? Can't you? Can't you? What? Which one? The first one they give him a fucking charger. S.X.T. No, it was a camera. I just watched the first time. Okay, then with the second one. One of them they get, they're like, at the end. They're like, we got to the given the keys. The black dude, the manager of the hood. Yeah. He's a game based S.X.T. Yeah, I was pissed about that. She'll be stealing my health, get it. I won't see what the camera weighs out of him. I don't remember that. Who's an SS? Obviously. I was like a 60. But did it have the R.S.R.S. It was like, isn't it? It was SS. I like the R.S.R.S.R.S.R.S. So, thanks. Bye! We were going to comment, but I don't even give a fuck. Because she might be. It was why you need like a malem wall or a big aggressive dog. Are you kidding? I'm like a golden dutel. I'm not a scary duck. I'm good. There was a gold dutel puppy next door. We should go knock in the door. That's really creepy. No, she takes the lead with X.T. I'm a... I'm already married with X. What are you... You're fucking joking. No. We're dealing for our partners. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I told you that I would laser his neck. Or when I figured he was. You know what's crazy? That fucking thing was probably made for five dollars somewhere. I said, I spent four grams. You're... No. My patley's are barking. My vet. It's only a certain voltage that that naryans can get. Some of that's always to make sure three of them. And the red light bulb. Shh. Not always at a red light bulb. But that's a fucking red flag. Right. I don't do anything for the people I love. I told... Chris had all this over his kidneys and everything. Oh, he's scarier. He's scarier. I'm so sorry. That scared the sard. I'm so sorry. Oh, we can't leave you tonight for five or two. I'm getting so scared. Welcome back. I'm sure you're hoping for her in the end. Can you hear mama? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Come back. No. Come. It's a smothering bother. I don't even think an NFL athlete gets treated better than what's the. You fucked. Did they see what these people do? The NFL's with those giant versions of that. They're full beds of that. Okay. Maybe not an NFL athlete. We're seeing a red light bulb. You're like sitting in the pod. You're like a tanning bed. It's like a bit different. Okay. Well, she doesn't treat you as well as Watson. This thing, dude. She's an innocent dog that hurt her shoulder. He's hurt his hamstring, his shoulder, his kidneys. Okay. Don't even give you that shit. Anytime Chris doesn't paint, remind them what I did this year at the Olympics for you. She massage the farts at me. Literally. Like if you don't think that's true love, then I don't know what it is. I did it. I didn't know what was painted. I've been in actually no. Well, it's been a bit of not like two years. But I was rough. I had to go circular motion. Just like the most getth and possibly imagine that wouldn't be my stomach. Just fucking night. And I was in the gas chamber room. Like literally like this. We started to do it. You had the figure in my digestion, you. How do you sound like? It's good to hardly told me no hot hot. So I put the ratch on everything. So maybe I'll listen to my coaching. Sorry honey. Alright kids, it's going to be a wrap on today's video. Happy July 4th. Maple a waffle protein to sell and stuff. We only have, I think there's only a few thousand units left. And we're never restocking. We were in a bunch, but we are never restocking it. Unless people are like it. That's my right now. We're not going to be making it. So if you want it, get it. But the thoughts going on, we're going to go barbecue tonight. Fucking fourth of July. Hashtag fucking America. We're going to get the RAMT RX, the Ford RAP there. We're going to do donuts with fucking firewood. Shoot none of the tailgate and drink beer and folks who go out. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're doing zero of that. Yeah, probably we can have a lettuce wrapped hamburger. You're being bed tight and I'm going to be cloth. That's a lot more accurate. It's a lot of new. This is a show. Can you tell the about the show? Oh yeah. So it's a success. Sorry, which year better show? I should have heard you that. We started watching a succession. I know people are going to get lit up, but this gives us a show. Take the number one on the internet. I'm not going to talk about it. So far, it's pretty good. Not going to lie. Each of the lots of coffee does an understand. I mean, this is true. I don't really understand a lot, but it's pretty big technical. I mean, you should watch something and then it'll show up on the phone for like 20 minutes. No, I'm not. I had a bed. I haven't got it right. I ashamed you want something you put away. So you were talking about your training program so I allowed it. Oh yeah. How's my 225 up for good? The company's going to split 225 by next year. Yes. Nadi? No. Brother Dave, she's not that ideal. Tell the world. Wow. Okay. We're going to go into a new one. He's bodybuilding. He's going to go from health, from what then to a fucking juice from what then. No. You guys are so rude. Just what do you test off from out of your pores? I already took one in the way. I was going to test off from the floor. You're back. You have a worse hair line than me. Wow. I think we need to get popped in on testosterone. Actually, so you'll... Yeah. Please just pull that your video because we're done getting a 4 to 5. Alright. So yeah. The wrap on the video we're going to be in Nashville in two days for a carbon culture grand opening. So if you guys need a gym in Nashville, carbon culture is the place to be. And Eons is going to be there. So I'm going to try and get a workout in with Eon and he comes back to Florida after two. So pump to about that. But yeah. That's all it's going on. So thank you guys for watching. And I will see you guys later.
