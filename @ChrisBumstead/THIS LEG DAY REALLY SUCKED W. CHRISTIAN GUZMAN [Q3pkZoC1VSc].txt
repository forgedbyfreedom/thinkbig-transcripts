You're like, I'm a, he's locked up. You know, Calvin stops talking. He's like, it's, like, you're focusing on just like the table here. I mean, I was like, I was just fucking wrestle him once he got so drunk. Really? I think, like, put him in a fucking choke. Yeah. He didn't know he didn't remember. He was like, I've never had a fucking kick. I don't think he was going to remember. He was like, I've never had a kick. Wow. He was like, he's in sync or what? Like he's like a fan? I just said, like, just talking. Try it out. Look at for the knees. Dude, he's fucking constant chaos, eh? Huh? He's like, always in a rush. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Also always have like 30 things in his hands. Yeah. Yeah. Also always have like 30 things in his hands. Just literally, right down. Yeah. You like a little hurt or like a poke bag. I know you just have a probably trying to charge him so much and hit him. Put the pump in the free. Well, you supposed to pick one of the other. You've already pumped in the free. Is there a caffeine in this one? There's one has no caffeine. It says pump and caffeine. Caffeine is better. You can't even, why do you? You can't even get with that. I'm gonna give you a minute. I'm gonna try this one. This is the same as the powder or no? Same formula. Okay. Taste the same or no? No. Well, they're all different. They're different. The powder is just one. No, they're different. We actually made a V2 a load though. We don't sell those anymore. You want to sell this? Yeah, we'll be too. They look like that now. And they taste better. This is like a baby bottle. Yeah. Exactly. Why are we doing this? It looks like milk. Yeah. I mean, I'd tell you that when you show me the fruit. You show me the fruit. Yeah, another god now. I think they have corporations. Good bit. So I have to rate it. Who's where you're saying it? All right. We did it. Oh, you want me to just judge him to them. Okay. Broken. No, I'm broke. I can't explain that to the right. Just fucked up. Stress. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna handle it. Okay. I'm gonna handle it. So literally was like, I almost pulled them off of the fucking Google. I was like, like a wolf-ball. What? You had such ones? Yeah. Oh, they haven't ever owned up this. But yeah, you can't. Well, I got a wolf throw with three slashes. That's true. They make more than that. We don't have a wolf. We just have a lot of things. I'm just going to see you later. I don't know. We have four of those. Okay. Why four? Four. Oh, shit. Well, that's going to change a rear so come on. It's the boring. You can just like, you can just, like, I can't even change the music. I'm like, take for a little bit of a way. Yeah, really. That's where they go. I'm not joking. So you're self-sufficient. Yeah, I don't think there's no one going to change the music. Well, you have, like, fucking DJs. You want in there for a desk? Yeah, I think, I think, being gone. But I don't even think, Tom, that would be more easy for you out here. How do you do it? I don't think me in the front desk. But I bet you got it. You're like, this. No, I don't do this. The other is a clinic. They had to put on, like, soft rock out there. Oh, okay. And you kept it. Right. I got my blood drawn tomorrow. You got it. Yeah, I know. Mm-hmm. All right. What is up YouTube? You got a very special guest at our event this weekend, Mr. She keeps showing up over here. I'm just like, getting certain myself everywhere. Often, then, you know, then see the master's speaker now. He's like, you know, talking about him coming. This guy is like, hey, he used it some of, I mean, I'm just an invite bro. Am I? Is that midnight? I did not know if you were asking me to come to him. Could I just post it about my event jersey and a new message? So I thought you were gonna need that jersey and I'll come to you. I'll do both and then you can see that up the top. See this is how you do it. I've been putting myself in conditions to grow by speaking more. He's doing the same thing. It literally won't be in every, every time I can get any speaking thing. I need to get better out of bro. I'm getting better. The only way is brebs. Yeah. And like, I feel like I get to, like, that's was a great, honestly. We did a good job. Yeah. Thank you. Who is chill and I feel we were given high levels of life. But yeah, I'm thinking of Ben with a big success so I like very much about that. But hit legs today. You're what? 53 days. How do you treat these? It's moving? Right, almost eight. Eight weeks though. That's prep and for a show. I'm like 22 weeks though, so not very close. Talk and talk a lot, so. Yeah, so I'm still trying to get huge and you're trying to get skinny, so like good. Really? What is this? This is what I've ordered, so pretty. We're going to go all men. Wanna keep some! So that was all my energy numbers that fucked the rest of the world up. That was a point. It's good. Are you ready, questa? No, not凨der! That, you know, stutters been stuck in the case? I'm in the game, I've already killed a gun. All right, this is actually it. This is me. No more international travel for the rest of the year. I have two trips. One of them isn't in me and agreed so it won't kill me. The other one that was haunting so I'll get a good work out of them and we're locking it in to finally grow and get huge and be consistent because I've been fucking all over the place and legs have been taking a huge detriment of my legs and shrinking. I'm going to weaker and it's just not how I want to be. So time's up to myself. I did legs four days ago and doing it again today. I'm trying to get them huge so this is it. It's been too long. Finally not fucking traveling for a bit so it's had to be consistent.geons, going to my Davis. I'm going. Work longer left Xbox아요. I don't like it a lot, can you see this one? My boy. It's a game strength, wow. I thought I could have a lot of it. I feel like it was the only one to ten. I thought I'd get it. How many infos does it take to put on a resistive band? It still do. It still do. It's still do. It's like... I don't like it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to put that 25. This is a gentle ending though. I'll try it like a bird. I'm sorry to put that on. I'm sorry to put that on. I'm sorry to put that on. What's going on? I can't see it. I can't. That's going to explode. I'm going to try and like the head of the head. That idea. Did you all do it? You only do it. You didn't get that many reps in the first set or the action. What? Did you do it? The drop sets more when you only eat like six or seven, like five to seven reps in the first set. Then he drops, right? You just feel like you can be doing the nine or ten when you drop. Do the drop set. You want me to do it? Right? Sure. I think that's one. I can't even hear it from over there. You do a drop set if you only hit five or six, like if you did his hand or the leg in the first one, like it without dropping it, you wouldn't do the drop. It's more like the rep range. I intentionally went heavier to that drop. But sometimes I'll just do six and stuff. Yeah. I'll try and find out on six and drop. I'm doing it. Come on. Come on. Two. Another one. Oh, bro. You want me to go? No, no drop set. Do it. But it's just shot. I should shot a kick. Do it. Oh, this is your spot bro. Oh, this is your spot bro. Oh, this is your spot bro. Look.
