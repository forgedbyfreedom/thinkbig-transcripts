Don't you know what I'm talking about? Am I 14? You thought you had to go through that? I thought I was going to be too blind as to go. What do you want to go? I think you'd go any big piece of the... Well, I'm off down. Go out. Oh, we do have one of those. There's quite a lot of them. There's quite a lot of them. There's quite a lot of them.

I'm gonna try and press it down. Next is cinnamon. You don't need that. You don't need that. You don't need that. You can have a little bit because he's on it. I can't agree that. It's something to quit it. I thought you had a good idea. I thought you had a good idea. I'm sure one might be like a full day meeting. I'm gonna try and get a plate. Oh, here you go. There's this plate. Yeah. I'm gonna have to do it. I'm gonna take this one away. I'm gonna take this one away. Don't you get a plate. Oh, here you go. There you go. There's a big knife. There you go.

Just fill it up, say. Just get a hold on. I'm going to try it. I was waiting. Get in there. You want to do it, honey? Probably the work thing I like to do. Great. What is up YouTube? Last night, beautiful night. Kelvin wanted to watch a shitty UFC 5-3 to film a little bit. But honey let me get an in-note burger and some cereal. And what? Yeah, but I didn't really get a date for a brunch. We went in at 11 o'clock at night and Kelvin tapped up by them. So you guys don't get to see any of my cheat meal, but I haven't been in the open. I'm going to get a pretty fire. So I'm enjoying that. And today's like this, I'm trying to put it to work. And get some big ol' legs. So let's go to the exact way he said. Three ways, what? 600 pounds. No. Five many times. Five these times. They're for sure. That's not fair. That's not fair. That's pretty good. Good. Good. Three. Three. You're going to keep going. Good. Good. Good. Here we go. Go, go, go. Good. Partial, partial, three. Two. That's it. That one. That's just like it's like always going out. You have to have the... ...this part's clear. Okay. Let's go. Go. Good. Go on. Keep going. Good. Keep going. You're going. Good. Now partial. Go. Two. Three. Keep going. One more. That's it. Good. That's it. That's it. Failed bats are too. That's what? Did that... Did you hurt your leg on that one? Or your knee? Yeah, both of these people in there. It's like maybe I should hear it a little bit more. I know that was the one you hear a lot's during. Yeah. Do not amazing machine. You're going to love so much. I didn't hate the machine until now. It just hates you. Yeah. See that my leg works. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. Good. Put your toe. Put your toe. Can go. Like that. Go. Just go to feel it. Good. Go. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's it. Tell you. Good. Partial. Three. Two. All right. Good. Good. Sunday, late, month. Good. Good. Excellent. Fire. Good. Good. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Go. Okay. You need partial stuff. Partial. Partial. Keep going. Good. Good. Keep going. Good. And you're done. Good. Go. Good. That's who three of those. I feel too is okay. I think we can go into a compound movement now. Let's go into a. You don't have a Smith machine squad. You won't be here to all the later next week. So I think we can avoid it and then do. Smith machine squad. We can do late press. We can do that vertical late press. Have you guys seen something? No. You know a vertical late press is. Oh, we can do 45. We have vertical. We have 45. We also have two different hacks. Actually, this this one right here. This pendulum is pretty bad. It's pendulum. I think the home of the starting was like press. And then moving to either belt or pendulum. But we just did felt. It's been a good look for so. You know, tired me on when the late press is in do this or do this first. I think you're actually this is so smooth. I'd like for you to try out this machine first. And then go over. And then maybe on the late press. If you didn't 45 before, we can do vertical. Because you know, you have to put it on. No. We're going to try that. It's matched the how it is. This is for his only fan's page. Come on. You're straight. Two. Two. Two. Two. Five. Six. Two. Two. Two. Four. Four. Two. Four. Two. One. Four. One. Oh. Oh, good. Good. Good. Good. You're good. Good. Good. Go go go drive. Go you come on go drive. Go go go now. Now I'll start. Go go drive. Are you still go two more go up drive one more one more with me. Come on Chris drive it all the way through. Go go. I got really happy. Chris. Heard so bad. He's got no looney five. It's a hotty. He's six, six, six, we. Okay. What is he seven? I mean I honestly feel like you can probably do that way again but it's up to you. But if you want more volume or less, I want to see him out of volume because I don't think it will do more. Oh, I don't think it will do more. Oh, I'm sure. There you go. Sorry, but. Hey. Oh, good. You going. You going moving. Right. Go. Right. Good. Good drive drive. Good one more one more. Got this. Come on Chris. And drive all the way up. Good job. How's that all man? So bad. You cracks but. Moving. Cracks and creaks. Yeah. So. I was no loosey duty set. Good job. Excellent. Excellent. Good. Come on Chris. Good. Keep moving in. Move away. Right. Drive. Excellent. Good. Right. Right. Right. Good. Right. What? I think that's good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on Chris. Drive it. Come on Chris. Drive it. Drive it. Good. Keep moving. Go. Drive. Good job. Drive. Good. One more. Go. And drive. Go. Go. Good job. Like that. It's not easy. I'm not going. It's not a big smooth push. There's too much touching on the machine rather than weight moving. Like the bench is to come under through pushing the weight up. You're kind of pushing the weight against the metal. Like it's on a track and it's that you're pushing up. What's that? You're pushing into the metal and then up. It's a lot of friction. Yeah. I also think that you're, it's like where you're putting your feet to on this one. It was a sign. It's a sign a little bit for your higher foot position. I mean, this chair is too far back. It's too far back to too open. You need to be like, you need to be a little bit more upright. Or no, this whole thing needs to be more under. So pushing will up instead of out. To me, it feels like it's a little too far back. That's what I mean, this needs to hold between these two and stuff. So you're more underneath. See how it feels. We're going to start with two and then work our way up a little bit. There you go. This definitely provides much more resistance when you're doing single leg. Then do the double. So that's why you went lighter than half. You want to quarter or more about it. But. Okay. Okay. Good. Squeeze. Set your retard. That works. Don't say that word. My coach is retired. I don't know. I thought you're still talking about somebody else. What? Yeah. Did you realize it would be a pain in your life? Jason, 20. Of course I realized it was me dummy. Sure. Couldn't even think of a name that started with endless name. We had a game going for four hours last night. Four hours at the dinner table. What is fairness called the game? I don't even know how to go. It's like it makes up categories. Cam picks a category. He says he picks celebrities and people. Essentially in movies or celebrities. And he said the name like George Washington and then Washington and then Washington and then between to make another famous person that starts with and and he goes around the circle. And then so. You can't think of a name you lose a point. You get three points to lose in your up. No. No. We went through probably like 20 people with last name and like back and forth. And the order just fucked. There was a lot. Four hours of just a name. Literally. Yeah. The entire dinner we stayed there longer. And I was of course one. We had a letter one. Zero strikes. No you had one pass. No pass. You tried to cheat me at the end there but I got it. This guy. I knew fastest. I didn't want to like hurt his feeling. So I went. You know. It's like a pretty upset me. Oh, he's got a call. I was like give me the banana foster. It was like your sense of reality. And truth I was the one getting heated. I got to win them. I got to win them. You see. Okay. Wait. I don't want life. Really? The most mother. A little bit. Got to go save. Well, the fuchions are heavier. I guess you don't have to wait for them. You're going for this. You're going. Okay. Good. Try to eat. I'm good. Push. Push. Okay. Okay. I'm like, well, sorry. Okay. You're just being closer. Keep. Good. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Don't go to the. Don't go to the right there. Like a. Keep. Keep attention on the bottom. There you go. Yeah. You don't go to the. Yeah. Why? Good. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. That way. Good.

Hey, go to the iron. Put my head eggs. I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm just like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, okay, you've got to breathe out of my hand. You should say, here we go. That's it. Good. That house is wall-arrage emotion supposed to be, yeah. I got three, good. You go a little higher. Go on, go on. Got. Oh, you had that. What did it do with this machine? Oh, no rage emotion. You can't breathe. I'm pushing my legs. Yeah, how big baby. When you're telling me to do that tactic, that revive, it's nothing behind me. And I'm like, two fucking heavy, it's going to be back. You're like, what do you say? All the science guys really. Actually, you need a bench behind you and Robo, how's the shit?
