I'm going to make a really slow right now. But I made way to try to do it my pants on. I'm going to go one by five or something. So, it took about half a stop at a 240-1.2. So, not bad, right? That two pounds came in handy this year. Probably could have pushed a little harder. But it's still great for the two pounds. Got the heat. It came in. It had either not very delicious. But we'll call it delicious. Fish and pulp. It did a lot of good. Food is great. I'll leave it to the press conference. Never know. It's expected these things. We have more people in here. We got a right to make up. We got a press conference. You're not picking publish. I'm not saying that we can make this like this. I don't know how much. I'm not doing this. What's wrong?

Chris Mumsman. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. You are here to do what you have done before. Is it just another day at the office? I see that you have gentlemen next day that you train or services over there, you are allowed. Those moments in the gym, someone is like you are lowering your man. Young lions and all that stuff. What I want to know is, are you here to just win this thing or you here to actually dominate this thing? Because there is a lot of people that believe that you can do it. Of course there is people next to you that think you can't. I'm here for a few reasons. I've said, I'm absolutely welcome home. Was I trophy? But that's not the only reason why I'm here this year. This is my fifth time chasing after title. I've been on the on the stage. I'm competing for 10 years. If I've learned anything, it's that in the past. I felt I'd have to just shut down a lot. I've pressed a lot and just go into this performance mode to win. I'm just pushing everything aside. And this year what I want, I will be with you. I want to be different. I want to feel the whole journey. I want to have fun training. I want to enjoy the process. Feel the outspiel the downs. Not just not the wallet. I'm not the one who's going to be here. I'm excited to be here. I'm smiling. I'm showing my family and they're all here. I'm just having a good time. I'm putting the work. I know these guys are fighting for second place. And I'm just here to win. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. No, yeah. What's the week? I don't want you to get better there's zero. I don't want to be. I want to be no. Great good brother. I'm going to give Chris a good run for his buddy. And he's going to have a success week. We got a great competition every time he's back. But I mean, just take with Chris. Chris. Sean Ray says, you're in the wrong division. You should be in the open. Your eyes should be on that stand out. You should be in that open. He thinks you got a legitimate shot. Sean's there, right? Chris knows. I told him two or three years ago. He's in the wrong division. But he's always got to do. I'm right wherever. I'm going to get back to the end. Now, you're where you're going right now. But let's just say, technically say, you do win five. And you said, many times, you're about any years. You got a lot, but you still got some gas. But then, would you consider, if you were to win five, would you consider hand in a month? I need to let me a stage. But only temporarily, you're going to grab it for a pair of trunks and get that sand out of shot. Sorry, can't point out. Like, some tons of air. Do you want to do it? No, no, no. I'm not going to say, read your Chris. I'll do it this weekend. I mean, listen, I know you're an over-ish. So if I could be a little bit much, I'll be cool, though. But no, I'm not going to, like, just say, you say, okay, five's enough. I'm returning from class. I'll be back next year. And I'll go over that. I don't know if you're trying to exit the crowd or get these gas hopes up. I don't like Joe. Well, the first tell us it's key. So as if you're eating in a good five, you're going to put it in to that right here right now. This year, the junior four, I know you want you to like it, brother. But it's time to move on. The Earth is a miracle, bearer. Can it happen? Will it happen? We all know everything can happen in this world, especially nowadays. But we're going to find an hour, set it a evening, man. You got to get to the speed, no, before you get to the ship up. I know he's not understanding when I say the English, so I said it in Puerto Mish, Cuitado, Dosicando. Who are you? Who are you? You got a whole bunch of followups. You're dead head right now. No, I say you guys, the question I can ask is, Earth said that he put on 15 hours since his last attempt at beating Chris. Chris says it's going to kind of be a sound like a saying it's going to be a walk in the park. So I don't know. You train with him to see anything when you were training with him that gave me an idea that you could surpass him this year. Yeah, so definitely that he's getting old of. So I knew I invested a lot last year, I trained my ass off over there and coldest journey in the bunker. And he has a great journey, sunny winter, so I knew I won my ass off. No, but decide that. It's always good to always go to training and with those others, to come out of competitors, it's always the reason why flying the US, literally on the, yeah, I'm into those guys. I also came all the way to Brazil and trained with Ramon. So I think it's good to push each other in a certain way and also don't forget the fun. Yeah, and it's also fun at this level of bodybuilding, trust me. So it's a great spot of a great time, everybody should join in and follow it. All right, thank you, Eric Bell, you can't stop flying anybody from Brazil. Ramon is a superstar in Brazil. I'm going to ask this question real quick and Portuguese and then I'll translate when you respond to the audience. Ramon, you're in the middle of Brazil, but you're a Brazilian. So you're not going to be able to do that. So I'm going to ask you to come out of your preparation. So what's the question? I asked him, he's in here in Brazil, but a lot of people are being critical that he didn't show any pictures and that he maybe doesn't pose as aggressively. Wouldn't he have to say about this? So, if you're going to, don't you just come out of your strategy? I think that's a good thing that I'm going to do the same. Most of all, I'm going to do a different thing that I can do because I'm not going to do anything. And that's what I'm going to do, and that's what I'm going to do. I think that's a good thing. He said, it doesn't matter when the picture show, it's not a strategy. I'm only concerned about what I'm going to show on stage. How about that? Thank you very much. Well, I have a question because a lot of these guys, they seem to be fans of the Chris Bumstedt. They make hard signs to Chris Bumstedt. They invite Chris Bumstedt to dinner. But, pre-on is the kind that actually challenges Chris Bumstedt. Pre-on is this year that you're going to do some of these young guys to finally challenge Chris Bumstedt. Chris, you trained for your first floor, Linda Bowins. I want to say the most popular by the law in Instagram, 1920, million-bought, 20, wait, it's 21 now, 21 now. But you have so many people coming up to you in the gym, when you're trying to drink for the Linda, it's a picture, it's a talk. And you're a nice guy and you've always accommodated everyone. But this year, you built your own gym. You've trained in private, you've noticed directions. What difference did that make in your training and your focus for this year? I'm focused for this one. Me and it was the very selfish and you're focusing. I had this year to have that private gym and it was a lot of fun. I got to teach a trans-my friend and focus and do what I do. And I think for guys who are aware of that, I could be able to gym with the barbell or receipts with some dumbbells. I'm going to get the work done and do what I do. But I mean every age I could get, I'm going to take it. I built that type of gym, I got to work. I didn't really help me focus my mind. I was going to say before, just enjoy the journey. I could go in there. I could be quiet, I could play my music. I could be present. I could enjoy every single workout. I remember getting into the barbell squatting, doing this and being like, I got two more things, just like, feel this and enjoy this. This is so fine right now. It'd be this strong with lean to be working so much such a difficult, beautiful goal. I just, they both allowed me to ski more in my presence and everything I was doing. I trained my ass off and go off and I'm going to provide so hopefully it helps. I just need it, but then we'll have one final. All right, I'm going to work. I have to do it. You're going to get so happy to play out. I'm going to do those. Let's go up and go up. Do you want to go up? Yes. I'm going to do that. I'm going to go up and go up and go up. I'm going to go up and go up and go up. Right. Right. I know. Just like, I never thought. You know, like, these old guy. No, no. That wasn't that. He's got his food. You ready? Yeah. It's a skyrocket. Is this like, you know, that's different? No, but it also doesn't look like it. Yeah, hi, anyway. No, no. No, no. No, no. He's wearing up for it when he can. We have. No, no. He's wearing up for it when he can. We have. All right. So. Williams. Check. First conference. Check. Thursday. Chaos is half over. We are home. We're going to eat some food now. We need two meals today. This is November 3. The press conference sometimes. I mean, people like it. I get it sitting there when I'm this tired and the chair. My next Saturday at headache and just every two hours. Just beaming lights on you. And I'm like, all right. I got to go eat. I got to go to the trip's water and chill. So finish that up. I found Van turn was the boys and no, Brionne's back this year. We had a, it's funny. I spoke last year. We had like a. Like a genuine rivalry. He was the one who beat me at the end. And it was like that. And he retired last year. And it was like this. Like moment of friendship that we had those genuine. Like that. And he comes back and I was like. Back in the tack. So fun being out there was them. Been turning a little bit. Yeah, I'm just enjoying it. You know what's fucking on all of this here. We've got some jokes chilling out there. And now we get to eat.

I never heard of her. No, but I just spent two hours in the shower. I'm eating a coordinate shaving my butt crack. She's been to over in the shower just shaving all the hair. So, that's why I bought this. That's why I'm eating my butt. I'm eating my butt like right here. Like down below. I'm like, Brad might cheat. But I like, we don't really know. I'm like, right here we go. He had a crisis secret as he uses women's razors because he said they don't give you as much razor burn. Way better. So, tips for the competitors. And all fairness, I think me and Matt have seen just as much as you. Bro, shut up. You have not. You're better than me. You're better than me. You're better than me. You're better than me. You're better than me. You're better than me. Sorry, guys. I think I'd take, I think I'm going to like confidently say I take a with on that one. But, yeah. Anyways, sorry for the shower shaving.

Why do I guess? The sense you don't view from me this year. But no, honestly, it's sometimes I get stressed out to note me and I understand how much people appreciate it. And hearing the effect that I can have on people was. I don't really understand it, so I see it in here. I just love my life. Trying to get through my own life and seeing that it helps people with a lot to be. I appreciate everyone who followed my journey. I love you guys. Am I something similar? What? Am I something similar? Different but similar. Yeah. I have to get the Bible, but it should It's on mind, both things, comments and you see it. But when do you meet someone in person? But I write you a long letter like that with a cold, it's fucked, you know? It just shows you too that everybody's in the same boat sometimes. And we all think we're alone. Everyone's going through their own shit. That's the only reason I share it. I don't share it to my shit, to complain or to think I'm in the bad spot. I just share it so people know that they're not alone either. And so that they know that you can't fucking quit. The champions don't quit. We follow, we stumble, we cry, but we don't quit. So yeah, this is what it is. I'm sweating now, now I'm crying, sweating. I gotta go to the town, so we're going to wipe these tears down here. What? I'm in 400. Yeah. It was supposed to be light and reasonable. But yeah, thank you guys for all the love you guys gave me all the support. Didn't go and notice. And I might not get back to everybody, but I read a lot of these notes and I read a lot of these notes. I read every note. I get, I read a lot of the comments. Some DMs, I can't get it back to a lot, but they mean a lot to me. So thank you guys for all the love and support along my journey. You guys have helped me probably a lot more than anything. You guys have to be a lot more than anything. All the trees here are over 350 mage plants themselves crowned by the Workers' Republic ofzukman, where they have made this.
