So it's cool. It's awesome. The great thing about it is we got another 50 pieces of equipment coming in the next two weeks. So a little kid in the can is shut. That's right. That's right. Because we have a lot of area. We got to actually not have a material. We squeeze everything in. But we have a lot of warm machines coming in. And so shout out to Anada, shout out to Primo Fitness for helping us make this dream achievable. Been working on this for a very long time. It's been great because of the vast variety of machines and being able to use not only the biomechanics to really help you create that better contraction. But also being able to adjust for different heights. I mean, we have my wife was here. We're so on her. You guys, somebody is tall as Chris. Being able to work on him and everything in between. So that's what's really great about it. So many different machines that work so well. So, great thing about it is that Chris is going to be here for a couple more days. We're going to be working on legs, we're going to be working on arms, we're going to be working on back. We're going to be working on shoulders. So we got a bunch of different workouts coming. But it's going to be just over eight weeks out. Yeah, in the Saturday, we took. Yeah, it's been a good time right now. Down here, putting them the work. And then the right mindset and we're to fuck shit up. That's it. So follow it. Love it. Kill it. That you knew like, well, could be put down on t-shirt. Could be. It's got to go on the next t-shirt now. barbecue. Can I eat barbecue? barbecue. Sure. You can smell it. I want you to want that. barbecue would be my last resort. Yeah, you would have like a very run joteer. We've got fries, muffins, and I haven't actually had four new go big because you can fire us. Fern a fairness can be cooking up a storm. Yeah. Just giving, I get cod and potatoes and everything. I'm going to get shredded. Five minutes late, bud. All right. Yeah. So it's a day two training with private layer of panata, not everything. Honestly, these are panata machines that haven't even seen. So it's kind of cool. Take a pictures and put some of my gym I think, and everything like them. So it's nice. It's going to be my knees thing now. I've made gym with none of these big, but I'm going to fucking swap out pieces. I like finding them and like them. So I eventually have a perfect shit I have to have less variety. So it is what it is. But we're going to go back to honey town. So now he has a meeting. So we're going to go back to get some food. I think I'll make train right now. And then I'll see you guys later.
