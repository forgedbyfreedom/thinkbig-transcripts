Take pictures and he's like the little evil child. You're kids, Maddie, and they're just going to be here. Let me pop you places to which one I go to before going here. Poor. We tried two other ones. No doubt, Doug you know that, so that the big fuck it will be late because she needs good coffee. Whatever we're late, never ever late for anything. It's not that bad, literally true. I'm just going to get a heart of these burnt out nights to get your head. You can get like my work for a guest right. I know like you're the extreme for life. I'm going to have like, he is there. I'm going to have a friend of the bodybuilder. I'm going to have a family for a few days. This is the very first SSC by my organization to lead to the Summary Sharing Championship. We have so many high-sake prizes and just opportunities that are going to be opened up on a tourmer 27th. So, we're going to have a move all the way back. What is up YouTube? I had to get that in there and nobody's going to say that the vlog. But we are here in Tampa for some of Shredding, Courtney's judging Kishida, part of the Alpha League who came out of the poor Christian in the show because of the Christian and Courtney's judging the show. So, we're down here watching but a pre-judging, I haven't even breakfast yet, so we snuck out and going to get some food. And then we'll come back and we'll watch finals, actually. But that's what's going on. Did you hear in Tampa? I don't know what else to say. I wish I could ask you guys to go for breakfast because you can't find any good food. That can't but it's no good food. It's really run out down the town but we're going to search for some breakfast so see you later. I found this place. You did? Yeah, you did. You did a job, Calvin. Let's just see if it's good. It's good I found it's bad you found it. I think I have two which touches a lot of food but the can't be done. I don't know what I'm going to say. I don't know what I'm going to say. I don't know what I'm going to say. This is the first time you've been out or take out like in a while as well. I mean like breakfast. Breakfast? Yeah, it's been a minute. I don't know what the last time I've been. Do we go to first watch and text this? Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't look like talent. It's like healthy. No, no, no, no, no, no. I feel like this is way dirty here. Did it dirty? I got egg whites, bacon, hash brownies. I mean, yeah, bad. That doesn't. What? I don't know. Should we get on the bleachers? I don't really want to eat her on a bunch of ducks. All right, like to tear her thigh. Don't hang in the ducks. Oh, I don't know what these. What? They're the fucking ducks are evil, man. I can't even know the ducks have any cheese. Oh, yeah, gross. Yeah, you know, you know, you know, fuck with cheese. No, no, come at you. These are fucking terrifying. I have literally got charged full on by one once. What do we do? We have the bleachers. How can squirrels? Yeah. Nature. Nature. You're going to take us to the food, not leave us all alone. So Gabriel Montes says you have to be one with nature. What do you say? Yes, that's glass. That's dedication. Walls, life. Oh, there's another bench right there. That's why he said. Oh, I thought you meant that one. There's a yellow bench over there. I don't know. I don't like the most. All right, so here today, in Tampa Bay, we sent stuff by daily each first, a beautiful breakfast. And I'm not sure how to build by it yet, but if you'd always for all those, we got a sandwich. This looks like shit. We got a lot of stuff to do. They didn't even try. I was like, can I build my own sandwich? Yeah, I'm like, okay, so egg. How do you want them? It's scrambled. She's like, okay, do you want anything else? I'm like, like, she meant that you want anything else. I'm like, can I put more stuff on the sandwich? Oh, yeah, I'm like, can I put turkey on it? She's like, yeah, sure, I'm like, okay, what do you want? To Calvin, I'm like, I guess it's all I get on my sandwich. So I left it at that, but the bowl actually looks pretty fire. And the steak actually tastes good on my first bite. It's like, it's really potatoes out of the bottom. It's just a piece of meat. All right, let's put it go. The putty we're looking for a quick breakfast in Tampa. Grab and go. I give it a minute still pricing. Some of them. 50 bucks at first watch, get to like, four entrances and like two hours. Maybe it's a couple of days. I also got steak, egg, three servings of egg whites sandwich, turkey sauce, and a unique bowl. Chewy cocky and fruit. Not bad. Wow, sorry. Oh, it's all good. I want to put that in. Appreciate it. That's probably the only one I've ever seen. I don't know. Thank you so much. Yeah, thank you. Okay, can we unlock the door and go? What's going on? Where we at?
