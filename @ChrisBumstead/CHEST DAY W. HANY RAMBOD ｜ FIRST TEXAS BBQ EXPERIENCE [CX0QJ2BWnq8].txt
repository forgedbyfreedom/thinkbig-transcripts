You know, I'm gonna go mister and miss is going through it. Oh God. No, no. I'm gonna have to do that. I'm gonna have to do that. I'm gonna have to do that. Yeah, that's it. That's it. Only if you put me. Oh, I'm gonna do that. Actually, I have too many princesses even I can do that. I'm just like a more pressure. More pressure. No, no. Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on, Chris. Come on, you're still. Oh, come on, come on, you're still. What's the... What is up, YouTube? We're here in Kentucky at the Megafit headquarters. There have been here before, so they're bringing me in behind the scenes. How the meals are made, how they're all prepped. The food coming in, all that could show me how high the quality, the clean the processing is, all that could stuff. So we're gonna run through here. The everything's made from the bundles, the custom balls, and all that could stuff. So stay tuned. Keep watching and hopefully you have like to do it. It's nice in here. Yeah, we just did some some remodel. We just expanded the forever little more and put a new line. We still have a mill of metal detectors never hang. We literally just got a chance to do it. There we go, perfect timing. I would just send my first ever food facility a few weeks ago. Let's make our bars and some of our juice and stuff. We went in there and made this cool 30 week factory there. No, it was tiny. They run a lot in the small place, yeah, pretty impressive. This small is missed a lot of fun. Oh, it is, yeah. Let's go ahead and get y'all set up. The question is, two eggs, so or three eggs, so. The three. So you should get comfortable. You don't want to see me cook. It's so good. I leave that to the court. You know that? You have your staples. You can cook. What's your favorite? Box, pancakes. Pasta. From a box now. I can check your technical. You can actually do a refresher. I'm going to add on a pumpkin. I'm going to add on a pumpkin. I thought that we did do it. I do. I used to make it every day and then now I don't have to make it. So, how much of my poverty zone cheese on it? All right. All right. That's what I'm going to do. What would I want to do? I am like a fish. A fish. With my pajama dog pretty much and like dog hair all over. It's a good opportunity. I want to do it. This is a. This is a word that's kind of on the way. We used it to speak. It's a good move. And over there. So, this is not starting to like a big prep area. For me to cut it. You want not. So, that's why there's not much in here right now. Everywhere cool too. So, like. It's like this place. The prep room is filled with food. The machines are. It's where I've been. It's in here. Yeah. Yeah. No. I think that's what I'm going to do. Everybody else is having a big machinery now. Yeah. We still do it. Yeah. We're going to do it. That way. So, keep that in light. Yeah. We're going to look at all the ingredients on the flat growth. The muscles. You can use your six lungs. Yeah. Very good. But, you know, you can put your feet in that breath. Your body's filled with your lungs. Yeah. We got a piece of meat. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can't put your foot in the deep breath. You can put your feet in the deep breath. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can't put all that. I guess so. It's past them. Yeah. It's not that creative. But it's good. So, this is where we grill all the chicken and we do all our ground meat in the base of the chicken. All the grub meat in there. Yeah. Yeah. All wrong. All wrong. That's what we're trying to kick in. Try to be. Yeah. There they come in door for it. It's a little cooler back there for some tuning. Yeah. So we grill all our chicken. So it gives it a little bit more tenderness. It's like real deal with it here. I don't know what this is. Oh, really? Damn. All fresh vegetables. They're shippies and daily. Nothing's free frozen. We don't use that high cool. We don't use eating, I see. We have this. We're typically in the breakfast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a hell of a lot more hard than it's worth. Yeah. You'll be the only reason I've stayed with you guys. I like you. But I actually like the food. Yeah. I've tried all the other stuff and it's like, I don't want to eat this. Yeah. Everybody knows how to talk to this. Oh, man. I don't know what people say that. Yeah. Because we eat the products too. So we don't have to eat it. Yeah. And as we grow, rather than cutting quality, we're trying to upgrade every day. Yeah. Try to use better beans and what more. That's the best. That's amazing. The nice thing behind the scenes is being bored, press. You know? The big better than the food hope. Yeah. I mean, it's good to see how it all gets cooked together. There's a lot of things they just cook. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What up? What up? What up? I'm sure. How do you like types of stuff work? Well, I've only fed here for for 12 hours. Come on, let me get it. It's nice. Beautiful. Shout out to the Texans of the world's my first time in Dallas. I'm a fan, Calvin. But I think camera won't talk to you very highly of it. Love it. And Chris is a piece of art. He's a little sick boy. Yeah. But he's like, I really like it here. It's beautiful. It kind of reminds me of that Illinois. But like the grass. The grass is a trees. Florida is very tropical. This is very. The vibe. Yeah. We're going to vibe up. Let you all come back and let you guys know my final thoughts. But so far so good. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Just being my authentic self. I think it's a minor asshole. Cheers. What is up YouTube? We are back in Texas to see H.T. Mr. Honny Rambad, but we're going to crew with us. We're here for the built-in film with it. To where that we're doing a little seminar. We've been Q&A. Mean Creek. Calvin can have all that on these series. But we are just guided in late last night from Kentucky. I don't know if I know all that footage to show you guys. Calvin was with me. But later video I'll go first. I'm going to show you some of that stuff. Maybe before after this. I don't know. But we're going to do a podcast right now with Honny. We're going to go work out later. Calvin is desperate for some barbecue. So maybe we'll get some barbecue. And some I can actually eat it instead of big torture. Just watching our prep. But the tour is right now. So we're heading to the podcast studio. We're going to film this and then go from there. So say to it. What is it called? What is it called? Color matching. What? Well you both are fancy. It's like my beard. Oh yeah. It's good. Good. Good. Good. Damn. Honny. That's really. I'm going to roll the rest room. Yeah. Actually I'm going to go too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to get a step. Maybe measuring his water. We're up like that. How much does that? How much do you think he was going to have to travel to his. He did. And what's one of those was the RS grill? Yeah. What's the difference? Of course. I want you guys to be able to try and sell things. What do you think? What do you think? Good. What business do you want to eat to go? Not as big as what we used to go. Yeah. I'm going to share this with you. I can't show it. Okay. I think we'd be just today. Yeah. When we do that, when tomorrow, like, what back? Yeah. And then maybe Sunday. Yeah. And like, oh, like. Yeah. Yeah. It's scared of doing legs. Woo. Nice. But I just actually the week is far enough here right now. By pressing it really weak. So, it's still being a bear. First workout. Yeah. How do you feel about him? Bouncing 225 for 10. Oh, you mean skinny bitch syndrome and full effect? I have a teacher that does skinny bitch. I'm absolutely about to do it. How you under percent of the other thing is skinny bitch. I'm a little sad. He doesn't want things to be too easy for us. So, you have to take two steps back to take five steps forward. You gotta put yourself a new core into the pressure to work that you're not. I didn't have no words. So, it works. That's him. I'm gonna throw this off. These are favorite being your favorite. Yeah, favorite you've had. There you go. How did you do it? How did you go? Good. Oh, you know. Are we gonna go Mr. and Mrs. Goantyre? Oh God. No. Mr. and Mrs. Olympia. So, that you want to do that? I don't know how to talk about you. I don't know what you do in the game. There. That's it. That's it. Only do put me. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I don't know. I don't know. Actually, I have too many princesses. Oh, I can't do that. I just like a more pressure. More pressure. No. I don't know. Okay. Okay. Good. Let's get it out. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. So, what we're doing is we're just making sure to go through the motion. It's not. He's not as weak as I thought he would be. Thank you. It's a little bit punchly. I thought it was going to be really, really, really weak. I've been seeing the last video. I have to do so that. The expectation was a problem with overdoliver. He's definitely set the standard to borrow low. When I could be this at the center of high and then right after I set it low, it's possible. He's a good job with that. Good job with that. Can't find any weights or injury. That's what we're trying to focus on right now. We'll arrange a motion, get in the blood and the muscle, make sure it's contracting, and we're getting out the shakes. The pushing is getting us. Yes. He's hurting us out of him. He's looking at the release of your inner beach. It's hard to be there. And he's accepted. Roll it. Yeah. Going from that to big beach. It's time for some upgrades. It's time for some upgrades. Good. Good. Okay. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Good. Good. Good. I still notice we can be tired. Here we will stronger than I thought. There you go, guys. I'm not actually speaking about it. I'm a medium, medium bitch. It's not true. You just told me you was a superstar. I'm just a regular. Yeah. Okay. So we're going to do all the way up. Go. Go now. Pause it. Just go down. That's it. We do one more set. We're just going to work on the eccentric a little bit more. Go a little bit slower on the way down. It's just going to really help to keep more time and attention. So just go up the top. Pause for a quick second. And then we go really slow. There we go. Great. Great. Very good. That's slow. Turn it up. Good. One more. Go. Good. Sit slow. All right. So we're working on the eccentric. So we're on the way down. We're getting him to pause at the very top just for a split second. So we're not using momentum. But then on top of that, what we're trying to do is we're trying to focus on making sure that we're taking our time on the way down. Trying to get those muscles to react to it. You'll start seeing shaken. Most people only get shaken as during their ab training because most people do everything but abs. When you're getting it from chastise because he hasn't done much of anything. I did chip last week. I just didn't do that eight week before that. To my point. It's why I'm your favorite client, eh? This is what I have to deal with. Everybody be careful what you guys wish for. Not what you think. You didn't whisper that he just came crawling to your door. Oh no, I'm saying that people wish they could be me. If you wish they could do this, I'm not you. You were wishing for it. You're the person who wasn't. I said, where did I deserve this? It's a terrible chat. The challenge was accepted. Now it's time. Now he's trying to make it like let's raise the barn. Like he finishes. This is a panata press. This will be pressed as a couple of different angles. You can be able to really attack your chest or triceps. Can you do it? Oh, fuck me. Can you go here? I'll also do it right here. And just put yourself right in that spot. And then there you go. So you're going to feel good. So you're going to feel good triceps. You're going to feel good. You're going to get a little bit of stretch because the bar is back. You're pushing the bit like this. More of a normal range of motion. It feels good because you get a little bit of tension all the way through. But you also can get a little bit of stretch because the bar is back. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The terror of things. There you go. There you go. Good. Good. Good. You're going to feel like you're locking into a roll of things. It's all the fun. It's all the fun. It's all the fun. It's another dad joke. Dad jokes are bad. You're waiting to sit here. I was waiting here one. There it was. Was that a joke? It was not a joke. It was just a steak. I don't know. That's what a dad joke is. It's the funny joke. It's not.

But he said he was literally nervous in the car. He could eat upset barbecue. Me and the ham not a gigantic fan of it. But I do like good food. So we'll be the judge of it. If my first bite in the barbecue sauce or. No. Yeah. Without. There you go. I've honestly never really enriched people. Parts of a cake and very anything. But I think really good. It has a lot more smoke than normal. So if you like smoking very good. I think it's really good. The sides are awesome. Haven't tried the rift yet. But so far. And I like the vinegar based barbecue sauce. Where it's not super sugary and not the molasses base. So that was a big piece. It's about. There you go. I'm big of vinegar, but it's not too. All right. So that's going to be wrapped. Day one in Texas. You managed to do a podcast. Get a workout in. And eat some angel's barbecue. So Calvin's happy. We're all happy.
