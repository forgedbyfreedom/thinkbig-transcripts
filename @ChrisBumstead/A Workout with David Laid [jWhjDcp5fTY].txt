What is up YouTube? Boys are gonna beat the whole time. See if girls try to save lives. Anyways, boys are headed on a low road trip, going down to Miami, reliving some of the glory days here, we're going to a gym shark event, and these are like the first ever events I went to back in like 2018, when I sat in the front of the first big brand I ever really signed with. And they're coming down to Miami, so I'm like fuck it. If we can put up some of our manager's stuff right there, put them all to the there, we're gonna give boys some free energy drinks, all this stuff trying to get some exposure for the brand. And Mr. David Light is gonna be there. Ryan Terry is gonna be there, Phil, he's gonna be there, Chris Williams, and he's gonna be there. So I'm gonna get to meet up with all the moms and Dave Light in a long time. You guys know I love Mr. Light. Hopefully he can show me some magic tricks. That was like some of the OGU tube Dave's too, to some magic with David Light. I think that was LA. Jim Shark event we did. But we're driving down there just leaving now, so it's about a two hour drive. Gonna work out with David today. We're leaving a little bit early, but I was going to. And it's just kind of a grand old time or even old memory. So see you down there. I love Miami traffic. It's like the car for a way too long. My lower back is very sore and I'm tired. So it'd be slamming some free workout in the car. It's efficient my favorite flavor flavor. I've had anything we've ever made. Citrus Creek, the central pre-workout. Like a lot. He ate the label. I don't like the gold bonnet. I don't like metallic. So I'm probably going to get rid of that on the next run, but taste delicious in it work. So a lot of night is so. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. And you feel what being, that this next Jim Shark event happened in the past four or five years and nothing. I don't know. I'm excited. How was that fun at the? I don't know how many people have followed me for a long time. I've done that, but they've always been a lot of fun. For only time, we were in Australia. It was with Jim Shark. I thought to go surfing, do some cool shit. So now I don't have any obligations. I don't have to stand in line tracks. I'm on a time enough to do anything. I can just show up the day before. Leave what I want to do what I want. So. Even better. The good is. The question is, are we going to take a look at the picture? So picture. And the blue is pants. Do you? I think we have some modest regrets. I think we have some modest regrets. I haven't done any more. Probably shit. I think they're putting on your fras right? Like six months. They want me to have a seat. Try hard action over here. Then an ND filter. What do we shoot around the F-negative two? You're just gritting behind your little camera. Yeah, I got a fat unibround. I'm all bubbly and stuff. It looks like my parents came for their filming. Did I meet? Easy, we just met. No one saw that. I saw it. I have a good enough to. How heavy? Yeah. My boat was going so well. I hit like two-ten. I said, like, fuck it. I was eating like eight dandy pancakes a day. 75, 80, maybe 75. Are you actually only going to go up to 90? No, I'll go up to like 95. Okay, then we'll get a separate bench for him and then we'll have our like one-times. I can do 100. You can get that. I'm going to get some lighter in between. I'll get a look. It look, you gotta give my ligaments some mercy. So you might need to eventually resolve fusion a few extra reps. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. Oh, wow. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, shit. My man, I'm sorry. Hello, Calvin.
