Compared to a new 10th piece I'm going to have to go over the past few hours. How much all that really sucked in this? I don't know how that... that's crazy. It's always crazy because I'll be drinking seven-eight liters of water a day. And then all of a sudden, like, perfect timing, three days out. I said drying out so much. Even during seven weeks of water my mouth is dry. I could just need more water always. That's fine. My body just flushes it. Oh, let me go a quick run over there, dad. Yes, so we're just... like today's just lymphatic drainage again. We're trying to dry him out. So we're starting out these ankles. We're just gently gliding through, not a lot of pressure. And we're just pushing all the stuff up. And then we're getting into these thighs. And you're going to start to see this vascularity start to increase. As it absorbs and then we're using the guided PEMF from Electron Plus. So you activate those muscles. And that's what you're seeing as the muscle sort of quivers and shakes. It's just pumping it full of electrons so that it's pretty activated. And it's a really nice gentle way of getting treatment through the whole muscle tissue without digging too deep. That's the thing is we're only... What? Three days now? Two... three... three... three-ish, you know? We want to be very gentle to these muscles so that way. There's no inflammation but we're still draining them and go ahead flex. Yeah, and I mean they're drying up really nicely. So we'll kind of see more on the other side. So we'll light things a little weird. Let's go here. Let me get this plate. We're going to switch. The reason I'm switching the plate from side to side is it's pumping up this leg down through the lower back and then down through here. If I just have the plate here, the electrons just go up and down. This is going to get more of a full body flow or at least the lower body. So that way we get more current going. So right, vascularity isn't quite full and in yet. You can see a little bit but it's not surging up. And that's the goal to get that kind of pump in here again, especially for his next meal. And then I'll even do that for moral nerve too. Let's check out this for moral nerve. The more nerve comes kind of through the hip. This is a great way to treat the whole leg at once. Yeah, we're going to feel like. So the for moral nerve that supplies all the quads. It comes right over here over the hip flexors. So it's a really good way to get the entire thing at once. He probably feels it through his calves a little bit too, not too crazy. And we can do the same with the sciatic nerve on the back through the glutes. It's just kind of pumping the whole thing at once. The first thing we did is I couldn't stop laughing. I don't know if I can do that. I want to be on the machine. Three, four months. But yeah, you can start to see the pump really starts to come through. And it's a great way to kind of give him a passive pump without having to, you know, go lift a bunch of weights right now. And so even when he's not training, I'm still having his muscles get that flow. And yeah, now we can really see like from earlier, that was what those veins are already starting to click out. And that was sort of the approach that we were going to do this year to change it a bit because, you know, he has to beat himself each year. That's, he has to beat his previous self. So it's like, well, what are we changing? And this was sort of a technique, but his muscles have been recovering really great. His stamina has increased the muscle connection or the pumps. He has been telling me after these sessions, they get really, really nice and they fill out. Yeah, there's that. That's gorgeous pump there. She bring this back to us. She bring this back to us. She bring this back to us. So what did we did this before training back to remember of super depleted? Yeah, I didn't get a crazy pump, but I saw a pump, but my mind was the connection was like, and that's what that's what it was there for. And we can do another one because we're going to do a little bit on his, his a break-up, a plexus and arms because again, like, we don't need to shred through those. You know, we want to be nice to the bicep, right? Make sure we don't have to deal with anything there. So again, a really nice way to get into it. Well, how would you compare his body in this year as opposed to all the other previous years? I mean, from, from even just last year, there's, I don't feel any really not. Before there was like little granules that I could feel throughout the muscle tissue, there were tight points that were inhibiting him from getting a full muscle contraction, especially in the legs. This year, I mean, it's really just none. Information level is probably the minimal amount, and we were even talking about it. Like, he got a stem cell at one point and his body just flushed, and I've never felt someone's body changed so drastically. So there was definitely something to that stem cell. That was awesome. And we just, like, period of smooth glides. A lot of people asked me, like, how was it like to work on bodybuilders? And they're like, it must be so hard. And you know, like, and I was like, actually they're very squishy, and I like healthy, like all these muscles that are squishy, like that's how they're supposed to be. So he's feeling really good compared to the other years, and his, his contractions and muscle control is just absolutely wild. That's fun, but that vagus nerve goes down through that diaphragm, even down into the digestive tract a bit. And we can get these kind of break-up. All right, and all people are going to clip this. Yeah, every patient I treat with this there, they're always kind of half that gaggle. But yeah, we're so, that's what we're doing. We're just kind of checking each muscle group. And you can sure every fiber is doing what we wanted to do. That's interesting with this is you can see when someone's muscle is in firing. It won't fire. Like it'll actually be almost dead. And they're like, oh, and they can feel it, too, they'll, we'll be going through a section, and then it'll just stop. And then it'll slowly recharge. Because that's what, you know, each of these muscle fibers are like, little battery capacitors, and they run out of charge. I think that's really what creates a lot of knots. And so, within you can see every fiber is just firing very nicely. All the way through. What is up YouTube? Welcome to one sit. Another day in paradise. We're head to the gym. What? Something upstairs like that. I thought you just fired up. No. It just... I'll be right back. The room next to me dude. Wild. Like, party? No. It's like fucking going at it, dude. Nice. It was like this kind of door to you. You know what it was like? Oh fuck, that's it. I was like sick. All right. Anyways, one's day. We're head to the gym right now. A little bit later. Honies got the meeting with the open guys later. So, they all trained earlier. One of the gym now. We're going to be able to deep in some good kind of stay. I've had like, let's talk about them.

Just try to contract these machines you need. All right. When I'm like old and crippled, I get a picture of Poppy's head right here of my clothes. I don't want to attack from a little bit too much. I can just feel so like proud to have. You know, I can like feel the muscle fiber is like moving at the deep shit. I think it's not a good one. Nice. You know what I mean? That's why I'm not telling you to train with Poppy. You only want to win tens on the incline today. Because you can't help myself too. Oh yeah. You know, I said you get easy.

It's the delightful surprise! Alright so we wrapped up a very gentle workout. I'm hungry, so I'll try to buy some chicken. Just squeezing my back and putting the carbs on the meat into it. I got some nice rice and potato and chicken. I'll throw it away and get a meal. We're currently just saying sadly, honey told me no more coconut meat. I was already eating it. So the sad day eating it plain, but the potatoes make it taste better. So I'm going to eat this. I'm going to go home. I'm shaving my body. I'm a little hot head this year. I've started like random spots when I board one day. I'll do this arm and that arm. I got a clean shave everything. It takes like hours. Probably the worst part of prep. So I'll go home and do that and then... I think that's all I'm doing tonight. Literally. So let me go. I'm going to parents will come by and say how to them. We're better early. We'll get a skinny tomorrow and make way. I'll get huge. So I'll see you guys in the bill later. All right guys. Once in a... We'll tell him that 9 o'clock at night. 12 hours from now. We're stepping on the scale. Making sure I'm 6-1 again, 9-2-42. So it's all coming in tomorrow's day where it's just like it's hard and it's all getting super real because you're. Mean Greeks, you see all the asses, press conference, everything get her getting 10 and just game on. I start feeding, carving up everything. So it's about to get started and feeling... It's here feel different. I've even seen some people kind of notice that. I just feel a little bit more like present and calm this year. My energy is better. I feel healthier and just like good, you know. Whatever's coming. I know I did what I had to do and did the work and I'm going to get squat. And then I said I can do this point. So I'm just kind of rolling with the peaks and valleys as they come and you know just enjoy this. This is best I can this year. Trying to keep it light and have fun. Do what I do. It's about sage fuck shit up and enjoy every single moment. This truly is like an active practice to be present. And the moments come once a year. So I've read press conference every meet. They're all super fun and if you're like just worrying about the stage or worrying. Perfect carb load or perfect this or whatever you're worrying about. You're not in the moment and you're missing that opportunity. May never come again and may know when we come once a year. So just do my best to be present and enjoy it all. Practicing that and I'd five years of practice. So grateful for the many opportunities to keep doing better and better. You better version myself and better Mr. Olympia. So let's go on. Chilling tonight. Very tired. Started to shave. Shave it tomorrow. I'm going on. But yeah. So appreciate you guys. And guess what I'll show you guys. The way it is tomorrow.
