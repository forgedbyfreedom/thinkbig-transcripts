эпーム What is up YouTube? Just where we are. The blue anywhere behind me there is a foreign back in Dallas, Texas, was the fucking maniac himself. So it made me go get a hair transplant and he's stressing me out of the time. I'm going to show you what's happening. It's very true. But we're here back in Dallas, so we're going to get some more cuts in, be a real bodybuilder for a day or two. So I go back home and go back to trying to run a marathon. So putting some gold into the garden, putting some gold together, walking poppy, all like it's stuff. We're here, hoties here. These in town, these two in half, we say the Arnold. So I'm going to show them what real strength looks like. We're going to get after it, hit a little back work, I don't think I've done them back work yet since you want to be a. But I'm exhausted when I'm full again. So we're going to bring it back up, fix that torn light, getting the big juicy back and you have to do it. what you don't passion? You're lying there for eight hours and in ten days, so we're going to get that room soon, and then you should recognize that. But I mean, she's my tool for teaching her. But you're going to need to come in, but she's going to come on, but I know that. She says it falls out and then after she's muscled, it grows back. Yes, she's going to tell us now. Yeah, tell us now. What? It's going to be out of love. If I do 15 minutes of running, it's a cool little like an hour of walking on the channel, so why are you doing that now? You don't even do an hour of treadmill on the during the prep. That's no good. No, you don't have a rear 45 minutes. You have a two hours, you have a two hours, you have a two hours, you go where you're doing it out of 30. Yeah, but you need to be tournable for the day. Yeah, we're not at one time. Yeah, but you're going to work there with 50 minutes. Yeah, but you're not doing it now. Yeah. Why would you never do it until before the show? They're going to get the other meat. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Let me do it. Let me do it. This is why I'm running for one. You're going to do a big deal with me. Yeah, I do. Fuck you, I'm feeling good. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. He says you can be right on where you're being from. Yeah. That's it. What will you control? Again. There. You may be funny back there. Yeah. You're going to spin it? Yeah. I don't know. Easy. Just big. You're going to crack in? First time moving. Only when I have to press hot. Good. Good. Good. Good. I didn't know we were trained hard. But we were warming up. We're going to have to warm up. Yeah. You got to warm into the offseason. If I'm doing 60% training, 80% training will get me gains. He didn't even know what exactly he disagreed with me. I think I've barely been there honestly. I'm traveling so much. But it's good. You got your car? You know I've seen him. He's been working out. I know my limits. What? Yeah. 232. No, I'm not too fit. It's still bigger than this guy. Who me? Why? Could've met a breath? You know, not running. I hurt myself running. Did you? No. Maybe a little bit. I'm only running out of treadmill. What? He says you're getting lazy. Yeah. I was getting lazy my offseason. You're home, sir. You get why are you guys? I get lazy because I'm smart. I do one show here, no Arnold. So while he's doing the Arnold, I can just be lazy. Good. You really haven't been watching. I haven't. That's a little running, flag. What's that flag right there? Is that this? Oh. Hey. Good. What a good flag. It's a high school flag. Right now here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I wonder why? Whew. I'm out of shape. It's a rough life. So I can you for sure, let it. Yeah? You still get it in the GT3 RS, I think. I think you'll have fun, it's just okay. I need to do longer for this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. Yeah, I feel like it's working out. Yeah, that would be such. This is what it feels like to work out again. I've been in my net. Whew. I like to know how you like to get everybody head start. But can we close and go up? Who knew the head start? Or should I back a little bit when you come on? Hello? Yeah, I'm on. It's a four type of four. It's a four type of four. Back, it's four. Come on. Come on, Chris. That's it. Oh man. It's just like a swine of skinny. That's that. I got it. What? What? That's the sand, it's And what? That's what you are, it is Made of sand for you all over ladies again. What? Some snow sighs. What I've got. Oh man. No. Oh man. No. There he is, don't. Something fell on your head. Here it is again. It just me. Here it is. I just don't have the strength. I think like two months off. I'm going to be fucked up. They change it because we are the three people for us. Yeah. Yeah. Community keeps you young. You can't go. Uh-oh. We're reheating. Oh a man, he might have some worried notasts. Yeah we're gonna watch out. Has he had two bombs? 3D. Ah! 0.5. 4. 2. 3D. There you go. Ah! 3D. Good. Good. Go, go, go. 2. Good job. Come on, Eddie. Soar. You're right. I'm going to work as I'm going to work as I'm going to work. Good job. Last one. Good job. You've been at the one dead. Yeah. You're straight. 4th of a p-dix. 4th of a a-dix. Come on. Good. Go. You've been now. Yes. You're the last of a shakin' day. It's got a little bit of a big one. Up to jack. It's like saying please. Cool. Oh boy. Easy. It's work so far. You guys talk shit every year, but here I am. You know? All I hear is shit about the mic. My unorthodox message. But I pulled it together every year. Every single time he does do this, and it'll be like four weeks goes by. He'll just start wearing a bag of your clothes. And then after four weeks he does like a completely new person. Who's a method to my madness? It's like a cheetah. He goes back in the stands before he counts it. For the long winter or a bear hibernating, you know? You don't want to just stick some mud to clog up my rectum. When he starts to put in the juice, he's like, he's like a cheetah. He goes back in the stands before he counts it. For the long winter or a bear hibernating, you know? You don't want to just stick some mud to clog up my rectum. But it's worked so far every year. So, you know? So now we're going to go with some clondag bars, some ice cream sandwich protein. Let's try it myself. Ice cream sandwich protein. And get huge. That's right. I'll go home. Alright kids, then the work it was Mr. Howdy Japan and Mr. Honey Rumbad. How do you think I'm looking right now? Three weeks at the Arnold. Three weeks for the skated. 100%. Better off than that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big determinant. I think you think. I think you were better off than that. It's all the matters. Perception perspective, all that shit. Mine said it, everything. That's right. I think I'm good. It's it. But yeah, it was another good work at with his hobby and honey. So, it's nice to be trained like a robotty builder again rather than rehab specialist, try not to break myself. I felt good. I'm probably going to be broken tomorrow. Yeah. He's going to be super sore. And come over to you. He's applying to it with Cameron. I'm plugging in yet. We even need to. The soul has been so cold. No, I'm cold. If you plug in the plug, you'll come over. We'll come over tomorrow for the week film. Whatever we have to do tomorrow. But we're going to get some food. We're going to get some food. Maybe tonight. We're going to keep calm up. We'll pass the bed down. Because we're going to be going to crazy on night. We're placing our tools in the car. We're going to get them in trouble. But for this, we're going to fuck the boy. I want to be a dad soon. I'm getting ready to come out. You're like, if school's stupid anyway, just sleep in. We'll chill tomorrow. So I'll tell him how big he did. No, he actually likes school. So I'll probably be sad. But, yeah, we are going to keep him up late. So we got to get going. See you tomorrow. All right, what's going on? I'm still going to put an idiot right now. Each of you is a cowboy that I'm wearing. It's like a little earlier. But excited. Because we are launching. We've already launched a woman energy in each of you. She's going to be in all the crowd sexes. So we're in the healthy living sex right now. We're in the bridge as you can see right here. And we have an end cap over there in the corner. It's like a lot more stock than that's like a warm open open air area. But, but my energy in each of you in Texas. This is a fucking crazy grocery store. I'm not going to lie. They have everything that's healthy stuff. Organic stuff. Unhealthy stuff treats every protein bar. Protein drink, everything you can imagine. Probably the nicest between us. Most stocks. We're sure they're going to do so together in Texas. It's not by a couple of men's sheets. So we're here filming a little video. We're changing to be cowboys. So you have to see that coming soon. Why we're in Texas? Because the Chinese honey films the videos for this. And we're actually together one after this. That's easy to get as it should. So super pumped about it. Try to push you to the cross of America together. And see you on. Please grab it. Pull to your story. Or whatever you guys want, we're trying to get into the mainstream area. And very excited to be doing something. So, look at the whole. You drink now. Like how many seconds are going to get? I'm going to say a little bit. Alright, so we wrapped up our trippin Dallas really fast because we didn't want to stay traveling anymore than we ever have to. We're sure to come home Friday. We got everything done on the Wednesday. And we came home Wednesday night after that flew home. Got home at midnight. So happy to be home with me and traveling so much. And I keep fucking selling a broken record saying that. But we had a very productive time. We've had to film two videos and we're out there because we were launching in QT. Big gas station chain out in mainly around Oklahoma, Texas area. And then kind of branching out of monks there. And H.E.B. as well. One of the grocery stores out there. Honestly, an incredible grocery store. I think I said that in there. I'm still blown away by how crazy this up in the section was. I bought it much of a pre-opening chicken. Bar is just to try because we were in there. But you had a lot of stuff going on. It was good to train with honey and honey. They fucking just rose in the shed and me constantly. I take a little time off and it's like it never worked out a day in my life around those two. So, you know, love the banter that I was getting from that. But it was good to let a little fire in my ass. Get myself training a little more intense. You know, I wasn't a training phase where I was trying to create more stability. My body, a lot of the workouts I didn't even really show with me doing a lot of isometric holds. Really boring shit and stretches and mobility stuff that I'm just trying to not be super broken this year. So, getting back into getting strength now obviously pushing some serious weight. Again, so I got to get my legs up to fire. I've provided getting stronger but feels good to be doing a little bit less volume. I'm focusing a lot more on like, you know, some combat movements. But not like then chest of the oppressed, but I then I don't do like 10 flies after. So I'm less sore but my strength is building up a lot. So it's a kind of a fun phase of training where slowly you're really into. I'll be up didn't get more on what those training looks like. But it's kind of all that's been gone. You came back in Texas. We're chillin. Happy to be home. The house is coming together slowly but surely they turn the pool on today. So it's not going to be a cess pool of tadpoles and shit. So I've got to give you guys a house tour. We're going to have to organize it in a ready to rock. But that's I think that's really all the food up. So yeah, appreciate you guys for watching and I'll see you guys next time.
