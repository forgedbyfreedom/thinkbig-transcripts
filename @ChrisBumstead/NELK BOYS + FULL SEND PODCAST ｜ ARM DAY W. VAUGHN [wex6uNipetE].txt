Don't cut to the white chocolate. My cards can be good to see if I'm just broke. Jesus. I don't cut sugar. Yeah, Jack. My name is Brad. It's the one. This is bad, bro. This is so weird. This is bad. Why, let's just bring it inside my cookie. What does Brad have you? I do. What are you doing? I like the Jim Pro's second, like Brad, Aguio, anything. It's my vlog now. I think my vlog. This is the deal. If I don't get 100K subscribers by feeling beer, I have to wear a dress to them. I show. I don't want to do that. I'm going to do my channel. There's a little box. I'll just click that, okay? I want to get a follow you now. No, I'm going to do that too. I'm going to wait till after you won't be able to subscribe. I'll be so unfortunate. Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on, you're one in. Two, four, turn on the camera. Come on, you're one in. Come on. What's that? What is up? YouTube. Today's a good Saturday day. We were fun little. We went on tonight. We're doing it. I don't really know, but I'll surprise you guys when we get there. Or later on. But right now, a little bit less exciting. I'm fasting. Going to get blood work. Thank you, sure. I'm healthy. I don't even know how many weeks post won't be. It's like 16 weeks or maybe. I don't know. I'm going. But I've been mad at you. See you, Bob, for a while. Try to get healthy. I want to get my blood work right now. Making sure everyone's everything's on point. We're starting a proper off season. So we're going to revive. Get done. Then I have another doctor up in New York. I have that special to do. She will live on my blood work. I mean, so doing that, then we're going to like a food in the back and eat on the way to the gym. Go to the gym. Train with Mr. Bob Walker on the well-verchating maybe arms. Just took the last three days off because we do blood work. I think I just said it's the last one. But if you're training too hard and intense before blood work, you can excuse your results. Like, creatin levels. You're different blood markers and all this different things. So, best to take time off. I did that. So, three days off going to the gym train arms and then later today we're doing a podcast. So, stay tuned. I don't open up till the end. That's four of the three ones we'll have. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Back fist. Alright, blood work done. The up to a bunch of blood and now we're going to go work out. Exactly what you're not supposed to do. But like to live dangerously because rules are for losers. Let's go get huge. I was already a whole guy like had all the Michael Gurnes though. I mean, I mean, if it's good, can I get a little fake? Yeah, sure. What happened? You're talking about kissing dudes. Why you always get to bring up that weird chain? You're the one talking about it. You brought it up. I don't got a new one. You're talking about it. You're so chill. Yeah, Calvin is trying to kiss people. That's all it is. What did I do? Rest to that. You're taking four days off. What did I do? Let's go. Alright, so let's take our train in arms today. The Sir von Walker's going to be leading the workout today. We need to teach me how to get big arms. Just took a few days off. My arms were going to be sore. Fuck that my arms really hurt. Don't ask why. Don't take these off. No days off. You'll just hurt more. But arm day. We have like a watch. I watch it and I've a clock. I've got an hour and a half to train and I got to get to a lot of air tonight. So we're on through it. Why do everybody so soft today? What do you mean bro? We don't want to take an hour before the workout. Because you're talking to me to get here at 7. No, bro just wanted to stay hard. That's what I do with Corgi. We have to be somewhere at 6. I told her I'm going to be there at 5. And at the other way around time. I got another one to go. What do you want to say? Okay. Good. I'll be there in half a minute. I'll be there. I'm going to go in late. That's a nice shirt. Yeah. After I get here. What? Come on a minute. Though it's gotta agree with me is to go up Çao, I'm not sure if you can have a press conference with me. I'm feeling good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel great. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. What do you want to do? I want to push down or something. I have to go up here. Why? I have to go to the bottom. Why? Why? I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. Yeah. That's what we're doing. That's the game point. Rock the roll. You should really be a coach. Right? That's how I'm saying. We'll actually encounter. I'll drop on if you go to the middle of the field. I'll be a little bit. I'll be a little bit. I think I'm going to do it. I think we're going to have it a whole different set of things. It's like my version of what I'm stopping. I like to do this and then I'll put my thumb on it and it's bigger. I don't know what. So what you grab it like this? It's not, it's don't do it. Don't you have to take hold. It's just like, that's how you get big. That's what I'm telling you to do it. That's what I'm saying. That's just that. What? Sketch polish. Do you just do it? Yeah. Can you see the dirt? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got to get some other day. Of course. I see everything. That's a 10. And at least. Yeah. I'll show you a little bit. Oh yeah, I think I should get 10. There's why people are around.

You're welcome. And it's still like... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Never. Never too. You only lose if you quit, Bob. Never check out. All right. All right. You're welcome. Anyway, I'm going to speak French. Is this a scene? Sure. Yeah. Oh no, it's a scene. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what we do. Well, last time you got tried to bench you only did 225 pull a gate. He's not talking about that. That was three with. Yeah. Yeah. One point my next block was six play. My deadlift was seven play. And my bench was like three for one. Like my bench is so weak at the horrible. I don't know what. I just never do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's how I hold. Three play's over my body. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Fuck it up. Yeah. Well, midge d'airms. Yeah. No remorse. Yeah. I'm sure. Or just have a look at yourself. I'm just a shorter person than the general. You look at your shoulders. You're like, instead of like, straight up. It's a lie. It's a lie. We're going to do the grand opening. Sure. Two. No. That's rude. That's my block now. Okay. It's not breathing. I just didn't fucking set my T. That's your record. So, low-winded. Alright. Everyone go set up to the box channel. Yeah. So, this is the deal. I have to wear a dress to the match show. Not just any dress. I really don't want to do that. So, go to my channel. There's a little box. Set a subscribe. Just click that. It's not going to happen. I'm not going to let it happen. I think Dom's a pick-up dress. Okay. If he doesn't hit 100k subscribers, he has to wear a dress to the Olympia. Do it. But you have to pick the boy. You have to subscribe. You choose to. Where are you at? 165. And how long do you have to be on the field? Yeah. Well, let's do it. You better do it. I'll get a fucking shot. I'll dress with the gun on the ground. Bro, you should have one gun. I know. You got to be a mini dress to show up with that. You should do a high, like a high, wasted dress with a crop top. So you can show the belly top. We should give them a mini dress. We should give them a mini dress. We should give them a mini dress. We'll do it. Alright, see. We'll get a nice and made for you. Well, let's just hold that. You guys, I really don't want to look at it. I don't want to look at it. Come on. We're going to follow you now. No, I'm going to do that too. I'm going to wait till after you won't be able to subscribe. Imagine that. You're going to get his studs just blank. That would be so unfortunate. Yeah, jokes on you. Yeah, what's my life? I don't know what's going on. Come on. I'm going to shoot this. I might be the only two people who are working out actually seem to get chore. We're working out seem to get choreo. When you're in your health recovery phase, working out is a chore. Yeah, we're doing a plank. Well, yeah. We're joking or does that actually do a good nose joke? They call me old. Maybe. You proud of all of them. You're right at the terminology to me things. Like when you do a bunch of drugs, when you're tweaking, you should be like you can off free. Like 10 o'clock this morning when I took it and you guys didn't show up so 11 o'clock. You know? You don't know what about our current societies. That people do like, I feel like there's less of like a hardcore drug part in society. Reddance, so tweaking becomes a lot of like cute about taking like pre-workout. Or at the 4 East, if you want to use a bookbender and you need to sleep for a few nights in the tweaking. You have a few though? What? You have a few. That's a magic. Oh, yeah. It's a lot of time. You need to watch out. So like, you need to do something. Something like, you can just add or just like, almost like a peanut or a string or anything. You want to add a string or something? Yeah. So like, you still feel like you're sitting like that. That's so cool. Yeah. Yeah. That's not cool. You just say it. Did you just say it? Yeah. I'm down to do a like that with you, me and Brad, something. Feel like, but we should go to that barn, Jim. No AC. Just fucking devil. I mean, it's getting bad enough in here. Like, I feel like there's no air back there. It's like a fucking sauna. I can't keep. I can't keep. I can't keep. I can't keep. I can't keep. I can't keep. It's just, see, like, I took my shirt and I just were running in. It was like, that's that place, right? Yeah. But like once you get you, you feel fucking yours. I'm sure you have a great cocktail. That'd be a good video. This time, I got a little bit of that. You don't throw a lot of it on, man. Who's got it? You got it, Dad. You got it, Dad. You got it, Dad. You got it, Dad. You got it with destiny. Who's destiny? For a total of 20 rubbers. It's like a coin. So the date is destiny. Alright, you know what we do? Alright, so we made them to Fort Laudale, the Duna Podcasts. I don't know why I always pretend in these videos like you guys aren't going to know what I'm doing based off the thumbnail that I clearly can't know what I'm doing. But we're Duna Podcasts with another voice. And I'm honestly pretty fired up better. I watched them for a long time when I was young. I got their beauties, fellow Canadians, and they are killing the game, funny, work hard, play hard, and they kill them on the content game. So super pumped to do this, all of they want to be on the podcast. We're going to get out there and see how it goes. So, let's do it. I'm going to try a little bit more. Let's go around. Okay. Oh yeah, for misogging. This is a saga. So, don't we get them off from? Me, Kyle, Stanislaw. I won't try to draw them off from here. Misogging. Yeah, yeah. It's not that kind of thing. It's slow. Yeah, it's slow. What about me? Let's go on. Let's see. What do you want? Why this one? Don't tell me. I have to go on you. They meet you in this way too though. Tell me. You look like a man from the park. What about that part like I don't have? Oh shit. Yeah. See, are you a park? Yeah. It's like, what you want to do? It's the way you draw. That's cool. A lot of work in the water. Yeah. You think it's from Sawyer? Yeah. That's great. Yeah, we catch them from Sawyer. What was that part we were doing called? In the college. A lot of work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I was going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. What do you want to do? Right. I'll do it. Yeah. Let's go. I'm going to do it. Oh, I get a straight way. Wait, wait. You know, yeah. That's how we start this. Yeah. I'm going to do full-circuit. Yeah. Nice little shot. What do you want me? My jam. Can you see? I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. You're that side chest. Oh, yeah. Pretty little. Yeah. Down, like, people's like, how? What? What? What? What? What? Are you taking one? No. What? What? What about it? You're taking one? What about it? You're taking one? What about it? I'm in the origin. It was mainly business. I got it. But it was, yeah. It was like three years of your foolish shutdown. The Jim was the Jim with that. Yeah. And then you went to those extra. We were in the basement. I was having a problem. It would be a working on some kind of basement. It was like cable rat machine. So, like in some number of one. That's actually a crazy thing. Yeah. So, what? Yeah. Tell us about that. Like co-pets. And then, sure. For the students first, what do you have to do? That's for a little while I'm holding it. Oh, proper. I've got to be a swimmer. It's a bit of a... My fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking. Don't cut to the watch, I'm going to do this. My call to the sea fums for a couple of days. Jesus. We're a trash crack. est What are you doing? What are you doing? You've been listening to me for a while. Why do I let those things out of the picture? What does Brad have you? I do. What did you do when I like the Jim Pro-Secret? Brad have you anything? It's totally. You can't. But I mean, like the lifting thing? Like everything like that? I honestly think it's a beer, but probably all over the place. Why are you doing it on the streets? What? It's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very. How do you guys find that? I'm not here. It's like, probably the guy in the street. I don't like all the more things out of the way here. Bro, what are you talking about? I'm not going to say another. Just a second shit with Brad here. I thought I'd talk a lot about it. Wait, hold on. What about the old strong stand with the adrenaline, like Dick Holder, or something? Yes. He did talk about it. What's that? What's that? What do you think he did in fucking good? Alright, let's give me a wrap on today's video. Healthy blood work, check your blood work, be healthy, good work out with Vaughn. Arms are getting huge and a podcast with another voice. My first kind of podcast outside of the typical stream, or even content done with something outside of the fitness industry. And like I said, it was super cool and like an honor for me to do something like that because some of their people I've watched for a while from what I was young. And they're obviously super big, killing the game, doing a really cool shit in their space in the industry. Yeah, they're killing the game in all aspects. So it was an honor to be on the podcast thinking what's super well. Whenever it comes, that'll be posting on my Instagram, talking to me to whatever and giving you guys a link. So you guys can check it out. If I'm good conversation up there, so it was fun. But shout out to the North Boys, appreciate them having me on. And that's it. Thank you for watching. Catch you guys from next one.
