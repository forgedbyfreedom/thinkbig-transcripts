Thats what we call a racing<|bn|> lamppuccero kidney. I am going to start the不le gotusil. Silence. Then. Thats the move. What's clean? Listen and set your breath by jumping out Pretty cool. We almost jumped with five plates. How's the gym remind you of? It has to be a bottle. 6-3 left. 7-5 finished combined with what Calvin said. So sure that's nick de Neda. 6-1-3 not a bottle. I think a hotty training. It's good. So that no high train my whole life at the end. So I always train like an open body for there. I'm training for the open as always. But it's training with someone like Hottie, mind's of training at the end. Someone who's strong isn't me. So they're actually doing the same way to stop more. We're the same way in front of us while I do that. So I really push it to you to be stronger. And not just be like a skinny bitch. Like, you know, it's like some people like to be. So it's been good training for some of the things. I know it really is how hard you push it. Oh, each train is fucking hard. You don't follow it, man. Or for the attention, he's strong. This is a big win. You know? Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. So you didn't understand what you said. Angle of this machine. This is an older, leg-trespassing. It has a very steep angle. So it's naturally much easier. It's like the same. It's like the same. The same. It's like the same. It's like the same. So you didn't understand what you said. The angle of this machine. This is an older leg-trespassing. It has a very steep angle. It's naturally much heavier than a regular leg-trespassing that has not such a steep angle. So therefore, when you start to fatigue, it ends up becoming just absolutely much much heavier than normal. Because you have a very steep angle. It's just a bit more gravity. There's more weight pushing down instead of on the machines. Yeah. Go just like crushing through. So it's the skinny bit's character. The anti-s skinny bit. That's right. That's right. That's good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Where's Andre? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Good to get Andre trading and how to. That's it. Yeah? That's it. You get nothing to say anything. First you make a bottoming of the legage again, I'm just saying now, just physically just call me a little baby. Kinding the cheeks. That's right. Just seeing, I don't even know the word. I'm not a skill-editoring this word yet. There it up. Yeah, about for sure, honey. Say, can you one more way? No. No. No, it's good. No, it's just making fun of you. That's good. Not so. Fine games. I need to go back to trading with other classic pretty competitors. Here you go. This is the last time I did just eat it, right? Was that the last time? Was that the last time I did just try to turn it up someone? Was there a risk? What's your head? Oh, it's in, yeah. What you're gonna say? What was the last time you trained with an open guy besides eating it? Besides eating? Yeah. Nick Walker in 2021. What was that? Right? Yeah, I chose Brett Wilkins. Go ahead. How was that? He was like, coming off of show. So it wasn't, he was like, he wasn't that full intensity, but he was so good. Turning it was in his leghawty, he's just fucking strong in the belly. He keeps going. So how did he just demoralize his leghawty? Yeah. I mean, he does that do sometimes. That's why I'm strong, I should like, be eating, training from like, party or whole life. You know, like, he was always talking like, he's strong. Yeah, so you hadn't tried to keep you. Yeah, I did, but keep up. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Woo. Good job. Good job. Good job. Yeah, look a lot. He sometimes. Guys on his shoulder come back. Get that? Look at that, let's go. Yeah, I think that listen, in job, mark my class. You know, I've got a shoe. I've got a shoe there.
