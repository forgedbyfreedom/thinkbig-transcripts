I'm just, I like, this was not enjoyable. Like, the amazing service, but like, he was a fucking maniac. I was literally like this the whole time he would like to. No, no, no. He would let everyone listen to me. He would let everyone speed up and he purposely wanted to be in the back. So he could just fucking floor his arm. He could just don't want his arm. Do you want to do it? Do you want to do it? Do you want to do it? What are those drags? Drag turns. He's doing flung drag turns. I'm like, I'm not okay. I don't know how I'm like, Courtney is freaking out. I didn't tell. I'm so, yeah. I'm gonna walk away from this situation. I was literally like, trying to make him go fast. I was like, I really thought so when he was like, It's a fucking, I literally went to a disappeared condition. I just like, was crawling and now it's boring to touch up. I was like, how intense and like, like, how did he go? Well, yeah. And then he said, I'm doing it. And then my husband follows suit. Of course. So then it's like, yeah, you know? Just what's to do with the person in front of you is. Yeah. Mom and G didn't play it until then once. Actually, mom, she's a beast. Nope, not me. Calvin's the best driver. That's what I can say. Seriously. Try to pick up that. I'm not going to look at that. Like he will take you for a fucking ride. Courtney, did you film the whole thing? Rose screaming. I can't get some good guys. Yeah, I filmed it. So enjoy. I gotta retry that. He's a piece of education. Pick one on the middle thing. Try again. That's awesome. Man. Give us a lesson. You go. You go. I gotta walk back up this. You already get it. Can't even breathe. I know. I can't snow. It's easy. It just doesn't really feel like it. I think I need to do right side down. It literally just just stay on the way. If you just waxed it. I don't think it's going to make a difference. Just keep your balance. That's all you see. Okay. That's it. Okay. Well let's go. It's good. Try coming up now. Try not to play. I'll come this fast. You'll pass for now. I'm not going to. I'm not going to. I'm not going to. I'm not going to. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's broken. This is miserable. I'd rather get a full ride out of it. Is that a body boy? Wow. That was so fun. You did it. Of course. It's in America. It's just a place in Arizona. I think it says sit down. I'm going to take a break. Okay. I'll just go over there. That the people have like insane ways of these. Yeah. Somebody goes to it. There's something you tell too. Oh, it's you, Tom. It is you, Tom. They have the huge flags on them. Yeah. Dude. It's crazy. They're expensive. It seems like all done. I'll put 100 grams. What? I'm not. I got it. I got it. I got it. All right. Alright, so it's a wrap on Doom like we should buy it. Or when you just like to scream, I heard you at the whole time. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I've pretended like I can hear and I'm just boring. But she knows why. She needs to be pushed through that a little bit. But honestly, there was a lot of fun if you guys are ever in the Dubai area. You get the shot, do we have a lot of fun? But now we're going to go chill by the pool for a laks, hang out, dinner and night and then... Do you? I maybe workout. We'll see. I should probably workout. We definitely want tomorrow for golfing. Yep. So, yeah, see you guys there. Alright, so we're taking a little ride to the gym right now. I don't even know if I'll have to film that, but we're going to figure out. If I can't film them, I'm seeing the puzzle type. The hell do I film for this? But I believe in a whole iPhone, I've been able to film this whole plot. Yep, it can't be the nice button, but in a little tour on the way to the gym, on the views of this beautiful resort. So, I really can't complain about that life right now. But that's pretty sweet. I feel this hotel has one fucking pile of the gym and it's like a literal real gym. It's like a dream garage, essentially. But I got a really good chess bucket in yesterday. Today, I'm pretty fucking dead. We're in the sun all day. By the pool, red, noon, but Easter. So, just trying to get it in. It's not getting any of an even lot of food. So, it only means you'll lose weight. So, I'm trying to get whatever work I'm thinking on the street. And then we'll go back home to the garage. So, it's what we can do. Maybe that's what we should be slamming weights in this gym. Drop in the weights, match the perfect with the drop beat of the drop. Do we get copyright with this? I don't know what they're. They're custom DJs. Shoot here. I'm so tight that burns. Drop set. Drops is a good best friend. I'm vacation work ethic. Of course, you work a little harder. And then I'll have a lot of machines up with your work. I can never get used to kilograms. I might even go that way. My favorite is when people from Europe watch my videos. And I'll press like $100.0. And do like those kilograms. Like bro. Maybe a 220 pounds. Oh, we got a vacation. I'm going to do a vacation. Wow. So, you've nice time here thinking of that. I'm going to get burnt. I don't burn. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. All right. Last exercise. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt.
