Yeah, okay. Let me say something to you as a friend. You suck. Kill your mom. Four. Come on. Come on Chris. Come on. Two. Four. Two. Come on. Come on. Two by day three. We're golfing. This is fucking insanely beautiful course. If you have no me, which you don't, I can't golf or shit. I can't even the ball through it. I can barely even hit the ball. You guys saw my snapchat stories. I'm miserable. I'm kidding. I'm just going to meet a pretty much a day of laughing at Chris. I've never the worst at something that I hate being the worst. But today I think I may get behind the turn of the golf. So wish you luck. You didn't say what's up. It's in your blood. What is up? You two. She added that at the beginning. Oh, Chris was really on it. I don't perform well on the camera. I don't know. Need some of that sand? Wait. Is this the first time you're using a tee? No, you used a lot of sand. Oh, did you? You like it? Thanks, sir. I don't want to throw a thousand, sir. I'm so glad. I'm so glad. I'm glad. You know how the plight would drive? Sorry, so we're trying to golf. Oh, damn. The girl they're putting us this shame right now. I've lost six balls so far. To the point where we've done the best ball. We've done with the football. My camera driving. Every time I hit on a driver, we've had three or four people pass it when it works. I think it's four with four people pass it. It's even playing for almost four hours and we haven't even done nine holes yet. So, they're native us, but. It's a little rough. I've had like four good shots. I think my putting fin decent. I shouldn't have said that to my jinx. But, you know, it's good time to maybe I'll get better at this. We do look in Florida. So, I got to go out. I got to go out. I got to go out. I got to go out. I got to go out. I got to go out. I got to go out. Maybe. John Daley. I don't really get one. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm right. I'm right. I'm trying my best. Oh my god. Look at my golf cart. I'm not looking at it. The punch you do there. Yeah. The punch you. The fuck you got stuck. You got stuck? Yes. You'll see the side of you in this truck. It does. No. I better go in there. So. Okay. I need to be the camera. You missed the last shot that I fucking hit right here. Real dead. If you get this, you can help it. Taking a mulligan on that shot. Fuck. This is so thick. That's pretty deep. It's bushy. You're going along with the fucking grass. It came as well. Very good. Very good. Sure. That's a good wood. Oh, the direction. There you go, sir. Yep. It's my catty. I'll be your catty any day. How fast I was fucking doing? Very fast. Oh, yeah. Woo! Oh, yeah. You're a sailor. Good. Still saying this is a good. And it's not pretty all crisp. That would have been it. That was actually pretty good. Putting master. You know, didn't go in. I played more mini-pud than I hit it, golfering. So. I think that's it. Oh, that went. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Alright, man. A super eye. Can't see. It was on the green. Almost in the hole. Eagle. What? I have no idea what the fuck that went. I just don't know the other two. I'm going to drop. It's on down. It's all very long. It's a fertilizer. It's fertilizer? It's. It's sand and fertilized down. Is it actually? Yeah, they just call it sand. Oh. It's so the grass grows back. Five. Five on your nose. Well, normally I don't hit it that good. You but you still have to pretend like you're going to hit it good. You don't plan to hit it like shit. Why? You say hit it like shit. The bus is in the last three balls. Yes. This is what I call a day. What I run out of fucking 12 balls. Okay. Three were court. I only have two left. So only a pack. I don't know. Actually, last six. I feel like my thread over that hill, but I just don't feel like going on with for it. Yeah, two. It's going to just fire. If you get it up that hill, it will not over. Oh, yes. Sorry. I was killed your mom. I'm not. That's not looking at the home. You're good. I'm good too. Four. Now you're good. That's not real. What? We're in a simulation. That airplane is not real. We're flying gravity. There's so much at MPCs. I don't understand. Do you understand? Oh, I don't understand. It's a big one. It's a big one. Right. Oh. See how big that is? I ain't over here. Oh, no. Hey. Hold on. Hold on. Hold and watch. The champ. Your first. Your first champ. Pull and watch. You did a hole in one. Wow. You did a hole in one. Wow. You did a hole in one. Wow. You got under it. Take a little more dirt. You're calving your shank in this bitch. And I'm putting like sock now. On the other side. Something on the side. The walkway. Really? Yeah. Take a little bit of dirt. We were my other shot with. Aww. A little lessy boy. You're gonna get good grip. Good grip. No. It's good. You want a grip? That's good. That's good. Well, that's it for Dubai. A beautiful trip. Beautiful city. It's places like the fucking future kind of. It's very clean. Very good people. It's good time. Good food. All the stuff. We are now headed to India. We're very drastically different things. Honestly, I'm more excited for India. Because it's going to be. It's going to be. It's going to be. It's going to be.

It's going to actually be a cool trip. It's similar to America here, but nicer and newer, but it's going to be like a different world. So I can have more of a more if I've got a lot of love from India online. So it's a super head city's country. I also wish for their long enough. I could see more of it. Travel with the north. Everything but. Even next time. So off we go. I'm going to go to the beach. I made a tinder right around. Late night, I don't know what's going to happen.
