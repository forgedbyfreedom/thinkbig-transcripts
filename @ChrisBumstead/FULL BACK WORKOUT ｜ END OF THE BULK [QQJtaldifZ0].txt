No, not crossfit for lunch, right? I mean, didn't you tell you that you want to switch your head? Yes. I don't know if I'm doing after snowboarding championship and everything else you've been working on. Is that it again starting to skateboarding during the program? There you go. Wrap you in bubble wrap. Can you help him in on you and wrap your whole body in the whole wrap? It's still her muscle. So I know I look like 271 last night after dinner. I'm not gonna be able to do very many of these. I know. I look 268 right now. Well, no. She drank water if I got close to 27. It's still see how you do it. Hey, crossroads. You got something you need to want. I need to use one. I need one. I got three. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Not bad actually. I feel like you were going to do it. I thought you'd do like three. I feel like I was three because. Well, you look like your roles. 271. Well, you are. You said that. Prime director. Because I'm going to have to try to make a topical diuretic for your face. That was my prime director for your. You made it your wife. You made it your wife. But I'm waiting without fucking these going. I think great. My book. My book. I got to run. Rub a little bit of topical fat burn around your face. Yeah. You're okay. Wow. He's 22% body fat. But it's basically like six months out. People love skinny face. You're so lucky. You have another spot. Is your other spot you can do without hitting your head on that thing? That part. Maybe this part right? That won't fit this way right? Is that true? That's true. I know I just pull on the leaf. You can try. It's just the grip. It's really smooth. You're not going to have it on. You can get up my grip string. No. No. Hook grip. It's good. Good. Nice cross, cross, cross. There you go. Good. Much better. Yeah. Archback. Archback. Good. And then we need help to straighten out your leg a little bit when you start eating a little help. You want to. Well, well. Good. Good. And that's how you spun. Well, it's not because normally that's too wide, but because of how wide you are, it actually is probably right where you need to be. So what we'll do is we're going to start doing those on the beginning of your business. Sorry. I honestly didn't think you were able to do that many. Because that just how heavy you are. So the heavy is still. Every time you see me, I've been feeling the lift. You're like, oh, he's the press. Thank you for your help. Or yeah, when you're in other hands. Well, no. I forget that you actually used to be an open body, but there's. There's another. I'm sick of it. I never opened. You had it when you're so hard as an oval, aren't you? I didn't win over all. That was the only one in your fifth place going to pro-card. Just a rotary gives me. I've never been able to do that before. I've never been able to do that before. I've never been able to do that before. You never competed. You know, open? Yeah. No. Until this year. It's a secret. You know, a new boy when you were not here. He was like, three hundred pounds. I just stopped 30 pounds. He did a water. He did a water. No, I don't know. The fact that he texted me and said, I feel like I'm too good of a shape. So I'm going to make sure become a fat paid by the time you get here. I did say that. Did you say that? What's nice? What we'll do is let's do a row. Start getting into that reverse grip. That's stuff that we were working on last year. Try it out. They can up that back a little lat. So let's do a reverse grip then over row. Just make sure. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Control or combat control. Control. Control. Control. Control. Control. Control. Good. Control. That's it. I'm going to just get rid of the other one. That's it. And last year. Good. Good. Control. Good. Good. Good. Control. Control. Yeah. You might go a little bit wider and let's just add a 25-gram. I'm going to go straight into the plate. I was going to do two things. I started leaning forward a little bit further though. Instead of pulling, you're going to do it again. I come here. Pull a little further from my body. Some weaker obviously, but it's better contracting. Yeah. That's okay. So you're just going to make sure you stay up. Especially if it's a heavy weight. Before I was doing that wasn't doing straight legs. And I couldn't do it. I couldn't rope bent over. I didn't have the stability. And I said straight legs and then all of a sudden rolling. You can go away. When did you stop doing straight legs? When I was traveling all that much? Oh, God. Take my purse. You can fall off the roll. Good. And the air is just two. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Four. Five. Four. Four. Five. Done. Good job. Five. Five. Five. Good. But I look back a little tax from yesterday like that. Yeah. Well, normally I wouldn't want you to do that after legs, but because we're going to concentrate on those machines and the, I mean, the, those workouts. It made sense this time. I normally do legs a day before. When we did chest, yeah. But I had just done hand strength. Did it before that? Yeah, it's better to do either chest or shoulders in between. We're about, um, overhand. How do you feel about just keeping it in this weight? And then going into an overhand, I feel better about it. Sure. Okay. Let's do that because I still want to make a couple of my surgery now. I don't know if that's actually, this dream. My butt, my butt, my back, that felt a bigger butt. Oops. Let's go, Christopher. Let's go. Good. Bring the elbows back a little further. I was back a little further. I was back a little further. That's it. Back. Good. Good. Good contraction. Excellent. Much better. Much better. Good. Stretching. Good. Good. Good job. Good job. So when you're going early in the set, you started to bring your elbows out this way. And then the minute you start bringing your elbows in, you can see it when much of the stretcher going on. But I agree. Where are you saying coming fromverted, but you still purposely, for more like trap up her back. Just trying to think that you feel that in. Yeah, but we'll do track enough for back when we do track enough for back. I don't know if we normally, this is easy to track enough. But the rest of my workout, tomorrow, that's okay. I want to pick up those last. Those elbows in. Throw the weight. Throw the weight. Come on, Chris. Come on. That was easy. You're going to ask me, is this back good? You throw it, you throw it. You throw it. Good. Good. You want to walk two more. One more. One more. Get this. You're broken, don't do that. You're fine. Spine. Oh, this bad. Oh, this is broken. I broke my back. What's that mean? I don't know. Can I take some bridges back or something? No. No. No. No. No. No. This is something like that. Get ready. No, it's some of that movie. Long to serve. I think I broke it in my back. This is no one's pulling it. Yeah. Just put that back on. Mostly just all together. Would you been doing on your, because you've been traveling on a ship? I've been traveling recently. Well, I mean, for the last time, you've used your having before that. You've been traveling once. So we're in the back for six weeks. How do you think I'm so fucking jacked or how does it work? This is jacked? Yeah. So I've even just doing all of the upper back with my back. I'm doing mid and upper. Come on in and then I have two days of doing two lap. Really lap focus exercise. Okay. So I've even, always the last time you did when I'm going to my garage. I don't know. I've only two are chest supported. Okay. So let's do that. So that your old bleak stomach again. So. The bleak? See your bleaks? Yeah. But that's, I do that. I either do bent over by the way or that, because the way I pull the very somewhere. Now that's going to be a pull higher for a breath. But that's what I'm saying. I normally do barbell high for upper or dumbbell high for upper. Not low. What? We're going to do both. We're going to do one upper and lower. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good stretch. In pull. Excellent stretch. Pull. Good. Good. Good. Try. Like good. You go ahead. You go ahead. You go ahead. You're actually a lot of look at that. Stronger than you look at. That's usually the goal. I try to walk around looking to see me as possible. Right out here. They make it harder. You can do it. You can do it. Up and hold it. There you go. Come on. Pause it, pause. Good. Just a little longer. Good. You can do that for a bit. Hold. Good. Right there. You can drop that shit on my feet. You go ahead. You go ahead. You go ahead. Good. Good. You can do it. You can do it. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Three. Two. That's it. That's it. Just like it around. Try to do it. Try to do it. That's it. Nah. In that mirror. Oh, it's got to be cool. I'm very too. What do you do? It's himself. And that's. So, imagine now how you've had the problems with hearing? Oh, I thought you're going to say my toxic sarcasm. They're both. Yes. After sure it is, I don't have to ask about that one. For last one. Two. Two. Two. Classic guy. I've been doing this. That's pretty accurate. Yeah. Just a little longer. No. That's not good. That's good. It's not good. It's not good. That's not good. That's not good. It's not good. It's not good. I'll take that. I'll never do that. No, I'll take that. Hold that. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold that. Five seconds. Hold it. Good job. Good. I'll turn my leg from zoom in. You want to throw last friend? Yeah. Is that when you're seven hundred pound dead? Yes. You want to throw last friend? Yeah. Is that when you're seven hundred pound dead? Yes. You're a drug. It's something that I think is a mouth. You can. That's always. When you get the sign by dice, yeah. I knew you were going to say something like that. I had to. Because it's like there's going to be like a lead in somewhere. There's going to be a shitty joke somewhere. Mine are less shit. Maybe so, but less shit. You've got 20 cents. Okay. Let me ask you this. I'm going to override your shit. What's that? Well, we got an out of builder. We do a lot of, let's put an out of cold down. And then maybe we'll put any drop with a straight farm pull down to have to get her in. Or an F.S.E. seven, straight up, pull down there. Pull down a pull over. Hold over. Hold down. Pull over. Why do you pull over on the chance? I'll pull down. That's great. No, straight on pull down this. I'll pull over. Hold over. Hold over. Tom at the low, if the pull down or pull over. Take Chris is ready to pull over. Chris is always right. True. Come on. You see I got swinging at the very end. What's your last thing? You can take your nerve. Just like that. That's how you pull all the way through. The very unique high row. Is that how you pull in like this? I think I would hear and feel so much better. Yeah, and also the best thing about it is that with the pedonic of Indian actually there's change up the angle slightly. So just changing a little bit of that supination of the wrist can cause a lot better if you track it. Good. Good eight eight good. One. Cool Chris. Good two. Arch arch. Great. Good. Cool. Good. Cool. Yes. Cool. Yes. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Yes. Cool. Cool. Cool. Yes. Cool. Arch arch arch. Good. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Let's keep the weight the same. Let's change up the angle. What I want to do is you're going to feel a little bit of a variation. Can it feel for that? Feel a difference in your position? Yeah. Yes. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. There we go. Good. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Excellent. Keep going. Keep going. Good. Good. Good. It's like you're on stage. So I can demonstrate your pressure straight. Cool. That's it. Two more. One more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Two more. One more. That's it. Good. Don't doubt. Probably a good one. It's all about the curve. Good. Good. Good. Just get it about three more. Last one. One. Nice stretch. Good. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. You ready to wait? Yeah? No. Come on. Put in this shit. You're special, fine. Oh, it's... come on. Good. Stretch. Stretch. Stretch. Okay. Three. Three. Three. One. You going to keep on going. Good. Good. Stretch it forward. Good. Go away. Go away. Go away. Go. Okay, when you go up, march her back a little. Keep your chest down, but arch her back. Look at that. Go back to your mouth. Go back to your mouth. Go back to your mouth. Go back to your mouth. Go back to your mouth. Cool. So what that means is, as you're coming here, pull, and then when you're going here stretch, but make sure you get your chest up a little bit and stretch. You're still going to arch my mouth with hopefully much. I just want you to arch her back. But don't let your chest go. Don't link me up too high. Good piece. Lift weight is all I know. I take high kick up. I put down. Now he's losing his brain cells on top of his hearing. Is that mold? I don't get a better tooth. I actually probably argue better. I should have some serious brain fuck for what. I mean, you were literally like, had such a histamine reaction that you were just constantly like, nose was all fled to eyes were watery. You travel, you get better, you go home and you're like, oh my god. No, it sounds a lot better. Take your body. Publish your sleep, pubbery. That's good. Good. Good job with you in your back arch. Good. Good. Keep arching. Good. Good job. Good job. One more second. Good job. There you go. That's the stretch. Stretch. Stretch. That's the big back on stage. Let's go. Big back on stage. Let's go. Good. Two, two, two. Stretch. One more. Two people. Good job. Excellent. Let's see some hypers. Get the lower back first. I love back like, pump full of blood. You're like, let's work on the lower back. We're going to just go to do the hypers, brother. Do about three sets of hypers, both of the hypers. Finish that off. How's it feel? Good. Good. You know I do a lower back yesterday on my hands. You're doing it. That's what I was just doing. So would you have a... I personally mentioned girls on it. Okay, we're looking around. Come on, Kevin. Good. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. I need like a six-edron pound deadless for the lumpy. I need it. I'll boost my ego. I kick up, I could die. I'll need to throw a little. I kick up, I put down. That's it. How's it feel? Did you kick it out? No. Just a little back. It's going to be pumped. What? It's going to be pumped. It's like knowing your spine's really over arch-orthkranific. Yeah, she's good at it. Stretch it a little bit and it's just not meant to be stretched. Stretch it a little. Stretch it a little. You got to take it. That's it. Stretch it a little. Stretch it a little. I just mixed some fucking intro with protein. I don't know who did it, but someone mixed it on flavored intro with flavored intro. And then I'm drinking like lemon lime cookies and cream protein. That's fucking disgusting. That's not good at all. Why don't you make some new one? It's a lot of good. It wasn't like five seconds ago. I didn't want to waste it. It's disgusting. I don't like it when the company I can just get on the track. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I want to try this. I tried it and it wasn't good. And now I'm just getting the dark of the need it. It looks like sewage. Because you're cream. Because you're cream lemon lime. Why do you like it? Yeah, I'll try it. Okay. For you or me? Me? My battery's flashing. So you got to know. Three, two, one, go. Battery's flashing? Yeah. Okay. So he's toast. No, no, I thought you was floating on you. So he's going, I'll go. You can go. All right, guys. Got to end day three. We just got done doing an amazing back workout because we were able to get in mind muscle connection because it's all about time and attention in mind muscle connection and not just growing around heavy stupid way. So you got to be really well. It's going to be really smart about your training. How do you feel? Good. Form and then in terms of being. That's right. Perfect form then you can add to the. Yeah, then you can add away as you're able to get stronger instead of just trying to do it all backwards. You go heavy. Your form swallowing apart. You're getting more likely to get hurt and you're not going to be able to grow. So all you're trying to do now is assess or crisis that for this prep. And I think we need a really good job because you're in a good spot. Yeah, I feel good. A lot stronger and bigger than I have lived last year when in the prep. This is a good point. You came down about 16 we said last year. Yep. We started working. We've been working with it. Yeah, for 16. So much better than last year. Yeah. Your heavier, your leaner, your stronger. And I feel like it's a really good starting point. Yeah. Really rock our own. Yeah. So now it's not. What's that? Next up. Now it's about the max bed list because Calvin says it's about not. I just need a 600 pound. So we're looking for a new video. We're looking for a new video for Calvin's going to be injured reserve. We're actually killing him.
