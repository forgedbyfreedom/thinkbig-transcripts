Got back Sunday so I got three days to recover and Generation hours and you time for filming some stuff Wrap you some stuff up. Got a bunch of meetings for around kind of going over a lot of things coming forward Log itself turns people into a bunch of appointments and then I leave for Italy on Thursday So a lot going on I'm trying to get a few good workouts and right now trying to get as many meals as I can I'm a kitchen. I actually got me a prep in Italy Courtney found out I'm up there. She found some mill prep company that will ship to meet everywhere I go in Italy because we're on like five different cities Hopefully I don't get too skinny while we're there. They probably don't have gems in city We're going to the club. I'll be fucking rocky about all those and pull ups and push up to somewhere in the ship Do what I can other than that Fucking what you know feel a little bit overwhelmed the speaking travelers so much and nothing home And knowing that my priority the body is what I have to do and be home body myself and being anxious around like Too much travel so much going on not having stretch here. I'm kind of pushing myself my comfort zone But I'm trying to roll with life right now. I'll get things I'm doing and I come back be able to chill for a while And hope somebody to focus on so to enjoy it Best again and get huge in the process. So good train Chester that thing I did like that night and I can't walk. I'm literally going to bring around hopping Going to train like the rest eight days right now and I'm not building up the tolerance trip There's this to roll it every time I train them so pretty broken right now. It's gonna go to chest there Maybe a little chance I've been to the good thing arms have a beautiful day Only push these take one scoop Oh Be real Oh I want to try the streets. I would love to meet you and kill you meet you all I'm fancy god It's my Chris is fantastic. I am five love Greatly So Bradley I'm like a regular Please call me nine one one Where did I come from I think you were ready with your left hand Does that look like something ready with your left hand? Did they say say how old they were five five? Have you ever used a good hand ready? Better than me That's like a bench warmers Signs class of press They'll get the same Yeah, it's a raw product of course it was advertising That's just square town to bottom of your bottle Immediately All right, so chest aid is I've been in hotel gym range and doing a lot of smith machine So today I think I'm gonna do Dumbbells they haven't had had any dumbbells in a while Probably so we print how I don't even need heavy dumbbells, but I'm trying to complete with My mobility going and But it has got warmness shiver my chest up. I still feel beat up in childhood stuff Which means I'm gonna do dumbbells the little tries to get it to work out I'm gonna do dumbbells the little tries to get it to work out Oh You Not really trying to kill myself on this just weeding the piss out of it the end of the wrap They're really contract my tech they were gonna move on to some Want to think I'm trying dumbbell, but they're no benching so We'll see if we can scare about someone away Get a bench I don't know the word almost Being a little stubborn to do that Man, it could be I can get a bar right now. You don't see it Yeah, we've been making a couple of false false alarm trips Three in the morning another day I was like These are two days a month, they just got so six days She's already over She's about eight and a half pounds. Really. Yeah, so she's ready Sit down or something hopefully if you man. Yeah, I don't mean like you Don't fucking bother that shit, you know next week You You You You You go below everything last time I did it Wow, but it's not horrible three weeks of travel five pounds left on the dumbbells I'll give myself a break with that Oh I'm trying to be past the point if we want to have you set them in dropping me for the next set too far in the Off season for that trying to get strong it stays strong So two sets that my top weight rather than dropping down I Don't know how much strength drop three sets like how many reps but people lot I think I'm like I think it's six but what I'm doing it trying to get better the more you keep your way high More your muscular strength endurance well lift up. That's the mission germs of how many reps you get How consistently you can keep pushing heavyweight and you're about to be ready to do another heavy set instead of a lighter set after You only would get better with that's after me about it you train your body to do it We're almost at the second build of the yes Fire up the better we're doing beta testing right now If you were in the first collection of people about the older version of my up you have to try it with the new one And it's just like fully updated weight tracking better video new videos But our explanation just do it all around He knows and waits. I'll be done in previous work. Yes for different training splits and a few other nutrition things We're bringing out the next one But I'm excited to look this deck so like a week when it's perfect I'm gonna do a video of me going through the actual app and training with the training as I guess how works And we're gonna be doing transformation contest In like see we saw this week with the marches and new asses I'm not gonna put the after transmission lunches the prize will be like a bunch of cash and they've Will do the training with me so it's all coming very soon Might have already posted about my second my time did it though All right, so push a little bit of volume here on this one. They did lower over there I'm gonna do a bit of like a rest pause combination thing I'm gonna go to like E reps they felt it out in like five with every last time and I'm gonna rest with my arms Stocking position here so my chest is stretched out and it's blood flowing into it It's a little bit more difficult and then I'm gonna go to failure and then I'm gonna put my arms down Rest a little bit with my arms down put a failure again take one plate off go to failure So it's like a drop set rest pause random bullshit and then we're done on this machine You All right, have your thoughts on dropping right now You You The machine is accepted we have you the end of the lock it it's super heavy because the weight Look gravity if you're gonna explain gravity for a second, but I don't know what it is just heavy so nice all set It's like my thoughts All right, so this is still like the only version of decline that I can do My labor is so fucked up in torrents. I get you any passive For how you close grip and close elbows neutral grip fly Press I can get that like heck minor squeeze on this and then we're gonna get to teach that school a little bit Talk rep it out third against the more russian but it's really just feel like squeezing like up under the armpit I'm like pushing like the bottom of your wrist again like a replication of the deep front You You You You All right last Second last exercise and really trying to focus on keeping my chest up Excuse me, why is he letting my shoulders from upper back cave in and kind of cheating that you can make sure a little bit If you make chest up above him, please Keep that the whole way and I'd rather fail out here with my arms next year and cave in Close other ways, it just like you trying to keep my lower back from moving in our tune too much to the same tip of the board Oh You You You Even myself and way weaker keep in my chest up and squeezing like that rather than letting myself hold roll forward The way it is like forced actoss and I know my joint did left wrap so sometimes best to make it as hard as possible We could shit it in the muscle and it's up in traveling a lot In off-dealing see for throwing on the road. I've just been focusing on like really deep my muscle connection And had made my training so much better and not as strong they know me which kind of folks with my head But like my work gets a lot more effective now than they've been so now that I'll implement strength What's his base leading to his off season? Think it'll be a good year maybe Okay All right, so I'm finishing out the last press on the chest there with some like close grip and kind of bench Free weight It's really good to just not get stuck the machines like I did for a while When you get in the machine, there's just such a smooth like lunar larle Plain emotion that your body can just keep it on the moving and that right Stabilizing in a natural form my gravity is gonna make the weight fall on you so I'm not gonna push myself on this Just make for myself I've been done in fucking years I was in that one time I embarrassed myself. I think it's fine So it's like a little bit of weight on here Just close grip both on the old tricep little check Should take that off With that as crooked as a belt that look crooked I mean I'm on an angle so I don't know stay back so I think it was fucking good So hard to think it should be It feels good How many of the four days in American for traveling so I'm doing like a little bit combo work this I'm gonna try to set it the end of this chest there Some of those both grip press like a machine hit my tries a lot Some new little close grip can I'm gonna do some ropes and then let's see I All right last exercise Along workout do some triceps like I said I'm trying to hit like one to have body parts three because of my Chobles so I'm doing like my body parts more I'm gonna do back and buy But for now just leaving the piss in my chest and finishing them off because they were pretty active a secondary Moving from all the pressure I did earlier That'd be yeah I I All right, that's it for today's workout I'm gonna quit as long workout. I don't know how many I've already did but probably more than normal But it actually feels pretty good to them not training for some reason I work out for a really good Pittsburgh Partly because I'd be training partner Connie was there pushing me my kitchen worries better I haven't been staying in my house for a while now.

I have this new trend of doing a higher amount of protein in one of my last meals of the day Actually most of the day, but really had the last one was like two hundred ninety grams of white fish in this That's because I haven't been eating like six meals or five minutes shake even I've been having like four meals in a shake So I've been having bigger meals him.
