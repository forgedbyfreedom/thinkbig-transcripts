Like you said you busted pretty on three times, but if you were beaten this guy I'm doing telecasts. How did he get you in this sport? You the first guy who ever beat me class really back in 2016 my first ever coach showed Yeah, he came in nowhere. It's where I should begin to and grateful for that show, but I wasn't ever going to happen again Come on come on Chris come on you are Jerseylor you're in your stake Where's the easier I need it over there in It's 150 grams of full ay, 150 grams of rice, 100 grams of sweet potato and 100 of bread potato. So, just a 14-6, and 40. Just a little bit of meat. A little jumbo-eye of carbs and steak. I'll do this thing just to eat a shit ton of steak right now. It takes so good. It's good, yeah? More fillet on the way. I'll look at you. We're going to get some man here and there we go. There's a couple of them. Make sure the press conference. Chris, you want me to have bear just time to do it. We're going to have a little bit of a short bear and probably call it. One more next meal. Right now, pretty much. You can weigh a little bit. Because I'm going to eat this meat court. He's going to make it right out. And then I need it. Or you can come to your job. I'm going to eat that first. I'll just take it. Did you want me to take the steak? Yes, sure. Keep digging up on me, Nate. Right now, so I tell you, if you can't. So, it's a take in every day except for the game show. And then morning, she went morning and she went out. I just wanted to take it just keep. Thanks for the long days. You're not having diarrhea. I just want to be with you. With your governments. I want to be a little bit extra active. So, I'll do this one. All right. Perfect. What is up YouTube? I fucked up already today. Kevin wanted to be a full day of eating. It is. But I had to wake up. Kevin told me when I wake up just like eat. Because we were up so late last night. You wanted me to get my food in here. So I ate before. We started filming. But it was a simple meal. I had 120 grams of oatmeal. Chased the delicious. And 115 grams of chicken breast. Not that delicious. But we still need to eat some of your food. Right now, I typically wouldn't. My carbs go up. My protein goes down a little bit. A for digestion volume. Me need less protein. I'm not like trying to build muscle right now. Just like give my body what it needs. Play a menu. A lot of steak right now. To see a lot of creatine. We've trained fat and that. Also helped really fill you up. And give you like a full look. And salmon as well. So kind of adjusting that stuff. But I mean, we're going over everything I'm eating today. Pretty much. So that's what meal one I had at about 8 a.m. I ended up eating it when it was cooked. And then I went back to bed because we were up to like 2. And now 10 a.m. and we're going to be eating again. So eating almost every 2 hours with the press conference at like noon today. I said noon. So I wanted to get 3 meals before that. Because sometimes you sit there for like 3 hours. And it's just long. And trying to keep me just full right now. So I woke up at like 2.39 point. Something whatever. Like still under 240. After eating a whole bunch. So my body sucking up the food. I look dry. It's fucked zero diuretic. I might not even take it. It's beyond us. It's like flush with yourself. And honey is still like on and of being like minimal everything. All natural food is best possible. Just to minimize anything when your body. So super happy to know that. Happy to tell my body this one. Happy to get to eat. It's collating me already about now. Like it's beautiful. It's beautiful. So what do you want to eat? Doing this up. Cornies up food. Fucking great. I just want to eat. I just want to eat. Yes, today when we were trying to make way back and forth. Hanies of maniac. But he did it. Making way. That's perfect right. He's a maniac. In the best way. Pock on me. Like the cycle. We were just so good at what they do. Because they've come to pick you up. Perfect. He did it in corny with a machine in the kitchen. We got the team fucking roll in right now. It's still good, can eat this apple sure you have in the meals made so stay tuned. Taste good already, one on the rice, plain as potatoes. Thanks babe. Hey, yours is so beautiful. Take your nose off, cute cats. I think you guys are on this side. Okay. That's a good piece. Well, he's a well-peeled juicer. I don't know. I'm going to have a side-to-side. What's up, Vannas? Oh, man, am I excited? Folks, we have seen the most competitive lineup. I think maybe even in Olympia history, I'm full of itself for this year's Olympia title, that's not just in the men's, but straight across the board over 400 athletes qualifying this year that does make this the biggest Olympia of all time. I could be happier that we're back here in Venice. All right, the men, the men, the legend, as you get here by the crowd, they said, you know what you heard first? Yes, I know. Because we back in Vegas. The stance is back, better than other. The stance is back. Yeah, I've heard of the mode this year too. I think that's very, very different. Better on you than me, that's for sure. All right, Chris. We had this conversation every year. You've got some great contenders coming, but, man, you just keep doing the business over and over and over but last year you were getting pushed right till the end. And I know you had that nice heart felt acceptance speech at the end of the really touched everybody in the Olympia audience. So, anything different this year, I know every year seems to be a struggle per se, but just gets more and more tough to achieve the same. Is it getting harder as you go on at the retaining the smile? I guess it gets easier in harder and way to, you know, you get used to it a little bit. And, you know, like you said, it was a competition coming up. There's some crazy younger guys coming to look absolutely amazing and they push me to be my absolute best. And, you know, that's what happened this year. This is my 47-comment in here, so I know the rodeo. I know how to do that. I want to do how to do what I do. I'm excited, so, you know, only I know what I did last year. I know what I did last year and I believe I did that. So, I'm excited to show you that. You did, you did have some good young talent coming up in Ours, a cow will sit and speak. You've spent the weekend this year. And he said young guy was 22, 23 years old. I think? And, like the beer remiss, of course, if I didn't recognize my Brazilian buddy, Raymo, Dino. Oh, no! Oh, no! Or Gino, I think Taylor was teaching me some part because of Gino. So Dino, I was for dinosaurs, that was at the cake with the... So I made them a steak, I've going out of podcast. I actually didn't take Ramon to win. In the next day, I hit my Inba. I hit 4,000 dinosaur emojis. And I'm like, what is this? Like, I'm all about Brazil. Oh, no. We're learning things, gentlemen. Now, every day, to defending all plastic plastic physics Heavy in from the United States. Terrence, from Brazil. Oh, no! Oh, no! And for a two-time plastic physique, to let me get Heavy in from the United States. On Ainsley! You guys know each other? We met the high school. You met a two-time star. What up, Tim? Hey, everybody. How are you guys doing? I love you guys. Thank you guys for being here. Real, when it comes to class, you're talking a little bit about stage. What about the fat, man? You know, it's just beginning to class again. I was very kidding play. And Greenland said, nobody is going to know who you're talking about. We got a few people, right? I'll be over three or five people, right? I remember kidding play. That's quite dirty. But... See? It's always in somebody with them. These guys don't know. You don't know the people play. You really don't know. Yeah, I don't think you're doing it that nice. Don't think you're doing it that nice. All right. We're back again. There's a lot of talk this year about it. How do everybody guess saying that you should have gone to the two 12. They said your time here is done. You can't beat this guy. This guy's sniping after you. You got your one show last year, right? Thanks. Was it the Olympia Lester? Two shows you got it. Three shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. You've given consideration. You said you got some unfinished business. But you haven't ruled out in the future. Don't want into the two 12 division. No, I have not. But definitely I'm finished business. Here comes Saturday. I want to finish this classic. My last classic here this year. I want to be the gang of the gold medals. Do you're moving on either way? Yes. Yes. Okay. It's going to be an epic battle because this guy is just unrelenting. I mean he hasn't shown out one bit of weakness. And all Terrence is done by the way Terrence is the best poiser in the business. Are none. Okay. So let's put it in out there because it's kind of a lost art. But you classic guys have really brought it back. Do you spend a lot of time on the poiser and your routines? Because it's her looks like you do. Definitely. Yeah. I think to be the best you have to put the work in. So I've been going this way about a decade now. Here we see what they are going to do. Like you said, you busted three times. But if you ever beat this guy. Yeah. I haven't seen it. Yeah. I brought him to me. We don't like to talk about that show. I don't like this. How did he get you in this sport? He used the first guy who were beat me in class. Really? Back in 2016, my first ever coach showed that he came in an oar. That's where I should begin to. And grateful for that show. But I wasn't ever going to want to happen again. What a baby back there. Yeah. Cool. You got to try. Yeah. What a show you to color. Hey. What's up? My name? Talk about truck. Do you see the shit? You know, he's about ready to show me right now. This is what the color I was thinking. You might have tried to. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Do you like that? I just love to use them. Yeah. Do. Yeah. I got to walk down. I'm going to work now. All right. So just wrapped up press conference. Honestly, making weight last night wasn't that bad. And it was kind of nice time to wake up this morning. Rush quickly to make weight. And then eat quickly and then rush to the press conference. It's at every two hours and rush back. And everything's so honestly, it's working out pretty good right now. And I got to end up the press conference pretty quick. I feel like they're rush this a little bit. So I mean, good for me. I don't have to sit around. I fell asleep back there because I was up so late last night. And the Chris, you're going on and like what? And I wake myself up right out there. And there are a few questions. And they let us leave really the same last time they made all the winners of the previous year's April the end. They're two of the main of the open bodybuilders say till the end. So I got to sneak in the early. He used to suck back there. But come back. My neck and head still hurts. So I'm going to roll out on the ball right now. And then I got to shave my whole body down to a fucking naked morat. I should say corny to get a shave my whole body down. My job. She's shaving my butt. Yes, today. Just just true love helping me fart and shaving my bottle. I'm not gonna let her go. You guys think this should talk, Lamar. I will actually the boys are probably like it. I was giving him an abdominal massage that he could pass a gas like a little baby. And I was shaving his butt inside. And not to the ball. Not that like in fact by me pretty much I was like scooting your butt over and like you know. I'm pretty fucking lean right now too. There's not much fat hiding my butt just glute. And then you have hair right here. So my baby needs to like bend a little. He's like I don't want to. I'm like, bend to suck and shave. Sorry. No man wants someone's hands down there. It's just everything my body's like, don't touch me down there. Well, it had to get a morat status, you know. We had to fully shave down with the razor because my tan is tonight after the meat grease. So we're gonna do that. Give me grease. Tant like 930. And then come back and sleep because I'm gonna be fucking exhausted already. So I'm still doing on. I had a meal backstage. We ran down. I had the eat. I wanted to meet eat right before going on. He took a while. I don't even know what I ate. What did I eat? He ate 140 grams of salmon. 150 rice. Yeah, 100 yum. And then 100 red. And now he's going eating the same thing but back to meal too. So instead of salmon he's doing beef back to full light. Around 2.30 I think. Yep. There you go. 3 team does it again. So yeah, he's just gonna. I'm gonna roll my neck up to get ready. Do you want sweet or what? I just want to eat my lunch. I have a whole sweet. This meal babe. You like it? I can never remember the whole weight this meal. You want to thank the blood? No, I'm not.

Got some 150 rice. 100 potato. 100 other potato. 140 steak. So absolutely beautiful. 300 milligrams of salmon in there. Top of that. I have them eating a little more calories. Lower my sodium a little bit. Just to fluctuate stuff. It's like out of the water. It meets with nice. And yeah, same shit. I'm just eating this. What? Good job for you. He was tired, but he's good now. He's eating and you know, he's going to lay down after this and just rest. And then I'm then he's going to get. I'm going to shave him. Make sure he's like good to go. And then we'll walk over later. So you can come up with whatever we're here. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Bye. Here's the. Okay. These are papers that are going for the day. Yeah. Just three. We'll take a look and just confirm it. But see how those bodies are showing. Have you checked your research? Yeah. 240. 240. 240.

But it doesn't look like a lot. Like when you wear it. So when you do that, it's like going. Yeah. And it means something. That's what I meant. Yeah. So thank you very much, sir. Of course. It's very nice. So that's great. Now it's not like super crazy. That's what I want to be. I want to be like subtle. So it's super easy. I know. I know. You just look at your box. What's the answer? I'm hoping that like damn. It's markedly. Yeah. That looks good. Yeah. But it doesn't look like you're just passing. Yeah. I didn't want it to be like body. Yeah. Guess we're committed to the look on now. And then where are you going, Matt? I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I don't know. I'm just going to be a change in there. I'm going to be a change in there. Right. Should I set? And we're off again. So I'm going to time's light down today. And I'm going to die. We just shake my whole body down. But like, now we're, he's posed a bit of time. Now we're headed to the end of the night. Because I am being done. There we go. Get to meet a bunch of people for a few hours, which is fun when I get my energy back. But right now, we're not long enough. Because we have a tan immediately after. Get home at like 11 again. And then chill out tomorrow. So we're going to get to meet greet. Be some people. Have some fun. And get home with the night. Can we get some photos? Yeah. Okay. Let's do like, let's do one.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh my. Did he come in the Cho운? Yes, sure. Yeah. We should be at our dinner and have a really good night. I did it out after two to a bit of hours, but there was so much of a line. If you were one of the people I'm so sorry, I was so much inspired and I had to dance. And I was also wondering if you guys like to just sort of get a ride. So everyone saw the camera. I appreciate you guys. I love you guys so much. I will be doing more of me, Greece. Much possible to see you guys. Sometimes I just can't see everyone. I really do my best to do it. But so one few weeks ago we had lunch because I set my stage on my best and I got to do what I do. I do my best so I'm literally going to fall over at the point. I love you guys. But time to get stand up and go to bed. We're going after that means we're in the boring meal. But still taste good to the food. Yeah. 40m, thanks to your 50 grams of weight, right? That's 160 grams of chicken. So, so cardamom, it's a fucking blue turt. But so taste good. So, get it down. Give it a hand on. What are you looking at? We're always coming after you. Yeah. You're turning around and Derek just naked on the chair. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. Yeah. Who's that? She's a family character and he treats Kate. I think it's about seven. What shall we check? Good. Right here before the show. Big day, carbon up, even some food. Eat some good food yesterday. And that's not good food, but a lot of food. So, I'll get the eat. And I woke up the same way I woke up as Wednesday. So, my, I fluctuated my water a little bit. I had less, but I thought like, four liters of water yesterday. My way still coming down. So, that's like, my body just like fucking sucking it up. So, breakfast was going to be 100 grams of weight. How much did you get? 150. 100 grams of oats and 115 grams of chicken breast. And then I woke up late and still not flat, but like not quite full fully yet. He's like, I had some more oats. They actually now let's those as some rice cakes. Because dry shit, I'm like beautiful. That's a rice cake. So, he saw me having a rice cake here and now I'm going to be kind of going over some guys. Everything I'm eating today. The day before the lunch, the day that matters about getting everything inside of you. Tomorrow, you hopefully wake up looking like you're supposed to look in just a crime tuning of your little thing. Eating like, well, our rice cakes, a little breakfast, some rice and potato and simple things. Keep your luck that you already have. So, you're going to be trying to go over all that today. And do what we do in the field. Take a change. If chicken is so much better, I'm going to taste like this season. Yeah, super big. I should have been a doll. All right. So, because we're a little low-hunter like I get some fats in, but I didn't want any more water in my oats or anything like that. So, he's like, rice cake and avocado. What have lost them on the butter? But this is obviously a nice little refreshing way to finish off breakfast. Calvin gets out of here. So, I'm just filming this as a coordinate. Don't try not to miss anything today. If I've tried my deus, I miss a meal for them rushing in. Not thinking that my brains have fun with me. But I have three rice cakes and 50 grams of avocado spread on top for a little bit of the laced fat. And that will be the actual wrap on breakfast. So, be safe. All right. What's going on guys? We are back to some old school Seabomb South Folder eating blogs with the camera on the box of Nutrivalet. Great name box. If I had a my house properly camera up, and here we are. Start with meal number two. It is approximately 10.45 in the morning. Day two going on no water. It's just getting out of their joke. My cat is logged. I'm actually still drinking water so it feels good. But this meal consists of 140 grams of steak. 100 grams of sweet potato. 100 grams of yellow potato and 150 grams of white rice. I am definitely going full booze eating filet right now. Every meal and it is absolutely amazing. We will probably make a lot of my steak. A lot of you here today are just like you chew it. It's like butter. You get no flavor to be beautiful. And it's just a lot easier and you're something to get down. We are eating right now and everything right now I am doing is optimal digestion, optimal bloating because I don't want to have a bowl of stomach or vegetables passing through me. How healthy. Delicious. We have healthy oven eating. I am cleaning everything. For so long. I buy it and I use eating ship foods. Some people want to carve out them when I have hamburgers. They want to have treats, chips, sugar or whatever. And you can get bloated back of your digestion and you are something to take your digestive water. You don't want that. So you get all super organic clean healthy fresh cooked meals. By chef Courtney here's the back. Doing the damn thing. Fucking smoking off. It's a pretty damn smokey. It's a fucking smokey. It's a smoke of fire alarm. She's been killing the game because in the middle of the day and they're all bland, no sodium. No seasoning. Just food. So. I'm going to put this down. I'm going to watch an X-Men movies specifically Wolverine. A watch. Origin Wolverine. Now watching Wolverine. Then I'm going to watch Logan. I'm going to skip out the X-Men bullshit. Because I just want to watch you Jackman. A couple of heads off. So I'm going to leave. Even I'm meal. And I see you guys for the next meal. Alright. What's going on guys? We got Coach Man in the corner here. Almost serious in the sunlight. It's just a little bit like a monster. Just a mysterious man in the back telling me what to put in my body. I was like, you know, some beautiful salmon, rice, and sweet potato. I love eating all this fucking fats right now. You know what I love my fats right now. I love everything right now. But salmon fat, all this stuff going to me. It's helping me just have energy right now. Nice having like energy through the day. Every day I wake up and then go back to bed. I just couldn't say a week. And now I'm like, I'm alive, you know. It's good to feel back to life. And looking better and better at the time was on. So people grateful plans going. We're doing good. It's 1224. And number three. Getting the carbs in and chill for the day. So this is it. Rice, sweet potato salmon. Meal number three. Check it out. See you for number four. All right. So meal number four. It's only 2 30 PM already for me. So beautiful day. Now I got some avocado. I wish I could stuff avocado in there and turn it to work in Moli. But still delicious. I got some white fish. 275 grams of rice. Five ounces of white fish. Like 140 grams. And then 60 grams of avocado in there. And sprinkle a little much of lemon on there for flavor. So that's my condiment for the day. And eating this, getting it down right now. Delicious. My parents are chilling right now in the room. Corny doesn't have to pant to them. I was going to. But I didn't know if the parents would want to be too. But mama pop up on the center right here. Yeah. Mom and dad made it. They've been to every single Olympia. They're here to support. And this is our kind of, this is our chill crew that we can just lie in the room in the relax. So hanging out eating some of the people from raw just came by and dropped off a little cortisol for me in the nice little note. So you're sending their love and support. So much appreciated. And yeah, that's it. I'm hungry so many eat this meal. So you guys are million them in fact. Yeah. Just like do a like kind of a right of a street. Like do any kind of support. No. Okay. Okay. That's what I guess I'm starting to like. I'm so, it's been like 200 or more. I'm going to. All right, we're off to 10. Number three. I just told you miss another meal. I'm sorry. I didn't miss using one, but it was a bunch of 300 grams raw weight, breast of potato and some steak. So same old chef. But I got to fix it in my pocket. I tried organic, thick, sodium free sugar free. Well, no sugar added. These things taste like crack right now. I'm not going to do a sugar and have it. So eating this on the way over there. Get a tan. Got a meal with me. You don't want to eat it over there. I'll probably get a naked tan. You might be able to naked them off on that. So three quarter day of eating. Sit, two. Now it'll be like seven, eight meals and I miss one meal. I eat it. You eat it. Yes. One. Yes. One. One. One. It's a big boy. I think you need to leave and walk me back at the toilet. You need to go to... Okay. A little tanning booth. A little naked brown dude. Played dude. Brown dude, black dude. All in the same brown in the end. And once I'll talk over the way, I'm ready to rock a roll. I'm ready to rock. Yeah. I'm ready to rock. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm ready to rock. I'm ready to rock. I'm ready to rock. I'm ready to rock. When you got to eat, you got to eat. This has been a number. My favorite thing. I think I would eat a lot of cows. I'm eating over two hours. I've no idea you've been to any more. It's like 150 grams of potato. 150 grams of rice. And 140 grams of salmon. I stayed kind of put together. I already had one. But he said he wanted to be eaten. Every two hours. I'm here. I'm not dry yet. So what better is waiting till time. That he's salmon right since the potato. Absolutely delicious. I enjoyed it. Hopefully by the time I've done I'm dry. I think I could get the pork out here. I'm going to go the bad. I'm going to eat a good one. I'm ready to go. I got to go the bad. I got to go. I got to go. I got to go. I got to go. I think I've got to go. with this, right? I mean all in here is stronger real. So I think by tomorrow. We don't that quite. I want to see that quite further. Push down that quite. Right, pushing down. There you go. Yeah, so if you want to see that, Yeah. I want to see this deeper. Yep. I'll be right up like just... Guys here. Boom. Boom. Go up and then go down a little bit. Go up. Yeah. There you go. Don't let me back too much. Right there. Perfect. Try such a straight. Getting some nasty way. You're gonna make it back. Go ahead. Go ahead. Back looks like... Yeah. Good. Give me the most muscular crack, not most good. I'm scared. I think yes. That's a fucking rush out. I'm not sure what's that thing. But just don't you feel like it's digesting? Because if it's not, we can do anything. You can. You can make it through me. That's what's pretty up there. You know what I'm sure that. You shouldn't have. Only once, but a good chat. Just me one. Try my sneaking in. Pop there to this one. Right. I thought maybe it looks like you're gonna crush that chat with your cookies in there. There is some. You're hitting under the stick. I'm pretty determined. That's the moment I... All right, guys. So it's gonna be the final meal of the day. Right. Same old ship. Got some potato. Some rice. Some for life. I mean, you know. Finish off the yellow thing this. Click nine o'clock. Gonna go to bed after this. Try not mass out. Get some good sleep. And we can shred it in the morning. Right to rock and roll. Tomorrow's game day. Going to the plenary now. We're gonna get a good plan. Put the whole squad here. Right to go early morning. One more ten. And then we're heading over to the. Comments and center of the Venetian. Get on the stage. Show them what we've brought. So. Let's do this ship. Let's do it. End time.
