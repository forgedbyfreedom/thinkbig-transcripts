I would probably break that. We both got our retire. Yeah. Give us like, give me like three years. And then we'll. He's. Yeah. You know, the care to do or you kind of just get through it right now. Anything like like, like, why do you think you're going to be dressed? You know. Yeah. And all. Just the basic stuff. Yeah. You're. But like you're. You've turned down your intensity as a. Yeah. Yeah. Don't fucking intensify us anymore. I mean right now. The boring heart of prep starts. The real boring shit when it comes to training. Right. Yeah. Like one week before. It's just like good pumps. Yeah. I remember last year we both went to like AVLC and Las Vegas. Yeah. Oh yeah. And we both are looking like. Hardness doing a shit with him. Steffa and his doing the shit with me. And they always like, normally when it starts to get. Get funny. They said like, yeah, stop it. And then you're just. Pump through it and I don't know. I don't enjoy the stuff. I was last year I remember when you're Instagram got deleted. Yeah. And you're freaking out. Hey. I so much. There was so much shit going on. Like on the phone ride from the start of the morning. Right now I don't give a fuck. There was our 12th of fucking social media in the morning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think we were sick you were here. I like the red touch on your pepper. Right now it's really bad. Yeah. It's my favorite fan. You've been watching my videos. No, I came here and it was on earlier. It was on. Oh yeah. It's just like. Yeah. Have you listened to just rock? Yeah. Grab music and shit lately. Yeah. What is the new album? Drake drop. I didn't even listen to it. Yeah. No good. Sing a track with like. I mean, Utopia was nice. Travis. Oh yeah. But I didn't listen to all that either. Yeah. But the rest can't forget it. Just listen to old white man music right now. Where in the suck in jogging shoes? Yeah. Yeah. And got you out there. You're going all designer on me and I'm going to get you out. Yeah. Stop fritting so in here. These are walking shoes. I'm no sprinter. Oh, so. How about? I'm a speedwalker. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I like the weather inside here. I like it so much better here. Yeah. I don't know if I can eat. It's in mid summer, horrible. When it's like 100 degrees out there, but lately it's been a lot better. But even that is better than the fucking in Germany right now. Give a what about when you're like fucking 290 pounds when you're fat there. Then I'm like, you would be suffocating. And I'm just lying into the laying and home of my go. Yeah, but you have the elevator in the seat. Ah. I acclimate to this. Hey. I acclimate to this. Shut up. Someone's getting older. Someone's gonna come stand. Yeah. No idea what that means. You don't know Ramstein? Ramstein? Yeah. No. You don't know Ramstein. The German rock metal band. Oh. Hey, Kelvin, you know Ramstein. You don't know? What? The fucking music, Mark is real post on every time. You never saw like posing from him. No. Who Marcus? Marcus, yeah. You know. I know who we even eat and know Salamstein. I know who. I like you so much. I like you so much. You know it's fucking everything. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's too hot. Telesi, John. Telesi, John. You're doing some crossfit stuff lately, huh? well it's stretching rolling around and like turning into a wrong direction my friend. You tell me when you find your way up. This is custom made looks like just for my arm yeah. It's going pretty low. I'm actually pretty good. It's been changing my diet every day but it's been getting the week. I'm like 2800 calories. Yesterday was like 22 and the lowest they have had. So I felt it this morning but I'm going to actually weight up. I'm doing a revostide right now. It's the first time. It's crazy. It minefucks me at the same time. I was at a zero-callure and I never did zero. I mean the last four years I didn't do a zero-callure at all. When you tell me to eat more I was like, I don't think I didn't want to. You're probably not going to want to do that. You're just fucking eating. I think it's 100%. So you used to being starving and suffering that. Yeah, you have to. Until we got it and but this time is different but it's always good to learn. You know, the kids are already under your weight. Yeah, I'm on the way. You're on it in the morning. Yeah, one morning I was on it and then he decided like, okay. We can cruise in now. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. I'm the rest of the year. But I mean you know it is also with Courtney and all those peeps around you. It's not easy. So I don't know how you can like stay in it like this for five fucking years straight. And don't even compete on a high level. Yeah. Doing this shit for like. Yeah, not even winning at a level one, sure. Yeah. I mean of course, but not for everyone. And then it's good. But I like, I like Ian's move to be honest. Yeah. Because you need to have fucking balls to say like, okay, I'm not feeling it at all. Yeah, he's genuinely so much happier now too. Yeah, you can see it. Yeah. I mean, I don't know him personally. Everyone says that's like the smile is different now. Yeah. And it's also not fake, you know. And. He's dead. I'm busy. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. Yes. Go chip. Yeah. Merci. Merci. So. What? For I didn't have the old limit. What do you mean last year? I wasn't at the limit. Oh, you're under it? I was way under it. Really? Yeah. I'm under the old ones. So basically seven or eight pounds. But oh, you only put on weight when you're really stressed out. Remember when you tell me you're stressed out and you're weight was still high? Yeah, I just stress. Yeah. Okay. No, but. Fucking smaller you are. More weight. More weight. Yeah. But it's. Yeah, really. Yeah. Come on. Well, you got seven or four. I personally got seven. Yeah. Seven. My weight last year was like, okay, you were under last year. Yeah, three hundred last year's weight and now you're weight high class. My high class got four more. Yeah. It's a bit confusing every time I'm telling you. The Germans were like, what? Yeah, he's lying. He's tall enough. Because they say like, you're going to you are tall every year. Like they told me. You know what they talk. I mean, they talk for fun. No, they tell you about me. He's getting taller now every year. Yeah. I'm like, people are. Yeah. Some people were. But I do it like fucking David Gaggen. So I look at it and stuff. Just laughing at those guys because it's so fucking the matter. Yeah. So funny. Yeah. We ever trained together or not. We go for a day after. We? Yeah. Yeah. The day after. I'm not. No. No. Yeah. We need a real work. Yeah. How did we? I don't think we did. No. So it's like two weeks out when we go. Yeah. Or you after fucking for our expo. Yeah. 10 hour line and fully nanny. Yeah. I was fucked from the onwards and from my diarrhea. And he was fucked from people standing in front of his. Did you have diarrhea? The girl did. It was the Arnold. Last Olympia was my fucking Instagram. Oh, I thought the Olympia was, uh, airplane. It's always up with me. Come, of course. No, this time. I don't want to say it too early, but we're in a good state. Where do you for whatever, you know? That's what we spoke about, remember? Now everything can happen. Yep. Oh, I don't know. Good. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Trying to sabotage me? Oh, it's hair on it. Oh. I don't talk about your armpits, but who is that? Oh, down there. You can't. You can buy them now for one million US dollars. Put it on the German on my website. What's I, you mean tell me to say everybody gets it. Give me a piece. It's like gel for your hair. You're also not yours. You don't get much of it anymore. But hair, much gel. You're going back to bud. Just get ready. Roll. Give another year too. I get the treatment when I was happening. I'm going in. You're going? Yeah. Nice. Tudkie? Yeah. After Dubai. Yeah. Both. But do it into Dubai. Not better in Turkey. Really? Yeah. I'm not like them. They're one classic surgery capital of the world. So new, new titties and new hairs. Yeah. From back to double these. Yeah. To a, a 75. Yeah. My free challenge. Yeah. What do you watch? I want to mean the free challenge. Like what I'm doing on the right way. You fucking lie on your couch all day right now. I watch YouTube. You here? Watch some shows. But watch out for something. I'm waiting for the new call of duty, honestly. Looks interesting. Modern Warfare Free. Have you come out yet? Didn't come out yet. But we need to go in it when it's out. I'm so bad at that given. Roll. Well, you want to be on my team. 100%. No. I can't play a PlayStation on prep. I can't really. I play for like an hour. Yeah. Assassin's Creed. Yeah. I can't play for like a new run round and I'm good. So what the fuck do you do? I'm really good. I give you really evasive sketchy answer, right, man? I'm looking at a lot of people eating stuff on YouTube. This bearded guy and this like, I don't know. What's the name from from him, but just goes there and eat the whole menu from what the fuck cheesecake factory. I mean, I looked at those most disgusting places where he eats and I'm like, kind of, you know, hangry and it looks so weird because I don't know any of the season. I wouldn't even enter this place. Like Taco Bell or some shit. And now it's like the weird fetish for you. Yeah, it's a food fetish. Yeah. But beside that, I go for some walks with the girl, of course. Roll on a stem, living a fucking boring. Oh, I know that would be boring. I'm living a boring life too. It's my best thing you can't kill time. Where do we sell the limpies? Yeah. I don't even know what you're doing. But you're all doing. What? What do you all doing? I'm not. I watch shows. You can nap right now. They're like maybe I like meditate and then I'll lie there for another 45 minutes. Half in half in I'll sleep. Yeah, for me it's super hard to get napped in. I try after breakfast, but after my meal one. Yeah. It's more like, okay, let's go on on on on. Maybe I get a super forwarder than I need to pee again. Yeah. Then I lay down and then I'm like, okay, 20 minutes, then I can eat. Yeah, okay. I watch some YouTube stuff. I go into some comments. I look just 40 minutes straight on Netflix, which show I'm going to look. Can't find anything. To decide, okay, I don't. I'm not into everything or something. I watch UFC a lot. UFC? No. I watch anime in prep. Awesome. I've been watching the YouTube guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a newer one. It's good. I started watching Bleach to the sea. I didn't have anything. Yeah. It's cool. I'm just like, that's like a thousand episodes or something. No, I mean the new thing, which is a lot of action. Oh, a lot of action. No, I watch that. This cool. It's just one fucking season. So we need to wait another two years. Yeah. But this one season was pretty good. Yeah. Lecoson. I remember hearing that there were bones at the Arjac어� трuf. Okay, this exercise? Yeah. We started with this really? Yeah. My joints were fucking dry and I remember my joints. Yeah, this guy was fucking netty as hell. So it was funny. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. Not at all. The wind was also pretty low enough, isn't it? I got up to 255 for like a couple weeks, but that was it. Can it hours 20? 20. 20. 20. It's a good old maple syrup. Jesus. Very nice. Coming down 40 plus pounds to make way. Everybody, that's the fucking age. I'm sure you also pull more water when you're young. Also a post-competition. I can see it. I mean, I've never started over to 65. I've been 271s in my life. Okay. But my wake-up is always 240. So if I ever got 265, I stopped turning on growth. No, it's just water in me. I mean, I'm holding so much water and the older I get every year it's getting less and less. It was at a rebound after. Yeah, my goal is to eat like shit after the show. No, not at all. Really? Back in the days. Of course, my first competition. Destroyed everything. But I went up 20 pounds in a week, but in three days. But then after like a few competitions, I never like eat super much. I do a lot of prep food. And you put on 50 pounds. Yeah, I put on so much water and then from one to the other competition it stopped getting less and less. Now after the Arnold's I hadn't like a rebound. A big rebound at all. You done with these? All the shit bro. I ripped the shit off hard. No respect for the gym. Let me tell big ass fans they owe me a new fucking plug. I'll send the advice to you. Big ass fans. What the fuck are you plugging in your fucking pants? It's not working. It's not broken. It's not German engineering. I mean, yeah, I see the calves. Those are German made. Not this kind of stuff. It's only secret to big calves being fat all year. Bro, being fat and being like walking around everywhere. We didn't have like big refits. We just said you're having one right now. But it wasn't that brief. It was like more you felt it a refit. Yeah, we increased the calories it everyday from like 250 grams of carbs to 500 500. You know, I think that's a big refit. My own normal 100 grams. Who's she? No, normally it's 800. Yeah, skinny bum. No one. But your carb loads are pretty big. Those two days with also a Z-800. Probably. Yeah, I saw it. It was a 800. Oh, they're 101. Yeah, I think. Yeah, I used to go. Yeah, it's always different. I mean, some days. A totally good hour enough. At the other day, you eat like 1,000 and it's your wake up or light it and they're 4. I never have those days. Yeah, I mean also. I thought he's well done quite a bit by the end. Yeah, this is the most of every in the. I've never had more than one refit in the last five six weeks of prep. I've had like five. No, me too. I mean, when I stopped the prep, I don't get any refits until like six to eightish weeks old and then my body and my metabolism's fire. Fire in and then I get them every week. I mean, it's good you weren't traveling at the end of the prep. Yeah, I feel like you're like, kind of stuff going on now. It's just a two hour drive across the state and you're there. Yeah, that's so good. They'll go to the mindset. Yeah, you got to do that every year. Yeah, that you should get like a helps a lot. If you go to Vegas next year, yeah, go to like Arizona in the bottom, like outside of the strip, can there be for four or five weeks? That's really nice out there. Yeah, I mean, just don't fucking shoot your brains out on an airplane. Always. Depends yeah on what the circumstances in life are. I mean, to come here to the states more than what also be a cool thing, but it's sometimes it's not possible with like family stuff and private stuff going there. So I always enjoy and be thankful for the time I'm here and be able to explain with a few guys and those crazy dims though, but I think the move is smart to build. I think to move, I'm saying to come for you. No, I don't think so. I'm going to buy your thing here. I think that's a who can shut this off. Yeah. But a future, definitely. I think you don't really really can doctor to know how to bodybuild it. Yeah, for helping like, as hell. What's going to happen? Oh, may it can happen? Yeah, he did also stuff with Reagan, Reagan told me about it. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Some basic stuff. Not like even in your 25 now. It's still better to get ahead of it than wait till something happens. Yeah, you think, start early with stem cells. You might not necessarily that, but like proactively getting your body healthier. You've had to be like, when I retire and I'm sick. Yeah, there may be too late, you know. But what's the theory of now? What kind of therapies you're doing? He does a lot, but that tells us one of his main things, PRP, especially I do a lot of different types of peptides, like knowing which one and how to use them and all the shit. Oh, barely sweating, but like, what's the next? It was hard when I was still like just I've acclimated, yeah, lost 20 pounds, the more cardio. Yeah, you did a lot of cardio this time, huh? Me? Yeah, 40 minutes? That's not a lot for me. I used to do two hours. 45 minutes is here, it's fucking a breeze. Crazy. Like can I do more? My first threat by it 12 hours. Now, since I'm doing 30 minutes, most of the year, yeah, we like, stable 30, then we drop to 25. Now we get out of here, I hate it. I like to stop my direct. If you love me too. My cardio now is like not cardio. It's like a walk on the treadmill. Because my way was coming down too, so I just like just to move and like get my body ready for the day. I'll do like 40 minutes walk, but it's like nothing. And I walk over to revive down the street. Set my ass in the infrared sauna and walk back trying to warm up. Yeah, yeah, cool. That's it. The princess invited me in her palace. It's beautiful. Hopefully you can come back to the time when we can work out like real men. Yeah, with all about 270 pounds when you're, you know, I'll be 260 and I'll be like somewhere. We don't know it yet, but yeah, definitely. I'm 10 pounds over you now. You'll be 40 pounds over there. That's how life goes, huh? But yeah, good work out, good beginning of the peak week. Like I told you before, it's all about respect, you know, when you'll be a, when you want to be a good champ or great champ, you need to, you need to give some respect on your respect and the shit talk with you is more like an even shit talk. It's just, you got ugly shoes on. Yeah. And he's all this fucking good race. So I mean, fact spit it, but so I dare I'm excited for this next week. We're going down to Orlando. Do you know our stuff on a day of the business and yeah, yeah, any last words from you? No, maybe you'll give up the title to, no, you. You can still got a climb up the second place before you get first bud. You got to take a Ramon. We've got a wait for Saturday. We'll be waiting till next year, Saturday. Maybe the year after that or the year after that. He keeps continuing. He keeps. I don't know what it is. It's chin mock. I find a new year every year, so I get rid of me yet. You young bucks keep me young. Yeah, even younger. Everybody's telling, huh? It's getting young and young about now I got all the contacts I need for for some aging, for some anti aging. I got you. So next year, I'm going to be back in the junior category. Junior. Junior are a good old guy to keep you young and healthy. So you keep getting better. So I have a reason to keep getting better. You know, my secret. You're odd. But it's really it's crazy to see how much younger you're. How much younger I look. You look. You actually think I do. You know what Alicia said? Alicia said it's because of the ugly hair. So you had last year. Oh, yeah. It looked so bad. She said it looked so bad at all. He's looking so much better. Because I was what was the fucking idea of that's just my hair. It had started balding. But bro, you had like the fool. What is the bullet you mean? The bullet that she had that last year. She hated the bullet that shaved it for stage though. What do you have on stage? No. The stash and just shorter hair. I was just balding. Okay. That I think that makes you look really old. Yeah. I have honestly been way healthy this year. I was gentle on everything. It took time off. I was like low dose in it all to be healthy. So my body feels better. Some prime office. Didn't do the Arnold. Yeah. The fucking Arnold. Why not? Don't do the Arnold this year. I'm gonna do it. Don't do the Arnold this year. Bro, bro. We have all been on the lampia. We have all been on the lampia. We have all been on the euro. Coming up. For your own. For your own. It's just a thing there. And for your youth. Yeah. You don't understand what three months of rest does. And in six months of off season does to a body. But where should we end? Three or thirty in the off season? I don't need time. You can't be any better. Yeah. I can be better. But I need to like. I haven't. My weight hasn't changed in four years. I've gotten better every year. You know what? I want to. Since I'm 13 years old. I want to win a fucking hour of plastic fire. So it's more like in the dream. And dream I'm catching. You know. It's like maybe I'll do the Arnold this year too. It's a fucking. It's not the same prestige. It's still limpia. But for me it's like just five percent It's like just because it's the other iconic thing. And I mean Arnold from from Europe from Austria from you know. Yeah. When in Germany honestly when you say I want the Arnold classics everybody's like the big year. I mean. Oh and then when you say you too when you say you want your limpia everybody's like I had it's like it's like the biggest show in bodybuilding. Because they don't know. And when you say drop the name Arnold there like three go. Take everything. Well you want to be a big fish and a small pond. No I just want to impress my old neighbor. Well neighbor when I'm telling him I saw the picture. I showed him the picture of Rafaunald and he's like. You're my man. You're a real man. He gave me his hand at the first time in 25 years. Like he's like that's a good boy. That's a good boy. That's a good boy. Get into the respect of your old man neighbor. That's like that's what you're feeling. When you get that respect you're like walking out of your your house like this every morning. Big dick. Have a little talk with him like what your every day. You're like you're in your garden. Yeah. All right so wrapping up this video probably the least intensive training day but for one week out and we're training arms. The goal now is just not to hurt yourself and just fucking do what we do. So there's good to see my ears again down and forth. Yeah I got a nice little pond. Yeah I can't complain. This community wet up. The biggest pants. It's up. The sponsor plugged again. Fund for me.

No one's really an asshole so we can actually change together and fuck around and you know earth is really really ugly shoes on today but I still love him and I'm really he still loves me. I'm from making weight and he's gonna fucking shove fit.
