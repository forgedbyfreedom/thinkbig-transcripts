Alright, so Saturday morning with a bit of a shit show. Um, pretty much every night. Let me have a little bit of a 6 to 7 to 8 pounds of water and what he and put me really dry and really good. And then near Friday night Saturday morning, I just stopped flushing water. My body was just like, oh, we're going to hold on to it now. And then I had also a lighter two hours already. But he had to do a good cup water to be lower by Friday morning. We started. So I had less water to flush. And then I'm eating a lot and I woke up on that Saturday morning, showed it all days to look my worst. I had locked in a morning in a very long time and I normally wake up like peel, shredded dry and like ready to rock. Build my confidence, get off stage. I didn't mind doing my thing. This time I wake up and I'm like, oh boy, like, I lost like a pound and a half, two pound, maybe not five or six or seven. And I didn't look like I should have. And then honey, like, technically, that you up, I'm like, yeah, I'm up now. And he was already hick waiting outside my door just sitting there. He knocks. I'm like, oh boy, here we go. And then he comes in and has me hit some poses and we're in a hotel room at like, five thirty in the morning. No sun can be in so the lighting is horrible. And the old hotel rooms are just like a little orange like coming down on me. I have no mirror. I don't know what I look like fully, but I can just stress in it. I see like, what the fuck? He literally is like, what the fuck happened? I have like, but I don't know what do you mean? And I could tell that I was not where I need to be at that point. So that's when it was kind of like, little stress, little panic. You know, it didn't really good peak peak. You know, everything was going really smooth. So, you know, you never gonna have a time where everything perfect. Obviously, this was like, a little moment of like, yeah, good. He's a little bit less stress just to throw out you. And it was one of the moments where I was like, you know, I had set a fighting to like, it shouldn't be stress. It shouldn't be the shouldn't be that big. This is just part of this journey right now as president's fans. But I was stressed. I was worried. I like, fuck my heart sank. I went shut down on. I was just like sitting down like, what do we need to do? And he kind of is pacing thinking like, what does the body need right now? What's missing right now? And he eventually, the wizard honey just like, what can I be thinking? This is why like a good coach can help so much because, you know, to problem solve like that. And understand after his years of experience, what like causes the body to look like this and need this, you might think it's too much water to little, too much food to this, who knows? You know, but he was like, you know what, you look at his flat, your body's been burning through food like absolutely crazy. I think he need more food. Maddie had bought me a burger the night before, which it didn't eat today. We didn't think I needed to have a super clean up until this point. He's like, eat that burger right now. Hey, it's that burger. He's like, have some rice cakes with almond butter and jam. The corn you made before, rice cakes covered it on the butter and jam like a shit ton of almond butter to get more fat to me. And then I started posing and I started to look a little bit that and he's like, all right, human rights actually need more food. So then I had like three whole like 200 grams of sweet potato, 200 grams of y'all of potato, 250 grams of rice, 150 grams of steak like fillet and covering ketchup and some salt. And just mash that down and it was so much food and this is like 530 in the morning to like 630 in the morning. It's 635, I had eaten like a 3, 4,000 calories. I don't know how much food, but a lot of food now. It's like, which is so waking up, still stressed. It'll be like, it might body just like, that just like lose everything over. And I used to have to panic when it showed it and you don't look like you should look. It's like, what's going on right now? But honey's been here before. We've been through it. You know, we've been competing a tilin' peer for me seven years. I don't even know how many years. My fifth one on a pitaid off. You got to keep calm. It's just gonna happen. And it's not gonna be perfect. Don't expect perfection. Expect chaos. Expect whatever happens happened and when it happens, it just take it as it is. So that's what we were doing. And then after eating all that food, I started eating some poses and I slowly started to look better. And I was like, I could see just a little relief in them. And then all of a sudden, it's like, you're pretty motherfucker, you get, you're gonna pull this together like we're good. And I didn't look like shit at the beginning, but I mean, we're trying to win a fifth one pitaid off who would be the best in the world that we're looking for, a very high caliber of look. I still would have looked good, but we're looking for a very specific, very high level look. So once I started to come back, when I sit with poses, the salt, sodium, food, all started coming to my muscle. Water started coming out of the skin into the muscle, looking a little bit better. And my physique started to come together and I started to look jire. Cuts were getting deeper in my glutes, my abs were starting to jire. And again, whenever I have like soft lower abs, that's just why I'm not looking good. And yeah, so it all started to come together and he looked at me and he laughed at her. Yeah, we're gonna be able to just gain that confident look. You like, all right, we got this like, we're pulling it together, you got this like you look good. We're gonna do it. And I would like I started crying. It's like there. We should have that a little bit of stress. You know, I've been, I put so much like subtle expectation and pressure on myself to like be so fucking perfect. Sometimes, and then when something goes wrong, that's when it shows me how much pressure and I expect to show how my self, and I'm like, it's not going the way it needs to be right now and then I'm just like locked up and tense. And then when it started to come together again, it was like a little tear relief, I was like, all right. You know what, let's laugh at that now. You know, I literally laughed, I was like fuck, all right. It's just part of this experience. This is gonna be part of what's gonna make it so sweet again when I step on stage. And I look good and I feel good. This is gonna be one of those little stressors. It's low moment, like the high feels so much better. It's spoken about my main little and peace beaches. But the lower parts make through better. The lower parts make the higher parts feel better. So this is just one of those moments set of fighting it, not wanting to be there, not wanting to have happened, accepting it for what it is, moving through it, and taking it as it is. So that's what we did, got it together and let it a little bit of relief. I had a little laugh, I have stress we were for about an hour and a half. I had a laugh about how much fucking food I ate in an hour and a half, just like whatever I could fit in my belly was so much food. And then yeah, that's what happened on Saturday morning when the cameras were shot because it was a bit of a chaos. Even that it's just a, it's hard to put chaos into hard to put words into the chaos I was experiencing that morning. But it's all part of the fun of body building, going part of the fun is repeating that you never know. It's gonna happen. The body does not seriously change and it doesn't list its science or biology. It just does whatever happens in that moment. Then you have to take it for what it is. Thankfully, honey's experience, you know what to do. We pulled it together and that's where we're at now. So remember all of the rest of the videos we want to give you guys a update on what happened on that Saturday morning. So hopefully you guys enjoy the rest of this video.
