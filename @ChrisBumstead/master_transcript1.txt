I'm very tired lately. I literally too lazy to get up and fill up my water bottle sometime. This year, it's been different because my minds are in a really good place. I know that because there's so much noise and talk and shit going on about me now. I've won three times in the neurosurgeon, people want to see me with failures and shortcomings and following. I just can't get to that point in the career when someone has put just a few people to talk a lot of shit and I can talk about that if you use so much. Come on, Chris! Come on, come on, come on! We're home, I'm gonna be a champion! Let's go, we're home, we're home! What is up YouTube? This is absolute prep late for me now. Eat calvins on the phone for like five minutes and I'm like, yo, I gotta eat right now. This is my third meal, I'm gonna be with my crew criminal in the serving. I have no patience to wait for you to eat. So I'm starting this video a little bit solar right now. But we're back in Canada now. We're in Dallas for four days. Give them good work at sin and got my head in the great spot. A lot of bunch of weight, really leaner, put on another pound or two and say, just lean some of my bodies in a great spot right now. Feeling good and we are under three weeks healthy lunchies. So get close. I came back and actually had a high carb day on Thanksgiving. No thanksgiving food. I had a slice of turkey breast. But no good thanksgiving food. So my carbs went up to, you guys all love the macros. My heart, the high carb day was about 450 grams of carbs. We shouldn't seem like a lot but even me eating that much. I was like tired and like, well, this is a good amount of food. Maybe more hungry, felt good. My weight only went up I think two pounds from that and then the next day did another little high carb day and I was 350 grams of carbs about that day. And I was having steak in salmon almost every meal and some avocado on one meal with my fish. So a higher fat as well that day. And I mean high carb days aren't as fun as people like to think there. It's a lot more optimal to eat healthy food. The same food you've been eating at a higher amount than going to get sushi, hamburgers. And then the bullshit is that you can mess up your digestion. It's going to explode you down. You can form the water. And you don't want to do that. The same is a new new refeed. So I also have been tracking myself pretty specifically because something has done in the past is not even enough salt. So now I've been putting one a piece of a teaspoon on every meal and then a good work at meal and breakfast meal. I've been putting two teaspoons, two one a piece of a teaspoon on it, two a piece of a teaspoon. And just being super consistent with that. So when I have higher carbs to do a little bit less sodium, a little bit less water, so my weight is fluctuating and it's going to be summer thing to work in our carb loading. So it's almost like a really mini mouth carb up. You see my body responded. My body responded great. It feels good to do it. And now we're back on and I only put on like a pound of two and it's already coming off quick. So feels good. Body is just responding. As it should be to food, low food, higher carb everything. So this is a pre-worked meal. A little bit of fish, a little bit of zucchini, a little bit of rice. But I could suck, but now that my food is decently lower than my last full day of eating, we're going to film another full day of eating this week. I just wanted to kind of give you guys a quick update that we're back in Florida. I don't know if I said we're back in Canada, we're back in Florida. Not Canada, definitely not. Definitely losing my mind right now. And yeah, so pre-worked meals, I'm going to put this down and see you guys at the gym. Or on the gym to the gym or for pre-worked. I don't, I'm just going to eat and stop talking. I'm going to put this down and let's go. Turn the flavor. Natural cabbage, sweet and we're still there, babe. I'll have some. You want to try it? Yeah. What kind of is it? It's a flavor. Cherry lime. Ooh, I actually love those crystal-lit cherry lime made back in the day. It's not quite it. See, I like this a lot. Yeah. I mean, considering the amount of ingredients that are in this product is impressive, it's not that easy. It's not that easy. It's like nothing. Yeah. It could be better though. What are you saying? I like it. Actually, it's pretty mellow. The little bit, it's very mellow. Super mellow, but I like that. I don't like a really, I don't want like Jolly Rancher in my mouth before I train. I mean, like mellow or some coffee. That's good. I approve and it's the best we can. I don't approve. We're going back to the Johnburg. All right. All right, so back day, beautiful old back day. That's the point now, we're like, I don't even know. It's so hard to be like wake up for a workout. The weird is that it's to say my body's asleep. A muscle is tired and empty and just like, okay, we're blood flowing and just like, get the fuck out of my head when I start to work out. So, you know, warm up, a lot of whole dances. I'll either be going to do a shovel, get up this time, and choose a reverse grip, and then we're going to go on some machine. Maybe it dumbbell, no crazy rows or anything today. And she can try and control it. She should have my back. Get it nice and shredded. Have a good back, though. I got no words. So waking up. I tried to check the muscles when you're this tired. I'm forcing that to myself. Gotta say huge. You feel like you're less tired this far out than you were last year? I'm probably going to use tired as far up, but much cleaner. When I was this lean last year, I was like one and a half weeks out. Two weeks out by the time I got this lean. And I was way more tired. So relatively, I guess, last time. So, we get tired. And it means I'll get the eat a little bit more food going to the show, which is a glorious thing. And I'll be less flat on stage. Fuller, thicker, cleaner. Beautiful time to be alive. R Maintenant. Like for sails. More effort and time to spend time with the bed. Good job. If you have any dressed up and damit up before reload. I was getting this point in prep, where I'd have it from a lock asleep or a lock of carbs or a bit of both. When my left, my right eye gets like a twitch and it's just like the underneath bag of my eyes just like, twitching, I don't even know if you can see it, but I thought I'm like an LED eye and it's just twitching. I haven't slept with a night in weeks so maybe I'll try it. You know, I think you know I'm gonna have a fucking eye go on out of the other direction. And that's when you know I'm fucking treated and my eyes can't even focus. Next level of shirt is... I'm gonna have to get in cab and like, I think I'm gonna shave it off. I'm gonna have to get my shave my mother. Is that a Dalton? A hundred Dalton? Yeah. A hundred Dalton like, the most big. A little Balzy. Maybe now the video won't get anything like, it's people like the mother. You never know, because it's a fun day. I'm gonna have to get my hair done. I'm gonna have to get my hair done. I'm gonna have to get my hair done. One arm, machine row. One row of beautiful rows. There is. But you gotta do a lot of weight. I don't even know if I can fit another plate on this thing. Six metal plates on. But only five rubber ones. Noted. Noted for five. So you're ever vibing your jacket into metal plates. I'm not jacked though. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I got it. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked. I'm not jacked.

=== FILE: A Workout and Talk with Chris Williamson [FnZbX0yL5-Q].txt ===

What is up? YouTube. Oh yeah, here. My amy. Tell me a hat. Can I weigh your hat? Sure. I need to wear it. I'm going to try and do it. How small is your head? Really small. It's because I got clamped when I got pulled out of the baby. So you're kidding me. No. You're kidding me. No. When I shaved my head to get my hair trimmed, I was like, mom, did they pull my head with a clamp? When I was born, she said, yeah, why are you asking? I'm like, I'm bald. I can still see red and bald. Anyway, what is up? YouTube. We're in Miami, elevation fitness. And we're going to do carbs and arms, press bum stand. Great, intro. And this is not the answer. You're going to be able to run into the house. Did not say that. Did nobody stuck in this little room over there because he needed to be by himself here. So we're in love jury today. You're such a diva that you couldn't deal with being around the unwashed masses. The unwashed masses. The common folk, as you called them, when you came in. Yeah, you spat on their Lamborghinis as you walked through the front. The other mouseradis and Lamborghinis. GT3 RS. I'd have a truck. I'm a simple man. Quite quick truck. So, stuff forward, you know? It's a poor casual. So, last year, whatever the year before last year, you had by yourself. Yeah, I tore my bicycle three days out. And then this year, I tore my lap ten weeks out. Yeah. Have you thought that like, this isn't for me? It's a, yeah, like, just a total fluke. This entire sport is like you, like, dancing through different injuries. Literally. Elves are in injuries. I tore my hand. I don't want it. The 2019, 4, we can't. You had the stomach thing, 2020, 2021? That was 2018. 2018. As a being a year, where you haven't been injured. 2020 was the only year or something. Seriously, they didn't like fuck me up in my personal life or I didn't get injured. Well, roll on 2024. Right? Eventually, I got to have luck in my favorite. Mmm. I'm like, you want to do arms? So, they're sure it was calves? I'm like, okay. Shouting out Alex Homosi. This is what he does. Every session starts with calves. So, I don't disagree, and I actually really like it. But he's wrong, because he says that calves are the front garden of the body. And I'm like, at best, they're the back garden of the body. The front garden? Yeah. It's the first thing that you see when you walk up to the house. I'm like, nothing, not like a best at the back. Yeah, that would agree. You don't walk up to someone like this. You check them out for up, down, you know? Ah. How was, uh, fucking Istanbul? It was not bad. It was not. Well, we didn't do much. We went to like the hair clinic, sitting on the hotel. What was the heck thing? How was that? Was it painful? It was uncomfortable? Yeah. Like when I put the needles in the back of my head, it was like, nah, ten feet. And then... They don't, there's no local anesthetic, whatever? That's what it is. The needles took, for the anesthetic. Right, okay. So the thing is, those are the pain, is that I know how to ten feet. Exactly. Fantastic. And then they fill your head with the honey, if you like, yeah, I'm like that. Make it mind. And then you're lying on the face down for like four hours, and then on your side for two, and then on your back for like three, so like eight hours is a long-sense. What's the recovery being like? The first ten days are miserable. These are head still swollen, and you look like Frankenstein. Like literally the water in your head starts to come down behind your eyes, and you look like fucking retarded, like a giant forehead, you see it? It's like, it's pretty bad. And then you're covered in scabs, and you can't wash the scabs. You just have to like lie on a prop that pillously has not touching anything. So you couldn't train no exercise? You can't train for 30 days, no exercise, not even walking. I still won't even walking. Not even walking. Not like enough like a walking through that you sweat, you know? Like a walk it in Florida at least if I walk outside of my sweat, but it's so hot. So, wow. Yeah. I didn't know. No one's ever explained, because so many people know like Mike Thurston's had it done, a ton of friends have had it done. No one has explained the brutality at the next month. And then it looked weird for like six months. But then. But then. Centre parting baby. Maybe. If you're lucky. It's gonna be like just in Timberlake from EnSync in the 90s. Yeah. Oh no. Maybe you commented on the announcement. You commented on the post saying like congratulations on the one million. Let's do another at two mill. We hit two mill next month. Really? It's gonna be two mill next month. Yeah. So many people have messaged and got a sea bump made a deal. And like you do that wasn't a written contract. I think you'll find pertaining to Instagram calls number 37. You said we'll do another one at two mill. And you like that. Yeah, exactly. That constitutes a verbally written contract. But yeah. How long has it been? Five and a half years to do one mill. Ten months to do two months. Ten months. That's insane. Scary. Do you move this up? I haven't changed it. I did it. I did it. You're in charge. Don't. I don't. I do have that for like so I'm just doing these two. It's nice. That's cute actually. Yeah. It's kind of cute. Imagine if you did like. Big push day with Jordan Peterson. You're a pro. Can you imagine a place? Can't believe you've got a Camaro. I know. If I was to buy Mustang or a Camaro or a pickup truck in the UK, that's like a joke car. Yeah. It's like a Halloween outfit. Whereas over here it's unironically actually a car that you. Some normal people. People put their fucking car seats in the bag of that. Correct. I'm a daily commuter. Why do I think that? Yeah. It's the back of that car. It's so small. Calling it a focic car is a lie. It's not a focic car. Just go warm up my old arms. All right. What are we doing? What's this? Just seated. Some supernated, some non-supinated. Right now I'm just literally warming up my elbows because they're cold and tight. I've never trained this early in the morning. So just warming up. But eventually the goal is to like pause in like four seconds through deep stretch. Okay. Three to four seconds. Okay. You wanted to pick and choose? That one is the equipment I wanted. So I actually partnered with a equipment distributor. Like connections with everyone. And then I was, they were helping me get everything. So I've shipped from people's basement from the 90s. That's the way. You have some new ponata, some other old like, change driven like, dory and the 80s. Pull over like seven of that shit. Not a lot of those. I have a lot of that. But you did it for a bit. Have you done a full gym equipment tour yet on the channel? Well, you have. Everyone does those. I know. Calvin. Well, you know, thinking about content. Thinking about it. Full gym tour. This is my not-less leg press. I love the cams on it. And then you can play drinking game of how many times the word force curve is used. How many force terms? Force curve. You know, like with the way that the cams are done. That's all that anyone else can do. Yeah, force curve on this thing. What are your calves? You know, like, you know, like, going to belt-driven thing. There's nothing fucking belt-tra poly. Yeah. But do you see how, you know, the see that thing with the red, like, the fucking cable coming over. Yeah. Is it a preacher kill? Looks like it is. Yeah. Yeah. It's not a circle. It's like that. That's a cam. Yeah. Oh. How long until kiddos here? Seven weeks. Cool. Less than two months. How do you feel? I'm excited. I'm excited also because I felt like stress about it because I've been traveling so much. And I feel like corny's been a long life. But I've been traveling like because I want to say that. I'm not because I want to stay home when the baby's here. Yes. So I actually be able to slow down and, like, well, comparing to this world, you know? That's fucking awesome. I don't know how much of a change is going to be in my life. But we'll figure it out. You've been doing, um, reading Baby Books and shit. Yeah. Have you? What's the, what if you learned about how humans work? But how humans work? Probably the biggest thing that I'm trying to, like, implement. Because I used to, no, I've never just sleep training. No, what's that? Sleep training when your baby hits, like, six weeks, six months old. And then when they cry, you just leave them alone to cry. So they self-smooth. Okay. And then they learn to, so they don't, they're not relying on you coming together. Every time they cry, so they're not too, like, people think they're going to be too reliant on you. But that's because we live in a Western society that enforces way too much, like, independence and, like, no social, culture community. So instead of what I feel like I'm, I want to do with corny is giving the baby space and infant space consistently, just to feel whatever motion they're in. Uh-huh. So, like, if they're feeling sad or angry, and they see me and corny, either not come to them or not give them love. Because they're sad or angry, they're going to think things out of an angry, the bad emotion, they shouldn't feel that. And then when they feel the emotions, they're going to shut down and go internal and not reach out for it. Is this comfort? A little bit of gabo matais stuff. Maybe. I know that guy. I know that man's every. I know. I feel like he's really against the cry it out. I'm sure then. Philosophy. So this kind of seems, I'm sure. Simulator though. Yeah. So that's probably our biggest goal. Do you try to help the baby regulate emotions appropriately? Yeah. Yeah. To feel comfortable, to come to us and to show anger and sadness and happiness and understand that it'll be loved regardless of the motion showing and it doesn't have to be a happy smiley baby to receive love, you know? To go. I've been thinking a lot. Security attached child. Dude, I've been thinking so much about feeling feelings. Like, I know that sounds like the most autistic thing that I could ever say. But like, it's all you can do with get along. That is why I mean David and so on and you. Yeah. Like, you had a camera in which speech it was. You did a speech where you said something like, I love myself to feel the feelings. When they were like, yeah. You numb the bad. You numb the good. Yes. Yeah. And there's been really, really thinking about that whole world of. Especially if you're doing the whole podcast. Oh, here's a cool mental model. I understand the evolutionary reason why we get anxious or feel attached or feel sad or have grief or have whatever. That's a really, really great way to protect yourself from ever having to feel feeling. Yeah. Because you're able to rationalize them. It's not anger or sadness or happiness or gratitude or whatever. It's like this adaptive evolutionary reason. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, oh, I'm protecting myself and the tiger in the woods or whatever. And it rips you out of that. So I'm really thinking about it's interesting. You said that about the secure attachment and allowing the child to not have a value of attachment about that run emotions. Yeah. I think that's something big that I'm trying to work on this year. It's so funny how many people in our generation I try to learn how to feel feelings. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. That's what I've done for five years. After I won the Olympian didn't really feel much. I was like, I need to fix this. Yeah. Now we're all like sad and alone and not connected to anyone. But I don't need that without any feelings. You'll like read something or someone will say something and you're all just like, almost have to tear up and you're like, what is that? What does that come from? Fight it. And then you just say, no, no, no. Never think about it again. Yeah. What are the cues that I'm thinking here? I just try and put myself into a position where like the hanging and a comfortable stretch and instead of rocking it up, pull it up at the very top to get that really tight biceps squeeze and hold that squeeze the whole way down for like three or four times. But you're feeling your muscle stretch the entire time. Never beat. Go. Yeah. Some serious forearm run you. Everyone's got something except when you stand next to fill Heath that have meet and greet that. And he makes you like puny. And then he made like a gay, hamacul joke. Talk about a hamacul. You're like, so easy. Yeah. Have you had, do you have a mug of your mouth? Yeah, he crushed. He crushed. Dude, the number of people that have come up about ours in particular. They could didn't do an outsize number of plays. It did like really great plays. It's like, like, 40 million awesome there. But the number of people that bring that one up to me. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Fucking awesome. It looked great. It's ridiculous. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Teach me about this failing failinist thing. That's what I'm getting what you want. You should keep the question of the floor. Yeah. I think one of the things, I think a lot of feelings are connected to feeling with other people. And because we learn when we're young, not to feel with other people, the way to heal that is with someone. Someone who is safe, you know? Like if you find a partner who's safe and you're able to like talk to them about that. And just practice expressing more feelings. I want to talk to those tears. I kind of come up to them and you fight it. Being able to catch, not like in meditation when you catch a thought go. And then you just like, you see it. You pay attention to it and then you kind of like, it does what it does. Doing that was an emotion when it comes to breathing. Getting trying to get rid of it. Someone in meditating, I guess. I know you're failing at meditating and you like, I thought, come, you're like, fuck that thought. Get rid of it. So thinking, like a feeling comes fucked up. You're feeling get rid of it. And then it's all like your whole system that I want to quite instead of like just like embracing it as it comes and paying attention to it. You're allowing your body to do it normally. And then feeling safe to express it out loud to another person. Is that stage two? That stage two. So your body is like, this is okay. It's safe. I don't need to protect myself from this. No one's going to hurt me for sharing this or expressing it. It's actually going to create more feeling. That feels good. Yeah. I did a recently. And I'm like really, really tried hard to be open. Really tried. And all it felt like as I was talking was weakness and vulnerability. Like, like mess. Messiness and, and yeah, just not dialed, not slick. Not aspirational. Like, I don't know. Maybe even it wasn't performative, but because it's so different to me, it feels, it almost feels fake because it's real. Yeah. Does that make sense? Because your normal is. It's like, oh well, like, don't, they don't want to hear about like my personal struggles with this thing. So I'll keep that away. Yeah. It's a really, really working hard on feeling feelings. Generally, working hard on feeling feelings. This is the feelings gem. This isn't the muscle gem. Yeah. That's why I run this side. This is the feeling side. Yeah. This is where we train for feelings. That's why you really close did off. Yeah. That's the way I can cry. Without the guy that drives the Ferrari. Thank you. That can mean first working set. Shocked the muscle. Shocked the muscle. How do I do that? That's what people have these feelings or lack of feeling feelings. Stronger and more. Good life has a reward at the moment. You know? Like you were saying, like, people don't want to hear this. They want to hear like inspiration or like, well put together, like, constructed. That's like what you've done and that's what's given you what connection you have felt. But it hasn't obviously something so missing within that because it doesn't feel fully complete. I just. Like people who like attach that performance based living and they're young. They're like, okay, if I perform, if I'm happy and I do good in this, I get more attention and I love. And then the more they do that life also gives them money and a successful podcast and all these things. And they're like, obviously this is right, but why do I still feel empty, you know? So it's like a harder battle to. Yeah. Why it's weird because, you know, I've got this very neatly tied up story about being a club promoter and, you know, achieving success in a lot of the ways that people say that young people, young guys, especially supposed to, with money and status and acclaim and all of that stuff. And then realizing that that maybe wasn't fully aligned. Okay, well, I'll make some changes and everything's gotten awful or better. But there's still some things that are missing. There's still some things that are fundamentally missing. And I think that what's consistent throughout all of that is this a version to really fully engaging with emotions. Yeah. And that's embarrassing because you go, well, I thought, like the arc of the story is supposed to be neatly tied up with a bow on the other side and you're like, Oh, fuck, maybe I've got to do this again. And that's like, I don't know. At least the first time when no one's watching or when there's no story arc, there's no obligation. Yeah. Where is now to go, like, How do you feel though if there is no tidy bow at the end of any line? I don't necessarily mind. It's just that I thought that I had done that. Yeah. I've got to do it. You know, well, and in many ways I did, like, I've an awful, a better and I'm an awful, or a little bit more aligned in all of those things. And maybe it's holding yourself to high standards and thinking, I think there's more. I really do think that there's more. And I'm interested in finding out if there is, even if it is a bit embarrassing or if it sucks to try and, like, reach what? Like reach whatever that. I think the biggest mind fuck and I have your probably even more of this in me. But it's like when I was young because I had this feeling I was like, alright, let me dive into this whole, like, self help exploration under sitting in the mind of this shit. So I can find what it is that's missing. And I could, you keep, like, if I have the high expectations for myself, so I want to feel more feeling. I want to feel more love and success and everything. But like, in seeking it, you're almost like not finding it. You know, it's not like you're finding something that's out there. It's like, have you ever done a podcast with Peter Crom? Yes. That can't be shit. Yeah. This is all thing. He's great. Yeah, he's a beast. I met him at a party actually, a few, uh, when are your weird little famous people, part-ish? A little bit. Yeah. We weren't drinking baby blood or sacrificing goats at the full moon this time now. Yeah. Why are you laughing? It's the success, well. Like, literally 10 years before I've heard it put into words, if you can be in a bad mood for no reason, you can be in a good mood for no reason. So, and also, having resting serious face is not a life hack. Like, resting smiling face is way better. Yeah. This is really cool. I put it in my newsletter last week. Charles Darwin, it was Darwin day, like a week and a half ago. It's birthday. There's this letter from Charles Darwin. I think it's one of the first photos that he ever sees of himself. It's like the 1800s, not many photos, not like people snapping photos all day. Yeah. And he's seen it. Note to his friend about this image of him, and he says, If this is truly how my face looks, the fact I have a single friend in the world, it may as is me. And it's like, this dude's just the most awful, resting serious face that you've seen. It's brilliant. It's awesome. Did you think of Ryan's win this year? Because obviously he tried to win, tried to win, tried to win and in fact didn't. Yeah. Like, what was different this year from your, you've got an insight into this world. I honestly didn't look at two deeply adding on new computers again. Yeah. I feel like he looked his best ever. He claims his posing was better. Yeah. But I think whatever he did, like, mentally. That's what I really believe, right? And I think well before he was above. Timmer, what he came last year, but he's just almost, I feel like he almost is a fuck. I'm never going to win who cares. Let me just do this. Let me just get on there. Actually, perhaps, my posing has fixed it. Do this properly. Have no injuries this year. Take some time, like, away from Britain and the family, just focus on being selfish. Who the fuck cares? What happens? I just want to look my best. I think you're releasing that pressure. It's body just, like, relax a little bit and it's just kind of like, it's wild. I was surprised by how much of your physical game you see is a mental thing. Yeah. And, like, the mentality plays way more of a part in your, your conception of your sport. I believe so. But it's not even, I don't ever hear you talking about this is how you manipulate your willpower so that you stay on your diet. It's not to do with it. It doesn't really seem to be directly related to the body. Correct. Correct. No. Correct. It's just literally finding the self-sign. Yeah. Trying to be a human. Feeling feelings and taking the pressure off yourself. There's a new buck out. I've got the guy coming on my show soon. David Brooks, it's called How to Truly Know a Person. The art of deeply seeing others and being seen awesome. Stinks of Chris Bumstedt. Absolutely. Stinks of you. It's really, it's really good. He's talking about, um, did you see the Theo von Sean Strickland clip? Yeah. Yeah. So that, like, holding space, you know, and not trying to sabotage when someone else is dealing with things. Yeah. All the rest of it. It's really good. What's his name? David Brooks. David Brooks. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exchange. And he just saw shit that I didn't see. So. Which exchange? Between Sean and Theo. Oh. And he explains this, but I think Sean's got a bottle of water in his left hand. And he's like, like, sort of splashing it around a little bit. And you can see this bit with his right hand, where he's like, going like this. And he's grasping for an answer. Like, he's actually trying to find something to hold on to. Yeah. And Charlie's like, so look at what he's doing. Like, he's, he's grasping for an answer. And then he grips his hand when he's got a hold of something. And then he sort of does this when he needs to self-sove. Yeah. It's fucking wild. I'll send you the video. It's really cool. I see. Where did that shit come from? Charter. When you're an infant. Like. Come on. Come on. I meant to tell Calvin about this, but I never did. When we had so big steak after we trained over at your place. Yeah. We went back. And there was you, Vaughn. A couple of other guys maybe. So you've got this group of dudes who are, like, fucking good luck in young kids. Fucking jacked out of their mind. Eating steak and like cracking jokes. You would think it would be a very, like, masculine, rival-race atmosphere. Yeah. But where is a lot of the time when you sit in tables like that? With guys like that, there would be a lot of posturing and talking over each other and almost trying to get a word in edge-wise and trying to make proof. It was almost the opposite. There was almost silence. There was big chunks of silence. Now it's sat there just sort of observing like this quite calm, sit there. Even though everyone's, again, you know, good luck in kids and jacked in everyone's. So make money and succeed and build this company and do all this stuff. There was this, like, there was moments of silence and, like, peace. And I really, it's obvious, it seems obvious to me that even though there's the aggression, like testosterone side of stuff. That's a, for that sort of a group of dudes. That's a very unique vibe, at least I thought so. And maybe I came in on a day when everyone was particularly quiet. Or whatever and I got a unrepresentative perspective of it. But at least that one evening, I was, who's surprising to see the guys, like, a little bit more. Maybe I was just bringing them the mood down at other. There's guys. No, I mean, there's groups of us within our community that are a little more like that. And those that are not, and none of us are like that. And I think, especially amongst, like, the fitness, like, community of people, with a little click set girl, I feel like we always have, like, all kind of felt like outsiders of that community. And I'm never really embedded in, like, good as a club, no other shit. Most of those guys are like that. And we're just not so we're more of just that. It was really, it was just down, and have our stick with a better thing. It felt like, you felt nice. It was good. casual. We got more, more. Yeah, more. Good. Because of the cams. Cams. Hey, this is, like, a fucking unstoppable object and an immovable force, but in the world of lessping. Like, between me and Chris. Why? Well, because I've got a bit of one in you. Yeah. I've never really noticed yours. It just comes out every so often. What's the word that I really struggle with with, uh, uh, fucking, is it cons, cons sequents? Consequents? Yeah. It's fucking, is yours like saliva building up in your mouth? No, I don't think so. The mind is sometimes is, like, saliva building up in the wrong spot. And I'll just not have to do a quick swallow. I think you're going so like, that doesn't mean, and then I lose track of my tongue in the public. For real. Now, I worked on it for a while. I got a speech coach. So for two years, I was doing my morning walk, doing tongue twist. Yeah. And the one that I had to do was, sinful Caesar, sipped his snifter, seized his knees and sneezed. Sneezed, bro. Say sneezed. Kneezed. It's so fucking, one way or the little. Sneezed is like, crypto night for a guy with a list. Two lots of people. I have a lot of group of men. Well, you feel feeling. Yeah, definitely. So it's, I learned what, like, the way it works. Yeah, gentle smile, a list. Make too much more approachable. You think? Well, you do, if you, it does if you're fucking 280 pounds. Well, people always think, I saw you. I thought you were like, it's a big and timid and a guy. And then you open your mouth. And I'm like, oh, I'm like, that a compliment or a slight roast. But I'll take it. You see the pod I did with Mike Isrittel? No. Really good. I've been diving into the parenting book. So I have a lot of silly podcasts. You know, have you been parenting podcasts? Is there any of those? I'm sure there are a fucking thing. But you've been doing the books. Yeah. How do you really cool conversation with a, uh, mass-to-mind group? I don't, I'm not in any of them, but I just attended some dinner one evening. Yeah. And there's super famous rich people and everyone's got a business and everyone, whatever. And they said, everyone's got any challenges. They're dealing with it at the moment. You know, we got a room of competent people here. Throw it out into the group, and we'll see if we can fix it. Let's do put this hand up. Is I, my wife's eight months pregnant and I don't feel like I'm going to be a good dad. We were all thinking it's going to be about, you know, supply chain, or revenue or accounting problem. And he said, the kids on him on the way and my wife can't wait for the baby to be here. But I don't, I don't feel anything. Like I'm excited, and I want the kid, but I'm scared that I don't have like some flood of emotions. Yeah. And I think I'm going to be about dad. And maybe this means I don't have the kid. Or maybe there's a problem in my relationship or whatever. And it's maybe at least two other people in the room. Guys who'd had kids, and we're like, dude, totally normal. Like absolutely completely normal. Gotta remember your wife got this cascade of hormones going on because she's got this kid inside of her. And you're just like essentially watching your wife get fatta. Like I believe you. You don't have the kid in there, but you're like, maybe you're just eating a lot. I don't know. I'm just kicking around in there. And then they said it took like six months for me and four months for this other guy. Yeah. So I actually be like, oh, this is happening. Yeah. But that was, that was really interesting. And it was so cool that this guy had what he thought was a curse. Like a personal pathology. It was his problem. Yeah. Two of the guys in the room were like, no. Yeah. Happens all the time. That's the weirdest thing is I just feel like so many people reach out to me with a ring. Like, because I've built so many connections due to more than the average person. Most people don't have that many connections. When I found out we were having a baby, I had fucking, I've heard like 30 people tell me exactly that. Wow. Men would come up to me like they're like, let me just tell you that. And then that's one of the first things they say. So I'm like, okay, so just expected that all along. Yeah. I remember we did this episode forever ago about, um, you put it up. I'd put it up a little bit. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. When I was at uni, I had, like, gone back with some chick that I'd fancy parades, but I'd had way too much to drink. I couldn't get it up. Yeah. And I was like, at the time, I thought, oh, this is something wrong. And then you get into your head and it takes progressively less alcohol to cause the same thing to happen. It's vicious spiral. Yeah. And I just told this story and I was like, and it just turned out that I'd basically got my own head and then it went away after a while of realizing that it was going to go away. Yeah. And this dude came up to me after one of my life shows and had tears in his eyes. And he said, you might have seen me, I was on the front row, but I had a seat next to me that was empty. He's like, okay, he's like, like, trying to calm himself down. I was like, what the fuck is this guy about to tell me? He says five years ago, I met this girl and I had whiskey dick on the first night. But she watched that episode of your podcast. So she realized that it wasn't about her. It was just like, I'd had a bit too much to drink. So she gave me a second chance. Yeah. And we've been in a relationship for the last five years. So I just wanted to thank you for like the best five years of my entire life. And I bought her a ticket to come with me. But five hours ago she broke up with me. And I feel like my world's ending. But even though that happened, I just wanted to tell you that I'm grateful that you helped me have the best five days. And we're in the middle of less to square. And the boy is waiting for us to go to some dinner or some thing afterwards. I'm like, I need to fucking, like, mean this guy. You're gonna go and have a little, a heart of a few hours. But yeah, just, that was wild. That was like, that's crazy. You see stories of people message you nice things online, but to see someone, you know, filled with emotion in front of you. Would that feel you with emotion? Yeah, a bit. But then even there, I'm like, don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Like, you can't cry. Even though it's sad and beautiful and, like, terrible and great stuff. Yeah, I can, I knew we even get in that sort of, that was gonna be one of those moments where you probably were like, you felt the tears coming in and like the meditation. You felt you thought it. Yeah. But those are moments where you need to, like, just let it flow, you know? How's the nursery? Did it done? Motherfucker. Too busy reading books, that's why. Everyone keeps asking me that. I'm like, the baby's gonna sleep in, like, there's a little, we have a bass in there. That's like, it's a shelf that comes out for the child, right? It's a dickhead, baby shelf. It's like a little crib, but a mini crib. Is it another one that goes on the side of the bed? Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's like a fucking shelf. Yeah, yeah. You're like, you've got your laptop goes up there and then the draw for the keyboard. And then the baby. I don't know. When does a baby stop being a baby? Like three? It's toddler. Three. What did you start being a fucking baby? I'm honestly waiting for that to happen. Apparently not 36. Uh, uh. Are you another seven years? What, uh. What were you saying no talks in, Paraband-free, fucking, paint in the baby room? Yeah. Yeah. Everything, because flame retardant for a while, they were making all baby stuff flame retardant in catch-on fire, but that's like a toxic chemical that makes it not flameable. So your baby won't be on fire, but might be retarded. Yeah, yeah. Go on in the burns of death, or be toxic. Rest for a while. Ah! He's recording on again, my humor about this stuff, but- Congratulations. Your baby is not a light, but is autistic. Humber? No. It didn't water, but- She wanted to, but the hospital doesn't know how to do the big-it-sav. This is why people have fucking ranches and communes, bro. Sorry, lady. You can't give birth to your baby. Ruh! The way you want. I think that muscle's bad. Ah! No! No! No! No! Hmm. Hmm. You know, looking back when you did the- I need to start feeling feelings. I need to understand emotion thing. Yeah. That was largely because you wanted you to be better, right? And also be better partner and better human and all the rest of it, but it's like, I achieved this thing and I didn't feel connected to it. I should change it. Downstream from that does that feel like preparing to become a dad as well. Yeah. I said that a lot. A lot of what I did, even when I was young. I've always had a huge aspiration to be a father. I've always just really looked forward to having kids. Me too. And so when I was doing a lot of this, a lot of it was about me being the best dad I can be. You know? Like this whole feeling feeling things that we all have. Like, what if I can raise a kid to not have to try and learn that in their 30s? They know it. You know? Imagine. It's not even about learning something. It's about unlearning, not learning it. What makes it? It's already there. It's a snake to us. Come on. Did you therapy? Did you do therapy? Did you do therapy? Did you do, like, did you have to talk therapy? Yeah. Did you? I still do. I've never, I've almost four years. Same person. No. I've seen three people. Do I want to have now as a go? I'm sure she'll always be my best student. I'm just a rematchee. She's rematchee. Oh well. Yeah, I started last summer. I sat next to a friend at dinner. Yeah. Who'd done daily psychotherapy for five years? Like, five days a week, five years. And in Osm. And he extored the virtues of how to change them. And it was real beneficial and stuff. And I thought if she can deal with his bullshit, she can definitely deal with me. Because he's way more fucked up than I am. So it's guy. It was like the canary in the coal mine. Whether or not this woman can deal with bullshit. And I was like, Hey, man, would you mind just he hasn't seen it for a good while. But she's still practicing. Yeah. So I got introed and I started working with it. It's fucking rough. It's really fucking rough. You find a good one. They can be rough for sure, but it works. Why it's not like she's very gentle. It's just so much to unpack. That's what I mean. It's almost like you ever get, or do you still or do you get anxious before? Speaking to her? Yeah. There's a waiting room. A little five meter by five meter waiting room outside. And there's copies of the New Yorker. She must have a subscription to the New Yorker. And I like leaf through the New Yorker. And try and find comics. You know, the little square drawings. I'll try and find one of those that make me giggle. I don't have to think about like, she's going to be real. I sit down and she's got this expectant fucking face on her. And she just looks at me and goes, and just waits for me to speak. Fuck. Damn it. No, you know what it's like to sit across from you. Ah, very good. Very good. I know that it's a meme to talk about my therapist said XYZ. I know it's such a meme, but I think it's working with the therapist that takes you to things about yourself that you didn't know. Yeah. Is like living in a house your entire life. And someone coming in and pointing out a room that you didn't know was there. And you thinking, oh yeah. What the fuck is that door? And you then you go through it and you go, holy fuck. This is where the kitchen leads to. I didn't realize that the, because I always wondered what the back end of that thing. And it makes connections. It makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. It's like that's been there all along. Yes. Yes. And someone else is coming in and gone. You do know that you do this. You're like, no. No, I don't. Oh, no. But it's a super meme. It's a super meme to say, oh my God. But I found it. I said, I opened up about this again, me trying to be totally honest on the show. It's making me a worse podcast like to do this because shit from conversations in therapy starts to bubble up throughout the rest of the week. And I can't unsee it. I can't not. Like a pattern that comes up about. I learned that I'm a people, please. Yeah. But every one around me. For me. And now, you know, I'm talking on the podcast and I'm thinking to, I can't not see that pattern while I'm talking to people. Yeah. What if it makes you better though? And it's not back the moment of break. I mean, the goal is obviously just different. Like transcendent include. Yeah. Right? It's to bring together all of this. Yeah. But this middle section is just me, like. Dropping. Tryna Holdan. The same thing with people is like, I, I'll ask, I'll never. I'm scared if I'm gonna do it, I'm not gonna, like, I'm gonna detach from everything I care about now, and they're like, well, then maybe you were never in a dump of it. Yeah, exactly. Maybe you don't care about it. Oh, yeah. How have you dealt with the increase in attention and stuff, like, just from the world? Keep a small circle, move to a small city. So you're trying to, the people I spend most of my time with other St. people, spend most of my time less than like six years ago, you know? So, I'm my business partner now of change in moving to Florida, but they're still all like, none of them treat me like I'm Seabun, they're just, you know? So no one I spend, I'm majority of my time with, treats me any differently than anyone I've ever had. Do you notice that sort of ambient sense that is just people out there watching? No. Really? Sometimes I think about it and I'm like, damn, but like, I'm usually, yeah. It's not really until I, like, yesterday, walk through there and people like, where I'm, oh, shit. You broke the event for, like, three months. Yes, a day. There's two, three meat and greets going on. And then all of those got ransacked by you trying to get to the green room. It's just a prize too, you know? No, I expect to see you there. Now, I'm just, that's something else I've been, like, feeling a bit recently, feeling. Feeling? Yeah. I don't feel me. Um, that just more scrutiny, obviously going on Rogan, like, every time that happens, there's a big explosion of, you know, the new eyes and people that got things to say and stuff like that. And there's kind of this generalized anti-influencer, anti-podcast sentiment, just like, out there at the moment, in any case. It's not, thankfully, not generated or directed of me, but I'm in the blast radius of it. You know, there's other people nearby that are kind of getting, and I don't want to switch off. From, you know, someone says something nice or if someone's got something like that guy that came up and said that thing, I don't want to discount everything that the audience ever says. But if you accept the good stuff that the audience says, it's very difficult to be like, I just want to go to not the bad. You either kind of accept everything. And then I see how a lot of influences or content creators or whatever get to the stage of going like, right? Fuck you. Like, I don't care about anyone. You're all a bunch of pores. Or you're all a bunch of idiots. You're all a bunch of whatever. Because that's their protection mechanism. They've been hurt by someone that they wanted to love them and wanted to like them. So much that they now just think all, and I don't want to get to that stage. And I'm not. But I'm also seeing the different paths and impulses of how that happens. And then another thing, like trying to be open and honest with the audience, that's hard. Because talking about this is like, oh, what a champagne problem to have. That's, hopefully one of the things. You feel guilty. It's not having any poor coming. Because people are, you have a way better than me. You should feel so happy. Precisely. Fuck. I guess the way that I feel doesn't count. I'll go cry in the closet there. Yeah. Yeah. I don't disagree. I think that's why it's so important to work your doing when you're talking about finding the kitchen, the room and the house you never knew. Yeah. If you discover that shit about yourself, I mean, it's the fucking oldest Gary Vaynerchuk, whatever. The shit people are saying if I hurt to you with this, it's probably something inside you that feels it. So if you know it all already, it's not gonna hurt you. But if someone comes up to you with tears and dwelling in their eyes, something you something so like positive that you help them. And you know that's real. Then that's a positive moment. If someone comes to you and like, you did this and it's fucked up and you know that I'm well, it was fucked up. You're gonna be like, they are right. But if you're a know, they're just being a fucking cynical asshole and you're so confident yourself. You know what? You can depict which good and bad is real and false, you know? But it's difficult. It's hard. That's the end. And you put yourself into way more scrutiny than me. That's true. Yeah. It's way different. Like, we do in Peterson was like, one of the first like, I'm very niche. Yep. Everyone is fitness like Chris is the bodybuilding nice guy. Peterson is like, no one knows who the fuck I am. Like who the fuck's this guy? All the people mad at me for even associating with Jordan B. It's because of all the drama around him, you know? You get that like monthly. Yeah, it's a, what's been your best tool to deal with all that? I don't know. Like, it's rough because meditation would be the one that I go to, but that's not feeling, right? That's releasing and allowing, right? Which is like you're not sitting in the emotion. You're not wondering where that comes from. You're not. They'll form a meditation to sit in the motion though. Yes. But the typical type of emotion is like, you notice it at a rise and then it dissipates because you're not vacillating and reminating about it. So, like the big, I'm working through it. Like I don't have the solution for this. And it is such a fucking champagne problem to be like, oh, all of the things that you want to happen with the show where, you know, you get to speak to whoever you want. People that used to idolize and now like rivals or friends or like someone that you can text for fucking coffee. Like all of these things are great. And then there's this sort of lurking side dish that comes along with it. But I realize this, I wrote it in a newsletter a little while ago that, because you remember the insults and not the compliments. Any increase in attention doesn't feel like an increase in support. It just feels like an increasing criticism here. And, you know, when you first start off, the audience is made up of people that know you and people that are super niche that fucking love you. But then when you start to break out into the real internet, that just picks up morassos. Like there's lots of assholes out in the real internet that aren't a part of the corrodians that wanted to support you. So I'm not, like I'm not built to deal with that, at least right now, like my constitution doesn't deal with that level of scrutiny and skepticism and cynicism and criticism and attention and stuff. Partly because we just covered with being a people of people, please, there is that like combat. I want people to like me. Yeah. I don't, I put a lot of stock in other people's opinions because I always wanted, like, I was wanted other people to want me as a part of whatever they were doing. And then it's very hard to split that off as you're like, yeah, but two million people aren't going to like you. Like obviously two million people or however many, like we'll do like half a billion players this year, right? Like half a billion people aren't going to, like not all of the, like some of them are going to have nasty things to say about. So I think one of the quotes that stuck with me was like, like, it was about setting in front of a crowd. Like if you're setting in front of a crowd and your goal is for them to like you and you're putting yourself worth on the line and you're a fail fail situation because they like you, they like you for something that you're not so you feel like yourself worth it's nothing. And if they don't like you, they feel like they don't like you so you're still worth it still nothing. But if you get on stage and your goal is just to be yourself then you can't fail. Because as long as you are yourself and at least for yourself and if they accept you, then they accept you for who you are. If they don't, you're going to go fuck the two of you are. You know, for being able, it sounds nice like that. But they actually build a little bit. So that's very different. Yeah. Yeah. Attention social media. Like just the amount of people you can have that have attention on yourself. It's not normal. If humans aren't meant to experience that. Scary. We're about a guy who is staying along swim. Right, actually? No. So similar, might as well be. Simmo, shit, yeah. And someone asked him at what point he felt the most emotion. You know, there was times when he might have drowned and there was times when stuff might have gone wrong and all the rest of it was he scared, was he whatever. And he said the only time that he felt the emotion was at the halfway point when he got to an island and at the end. And I always think about that guy. I think he was pulling a log like Ross did with his triathlon. Yeah. I always think about that guy as like the time that you feel emotions is when they accelerate or desalert. You know, if like your mum got an uncertain medical diagnosis. After about four days, that would just be life. Right, like it would be awful and you'd feel bad. But you would have a climateized to like that and be a little bit of anxiety. So, okay, and this is how I am now. But then if it changed, it was like, you've got the all clear, there would be a nation. Or if it got worse, there would be, right, you really only feel the acceleration and the desaleration of emotions. Yeah. Or, and I think the same is true with lifestyle. You know, you feel the change in scrutiny. Like you feel the change in these things. And I think that's an opportunity to like see what arises and go, okay, well, this is a time now where I can actually adapt to whatever this new world is and be like, okay, what is that to learn here? Like how is this making me feel? And the last 12 months have just been like consistent change. Change change change change. So, yeah. Definitely in that season of life. Yeah. But like I say, I really don't want it to be, I can totally 100% see. Like you saying keep your circle small. Or like, is it the Drake thing like no new friends? Yeah. Like all of those different, they're all coping mechanisms for there's lots and lots of attention on me and I don't know if the people out there have my best intentions at heart. Like that's what that is. Yeah. Uh, and I totally get how that's a good thing. But you don't want to do that plus resent the whole world. Because you see that in the turn of people online that have got this like bitterness against like everyone. This like nameless faceless enemy out there. Yeah. And they use that as fuel. But I don't think that that doesn't, that doesn't feel like the way that I would want. To let for sure. But I can feel this, this pivot. It's like, you know, choose your future Western man. And it's like, which path do you want to do? Do you want to be? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, see it. No, I mean, I definitely think defense or not. You need to be a lot more cautious about what you let in. But I definitely don't think shutting off your circles is like the best. If I get idea, I have to better have a better bullshit right there. You don't do out-trows on blogs. Do you sometimes, yeah? What do we just do with it? No, what's it? That was it. So nice. Yeah. No, that's true. That's fucking awesome. Unless we've done film and screen. You might have never mind. So even my what is that? I think we've done a film and screen. Yeah. I think we've done a film and screen. Yeah. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. So even my what is up YouTube started for me not me awkwardly not knowing how to start a video. I was like one time I was just like what is up YouTube. And I just went and then did the next time I was doing. I think. Yeah.

=== FILE: A Workout with David Laid [jWhjDcp5fTY].txt ===

What is up YouTube? Boys are gonna beat the whole time. See if girls try to save lives. Anyways, boys are headed on a low road trip, going down to Miami, reliving some of the glory days here, we're going to a gym shark event, and these are like the first ever events I went to back in like 2018, when I sat in the front of the first big brand I ever really signed with. And they're coming down to Miami, so I'm like fuck it. If we can put up some of our manager's stuff right there, put them all to the there, we're gonna give boys some free energy drinks, all this stuff trying to get some exposure for the brand. And Mr. David Light is gonna be there. Ryan Terry is gonna be there, Phil, he's gonna be there, Chris Williams, and he's gonna be there. So I'm gonna get to meet up with all the moms and Dave Light in a long time. You guys know I love Mr. Light. Hopefully he can show me some magic tricks. That was like some of the OGU tube Dave's too, to some magic with David Light. I think that was LA. Jim Shark event we did. But we're driving down there just leaving now, so it's about a two hour drive. Gonna work out with David today. We're leaving a little bit early, but I was going to. And it's just kind of a grand old time or even old memory. So see you down there. I love Miami traffic. It's like the car for a way too long. My lower back is very sore and I'm tired. So it'd be slamming some free workout in the car. It's efficient my favorite flavor flavor. I've had anything we've ever made. Citrus Creek, the central pre-workout. Like a lot. He ate the label. I don't like the gold bonnet. I don't like metallic. So I'm probably going to get rid of that on the next run, but taste delicious in it work. So a lot of night is so. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. And you feel what being, that this next Jim Shark event happened in the past four or five years and nothing. I don't know. I'm excited. How was that fun at the? I don't know how many people have followed me for a long time. I've done that, but they've always been a lot of fun. For only time, we were in Australia. It was with Jim Shark. I thought to go surfing, do some cool shit. So now I don't have any obligations. I don't have to stand in line tracks. I'm on a time enough to do anything. I can just show up the day before. Leave what I want to do what I want. So. Even better. The good is. The question is, are we going to take a look at the picture? So picture. And the blue is pants. Do you? I think we have some modest regrets. I think we have some modest regrets. I haven't done any more. Probably shit. I think they're putting on your fras right? Like six months. They want me to have a seat. Try hard action over here. Then an ND filter. What do we shoot around the F-negative two? You're just gritting behind your little camera. Yeah, I got a fat unibround. I'm all bubbly and stuff. It looks like my parents came for their filming. Did I meet? Easy, we just met. No one saw that. I saw it. I have a good enough to. How heavy? Yeah. My boat was going so well. I hit like two-ten. I said, like, fuck it. I was eating like eight dandy pancakes a day. 75, 80, maybe 75. Are you actually only going to go up to 90? No, I'll go up to like 95. Okay, then we'll get a separate bench for him and then we'll have our like one-times. I can do 100. You can get that. I'm going to get some lighter in between. I'll get a look. It look, you gotta give my ligaments some mercy. So you might need to eventually resolve fusion a few extra reps. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. Oh, wow. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, shit. My man, I'm sorry. Hello, Calvin.

=== FILE: A Workout with Ryan Terry [_6IVtPBz3b8].txt ===

Trip What is up YouTube? Back at elevation gym room waiting for the current raining men's physique, Mr. Olympia Champion. That's a lot can buy the door in here. It's the last pretty version of myself, but shorter, less pretty version of myself. I say that because the way more beautiful than I am. But Ryan Terry's on his way here, we're going to work out. That's the event today, I'll do a stream shark. It's fucking bonkers to see how good these guys are running at ends, especially having a few events for a while. If they don't even compare them together, they do here. So it's difficult to see firing to see and to have the brand that they've built like this is insane. So here's this little fucker walking in now. He's actually five minutes late, but I wanted to send like you five minutes early, but it's a little late. You're late old man. What's the fuck? You got me waiting here forever. You wouldn't want to limp you, now you're a big hot shot. That's how it works. That's how it works. I just want to sleep. That's how it's going to do. If you canceled, I would have gone to sleep too happily. Half a week. You got it? You got it? You got it? That was so nice. You got it? You got it? You got it? You got it? You got it? I did like an hour. It's crazy. Yeah. It's getting, it's, it's a stuff, yeah. It's getting, it's, it's a stuff, yeah. I'm not saying else to prove now, mate. That's the best part. What's that mate? I've got it. Work in sets of a triple drop of some of that. Couple super sets? What was going to do like, two middle or three working sets in there? I could triple drop of some of that end. Sure. Yeah. A lot of things. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Say again. Say again. How do you like being called? Do people call you champ now sometime? Yeah. That was my favorite thing I ever heard. It was like a sub champ. I was like, oh shit. Oh yeah. I'm usually eight to twelve rep. I've been doing a lot of like one second hold for a second negatives. Yeah. It's honey going. You're doing that. No, I actually have a guy like a, NFL NBA guy who trains them. Just drink training for a bunch of products. Can you help me do shit so I don't hurt myself again? Yeah. How heavy do you normally do? Really heavy. What? Really heavy. Really? I don't train like that. It's also the same. The last two years of training alone. Touch water. No injuries or anything that way. There's been training a lot like to a lot of, Really been training later now. Yeah, way lighter. A lot more control. Exactly what you're doing. But you want an Olympia like that? Exactly. Imagine that. Well, put six pounds on as well. It's just crazy for me. The process for like ten years and ever put a pound. You can say it's a bigger thing you changed. I'm a buyer. Just a posing. Yeah. Not even your training, just a posing. Well, no, we're training the training last year. So two things. One of us I was doing my backpow. I was hitting like um, because I was training with super everybody. I was doing like normal, like, you know, what ride? When I saw Stephen, why are you doing it? I was like, I've done that for the last ten years. So what are you meant to do? And then you just like, if you pinch my lower back, put me chest all. I think anyone. See, that's right away. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly that. Yeah, exactly that. Maybe I should've made it for the next year. That way. Honestly then, how you feeling about becoming a dad? I'm genuinely very excited. Yeah. I don't know what my health my last going to change. I don't know how you got it. I've already feel like tired and strong. Yeah, with all of the shit I'm doing. So I'm like out of baby to the mix and no sleep. It'll be interesting. Yeah, that will be fun. I'm at least not traveling for like too much. But that'll really help. I'll tell you the truth. He's seen it first. I'm just like, look at everyone kids again. He would tell me that. Do you think I like playing with your kids? And I hand it back. I get a little blown. Yeah. Smart man. Nice. Nice mate. I'll be with your gym compared to this. Maybe about just the size of the room. It's perfect. I want a 40-pound square feet. Yeah. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Look. Yeah. Last one shoulders. Easy right. Yeah, good. Yeah, good. You need some mate. Come on, Mr. Olympia. There you go. Thing is though, you know, after the limpia, I was like a king for two days. The third day got back home. And by the middle of the day, so I was in a skim. Took you down on the carball boxes. Yeah, broochin' off after all the builders are like, It's only gets worse there. I had the night of the Olympia in the next day. You've had it enough. Moving on. We're doing for five years. We're going to fucking... All right. Oh, well, I think that was good. I was on a podcast with a Flex Wheeler. And he was going to me. Oh, you're living the dream and wasn't so like the mission in here. Look down there. I'm a merry-gold, because I've been mocking floors. And I ran back. I was like, yeah, living the dream. I've got people's piss all over the planet. Yeah, fantastic. You're a true hero. Ah, I expected. Ah, I expected. Oh, good. Awesome. Awesome. Nice. Good. Solling. Eat it, keep going. No, yeah, yeah, I'm going to joke in boy. Yeah, so back to reality in it. So, but like, you work so hard not even thinking about what it's going to feel like. Yeah, and you get that victory. And then you almost don't know how to enjoy it. Yeah, but that's what people say. I've enjoyed it. Like what's it going on? I said to all these things I was going to do with a title. Like I've got to leave and then I've got it. I don't know if they were there. Just like, looking. Took me three years to walk into it. It was like, and that's what my thought where I prepped my mind to like, depresden enough to enjoy it. They were like, I think when you enjoyed it. And now I saw sort of, for me, the content we were saying about you learning to be president and being there. Because that was my problem. All I kept thinking, I still do it now. And I'm trying not to, is that right? What kind of do with it? I've got, I'm not blind at all. I've got to do that. Instead of thinking, just fucking enjoy it. Enjoy it. Yeah. You know, your whole life to capitalise. You've always been there, though, and I'm doing it. Yeah. Yeah, see how things change when you become a dad, like, if it drives you to it, or if you, whatever it takes that time away, for me, in the early days, because it was cried, who shit didn't want you. Wasn't that bothered, but now he's three. I've smoked him three times a day. He's like, that ain't when you're coming home. I missed you now. Is that, are you going to read for me tonight? I'm like, oh, fucking one, I'm going to be over there. Kimmer or what book has read, but it was someone talking about like, leaving for all the time and traveling to work. And they were telling their kids, like, I'm sorry, I got to go. They got to help, they got to help make money. What my family and all this stuff, and then the kids looked at him, like, the daddy, what if I don't eat, then do you still have to travel? And he was like, I literally started to cry, I'm like, yeah. Yeah. That is it. Because my brother and little took him to football today, which I taking the football at, yeah, soccer. But then, I saw him all his game today, and I was like, I should have been me. Fucking hell. That's my thing. It's tough for sure. Yeah. Again imagine. So, if I've done, he said it was it, 10 weeks. You just had off, just training or what, or just had a rest from, because he said he wasn't going to be in back training. I took him about 10 weeks off like everything. Yeah, that's like nothing pretty much. Yeah. So, first time I have done it, we're not intentionally that. That was just because of the, you know, the gym building, every, I was eating off. There's no point in his, yeah. Yeah. Right. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm going to do the press. You want to do dumbbell or machine? Don't do machine. What do you want to do? I thought you were going to play it when you looked at that machine. The most entused two champions ever. I don't want you on the other. I picked lateral ridges that you picked. All right, we'll do a press. Which press? That one, right. Yeah. That one. Yeah. All right. There. There. There. Yes. There. There. Bye. Bye. Oh. Oh. Little D.L. Thanks for the press. I'm going to, with the flags, right? Don't make it. What arm is it? I mean, it's a straddle me. You all have to do that. That's good. Let's go that. Come on. Nice. Good. Don't make. Nice. We'll control. It's all in. You missed Canada. I missed my parents. I just didn't know that she's not here, but nothing else. Just my little. Good. Good. The Jake L.R. video. Got home. Yeah. Thank you. Young old man. Why is it by sweety? What? The second one. When I got one of my favorite. Everybody said that. In 2019, I almost shouldn't have won. It was up in the air. Yeah. And then I came back. And I was like, I didn't really even expect to win. So that's a bonus. Yeah. That didn't feel too much pressure on me because not everyone really was like, it was just like, can he prove himself? Yeah. So it was almost just my year just to enjoy it. Have fun. Yeah. You've already got your win. Let's just prove what I want for myself that I can do this for me. And it was way more like chill. One of my best love. I was so chill the whole time at the great prep. But it was COVID. So I just didn't do anything else for that. Yeah. And I mean, I know you're going to win. Well, it's like, no, for proof. That's me. The first one's obviously good. But the second one. It proves not only to. So everybody else that you are. It wasn't a fluke. It wasn't a fluke. It wasn't a fluke. Yeah. So the second one's always better than the first. Yeah. Well, I say, just forgot so much on. But that kind of drove me to do it though. So last year, because I've had the British championship, another round of it. I had the new born. I had the link at the gym building. It's fucking mad. I was living on two hours sleep. I was training 12 till two at night. I was about four till six to my cardio. And I was on sight all day. If you're a U.N.I.R.I.R.I. I don't think why you think that might be a good way way help. But I also think part of the reason it was higher is to enjoy it. Was because you were in such a state of stress for so much. It was going on and all of a sudden you got it. You're like, what? Yeah. Where is this? You're not going anywhere. If you want to retire next year, you can, whatever you might lose, you'll build back up, but you probably won't. If you just take your time, be selfish as fuck and enjoy that. You're family and that. I need to. I know what you mean. Never. Everyone else. You'll fuck yourself. Tell everybody to go fuck yourself. Exactly. I love that. It's so safe. How are you? You're fucking okay. You're fucking okay. You're a good. Nice mate. Five solid. Six. Good. Seven. Eight. Eight. Nice. Nine. Five up. Go. Great. Good. Four. Got a matchet. Five. Four. Four. Got a matchet. Five. Four.

Eight- Warriors. Eight. I'll just return tomorrow. Yeah. Sorry? Ah, maybe. It's up in the air. I'm excited yet. So Jim, I'm not worried about you being lazy. We trained yesterday so we taken to the L. I'll be going, guys. Oh, sorry? I'm not, I'm going, but not compete, obviously. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm not being... No. What's your task in your opinion on it, Chris? Oh, I can't do like a machine. What's your thing with that action? How do you be serious? How do you do, Chris? Hey, make food. It's not out, buddy, is it? No, no, no, no, no. No, I only have one of you that worked in the company. I don't think you'd be excited to switch off that. No, I just can't. You're just supposed to say it, mate, to say it. No background music. I can't hear anything. Yeah, whatever. You've changed. Oh, no. You've come all the way up. No, I've got... Let's see. I've got a nine now. I've got this one. Pop side. Come a bit of cool, mate. That's some chaos, then. How can you mind if you should not have a penny? I barely have any at the L.M. beer. That's about... Nice, Chris. What a pleasure I did. That was a new one. 2018, yeah. What's going on, man? What is that? That's mental. What place were you at? 1990. Sir, you were up there for sure. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that you. Yeah, I placed 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1. First. Come on. Last year as well, I was like... Well, you didn't come second. Six, ten. Twenty, fifteen, the year, 41. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because we were in court and we went on to... We were here together and stuff. The thing was, that was the most frustrating year for me, because obviously honey and Jeremy were like a proper team, weren't they? Yeah, yeah. And our member was bed centre in 16. He looked like a porcupine. Never moved. And then right then, they moved us. And then, like the crowd just went, Roo, so they put me back and then sent us off. So I was like, where does that pour? Is that what happened there? Yeah. And then I come second and I was like, Oh. And then I just knew what... How many had Jeremy won before that? Three or two. That was the fourth? That was his third, I think. Yeah. Yeah, how was it back? That was the second. Especially, you could be like, Yeah, after like, dominate the move amount. You know, it can't be like, maybe. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah. I think it, yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's getting 9' or something. Oh, that's a gym. RT fit. Alright, kids, so that was a great workout by Mr. MP and CP Olympia. We've got to say that MP. People are offended if you know. I know, right? Trading like some true tramp series. Yeah. But, you know, we had a long day. We met a lot of people, so give ourselves a little bit of grace. Yeah. You're nice. We're a heart to heart to feel in the workout. So we're growing our heart strings. It's getting a bit of emotional. That's what I do, you know? I'm feeling the last, so a lot being a dad. So getting the dad bond. It's taking easy nowadays. It'll be rough. One day we'll actually train together and prep in actually train. Yeah. Well, you have to have lunch before, so we talk it all out. No, but yeah. And then we'll have lots of space. Some bullshit, like, yeah. Alright, there we go. But that's it. That's the wrap on that. So another day tomorrow. We're horrible. This whole youth is here. I'm terrible. I am. I'm terrible. I am. I'm terrible. I am.

It minefucks me at the same time. I was at a zero-callure and I never did zero. I mean the last four years I didn't do a zero-callure at all. When you tell me to eat more I was like, I don't think I didn't want to. You're probably not going to want to do that. You're just fucking eating. I think it's 100%. So you used to being starving and suffering that. Yeah, you have to. Until we got it and but this time is different but it's always good to learn. You know, the kids are already under your weight.

Like Taco Bell or some shit. And now it's like the weird fetish for you. Yeah, it's a food fetish. Yeah. But beside that, I go for some walks with the girl, of course. Roll on a stem, living a fucking boring. Oh, I know that would be boring. I'm living a boring life too. It's my best thing you can't kill time. Where do we sell the limpies? Yeah. I don't even know what you're doing. But you're all doing. What? What do you all doing? I'm not. I watch shows. You can nap right now. They're like maybe I like meditate and then I'll lie there for another 45 minutes. Half in half in I'll sleep. Yeah, for me it's super hard to get napped in. I try after breakfast, but after my meal one. Yeah. It's more like, okay, let's go on on on on. Maybe I get a super forwarder than I need to pee again. Yeah. Then I lay down and then I'm like, okay, 20 minutes, then I can eat. Yeah, okay. I watch some YouTube stuff. I go into some comments. I look just 40 minutes straight on Netflix, which show I'm going to look. Can't find anything. To decide, okay, I don't. I'm not into everything or something. I watch UFC a lot. UFC? No. I watch anime in prep. Awesome. I've been watching the YouTube guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a newer one. It's good. I started watching Bleach to the sea. I didn't have anything. Yeah. It's cool. I'm just like, that's like a thousand episodes or something. No, I mean the new thing, which is a lot of action. Oh, a lot of action. No, I watch that. This cool. It's just one fucking season. So we need to wait another two years. Yeah. But this one season was pretty good. Yeah. Lecoson. I remember hearing that there were bones at the Arjac어� трuf. Okay, this exercise? Yeah. We started with this really? Yeah. My joints were fucking dry and I remember my joints. Yeah, this guy was fucking netty as hell. So it was funny. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. Not at all. The wind was also pretty low enough, isn't it? I got up to 255 for like a couple weeks, but that was it. Can it hours 20? 20. 20. 20. It's a good old maple syrup. Jesus. Very nice. Coming down 40 plus pounds to make way. Everybody, that's the fucking age. I'm sure you also pull more water when you're young. Also a post-competition. I can see it. I mean, I've never started over to 65. I've been 271s in my life. Okay. But my wake-up is always 240. So if I ever got 265, I stopped turning on growth. No, it's just water in me. I mean, I'm holding so much water and the older I get every year it's getting less and less. It was at a rebound after. Yeah, my goal is to eat like shit after the show. No, not at all. Really? Back in the days. Of course, my first competition. Destroyed everything. But I went up 20 pounds in a week, but in three days. But then after like a few competitions, I never like eat super much. I do a lot of prep food. And you put on 50 pounds. Yeah, I put on so much water and then from one to the other competition it stopped getting less and less. Now after the Arnold's I hadn't like a rebound. A big rebound at all. You done with these? All the shit bro. I ripped the shit off hard. No respect for the gym. Let me tell big ass fans they owe me a new fucking plug. I'll send the advice to you. Big ass fans. What the fuck are you plugging in your fucking pants? It's not working. It's not broken. It's not German engineering. I mean, yeah, I see the calves. Those are German made. Not this kind of stuff. It's only secret to big calves being fat all year. Bro, being fat and being like walking around everywhere. We didn't have like big refits. We just said you're having one right now. But it wasn't that brief. It was like more you felt it a refit. Yeah, we increased the calories it everyday from like 250 grams of carbs to 500 500. You know, I think that's a big refit. My own normal 100 grams. Who's she? No, normally it's 800. Yeah, skinny bum. No one. But your carb loads are pretty big. Those two days with also a Z-800. Probably. Yeah, I saw it. It was a 800. Oh, they're 101. Yeah, I think. Yeah, I used to go. Yeah, it's always different. I mean, some days. A totally good hour enough. At the other day, you eat like 1,000 and it's your wake up or light it and they're 4. I never have those days. Yeah, I mean also. I thought he's well done quite a bit by the end. Yeah, this is the most of every in the. I've never had more than one refit in the last five six weeks of prep. I've had like five. No, me too. I mean, when I stopped the prep, I don't get any refits until like six to eightish weeks old and then my body and my metabolism's fire. Fire in and then I get them every week. I mean, it's good you weren't traveling at the end of the prep. Yeah, I feel like you're like, kind of stuff going on now. It's just a two hour drive across the state and you're there. Yeah, that's so good. They'll go to the mindset. Yeah, you got to do that every year. Yeah, that you should get like a helps a lot. If you go to Vegas next year, yeah, go to like Arizona in the bottom, like outside of the strip, can there be for four or five weeks? That's really nice out there. Yeah, I mean, just don't fucking shoot your brains out on an airplane. Always. Depends yeah on what the circumstances in life are. I mean, to come here to the states more than what also be a cool thing, but it's sometimes it's not possible with like family stuff and private stuff going there. So I always enjoy and be thankful for the time I'm here and be able to explain with a few guys and those crazy dims though, but I think the move is smart to build. I think to move, I'm saying to come for you. No, I don't think so. I'm going to buy your thing here. I think that's a who can shut this off. Yeah. But a future, definitely. I think you don't really really can doctor to know how to bodybuild it. Yeah, for helping like, as hell. What's going to happen? Oh, may it can happen? Yeah, he did also stuff with Reagan, Reagan told me about it. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Some basic stuff. Not like even in your 25 now. It's still better to get ahead of it than wait till something happens. Yeah, you think, start early with stem cells. You might not necessarily that, but like proactively getting your body healthier. You've had to be like, when I retire and I'm sick. Yeah, there may be too late, you know. But what's the theory of now? What kind of therapies you're doing? He does a lot, but that tells us one of his main things, PRP, especially I do a lot of different types of peptides, like knowing which one and how to use them and all the shit. Oh, barely sweating, but like, what's the next? It was hard when I was still like just I've acclimated, yeah, lost 20 pounds, the more cardio. Yeah, you did a lot of cardio this time, huh? Me? Yeah, 40 minutes? That's not a lot for me. I used to do two hours. 45 minutes is here, it's fucking a breeze. Crazy. Like can I do more? My first threat by it 12 hours. Now, since I'm doing 30 minutes, most of the year, yeah, we like, stable 30, then we drop to 25. Now we get out of here, I hate it. I like to stop my direct. If you love me too. My cardio now is like not cardio. It's like a walk on the treadmill. Because my way was coming down too, so I just like just to move and like get my body ready for the day. I'll do like 40 minutes walk, but it's like nothing. And I walk over to revive down the street. Set my ass in the infrared sauna and walk back trying to warm up. Yeah, yeah, cool. That's it. The princess invited me in her palace. It's beautiful. Hopefully you can come back to the time when we can work out like real men. Yeah, with all about 270 pounds when you're, you know, I'll be 260 and I'll be like somewhere. We don't know it yet, but yeah, definitely. I'm 10 pounds over you now. You'll be 40 pounds over there. That's how life goes, huh? But yeah, good work out, good beginning of the peak week. Like I told you before, it's all about respect, you know, when you'll be a, when you want to be a good champ or great champ, you need to, you need to give some respect on your respect and the shit talk with you is more like an even shit talk. It's just, you got ugly shoes on. Yeah. And he's all this fucking good race. So I mean, fact spit it, but so I dare I'm excited for this next week. We're going down to Orlando. Do you know our stuff on a day of the business and yeah, yeah, any last words from you? No, maybe you'll give up the title to, no, you. You can still got a climb up the second place before you get first bud. You got to take a Ramon. We've got a wait for Saturday. We'll be waiting till next year, Saturday. Maybe the year after that or the year after that. He keeps continuing. He keeps. I don't know what it is. It's chin mock. I find a new year every year, so I get rid of me yet. You young bucks keep me young. Yeah, even younger. Everybody's telling, huh? It's getting young and young about now I got all the contacts I need for for some aging, for some anti aging. I got you. So next year, I'm going to be back in the junior category. Junior. Junior are a good old guy to keep you young and healthy. So you keep getting better. So I have a reason to keep getting better. You know, my secret. You're odd. But it's really it's crazy to see how much younger you're. How much younger I look. You look. You actually think I do. You know what Alicia said? Alicia said it's because of the ugly hair. So you had last year. Oh, yeah. It looked so bad. She said it looked so bad at all. He's looking so much better. Because I was what was the fucking idea of that's just my hair. It had started balding. But bro, you had like the fool. What is the bullet you mean? The bullet that she had that last year. She hated the bullet that shaved it for stage though. What do you have on stage? No. The stash and just shorter hair. I was just balding. Okay. That I think that makes you look really old. Yeah. I have honestly been way healthy this year. I was gentle on everything. It took time off. I was like low dose in it all to be healthy. So my body feels better. Some prime office. Didn't do the Arnold. Yeah. The fucking Arnold. Why not? Don't do the Arnold this year. I'm gonna do it. Don't do the Arnold this year. Bro, bro. We have all been on the lampia. We have all been on the lampia. We have all been on the euro. Coming up. For your own. For your own. It's just a thing there. And for your youth. Yeah. You don't understand what three months of rest does. And in six months of off season does to a body. But where should we end? Three or thirty in the off season? I don't need time. You can't be any better. Yeah. I can be better. But I need to like. I haven't. My weight hasn't changed in four years. I've gotten better every year. You know what? I want to. Since I'm 13 years old. I want to win a fucking hour of plastic fire. So it's more like in the dream. And dream I'm catching. You know. It's like maybe I'll do the Arnold this year too. It's a fucking. It's not the same prestige. It's still limpia. But for me it's like just five percent It's like just because it's the other iconic thing. And I mean Arnold from from Europe from Austria from you know. Yeah. When in Germany honestly when you say I want the Arnold classics everybody's like the big year. I mean. Oh and then when you say you too when you say you want your limpia everybody's like I had it's like it's like the biggest show in bodybuilding. Because they don't know. And when you say drop the name Arnold there like three go. Take everything. Well you want to be a big fish and a small pond. No I just want to impress my old neighbor. Well neighbor when I'm telling him I saw the picture. I showed him the picture of Rafaunald and he's like. You're my man. You're a real man. He gave me his hand at the first time in 25 years. Like he's like that's a good boy. That's a good boy. That's a good boy. Get into the respect of your old man neighbor. That's like that's what you're feeling. When you get that respect you're like walking out of your your house like this every morning. Big dick. Have a little talk with him like what your every day. You're like you're in your garden. Yeah. All right so wrapping up this video probably the least intensive training day but for one week out and we're training arms. The goal now is just not to hurt yourself and just fucking do what we do. So there's good to see my ears again down and forth. Yeah I got a nice little pond. Yeah I can't complain. This community wet up. The biggest pants. It's up. The sponsor plugged again. Fund for me. Germany with warm. Warm fan. Warm fan? Warm. That big ass. Yeah but not gonna hold it you know. Yeah. Then I need to heat me up but yeah good little sash. Yeah we had a good little workout. You know we're seven days out tomorrow. So we're getting there. The beauty of our classic addiction is that. No one's really an asshole so we can actually change together and fuck around and you know earth is really really ugly shoes on today but I still love him and I'm really he still loves me. I'm from making weight and he's gonna fucking shove fit. A depository at my eyes if I don't make weight so I can we'll prepare for this year so you never I don't want to do cardio I'm just gonna picture you with the glove arm. So as well yeah it's gonna be a wrap so we'll see you guys later. You see Mr. Errs in Orlando and that's you guys later.

=== FILE: BACK WORKOUT WITH IAIN VALLIERE [dK8UR_0tZf0].txt ===

I'm gonna go waste. Looks like me one week out. I'm gonna kill myself for the next fucking six weeks just so try and look like that. What's up YouTube? We're with the runner the track star. Mr. Rommet track star. Mr. Lane Belieri. Lane Belieri. Back in Florida and his crocks. A hoodie and pants. I thought you might be wearing shorts now. You're tired. I might be wearing tights. I'm the way like three quarter light tights. Yeah, that's my chance. Still pants. So like kind of my calves. We can still see my quadra feet. So it's like the optimal look for it. It's a good frame. It makes your closet bigger because you're like the exact same thing. But it's fucking hot outside. We're in the gym with the way CNE still dress like this. Yeah, I get it. I haven't been doing these body-to-wear. So I gotta make sure I'm thoroughly warmed up here. You know, you're shredded, though, I'm sure. I'm very lean, but like I haven't done like just a back workout and well over a month. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, like I might do pull-ups and a row. That's it. Yeah, well, you can put me through and then jog around the building. Oh, I'm gonna fucking train. It's gonna be interesting to see what I can actually do something. You know, I'm gonna have a bit right now. Yeah, it's good to be doing back. If you do like three sets, I might just do like one. They have a big deal. We'll do one good set. It'll be every week. Well, yeah, we got Ian back here. We just did a podcast. He's talked about his fucking retirement a million times. So we're not gonna beat the dead horse, but jabbered on for an hour and a half. So go learn back. We're back into the world. So you're gonna be doing a lot of cool shit on YouTube. We have to over talk about a lot of living life. After bodybuilding. So stay tuned to that. But today we're bodybuilding because I'm so five weeks out. So we're getting in the night's little back workout. I feel like I need trucks. You know, they're going to be able to warn them. Yeah. What size of your these are 12? I think it's 13. Just what is it? 12-based wide enough? Oh, it's huge. Yeah, it's great. It's all like there. But where do you want to be having folks that are really pleasant? It's not really a small reason. Oh, they're done. I thought we were, yeah. Once you wear them, I want to see where them in the house. I wear them everywhere now. Yeah, all I care about is be able to read my code. Yeah. So if you go one size bigger, she got some room. But if you put them in sport mode, like this, put that down man. Whoop. I can feel it's good for you to run. I'm ready to run in the beautiful. But yes, let's go on. So stay tuned. We're going to be doing that workout. I hope we think that I got to do. Maybe I'll tell you and tell me what to do at the end of the workout. And we'll just get to make the most of it. So stay tuned. Let's do it. I can tell. My one cap has a little more like your issues than the other. Yeah. So like what feels tight on one leg and what feels down the other is like a completely different. Probably more than just probably. Sure. This one like doing with the bed leg. So like I guess more as I'm more soullious. It's like we tighter. Or this one stretch with the street. Like getting more into the gas truck is like way more. Kind of. My whole left leg. Like crank out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got it. When you do a workout, what's your like back? Or even doing it back to the book of Brad. Like working sets. Like exercise is what we looking for. I do it 2 working sets. One of them is often like a drop set or something. If I don't, and it feels good. I'll do 3. Yeah. that's six exercises, the warm and up was a pullover and then I would try to do bento-baros, take the past here again, so it's a little fucked up in the machines. Yeah, cool, cool. But it's just heavy. Nothing new? No. But I'm not home. I'm just going to do it. I'm going to work out how you're pushing like that. You're just like, like, what I've been doing, what I was doing for the first and a while, is like a pose of super sets and I would make like a striker for exercises. So to say if I would do like flat bench with a bento-baro, like two arm dumbbell roll, and then I would do like a dip and a pull-up. I would do like all four with like yo break, and then take like two minutes and do it again, so I'll keep my heart rate up there. So like by the end of that, I would make it so that by like, if I would say three or four rounds of that, by like the end of it, I was getting the sets like just with soft failure. Now what I've been doing, I'm trying to reduce. I'm like, I don't need to be doing like reps like that. So I'm doing like five by five bench, five by five standing overhead press, and then if I do some like a necessary workout, fuck me the problem is well now, I'll do like, yeah, my dip's my pull-ups. It's like 80, 90% 80%. Yeah, like, so like it feels good, I'm like, like, a pump, but I'm not pushing things to like, crazy to, you know, but like, you know, you know, you know, you know, like five by five, that's what's so nice to do. You know, push weight, but not like killing stuff. I'll put on for like, just shoulder plates and a 10 to 5 or three to quarter, you know, so it's like good, but I'll like challenge you to that that extent. So like my fucking one way back. I mean, to be honest, I couldn't probably do 10 reps with that before. That was like a rough, I probably do 50, 80 with 60. Yeah, 60. But yeah, I've trying to back down like, the actual reps in sets, you know, like, I'll try to do anything like 10 to 12 reps. Yeah, I try to like, increase stress, cortisol, and like, recovery. Yeah, I'm trying to get like, crazy pump right, and I'm like, the pipe works to be working out. Yeah. Yeah, I've got to see if you stick. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When in Rome, you know? You think the stairs here? Yeah. In this, in my, in this weather, oh, that's rough. You act will make pretty well. Yeah. Yeah. I've been training even two, oh, they get two months. But not even. I mean, they didn't like, we're going out and running on the track. We're out of time. Yeah. You know, it would be 25 degrees here to run for two hours. Well, 100. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This especially were running at six feet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would love to train here like seven feet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got to go when you feel nice to. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Yeah. Don't feel uncomfortable. You can feel comfortable. Awesome. Could taste nice. Oh my gosh, you're like,eleka, I think it's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. I don't know. Anyone has any tricks or the deletating headache? Please help. I got the normal headache all the time. We're killing you. We started with pull over today. I love that knowledge pull over your machine. I'm going to put my legs back in a little bit. I'm going to be neglecting spinal load. I'm going to be doing a lot of chest support. I'm going to start off with that today. I'm going to be doing the first five or six reps. I'm walking on the squeeze. I'm going to focus on the breathing. Pulling it by hips. I'm going to do two sets with the grip. I'm going to pull my wrist. I'm going to do my wrist. I'm going to do my wrist. I'm going to do my wrist. I'm going to do my wrist. Come with this. There's a lot of stress in it. There. There. It's good. Okay. Good. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. It's quite, you know. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Is it one, just calories? Umm very cool. It doesn't, doesn't, doesn't fucking cool air thick. Hmm, this. Looks like Gov把它. Okay. tener 3500 additions. manage school. but plywood tube so like, three witches. About almost. Short really quick. No. No, yeah. It's on the floor, we said I'm not gonna ride on the lift, we need your good shape for six weeks. I'm not gonna ride it. Double the lift bigger than last year. I think it's because I need the scooters, so I need to just stick your hands just to get the lift. That's all there's to work on it, Jim, like this, you just like, we get the seat pumps from the heat too, we're like, like, no, I never received the salt. I like, I felt like you know, yeah. I've spent so much here, I just like, do you've been having a couple of salt now? It's fine, it's been like, yeah, yeah, like, I've taken for the morning, it's, yeah, I put layers of them and I cover them in the fucking salt and it's like, like, that makes it a huge difference for your full nest. I feel like you're swindling, I'm just like, you're like, you could even sweat. No, yeah, I still have to hold a lot. But, and your kid needs to tolerate it fine. Yeah, good. Good. Good, good, great. Very good, stuff, so that's your help. Yeah. You want ID, you want to do the renal on there? You did? No. You did ID, I did ID, yeah. But there's one where they actually put it into the renal by the seat, it's in there. Yeah, not the kidney, the renal artery. Okay, so I'll go in to the interchid needs, yeah, the country, but he said you've got tangible different trip just doing ID exactly. Yeah. So I might do the renal one more and do that. Yeah. It's a good school. You got a nice track. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. It's a good speed attack. Good. Good. Hard. There's a good thing. Big breath. Good. Good. Good. Good. Really good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Oh, my God. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. or what my weight cut off would last you so my will just hop into meant for the tickets here which I've been shooting apps for like five weeks so who knows maybe I'll be able to do it cash being the board shorts for the 23 Nothing I'm eating probably similar than what I'm looking at. You're a public, like, busy car you ever need to answer. I'm not sure what you're doing though, but I'm not doing party weights on the same day. So your cardio is like real cardio, big hours, bit and all. Yeah, now we're spin-run like in my heart, like 1.60. It's not like going hard. Yeah, I'm doing like 1.10 once, 20. Yeah, and I'll do an hour and 10, 3 times a week. Plus two hours a week of your try. So I guess two or four seven hours a part of your meal, but six or seven, you know, an alcoholic way through four and ten. Yes, you still have muscle. Especially with like burning muscle, like the gym and stuff, like really bring your energy reserves down. I'm really doing twice a week and you're like, I'm like buying exercise in like seven times a week. Yeah, you're good. Essential nervous. Yeah, it's not the nervous system, but I'm probably more than. Yeah. Alright, so I squish my split up a little bit. So maybe my next video, I'm gonna explain what my split is. And for the end of the prep series, I'm starting to explain everything I'm doing. But I do arms after back now, we're at the four ESP more spread out. So instead of doing back and by, they just focus on a full complete back workout, arms tomorrow. So because of that, I added in rear delts. On to back there, because you're already hitting them a little bit. So I just hit one or two specific rear delts movements. Just to help cap off my shoulders, get a little chopp in there too. So if you're back with that, you can turn it on to buy stuff. Probably the first time training arm that a month. If you're doing some rear delts, and then call it a day. And then you'll waste your time. And then you'll waste your time. And then you'll waste your time. There's definitely a little smaller. There are nearly as full. Yeah, the full vest. Yeah, it's fucking shredded though. It was like me one week after. I'm gonna kill myself for the next six weeks. Just so drive-look like that. Yeah, but I did it at the complete expensive muscle. That's like the opposite of bodybuild. But it was like beer because like see you're starting a journey to like downsize. I didn't have any body battle when I started that journey. Yeah, like it was 12 weeks, 10 weeks out from the building. Yeah, just on Toronto, I was only like 12-15 pounds up from stage. So it's always like eight, nine percent body battle. So it's like where do you go other than to lose body battle and get a muscle? So first it was like a big drop in coldness and water. And I looked really small in first. In this little drop I looked smaller than I do now. And then it kind of like leveled out when my body got used to how much food was coming in, how much I got up was. And then I fell a little polar. And then I just started to leaner. You know, we got to the amount of muscle you could roll down easily. Yeah, and then the glycogen could fill that up and sit in that. Yeah. What you said the way you're training is like what you did. What you did what are on track. But you wanted to downsize a bit. And you wanted to join to be like, really, I would just say you wanted to try. No warning. I would do the circuits like I was doing at first. I would do like chest and back opposing. You know, my set of tries have opposing kind of stuff like that. And just doing like four or five exercises to roll. Like what I was doing, I'd be like, like, like, having lean, able stability to make the shift. Yeah, what you made a little bit, but probably not. I mean, depends what I want to do. Like, if I'm like, I'm going to play like men's league basketball. I would have to pressure. I'd be getting all like a fucking topsy-turvy angle shit, you know. Oh, yeah, especially the warning, it's like, hey, I want to go fucking height. Now, tell me, jarrel, I probably need to do some shit like that. Yeah, I don't think. I don't know how to go to the, I wanted to, like, some crazy now. Yeah, like, every space can't tool. Not because I get the least once a year. I get with like a very gripping obsession with doing those things. I get like down like a rabbit hole, like two months where I'm watching all the documentaries, all the 8,000 meter keys, you know. Like almost fucking, like, an off-leg grade to doing that. What they, you know, I'm not sure. I'm going to go right about my ears. But I think it would be because like you stand based down for a little bit, and you like take you two weeks, even hike to base camp, that is like an acclamation. I mean, guy diving, always fuck that out there. And you're coming out from what's in the end of the seat, and it's just here's the pop of the bleeding. And you've always had issues with that too. There when I was a lot of people, I've ever only jumped off the fucking diving board at the pool. Yeah, well, but you went down the pool. Yeah, remember that one. All right, so it's going to be wrap on today's back workout. I'm losing my mind. I thought I'd turn my sip today, but I just literally said that tomorrow's arm day, but had a good little back day with Ian. This is probably the last time you'll be struggling with me until I retire. Yeah, for a lot of things for sure. Well, maybe I can keep a little something something. Ben, she'll always be able to bench my name, Brad. Yeah, probably. And maybe not. We're probably like pretty close right now, because that's like one of the things that comes to me personally. Not by, you definitely stronger. Yeah, I'm probably, probably pretty even, but I can't bear that. Yeah, but no, we had a nice little workout. Some shit that kind of been aching and pain on me. Feel pretty good today. So happy with that. Had you fun working out enough and air condition during the floor. That's good. I mean, it's honestly, if it was any time for me to do it, it's when I'm like down a little in weight. And my cardio's getting a little better. It could help. So it's like I definitely sweat, but it was a good sweat. And like I'm used to sweating like that now for my doing more cardio output. If you're peak off, yeah, if I was 300 pounds, that would be fucking brutal. I've done that before. Yeah, I'd be here if I fit. For a moment, I was like, are we getting on my again? To go to a vibe, but I'm like, no, he's getting on my way. So it was good. It's like, I mean, it definitely hits different. Like your pumps and just like everything feels kind of like better. You warm up quicker. It feels nice. So in the gym is great. So it was good to check it out. I'm getting a workout in. Yeah, so we might get another workout before we leave. I don't know we'll see, but he's training with the track coach tomorrow. And he can document that. Yeah, that'll be cool. As you guys know, he's fucking transitioning to track star. So if you guys want to check out that journey, I'm probably going to watch in that because I was even asking about like just knee and rehab and shit. So I'm curious. But wrap up that video. You know, chill. But can buy some guns this week, shoot some shit and fucking get some massage just sleeping, train some arms and have a grand old time. So like, get through watching and I'll catch you next one.

So good and tasty What's really wanted to eat some fucking bread? Jeeam Shake bread, that's all I'm making baby Fuck Come on, come on, Chris! Hey, I'm your one, two, four, two, three, yeah, let's go! What's that? What's that? Music Did you close the front of me or then a shatter? Because you're fat? No, just looked at it. My ugly ass mug just fucking broke it in the middle of pieces. I'm actually trying to be proactive and clean. I was getting rid of all my old t-shirts and I was dragging the garbage bags down. I should bump in and that's over and I'm pretty pissed. But I couldn't do that. So I just wanted to switch into perspective, 7 years, good luck. Last all about perspective, you know what, about that? You're the truth, it's gonna be bad luck. And then you're also like the manifest bad luck. I'm sure the truth is gonna be good luck. So good things are coming, it's Chris, but come here. You're all welcome. No, it's not like you don't have an elevator place. I'm not in fucking break that mirror. Yeah, it'll be hell. And all of them, anyway. But anyways, what is up YouTube today? I'm like setting day. We're going to bear Jackson, which is like a really famous car show. Probably the second biggest car show in North America after me come. Like an auction where they bring out like collectible on a mobile. Like usually vintage ones. And I'm been dying for my 28 or like 18 years probably to get up. Three cars I really want, 70 charger, maybe 68 charger, 67 Camaro, 69 Mustang. I'm holding off because I want like a fucking beautiful one one day when I can afford like custom building one. For me, I would love to get, I'm probably not gonna get one here, but I'm gonna go look at a bunch of them because I have a bunch of vintage old cars. I don't even know if they had chargers, they have list online. But I just really love old muscle cars and my grandpa, which didn't really get to know very well. He owned, he passed away when I was pretty young, he owned a mechanic shop. And I think he had a plimate bear kuda or something. Very similar to a charger, but he was into cars. And he used to talk to me about some other really young, I remember I could see him around and shit. I was like always wanted one ever since then, and I really had a connection with double cars. So one day I would love to get one. So we're gonna go look at them and check out the auction, just got something cool to do. It's in Palm Beach, 20-30 minutes from us, meet Dom, same eating, filming, Matt, Jensen, all going to go check it out. So we're gonna bring him along for the ride then later. We're all trying to get together. Oh, I was gonna go to Miami. But yeah, that's what's going on then I can train back a little bit later today. So leaving him like 30 minutes, I'm just killing down there until we go. So I'll see you guys out there. Hopefully he doesn't rain because it's a little bit of a monkey day, at least it's not hot. It's really ugly outside. It's beautiful outside. It's kind of nice to have them. Oh. And people right here on the left, he's the opposite. Also, thank you so much. If no idea where we're going, we're definitely going along the way. He's definitely not so worried about it. Oh. It's not the right way. I feel like we've got a park somewhere more to see me from there. We need to go to a fucking 12. Well, he told me that. Fuck that guy. This guy's drove all the way up here. He drove right in where we've walked in. Well, I didn't think you could. But he just... Yeah, our cars look like they fit here. For sure. There's a lot of food. Oh, 14. There you go, make me. He's going back. He's going back. I'm on my car. I'm on my car. Please, just jump. Yeah. He's on my car. Oh. Oh. Yeah. He's on my car. Oh. Well, he's on my car. Oh. He's on my car. Yeah. This is fucking ridiculous. I think. So good. Everyone's on my car. This is fucking ridiculous. Yeah. Just walking outside of the room. Bro, it's a hurricane. Oh. Oh. Whoa. I think that's what you put. This is the name of the name. Yeah, that's what I'm going to call it. There are two, I looked at the history and they go through like one 15 to one. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's not perfect to what you want. Like you get in the custom, make every piece of it. But I don't think that's true. I like things here. It's like that whole leather. Yeah. It's a little Dutch. Good brown. It's a little brown. It's a little brown. This thing is called f**k it with the name of this. It's whole car is my private. Yeah, this is the city. I think it's about the image I was going to be like two days ago. That's all I've been put here. So if you get in the car, you just like that. This car is the stronger than metal. Carbon fiber is like a breaking. It's a 1970. It's a 1970. It's a mere of a dominant tread of zero watt. But that's a little too fancy new for me. I want to finish looking one. I don't know the screen of it. Yeah. What about the touch screen here? It has apple park on it. It's totally dynamite. I think I can imagine the one side put a sound to it. It's a little bit of a... Yeah. I think it's a bit of a... Yeah. We got two. I thought I was... I thought I was... I thought you were... About two volts. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. I'm serious dream park. Yeah. I see it so long. It's so long. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. Give a P1. What? Give a P1. You want it? Yeah. Right there. Yeah. That's where... That's the 10, 16, wide body. I think? I think it's something to see. Onward. You're on? Yeah. I don't know. Just... Of course, it's up. It's a little bit different. That's the wide body. It's a 10, 16, wide. Look at the door. It's a two-door. Yeah. That's the actual line of the car. That's how wide they're almost at the 20s. Really? Yeah. This kid is only... It's like a front splitter, a part of the new wing. This part is just a bottom. The only thing it adds is that, like, see that thing, like that bul out right there? That's... You've got a back-up here. Okay? Before they get that. Yeah. That's the only thing it adds. There's your truck, grab your arm. And, like, that's what I was talking about. You know, actually put my arm on. You can go through it. The second stick here. That's just a whole by row. Because it sticks in the middle. It's not big right here, don't you, don't you? Get another four? No, I've still got no 40 in the shop. Right. It's not like the... The... Like the flag, like the stitch in here. Yeah. This is... No, I do. I don't like the color, but... Yeah. This is good. You know, the pants are all about the clothes. What? The pants are a little bit funky. I don't like the girl they throw on. They're just like... You're beautiful. So, right now. Oh, that's a right here, right? Man, one. Oh, honey. Oh, honey, you see that right there. Get them here? That's... Nice color. Is that good? All right, feel it. This is exactly what I want. It's not made of... Rip. Rip. It's almost a lot of old cars. They take it from that in bulk of cars. You go to a tree. And then they keep the original frame on it. And sometimes the original frame is like being the shit in our new days. But, the beautiful is the car. So, that company's lost. He's got... Give me that Bronco. They're starting to make these soon. Might tell me what the good time. This shop is fucking good. Yeah. I still beat up. Have you ever looked at it? That's why I like mine. It's broken. That's really... It's one of those nice chip-a-noss in it. Look how you get it. Oh, they picture me, too. It might dad told me a story when he was young. His neighbor bought this exact car. The judge, they call it. Funny actually, too. He said all the kids in the neighborhood used to... Drive up and take pictures of an afternoon term in the oven, around the entrance. They're all about cars. Knock out the wood. You all in there? I wish you'd want a regular take. You'd take me down there. There's a few there's one here. I'll be honest with you. This is over here, right? Yeah. This is another one too. Time? It's got... It's kinda... It's the whole time I have the whole... Skin on the body on my side is all like... ...way-be-indventy. Looks like that. Yeah, this is just like old steel. This is sick though. I kinda like when the inside looks beat up though. It's okay. That'll be in the room, if I could. Probably. Probably. It's actually in the bathroom. It can be in the bathroom. It's in the bathroom. Isn't it? It's all from the trunk. It opens the door. Oh, it's in the bathroom. There's a lot of teeth. Look at me on here. Look at me on here. Look at that fly also. Look at egg. I don't want to touch it. I don't want to touch it. I don't want to touch it. So, we're gonna get it, Matt and look. What is that? First, we've got to get it, Matt. Dude, get that for a recording. Put it in the garage, and see if we can show it died. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. I have to sit under here. So I got it under the floor. I just want to put that on. I don't even care for your life you'd be driving this way. I don't even clothes. It just walks in with the door handle. Wow. I don't see what I'll do to you. This whole view of Grand National. So, you're looking at the comfy steps back in the day too. You're like, help you. You're like, help you. Oh, yeah, it's a seat belt. Under 20, right? Under 20? Yeah. Right, it's a bit. Under 20, right? Under 20? Yeah. Right, it's a bit. It's what I'm happy to drive and make it down. Oh, you got to drive me into the... Yeah. Together with me, yeah. I think this might be spray paint, too. I think it'll fuck something up though. What is that? I'm curious. I think that Pvis-Dish fucking vinyl roof they put on these cars though. That is. I think he died. Yeah. I'll tell you what it looks like at 27. That's a manual there. Another Dominic Tradocar, 70 charger. It's fucking V6. I mean, this one does both wild, but I... I know how I got in my boat. He got one of these and he said that. He gave it a... Just chaos. I think it's like a standard of drivers. I don't know. Alright, so to wrap on Barrett Jackson for the day, a few dope cars. I didn't see really, I saw a few 69 musts in there, but I didn't see any mock ones that were the boss. And not a 4, 290, there was a little boss 300, but some dope cars, a few dope Cameros. There was a 68 RS black. Exactly how I wanted it to be, except a lot of Maddox not manual. But it was a little old. There's a few online that are really good price, and I found one was like an LSX Supercharged Motor in it, so they're like 650 horsepower with a new engine. So I'm like tempted to get one eventually, but I mean, I also just wanted to see that if I really got the H sub I1, and I kind of did, honestly, their fucking, I love those guys. So those old Cameros are the charges. But for now, I'm gonna resist. I'm gonna use my discipline to resist temptation. Maybe one day I'm gonna pull it up with the fucking Cameros and rip it into the three two burnouts. Until then, I'll be patient and go work out with get you. So that you get for joining a lot of my projects experience. What you need in bro? I'm gonna video where this black guy, some of his body needs to be in straight breath because he's so high. He's a dope. He's called the Hybrose. He's in checkin' it right. He's all I do with bro. I believe he's a good guy. I should have thought I could check it out with him. I've only used for two days and he's canning and send some songs. I can't believe he's a good guy. I'll stir fry it. Put them off that way. Stop eating. I'm really wanted to eat some fucking bread. Actually, I really wanted to eat banana bread, but if I have too much carbs. Where'd you go? Where'd you go? I can't eat before the gym. I can't eat my energy. Just eat something. What's the difference? Because it was rice, was fat, and fruit, and protein. Then this is just sugar and bread. So much I'm gonna be tired. I feel like I'm tired. I'm tired. What about energy? I'll pre-work it. Make spult on them. No. Bum energy is not gonna get you a pump. Bum energy will be around 5. I'm not gonna fucking sleep today. I'll have a Bum energy. I like a sleep tonight, but I'll pre-work out. That's how you drink. That's right. You alright? Are you good gym? No. What? No. Well, it's lost my hamster. So, it's a power book, my hamster. Alright, back there. Fucking hate busy gym. We're in a busy gym, so I'm avoiding the cable dumbbell area for now. And for the first time in my life, I'm warming up on something. Other than cable, pull down. This is the machine pull down. So it's not much different, but underhand, grip, power strength, pull down, get nice stretch in the lap. We're gonna do a bunch of sets to warm up for the fucking take and tired, but back there is. Do you think notice? That's a new merch coming out soon. That's sample on right now. First ever printed. Things drop in the end of the month, so stay tuned. I used to do these with like 110, 115 condom bills. I felt good. And there's a place in time for that. We're doing these with like 85 right now, given a week or but it's also lighter. And just squeezing, full of deep range of motion. Like, arching my back and pulling my elbow back and fly like, yeah. I feel damn good. I'm gonna need to fix this here. I'm gonna need to fix this. Poor people. Poor people. You have to put on a bike by the end of the year. 7. 7. Give me a few mugs. 7. A few mugs.

I don't even use like the thin like sheet that's under the blankets. It's just like feels weird, you know? I just put the blanket on. You take it off? I just play on top of it. Really? Yeah. I think I just rip out the bottom that's untucked into the bottom of the bench. Get under. I home I don't have a sheet. I'm too lazy to make a bed with a sheet. And sheets are stupid. Yeah. Sometimes they're nice and Florida. I think I want to do that. But it's only when they see that. I'm using it to take the funnel protein into the bottle. It's like, it's going to be weird everywhere. 10 minutes? 10 minutes. You're not going to break the name as you got there. Yeah. They're always like to break these. I think they're lots longer. Yeah. But I don't even need anything. So. Oh. True. Doesn't make sense. You feel the. You feel the. The ship. Bathroom. You thought? Yeah. What do you shoot shooting at? I did.

Cute. Oh, I've been pressing your mixed protein in a smart water bottle. Just weird. Really good. There's like a bottle that there's like a bottle you put in a meaner's hand. Not fucking protein. There's no rule solution. That is. I'm like my own. I'm feeling like people like the POV. You know, I've everything that you do. That's fucking. I'm so weird. I just need to- I just think I'm not going to bottle. Just look so weird. I've never seen a clear bottle of protein in it. Really? Have you ever seen a ripple milk? If we brush our two to waste? Yeah, but like, this is- it says smart water. That's a difference. So just- It's just- You sure imagine that. That's what you're talking about. You should be careful. Yeah. That's a difference. So, just let's do some imagination. I'm sure you've ever looked up as a sky at name. It would be grateful for the beauty of the world we live in. It's actually really blue because my camera just sees that as very blue. It's like purple blue, honestly. It's actually, I actually do love leaving this gym. Could you look up at the palm trees and then it's just like always a beautiful sunset. It's sunset down now, but it's nice. No. You can finish your work, it will feel good. Drink it with chocolate milk, get a bit of a smart water. Two water, smart water, what's the difference? That's it. Let's get me a wrap on say, leg workout. And are you saying leg workout?

You'll be a brownie cake. Something that you'll, for say right. It's like confetti cake and I really want to eat it. That was too easy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like old-school. Realizes that nobody needs to use it. I don't, don't miss every other store. What is up YouTube? This is an exciting day. We are kind of scouting a new venture that we're working on. We partnered with Mr. Barron. Mr. Harvesty, a part of our bond streets. Check them out on the 3M app on street. This is the bakery of some new project we're working on. They're literal treats. We're first thing we're coming up with Rice Krispies Quests. We're going to bond all the EATs. I have them some time pre-worked. We're going to have them every week. We're going to make a really good protein packed one. And then we're going to come up with a bunch of treats after that. So we're kind of scanning our bakeries where they're making some of the samples right now. And just checking out the facility, making sure it's all good. Up to date, not the ship we want to see. So it's fun. It's exciting. And the ship. So far it tastes absolutely amazing. We love this. We want to make sure the facility is actually someone we want to do better. So here we bond, dumb, Matt. And some other guys helping us kind of scale the place. We're just going through the bakery right there. If you just saw it and then we're headed to another warehouse. And for my amy. So we're chillin' for getting some lunch after a train later. And just enjoying the beautiful sunny day. Because it's minus 40 degrees right now. And you can't have that. And I am happy to be in Florida. So check out the place. So all this here is where your barger or my maid. Okay? So here's where we make the barger. So here's where we make the barger. So the maid's to transfer the pot down here. And have two people here pouring on the top. And then to have two people checking this stuff here. And then just three people. So I have three. So it's a total 7.7 people working on it. Here's a very small. Here's our room. Okay. Okay. So now we're just making the train. We're doing the barger if you can't make a big one. Otherwise it gets nothing cut. But I think you can make a meat bun. Okay. You guys should be something you're cooking. But we sell the package. It's probably pretty far. Yeah, it's about small. It's a bit small. Delicious. I need our per flavor in there to make the bag of flavors. You can add it in all the sauce. I think it's per taste. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Very good. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna finish it with my mom. I'm gonna finish it with my mom. I'm gonna finish it with my mom. I'm gonna finish it with my mom. I'm gonna finish it with my mom. I love this part. I might drop it. I don't know. No, that's how it's talking. It's a huge kind of thing. I think that's a good thing. Obviously when you let it sit in a bit, it gets a little bit of firm. Yeah. I don't know. I think that might be a good thing. It's something we'll check in touch. There's a little rest. Thank you very much. All right, brother. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's a bit of a bar. It's a bit of a bar. It's a bit of a bar. That's really good. It's really good. It's in the guideline for the bar. It's a bit of a package. It's only six inches wide. You're saying five inches wide. It's a verdict on taste, I think. 10, 10. That one's 12. Yeah. I'm going to be the cream of 13. I think I can tell you the pretty pebble taste of that. It's just like, I can admit it tastes better. I just love cooking. That's very nice. Why do they ever go? Hey. I don't want to be real. I'm filling up. Save an environment. Okay. I see one for the planet. You over the planet. One liter of smart water at a time. That's a bit of a bar. It's like smart, smart, smart. You're smart. What? What? What? What? What's the number? Yeah, it's in there. What's the number? How? How is the coming of a cinematographer? That's the right word. Yeah. That's actually got some really cool shit for a r-plan that they're doing. So we got a fancy camera. So stay tuned for that on the r-plan. But it's armed day. My first official armed day since the Biceps Air. I'm going to really light on myself. I'm not lying on everything honestly because I do shoulder day or chest day. I get so sore now. My chest is even. Just because I'm so untrained. That it's like the first time you ever go to the gym you train legs. I'm sore. You're like, yeah, that's my whole body right now. I'm just falling apart. So I'm using back in there. And I'm trying to do movements that I haven't done a while because I'm doing it like so I'm doing close grip bench. Work on my stability. I'm going to do a two-place for like eight reps or so. So I'm going to do a shitty little arm day. Hopefully. Give my arms back to being where they were. And then these are bigger. I think they're stuck in the getting. So. I'm doing. I'm almost. I'm full. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm not gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Why are you talking to you? The shirt is so big. I don't know why I put it on. The band looked like I wouldn't wear any pants. When they told me to tell me to tell my skin. It looked like a fucking jacket. I didn't do it on purpose. I looked in the mirror and I was like, fuck, they look like a stupid side. I just took him to my shirt and looked really stupid. But yeah, that's it. Like Calvin Mr. First, the exercises of my warm-out-plush workout. Because he played on a crazy horrible video for focusing on getting good men. But I didn't do it for this. But my chiceps are fucking so sore right now. Trying to do this, I'm just literally just had the worst arm day in my life. And all I do is I'm trying to show you two days ago. So, I do one more set here. And overhead, doing two-by-step thing. You get the fuck out of here because I'm not going to do my arm tomorrow. If I push it too hard, I like air pod pros better. These things aren't a flab and they're like this little thing. It goes in your upper ear to so they stay in, which is cool. But it makes me feel your itchy. And I like it. You can air pod pros with the wind. ** curves two fingers umphpture** ** tied hip-hop sounds** ** wounded voice ** ** sharp footsteps** такие meaningless ideas, yeah! ** strong pressure** Have you been making some fun together? I don't know. In the room. 500,000.. Because 38,000 When I got here a lot of available things to help out. That was good! I bought some V-Biceps Matter food... Did I just decide to use it any more? And I burned it every five days! I know that Salt-1,000 I'm really not exhilarating workouts for the timing, but I'm just gonna go to like 78% earlier on my biceps and just gonna go. I'm not really happy, however you heard, make sure I'm not re-heating it, make sure I think progressively do more and more weight, I'm doing zero pain. If I feel any pain I'm gonna have to back off and feel a little bit more imaging or something, but right now there's no pain so just to go. I really have to use this period of training for it so I'm gonna have perfect mind muscle connection and then when I get strong keep that and I'll be good to go. So that always fucking, I'm going to lay it, I just wrap it out too quick, slow down just squeezing. About the biceps didn't hurt, but you're so tight for me like this, but not like movies through a range of motion, but I feel like on the other side of my throat here, it's just tight and not hurt. Don't wash your tongue. Now this is dry for you it was very cold, but Iemployed it with the soft bars ... I did, well I could have fished the red. Not to put any pressure on you though. We're almost looking at the eggs. When I start working here again, only to help too. We can do some like this. We gotta do a few like days up at the barn. But I'm gonna start calling it the barn. That gym I go do at the middle nowhere. I'm just really happy. Remember you sell myself as a machine with the heavy in it. It's full stacking up at it. Got to move things. I'm just really happy. Remember you sell myself as a machine with the heavy in it. It's full stacking up at it. Got to move things. I'm gonna put you in a milk egg tonight so we'll have a chance. I'm just supposed to drop out of it. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna do it. It's that latin to maybe really play. Yeah, I think it needs an elbow to feel like it's playing. I was like sweating after I was just... Yeah, that was really rough. If you've been need as way better as a mind-caf thing, just put it. But never know. For everyone who's better here to build restaurants. It's so scary to drop the weight. I'm currently in lowercase slowly. It's not trying to hurt myself. And our mockery feels really good. It felt tight on the curls over there. But I feel nothing on this. It didn't hurt after so soon. It could have caused it. It's positive. It's not really good. It's not trying to hurt myself. The norm actually feels really good. It felt tight on the curls over there. But I feel nothing on this. It didn't hurt after so soon. It was positive thinking. Honestly, it's not a proper prep until you enter something. It's a normal now. But you drink the last time. No drink to the gas. Well, I'm seeing it earlier now. So a degener said so by the time. I don't know. But I said, I said, I said, I'll ask how my said nothing bad was going to go happen. I mean something bad happened. But I'm saying, oh wow, nothing bad did happen. This has been like a perfect prep. But I'm saying something bad will happen. Oh, okay. Something bad stuff. You know what? I'm not putting that on the universe. I'm kidding. Whatever happens will happen. It will make do with what comes because it's what we always do. So I'm going to say it. What? What the hell?куюама and Dallas. Fuckin',zinho. How is just gonna murder make them so weak? Oh, what? You're gonna be... Oh, you want to eat back in the trained RokuВE gonna tell you. Well, I mean, whoever's planning a list of barbecue players, yeah, you got there gonna go with that me. Though I'm eating a fucking 7 barbecue players. I'm going to 4. Live over one. What kind of angelos are you gonna to hype over you to have got that shit? áHaja, wherever gonna Dallas, I'm doing it better. I'm doing it. We at Hanukkah are doing a Ben Dallas. Probably going to be announced right now, so maybe we'll be able to buy off maybe not. Maybe we'll be on Instagram. But we're going to do a Ben Dallas going down the chair with them for a while. We'll be like if someone are Q and A mean greet, I think we're going to do as where has. So, stay tuned for that information. But we're really going for barbecue. So, that's what I'm going to be doing. We're going to be our apple and this work out. A short blog. What? Short blog. I did two, I did a fucking Cambridge Curls earlier and tried to throw a big syndrome before I came here. But like my arms are sore as fuck and I have a pump right now. So, come on. Next work out. I'll tell you if I can even move my arms back for this. Where is the window? I'll see the tear. That's it. That's it. That's it. That was what it was actually down here. So, is it a little right there? No tear. I don't even have a spot right now. So, I'm going to be back to it. So, yeah, I'll see if we wrap on the blog I guess. Lots of push-in coming. I just got into the bakery today. Bon, the treats are going to be launching in the next two months. I believe. Once everything is quite away, they're working out. It's a run-in packaging and getting ready to go. So, we're really looking forward to that. You got to go and love them. They're going to love them. They're fucking crack them. Happy to come here on my office, isn't it? They're going to say to eat them. Also very exciting. We finally are updating my app right now by training app. I'm going to talk about it a while because it's been under a lot of construction. But it's fucking pretty much done right now. But really, like, interactive, weight tracking now. I guess you could thought I don't know what we're looking for. But it's really easy to use the weight tracking so you can track your sets, reps, and the amount of weight that you do this read it. And nutrition is almost done too. So, you still sign up for it. It's deep on fitness.com. But when it comes out, I'm going to be running through all the new features on the app. I'm excited about that. And it's time to get huge. My bicep didn't tear through this arm there. So, first arm day back, right around. We'll be in Texas. So, if you were training with H-Dub, bone after five feet. So, sit tuned. Thank you for watching. Peace out. Peace out.

=== FILE: BIGGEST LESSONS I’VE LEARNED ｜ HAMSTRING WORKOUT [L98F6tyJUU8].txt ===

Something you and I have talked a lot about is the difference between Z-Bubbing Chris. And it's funny because I think most of you probably know a lot about Z-Bubbing. And I know a lot more about Chris. And you and I have talked about how Z-Bubbing is a part of you, but it's not who you are. And there's been this blending that you've been trying to do even earlier. You were standing with a more present. You are Chris and Z-Bubbing is what you do. And it's like how do you win those? All right, so I guess I'm gonna pull a quote from Jim Caritas out there and it's something I know random is helping. He did smart. He said something like I wish for everyone to realize all their dreams and fame and realize that they do. That does not make them complete. Come on, come on Chris. Come on, you're one. Two. Four. Two. Come on, you're one. Come on, you're one. What's the... Music Music Music Music Music This is up. YouTube. There's a Q&A. We're all hiding in the background. How do we always do? I feel like I've mostly been here with a circle that's just hiding from everybody in the background. Pretty much. But We're at 9.30 right now. So we're about 30 minutes late from Saturday but people are also getting in their sit down. So we're getting in there. There we go. Ian, Lauren, Dawn, Norway, trio, for the 4p. Let's go up there. That's your smart questions. So that's what we're going to do. I know if we're going to get later. The gym can be closed. Good time to work here. But it's supposed to be rest day. So... I don't really know what to do. So we're going to figure it out. But we're going to do it as a vent. And then there's some rocks got talent in the gastroint. And I think that's why people are presenting like a talent show. It's a thing and I really hope someone really can imagine it because I fuck with magic talent. I'm just a video of a guy diving in a cool. I think I got something overweight man just belly flopped. He's a big cool. So he's sadly not here. That would have been great. That's just a video we have. But we're going to run through that today and have you talent. So... That's the goal. So, I'm just so cool. That's what I really want to do. That's what I really want to do. That's what I really want to do. And I really want to do that. That's what I really want to do. I really want to do that. But we're going to do something. So, I felt myself brushing. I'm Jordan and I'm a Christian Courtney's therapist. So I get a pretty cool perspective. We love Jordan. She's an artist. She has to say more right. No, but there's a few things. So I feel like there's a pro-con and biting her therapist of Q&A and this is, I would say the problem. Maybe it's a concrete, so we'll see. Something you and I have talked a lot about is the difference between Z-bubbing and it's funny because I think most of you probably know a lot about Z-bubbing and I know a lot more about Chris and you and I have talked about how Z-bubbing is a part of you but it's not who you are and there's been this blending that you've been trying to do even earlier you were saying you want to be more present. It's like you are Chris and Z-bubbing is what you do and it's like how do you want this? And there's been a lot of moment for you and I've been talking about a session and you've had like a realization or a light bulb moment and you thought, man I was sure what I know this sooner. And obviously, everybody's here because they went to learn from you. They went to learn the lesson due to learn. And there was one session in particular where you were talking about all the things that you thought we're going to make you really happy. And realising as you thought you'd want that that wasn't quiet and there was this one thing that you realized was actually thinking needed. And so one I would love to be a share of that thing. And two, I would just love to open it up to ask, what is one of the biggest lessons that you learned from therapy? And that you wish you would have known sooner than you think would be helpful for them to know. And now I know this, but our next session obviously. Well, it was a good question. I don't know if I'll be fine. So you want me to start with, let's unpack this, let's go Chris. There's a lot of questions there. All right, so I guess I'm going to pull a quote from Jim Caritas out there. And it's something I know random is helping. He did smart. He said something like, I wish for everyone to realise all their dreams and fame and realise that they do, that does not make them complete. And I think what she's touching on, we were talking about, I was chasing Olympia titles and I was making money. I was getting new contracts or any businesses. I was getting my career in my dreams. I was getting home at 24, traveling the world, doing all this stuff. And I was like, this is all these things that you think are going to make you feel a little bit better. And then I get to the point where I buy anything I want or anything I want. And I didn't feel any better. Every time I got to do level of another, I won Olympia, I was super grateful at that moment, but it didn't make me happier in my life. It didn't make me feel like a better person. I get more money if you feel any better afterwards. It's just a little fleet of happiness or joy and then it's kind of gone. And I realized, okay, this isn't going to be the thing that makes me feel fulfilled in my life. I need to kind of branch out into more. And I think I learned, it's going to be many things, but probably the biggest thing is connection. And the only way I'm going to be able to feel connected is, as I was talking about allowing myself to be seen. But allowing myself to kind of de-minded myself. And that battle I felt was Seabomb versus Kristen. Start from being called Seabomb. I don't know if he has it started when I was young. Just kind of feeling like I was all on my own. And I was always the guy who kind of had all together with Kristen and sports. I was always good. And Chris, the idea of Seabomb has always been like cool, calm and collected. Had the ship together and he's fine. He's always good. I don't know, so we're going to be lucky. He's done it all together. And everyone's always kind of just not there about me. So I just felt like I had to be that all the time. And I never really felt like I could share anything else other than that. So that's kind of the kind of act I've put on for a while. And then I realized it made me feel very alone for a long aspect of my life. I was personally my child that I felt like there wasn't much I could really like connect with my family. Because they didn't really see me. And he might struggle if they just saw the sun who had it all together. He's good to go. So I think it really something I'm not ravowing now is allowing all of the messy parts of myself to be seen. All the ups and the doubts. And I mean, I can have a better part of it, Courtney, to help pull this out and accept me for all of it. And kind of share. And build the connection with her first where I understand that the true connection is going to come from allowing myself to be seen. All the dirty parts of myself, the stuff that I don't want people to see. That's the stuff where when someone loves me for that. And I know they truly love me. And I truly, so close to them for that. So I think that journey of life is kind of really, I'm really grateful that I've been able to accomplish all this stuff in my life. And I wouldn't change it for anything. But it's also helped me kind of quickly learn that I'm not going to make me happy. And I was going to make me happy as I said the connection with the people in my life. And trying to be rebuild that was my family, which is part of the parts that maybe were tainted and kind of allow them to see me and build that with them. It was corny and anybody who knew in my life. And kind of take it at that. And a funny thing I actually get from a lot of men when I talk about sharing, like the motion of vulnerability was my girlfriend. But yeah, like my girlfriend would leave me as I cried in front of them. I don't know if that's anyone here. But I think there is a lot of fear on men sharing vulnerability just because of the concepts of how we have to be. And there is totally a balance. I truly believe this of where you do have to know that you can be strong and support your family and your family. And you're feeling safe and supportive of your family and your fiance or wife, whatever it may be. But they also do want to see the real side of you. So if you're someone who is constantly crying in this and that, like sure maybe. But if you're someone who can surely be there for them and love them and support them, be strong. We can also let them be there for you sometimes. And kind of have like a synergy like lean on each other rather than just on you. It truly will bring you closer together. And I know it's worked for our relationship. And it's only made me. That's the stuff that's truly brought more happiness and honestly just confidence in my life. Just to feel better and all aspects. The proof. That was good. Oh, we're saying the last part. Is there anything that you want to add that's a different lesson than that that you want from there that you would want to tell them. I'm going to let you be done and Courtney was like the last question. Thanks Courtney. I don't know. I think the biggest thing I've really learned was like how much I do need people in my life. I've always thought I could do it all by myself and like if I'm stressed out, well I can just hold it in a handle of myself. And how much it actually like it doesn't make you weak to share that they're still there. But it actually helps you sometimes just to talk about it. And no one's going to give you a solution or fix it, but just allowing and accepting some of these emotions to come up. Naturally makes them kind of fade away or dissipate a little bit rather than bring them to the surface and making them worse. I think you're really just kind of accepting letting things come up, feeling them and seeking connection rather than just trying to get through life alone. You killed it. Well, Chris, be built for this session. I mean, I see. You were still there. Even the stoked thing, like you but you described it with like the the combat, the monorality. You killed it and what was so cool after you were the most honorable. The next guy got really to your eye. I didn't know. I don't know. Yeah. It seemed directly, but like, but I didn't even feel it. And what a dad. Oh, question. Yeah. I was so sure. You got to do it. You got to do it. I'm hardly like I think it was looking at it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Let's stretch past. Let's try it. How's your life going? Yep. Good. Good. It's blowing back pain, you know. It means a good hand thing there. No, yeah. This machine is basically hooked my back. Yeah. I hooked my back. You on? Yep. All right kids, going to be a wrap on this video event yesterday. We got back yesterday. Yesterday. Yesterday. Yesterday's a good one. Whenever I was like we got back. That was a success. It was easy because it was an argument. So we got to come in and come out. I much more enjoy like the Q&A cell things that I've said. Cool. It's fun. Very full to share. A lot of things I try and learn from the experience of my life. A therapist was in the car and she came in and asked some deep questions. It just kept throwing me under the bus. But I think I handled it pretty well. She approved my answers. So that's always a good sign. She's from Nashville. So that's why she came out to it. But other than that, it was we went out that night and it took myself to the fucking Zin bin. Popped his in. Little fucking single up or decor and I just threw it through it all up. We got to a rooftop club. I started to feel nauseous. I like spit it out. I'm like my face went pale on my eye to leave. I'm going to over home. Like I'm just breathing deep. Eyes closed. Get home instead of the toilet. Like everything I ate that day just came up and I was like, Mother fucker. I don't know how people fucking chew these things. I was trying to pull up the injury, take diet of caffeine, steak and fucking nicotine. Well it's actually cigars. It's a guy. It's nicotine. Same for shit. But it didn't work for me. So I will never be doing that again in my life. Because that was absolutely bizarre. But I had the spins going to bed like I didn't even drink fucking horrible. We'll never try that again. But I'll try anything once. So that was that. It came back. It's sort of like they finished off with some F-C-7 calves. I told honey that I'm going to do nothing but F-C-7 for calves from now on. And if they grow then these are good cooked. It's not easy to show coach. So sorry honey, but here on the test right now. But yeah, that's what's going on. Come to Alphalene this weekend. I'm not. So God bless that. Don't fall in trouble. And it's going to be hot. And it's a wrap on this video. So I think yes we're watching. Podcast with Chris Williams in just lunch today. If you guys haven't seen it, modern wisdom on Spotify. Apple Podcast. I think it's Chris Williams in his channel name on YouTube. So if you guys want to watch it, really good interview. Probably one of my best podcasts that most most in-depth I should at least say you get in the side of the best. But yeah, that's a little, that's what's going on. So thank you guys for watching. Peace out.

=== FILE: BRUTAL BACK DAY ｜ PREP SECRETS BBQ STYLE [mON4wycpawk].txt ===

I'm going to take a look at the camera. Wow. Yeah. We're going to take a look at the camera. We're going to take a look at the camera. I see it and we'll get a regular barbecue sauce. Guys, you ever have a special dish? Yeah, we have a special dish. And then if you want anything else? Honey, what's your take on a similar deadlift thing? Sumo deadlift? Yeah. We're a sumo and deadlift thing should not be the same. Sumo is for sumo and deadlift thing is deadlift. You shouldn't be using that in the same sentence. Oh, here we go. Come on, come on, Chris. Come on, come on. We go. We go. Come on, let me in check. Come on, let's go, let's go. Always there. We're going to take a look at the camera. What is up YouTube? Welcome to our final day here in Texas, our final look at what came back there. One of my most crucial, important test days of the week, building a thick juicy back. This is technically the fourth day of the year, we're all training and never do that. I'm only three on one, I'll three on one off. But, not missing the opportunity to turn on the economy in the holidays here, a whole more time. So, we'll rest tomorrow. And, how many things? Only post you picked up many reps a day when the week is here. So, just getting to moralize your whole week, but you know, it's tough on me, I prepared. So, doing some back-to-day full-back work here, right? Everything we did by the tip, today, so we're going to do a good one. I'm going to crush it, have one final day of your in Texas, so we're going to make it worth it. It's going to be a good one. Worts of wisdom for the people. Yes, it's going to be an epic back day. We're going to be a good one. We're going to do some back-to-day work here. We're going to do some back-to-day work here. We're going to do some back-to-day work here. We're going to do some back-to-day work here. We're going to just keep going, just keep going. We're going to do some back-to-day work. We're going to keep going. Keep going. Two more. One more. Here we go. Good set. Got bigger hands than I'm at least. Drop the elbows down, stretch down. Good. Got lower lower. Go again. Go up. Go down and just hold it. There you go. Hold. Good. You can lower your chest. Go. Go in there. Go in there. Good. Two more. One more of that. Good. Got more. Got to try hand. Got to try hand. Got to try hand. Got it. Huff. I'm still longer, getting it and bringing my elbows down. Hold your shoulder arms. Any shoulder arms. Maybe I can just cut a few inches of my arms and then they'll grow out. and they'll grow up. Take some of these. We'll try it out. Yeah. One thing Dehani did tell me to do this box. So I made it this way. I always have a tendency of tucking my chin and looking down, looking forward. You told me to keep my vision looking up when we're doing these pull-downs. Just so you really like elongate the lats, get that full stretch. And you're squeezing from your back right and clunking your abs forward. It also keeps your muscles up. And you're lifting up helps. And you're less likely to pull with your arms. You want to use your arms as hooks and contract lats. That pull from the elbows. That's right. You don't even have no elbows or no knees. So just straight arms or straight legs. No elbows. And I go walk at least. Four arms are killing me. Just make sure you keep your pants in. Keep your pants in. Keep your tension, brother. Stay stiff, brothers.

Good. Good. Good. You know what? You can do it. You know what? This machine, though, is converging pull down machine. I'm too tall for it. My arms are too long so I can't pull the extend. But I love doing this with a lightweight. Because it really makes you trick your head in the back. It will bite. So it's a little lighter way. I come in and squeeze and imagine it's on the back. And it's that exact same motion. I guess you put it into it. Perfect for bodybuilding. You feel the position. But I'm sadly my long ass arms. I'll immediately use the machine properly. I'm going to try it. What's your take on a similar deadlift thing? Sumo deadlift? Yeah. There's Sumo and deadlift thing should not be used together. I don't know. Is that what you're building that?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got a paper there How pretty all right, so I never remember to finish a blog so team blah, we're out of show They're just in the new location, but we wrapped up the new jersey event and it was I think it was a big success We kind of like rolled with the tide just like seeing how to grow flooring people had a lot of question They were super engaging were like before lunch broke we were like we'll take one more question everybody like put their hands up to want to ask more So we turned the last portion of the seminar into more jpeer Q&A and I think it worked out so well that way people got to ask what they want We got to answer specifically what people were like expecting and I found it cool that it was very like focus around like mindset and my personal Growth and like a lot of personal questions as opposed to just like training There was some training sprinkle with no two, but I find I'm more passionate and like a leaning to learning more like the mental side of thing And people are kind of reading off that and asking deeper questions on that so it kind of fudgin slowly But surely I'm getting better at the whole public speaking thing I think I saw how moments where I'm like Settering and saying like and I'm way too much I'm like telling 80 if I hear back in a video, but we're getting better so no shame But yeah, it's a wrap on the built from a since 799 or two already back in Florida home for two full weeks So super pumped and not be traveling for a while right now Get to the honey got some good train sessions, but now we are officially under 20 weeks out the one days So it's grind time we're talking in the seminar strength building phases right now for me Trying to get strong this fuck big is fuck trying to get huge and like just over 260 pounds right now The goal is to kind of float around there.

=== FILE: BRUTAL LEG WORKOUT WITH HANY RAMBOD [z2vVGVSg-UE].txt ===

It didn't hit legs. Every year one of his like sick folks just started to tear it. No it's weird they're all like a little dull but hypersensitive. Like certain sounds like hurt me. Furnced mouths making sick like lights hurt my eyes and my brain like... How can I help you if you won't let me in? The world's too... You need bitch. Come on! Come on Chris! Come on you won't stand. Oh come on you won't be able to go for this one. What's that? You gave this yard to where Mike did it? Do you want to come to dinner today? I have to go to the movies. Oh he's denying my invite. Oh shit! How many times a holiday? How many times a holiday cup of the town? A lot. He doesn't actually. Emotionally he does. Every day to Chris. Or you. Yeah. Technically he called me a midnight. I'm gonna do it in the hospital. But he decides to work out in the hospital. I'm into that. What? You do. Also just... Just being with us not ours. What's that else? I don't know. I told Calvin I'm gonna say using a bike but he said pressure. So you guys gotta wait for that to have your idea. I'm trying to tell him who doesn't work at all. So you can blame him in the comments that week. I don't know. I don't know. I told Calvin. I'm gonna say using a bike but he said pressure. So you guys gotta wait for that to have your idea. I'm trying to tell him who doesn't work at all. So you can blame him in the comments that week. Did I get enough shit for it? But like Dave, with Mr. Harding about to go through a quad workout, he's making sure I'm up to power strong enough, big enough, lean enough to be getting the season rolling. So it's over due to the day. There's nothing else really to do. Any secrets going on? I'm the share of secrets. Secrets, consextra. Because it's only this. Because seeing the chin is safe, darling. Eh? No, you say secrets don't exist and then they don't go looking for it. Okay? Always. I can't lie then. You're our secrets. I can lie all over. Yeah. There are secrets. Are we smart? Have you been there or in the media? What depends on how you feel? Are you gonna be a skinny bitch? I'm always skinny bitch but I can also squat heavy. Well, let's try to be a strong skinny bitch. Good. You weren't even that stress last year. I was actually surprised. Everyone's all mad. How's he doing with all the stress? I don't understand. When you were telling me that, I was like, I've never really been a stresser. I'm anxiety, maybe that's why I thought that's... We've been the admitted that I have been... But like, every single person has anxiety. But I just say it. Most people just share like, I don't have it, you know? Yeah, I guess. I could be it. I mean, you could get it around. Huh? I said, you've been around. How does it? It just shuts down. Oh, you internalized it? Yeah, it doesn't go. It doesn't go. Yeah, you shut down and you go into a closet. That was the stress down in 2018. That's when I shut down. So you just shut down. That's the way of handling the stress. I'm not mental like everything. I mean, everyone shuts down a little bit. No. A lot of people go out there. Yeah. People go out there. People go out there. People go out there. Some people go out there. Some people get fucking just mean and nasty towards everyone around them. They create a fucking glass of. My head... I didn't walk around my head down and like, mopey. I was just... Why? I'm not thinking. I'm a little bit of everything, so. Calvin rides away. Ooh, we got after something. It's just this. You know, it's... You feel it affects you? No, I just feel it more. I can share a tea. Not affected at all though. It's good. What a feeling of being. One breath. It's a... One breath every second. What the... Yes. It was so big boy. He's like, I know I'm in this body. That's right. Oh yeah. Happy dog. I think he's got bigger legs in here. He's got bigger legs in here. He's got bigger legs in here. He's got his own collar. It's crazy. He's so scared. I just wanted to chat with Stringer. Pointing my toes, you mean? But like, you want to hold it on the top? Yes. You want to do the way. If I do this way, I'll hold it at the top of the first leg by the breath. And then go. You want to make sure you hold it. Right? Make sure you hold it. Yeah. So that's point of the whole set. It's just... we're getting it. Now we'll first three or four reps without hold. Then we'll go ahead and do some hold. And then we'll see how you got it guys. And then maybe do some partial straight. Good. Good. Straight. Good. Straight. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Pause. Pause. Good. Do you want like that? One more like that. Good. Two seconds. Good. That's right. Try to see. Go. Keep it moving. Five. Four. Three. Two. One more. Good job. There you go. Let's get one up. Now it's just a little bit tough. What? Good one up. Now it's time for working with us. I thought there was a work with us. No. That's a warm up to a working set. That's a main. That's so mean bro. Not here'd be nice. Yes. That's okay. How you got five images? So what we want to do is let's go into a turn sideways. Two of them are quad. One more. One more. One more. One more. Push it. One more. Five seconds. Two more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. Hold that. Good. Good. Well. You ready? It's a look of excitement. Could my legs hurt? Yes. I told you. I didn't. I did. I'm like I'm going to get some fun. Let me do it in a great spot. I just wanted to get some footage. Okay. So let's go ahead. I think we should be able to continue to try to go ahead. So we're going to ahead any spikishings. I think it's really comfortable for you. And then from there we'll decide on where to take it. We might end up doing really in hack or there might be another exercise. If you have a good pendulum or you have something on those lines. But let's go and screen to a smithishing spot. So we can go and ask the counter to jump that. While your body is still somewhat fresh. Let's do it. Let's go. Let's go. Good. Good. Here we go. You ready? Nothing. What are you waiting for? How many reps? No idea. I'll do it. 15. I'll be easier<|en|> last time. I did that with straight line but I think I'll leave you. You got it. You got it. Let's go. Let's go first. Come on. I still like it. You got this. Give it to me. You got it. Oh, is it on? WellANA is OH. I think I got at least five percent. You look forward. Oh. Come on, life is a need. Why do my needs hurt? I wonder why. I think I'm going to buy more plates at my gym. I'm going to have to carry it around the cushion. I'm going to have to work it around the fucking gym. That's why you got to get Calvin to do it for you. I have been a center. I'll probably get to see you sometimes. I'll rip it to cause it my nose. This is extra cardio. I'll tell you Max might as well go through carrying ability. Right? That's right. Mine are big bags. Big bags, small balls. You got to wear something ridiculous for like week out the week out. Just like to see if people don't want to. I don't want to. We'll do it with a hot-y trun. Just don't wear crocks. I won't do crocks that I won't do. Never. What's your opinion on crocks? Camels. Okay, well that's different. He's like 10. Yeah. That's too old. Got to change the ways. I got to get him over to Burx. I'm going to rip wearing Burx. That's why I laughed at you. I was wearing Burx. Cause it's a Northern California. That's what the fuck you are. It's like, you know, it's like the weeds and seeer of the woods. But you know what's not? I think that would be good. Yeah, would be good for that. Yeah. I'm going to have a talk with Cam like 7th team. And I'm going to talk to him about Travis Scott's and Kobe's and off-way. All they should. He's already done. I need to have Travis Scott's. No, he's already asked me about what he's about. Kobe's. But he sees all my Kobe's and he's like, can you get the kids Kobe's? Yeah, but you're really cool. Cam, if you had these shoes, you wouldn't be here. That's too old. Yeah, I was going to have to fucking send you the bill. When you're in try to put my son into a fun and speak there. Ready? No. No. No. No. No. Troll. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No way. Oh. Come on. Croupe. Do you have aATECIS? Youования? Do it. Good. Good job. That was on two tight. A little bit is a little spruiner feet out. Can I say this one if I go water if you have my ducks. That's what I do. Why do you say when I just told you when you were, you just repeated to my song? I said it before you said it. Is that a first of the night? You should be excited for all the same way. Say wait and per one, say wait and wait. I bet I love it. What's that? Always wants to be unique. He does. He does. He's very unique. They broke them all the way. I probably wanted to be unique because I'm so basic. He leans into his basicness. I mean he wants to train in August this year. He's saying. Hi, hi, hi, it's an hug. The program you're like a bear foot chooset. Who was telling you, where did you want to see it? He's huge red boot. Yeah, we're going to have a problem. It's like a thing. Is there a dragon on Mr. Miss? Mr. Miss? Sorry. Mr. Miss? I'm going to make the music. I'm going to make the music. I'm going to make the music. I'm going to show you the music. I'm going to show you the music. Actually, actually, it's a free version. That's it. That's it. Good. Good. All you better. Good. Good. Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Don't pass. Just go. Just go. Three. Two. That's it. And dry. That's it. Why? Perfect. That was the guy. That was the guy. That was the guy. It didn't get late. You saw something. I like it. I like it. Good. I don't realize over the years with him. Every year, one of his senses, one of his like sick folks, just started to deteriorate. No, it's weird. They're all a little dull, but hypersensitive. Like certain sounds like hurt me. Frinch smells making sick. Like lights hurt my eyes and my brain. Like very like. I think there's something wrong with my brain. It's not like you're in the zone. To him, it's like you're in the zone. Do you really like, fuck I'm dying? Your hands weren't that thick, bastard. I think that was the problem. We had to do it. It was a lot of deepness. What? It's solid. It's good. No matter how I looked, I thought you think I looked. Yes. I'll be on the table. I'll be on the table. I'll be on the table. These are not your droids. Do you have a drink? Do you have a drink? Do you have a drink before stage? Do you have a drink? I think I need a burger in the fear I can feel it. Yeah. At least I like one chick play sandwich. I can't. God. How is he wants as a burger? The dopamil is making the distrust. He creates my cord of the omelette. You should just order your pizza. No, no, no dairy. It looks hairy. So that sandwich can't have any cheese on it? No, no. I've never get cheese. No cheese, extra ketchup. And all of a... It's all of a ketchup. It's all of a ketchup. Oh. But only one pickle, not two pieces of, you know, no two slices. You don't want to use a glass.

Get in there. Then we'll do two sets. We'll rest up. The rest time is a little shorter. And then we'll come in and we'll keep your feet parallel. And then we'll go ahead and blast the other quad. So why? Yeah. Yep. Yep. See those hands? Then we'll do this. I need you to turn over the Handsaw in. And have it cut down. What's the thing to do with Jeffery's in Jeffery's? Jeffery's in Jeffery's? Yeah. It's like a kind of operative? Yes and no. Yes, closest thing to do nothing, but Jeffery's in all sorts of stuff. They're better? Yes, they're definitely better, but it's what you need, not necessarily. Otherwise I'd be telling you. You know what I'm saying? Right on that slide. Good. You'll let that go, right? Good. Good. Good. Nice. Stretch. You're going. Three. Go. Two. Good job. And left. You're going to do this. You're going to do this. You're going to do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. You're just getting your visual clients of a blood-lessed like I said, going to this on the floor right now. That's what you're trying to do. You're just in golf for your toilet. You have that super-sacced toilet. I just wanted to get extra. I wanted by one of the bougie-tweiles, which was like a cooling heated seat. You used it that place. I don't need my cheeks to be warm. I'm going to do it. What's it called one though? Oh, that's even worse. What? It's more like imagine the vents of the vents that seats like in a car, but I know toilet. I can't believe it. No, because then my whole... I would get goosebumps all the way down my life. I'm taking all the juice. I'm just gonna go over the other side. I can't stop. I'm just gonna go over the other side. I can't stop. I can't stop. I can't stop. I can't stop. Madricard, you're being pussy. I never do this. I can tell. Breath's wife. She can do full matrix. I don't really like what I'm playing on the floor. I'm in the core, but... Do you know what I'm saying? From what? What? I'm saying that video. I thought you might have... The video's not on the left. I couldn't see shit. I told you that one. Resolution. We did a video on the channel. Is that all of shit? Yeah. He didn't resend it? No. Oh. What happened? I cut this out. Joe. Why are you fucking stressing me out? You shit, time? He's like, tough job. I was horribly lying to you. He'd like your pectr or what pectr. Oh yeah. Well, you and I had to chill like that for me too. How about you, Adam? Did you? I'd take you every time I hear myself. I know myself. I know myself. What's the total? So? I worked out to you. You need to be like... I've been like quarter-stop. Every night, course all the rules back down. We're getting to build you a meditation room in New Orleans. Is that all? Fine. Good. I got a break. Good. You're good. Give me big light. Good. There you go. Keep moving. Keep going. Keep going. Okay, now go all the way up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Come on. You're too subtly. Come on. You look soましょう. Spoon. Directions. Naturally. You got this pussy. You just pushed him over. We're like, last one. I didn't even do another. cage. I think China has already hooked this on too weird to have bought some of these. One of my last chances to enjoy this is the right choice. The list should post work there. Wait hold on, get the good flavor one, yeah that's true. I got the original. No, the other one's actually good too. I like a little bit more basic, a little bit basic deal. Yeah, that's definitely a... That is actually, I think, um, texture wise more satisfying than all the other ones I've tried there a little not ours. I'm sure the ones with the original one. Oh, even the protein ones. And I'm sure the one had nothing to do with it and that's probably why. Well, I mean, I was just buckled in. Oh. You can watch this? You can watch this? That's right. I don't even know the guy I'm just looking at one of the most about me. He's just fine. Alright, wrapped up that like day. Pretty brutal like day. What I so strongly enjoyed about it. We only used one set of hacks, lots. Normally if I hit five plates, I might feel good I'll do another set. That's a smith machine, I always thought of that. Anyways, that fucked my central nervous system with the whole workout and then the rest of the workout. I'm sad we did one working set there, one working set on a hack and then like six or seven working set on the leg press. And I got heavy weight and a lot of volume in my life. I've buckled this right right now. So good workout, good game plan, good to go. I had some choral protein, tasted delicious, had a bond treat. So we're living in the dream right now. We're going to dinner because we're living life right now because we're about to stop living life very soon. And yeah, I thought it's going on. So tomorrow's back day and see you guys there for the final workout of this three-part training series with Mr. H.T.

=== FILE: BRUTAL LEG WORKOUT ｜ 6 WEEKS OUT OLYMPIA [JUgzci93e0I].txt ===

What is up YouTube? Welcome back to a yeol prep series underway. Going to be our first workout we're filming. Start it off with a bag, hit up some legs today. This fucking gym has been my savior lately. It's just so nice coming in here in this like tank doom of solitude and beautiful equipment of everything I want. I want so again a lot of appreciation for pure muscle and hook in this all out for me to be able to train like this a lot of fun. But like they're right now finally getting back into the groove of things and I'm feeling a lot better day by day. It's definitely so now under seven weeks out. So it's fucking game time. I'm lucky to have a no more bullshit. Some of the prioritized bodybuilding not let all the other bullshit get in my way. This is what's most important should have always been but it's on track now. So we're going to try and fuck up some like today. Quad dominant like Dave. Do some of the full new machine. We just got this swing squatting without fully finishing set up. I don't know if I can use it or not. Maybe I'll give it a shot but you guys know what it is. Fucking lots of water because of the hottest shit today. And hopefully we don't pass out on this like day. I like workouts lately of consisted of a little bit different shit. I've been cutting out heavy hacks. Really starting with really heavy squats because my knee is just taking it cold. And it wasn't hitting the part of my quads that I needed to anymore because I was giving tighter and tighter. And my body was naturally working around injuries. So so warming up with these knee extensions. Not that you have to either the best thing for muscle growth. But they do help my knees personally. So I do with that. And if we got a bunch of really cool machine dough there, I'm going to go over there. Hit him up. Gonna love it more volume right now rather than like 68 reps. Trying to get a few sets over around 12 at least on the leg press or something. And then a bit of a more heavier compliment. But just trying to keep my strength high. I'll even get some size and fucking bust out these leg days in this 90 degree humid Florida weather. Really makes you sweat. Beautiful. These were the 5G I might have to feel bad about throwing the weights on the floor. No. What? What? I don't know. We'll put that in our pantry, though. You probably won't be getting that much right. Alright, first compound movement. Doing this squat press, side backs squat press. We've got a side backs regular linear squat and squat press. This one really feels good for me to go high and wide. And I can do more of like a two-most squat type thing. Where I can hit a little bit more of my upper quad of doctor is getting hit. Where that's something has been really hard for me. Like I've seen on some of the squats I've gotten so tight. That I just started to get all like inner quad. It's hard for me to open up and feel like a wider squat position. So, I think I'll back to my roots on a good ol' leg press. I've been having that good machines everywhere I go that I haven't been using like press. Or prioritizing it. And it's how I built my legs when they were huge squats and like press. Squats aren't doing it so we're going back to leg press and we'll do some other shit. But just warm it up. Make sure my groin everything's open and then trim some decent weight on. Go for like 12 to 15 reps. Oh fuck. Like press pyrrish like a Thai school. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. I got like 15 with some kind of recorder at the end. No knee pain so God bless that fucking home yet my head. You work out they're going to be sponsored by raw hydration. It's hot in here. I've got to get 30 reps however many it takes to pick off 2 plates at a time. Hopefully I can do it in 2. Then I'm maximum 3. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. You're hard to do that. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. I'm going to move on. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

=== FILE: BUILDING A THICK BACK ｜ GETTING TATTED [ciHgSZdIVn4].txt ===

He's getting Poppy's paw and he's getting the detail of what you're getting. It's the endless pursuit of our love, right? Come on, come on Chris! Come on, you're still old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old. What's that? I'm later in your village. Good driving. Why did you come here again? Maybe. Wait, who's driving? Why am I driving? Then I have to drive back here. I said, oh, you driving yourself. Yes. This is as old as the time it was and I'm late for everything now. I'll just try that. Why did you park, bud? I like it. What is up YouTube? Maybe doing something to say that you're getting a talk shit about it because you like to talk shit about what I like to do to myself. What? Getting the tattoo. Partly, a lot of because I did a speech, I guess, a talk. This weekend at a seminar, a hybrid health summit, something very of some of my norm. People would really know who I was. Not just a good event for myself, but I spoke at someone else's event. That was about overcoming obstacles and risks when I spoke about it. I made a joke about how 2018 used to be like a fear that brought up stress and anxiety. A year that brought up fear and stress and anxiety in myself. Because of my illness that came on, that's when I got sick. I got diagnosed on a music, a hospital for a while. A lot of shit. But what it also did was it enlightened my mind to kind of go inside and learn how to handle stress. I had to handle obstacles that come up in our life and how to make the best of it. And these are the versions of yourself. So I made a joke. I'm like, I used to my perspective, my friend with mine was at 2018 bad. I did this to me. I was a victim of it. And now I'm grateful for it. You know, flipping the switch on it. I was like, I'm going to get a tattoo on my leg now. I'm so happy about 2018. And I wasn't joking. Two days later, I'm going to get a tattoo on my leg. So, what we're doing? You guys can hate me because you're always like, don't put tattoo on your body. It's dope to it. But I'm going to fuck with me. Good news, you know. What? That's actually close to what I was thinking. Okay. I can show you how I'm right too. Yeah. I think you know what I'm right too. Yeah. I think you know what I'm right too. Yeah. I think you know what I'm right. I think you know what I'm right. We can look at that one online. I don't know what I can guarantee. Okay. Yeah. Absolutely. Ready to get tattoos. Excuse me. He's getting cocky's paw. And he's getting, as you tell them what you're getting. Yeah. It's the endless pursuit of our love. Right? Yeah. That's it. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I just got to play it too. It's actually pretty pretty. You know, hands too pop. You should. Next to your leaf. What I'm dead body. I get it. I might like it here. And her baby paw. So which is that here anymore? You always have an imprint in it. Why you're perfect. Or her face. I'll get her head right here. Watch it. Just a front g-head. With her body. I think that's what we're talking about. With her body. Just put the letters. Like if I were to talk to a like face, it would kind of like let the letters kind of close up in some of the spots. You're a person with that's not a sign. Like you can take that to the face. Yes. Yeah. Like perfect. Cool. All right. So I'm going to go print those out. I was in the right direction. I made this one like has a little bit of space in between them. And then this one has like slightly that more space between those. So everything else. I think that would work out. That could fit. More options better. Yeah. I think that would work out. Yeah. I think that would work out. Yeah. I think that would work out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that would work out. Yeah. What do you want out more space? Not more space? What do you think you did it like in this same spot that this one's going to go. But like on that side. Maybe it's like. Filming them has a thing. So I have this already. It's going to be too bad. It's not very loud. It's not very loud. It's too dry. It'll be much darker when people look. Yeah. I just wish I could be. It's quite. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go wrong. What? Let's go wrong. Brilliant. They're misalty. Profit. You might defecrate the body, is that really something? I'm gonna use this down, I'm just gonna set it down. I'm not gonna lie down, man. Alright, so there you go. Tetsu number seven and eight, or something, completed. Wrap it up. Twenty-eighteen, the most pivotal year in my life, used to suck ended beautiful. Also the year in my cornea, to very end of it, so it's kind of hell up in my cornea, and then I start to get a lot better. So, choosing appreciation for it, but endless pursuit down there, and literally tattooed it right above where I wear my socks, because I wear these socks every day. But I probably will forever, but that's just the concept of the endless pursuit of growth, constantly trying to get to be your best self, and whatever aspect of life it is, getting better and better, and in every instance, it's a beautiful adventure that is life. So, words and methods that I live by, but that's it. So, I don't get to work out today's sadly, because I'm not really trying to sweat into that, so I'm gonna rest today. See you guys tomorrow for, I think it's back there. I don't know, either way, but we're getting here. So, peace out. All right, so in the office today, we're taking testing Choco Peanut butter, protein. Choco Peanut butter, isolate protein. We're going to go to the best flavors ever. But the Chig multiple samples? This is very, first one. Oh, that was a control. But we're trying multiple flavors, a control, and two samples, so the sample is going to be at the nail right now. So, I'm waiting to try them all back to back to back, we have to be able to compare them. How have you been waiting for you? What? Was that Choco Peanut butter? It's great too. That one is good. There's everything this flavor is very different to the way. I think it's because I don't always love Dr. Choco. I think it's because I don't always love Dr. Choco. I think it's because I don't always love Dr. Choco. We're going to be able to play there. We're going to allow Dr. Peanut butter. Let's go. That's good. Give us a ball of ice. I think that's a really good. It doesn't taste the exact same, but it's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. Let me try it now. I try to be good. Yeah. That's really good. This is great. You get the peanut in the trunk, which is like a drum right? It's a much better trunk, but. Do you want to go to the gym? Shut the front now. Who? All PTLs, of course. White cherry. The amount of time they've asked for Dr. Choco, come back with you. It's not bad to like White cherry, but it's a... So, it's super the, like, 2.0. This is super stuff like 2.0. No. Nice and black, series. That's good. Okay. That's really good though. This is the one we're going to do the John Wick ad? Yeah. Did you get up there? Yeah, but he told you about it. What the hell? We'll get it up for. It took you to build. Hit up Mustang. Mustang Instagram. Hey, can I rent a car for a shoe and how old are you guys? Well, I had to do it. I hit up Chrysler to get that div in lady to need reply to me. Dad? That's really good. That's probably one of our best flavors. She can't. That's probably made that form of a suit. That's good too. That's a div in her. Yeah, too. On my, on my. But they're modern? Yeah. This is the one that's like, asshole. Yeah, that's super cool. Yeah. Yeah. This is super rare, by the way. Normally we take this thing and it tastes like asshole. We have to go back ten times. That was the first time that people tried to nail drug appeal about her. And the second version of it, money. And this first one, a white cherry, fire. I don't even know what tastes like a slushier something. It's really good. Or white gatorade mixed with like ice cream. Yeah, it's like the ice. See that has the polar bear on it. We're like airheads even. The white bear has the solution. Yeah, yeah. You know if I eat this a little bit of the whole thing. Maybe we're coming out. That's like it. That's like it. You really roughly met me? Do you have any bummed out of your dreams? They're open. How come the open was that right there? There's like a case in it and I covered it over there. I know that's right. How do they know how many of you are next though? Don't you? Oh, I know. Oh, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Those are samples. So? What's it? Those? Peach? Plain Peach? I don't think I like it. Alright, so. Oh, goodbye dog. Is it dog in there? It's what's back there? One of the big things in the channel bring up. Honey said he's going to send me a game plan for the training schedule going forward. So that's going to be what's going on. I've been traveling a lot so it's time to sit down and lock in training now. I mean, I've actually been training really hard and getting back to it. So looking forward to the process of it all. But this past weekend I was at a speaking event and it's funny because that was you. It's funny because literally trying to get myself out of it. But he asked me to do the speaking event the night after the Olympics. When I had a few drinks in me and I was like, and I could move and I agreed. And then he put me on a post and I was stuck doing it. And I really want to do it. So I tried to get out of it, but I was like, fuck it. Whatever it's to Q and A. And then he gave me like a keynote speech. We're actually at the speak by myself and you guys know, I'm not a public speaker. But I had to flip my mind set. Instead of being like a fuck I don't want to do this being like this is not a opportunity for me to get better. Something I suck at do something I'm afraid of and get better at it. And I actually did really good. I don't think I started at all. I didn't say like I didn't say I'm the whole time. I had like a story I told a bit when I got sick because of the health summit. Now how I had to overcome the anxiety and fear around my health. Kind of my mindset going through and accepting the unknown and taking control of what I did. No, and what I did to take control of my health. And I think I actually did a decent job and it's funny because now I'm not a public speaker. I'm running to now thinking of like a renewed out of someone I was honny soon. Before I was really nervous to do that and I'm already like looking forward to it more because I know I'm better at it. And I know it's another opportunity for me to get better. So people are always like do something every day that scares you and all that bullshit. But like kind of hard do something every day. I really do something every day that's probably not going to be that scary. So my thing that I learned from this, it picks something in the future that you maybe it's not something you want necessarily even. But something that someone else does that you envy. Like I respect people who can public speak very well. You can speak very well and fluently. That's something I want to get better at. And so pick something in the future that you're afraid of and maybe not get that and plan to do that thing. And then progress yourself towards it. Practice your way there and then do it. It doesn't have to be every fucking day but like a few times you're doing something that scares you and put you in a position to grow. You're going to make you better person. It's going to build your confidence. And you're just going to feel really good about yourself. Very proud. The endless pursuit of life of being better and better at tiny little things and becoming whatever version of yourself you want to be. So I do a spirit of motivation for the day. Plants him that scares you and fuck that shit out. But we're going to get you a huge back day. We'll see you guys. Have a good day. All right. So typical warm up with some pull down came a bullshit. Somebody is my favorite pull down spot. Put this in the corner. Someone put this shovel handle on. So I fucked it up. We need to put it up today and do the shovel handle. So I did like four or five working sets or sort of warm up to the end of my last stretch warm up. They're working to come and film in the night drop sets finish up. And never warm. So I'm going to do some kind of heavy row movement. Probably just for a dumbbell roast. Let me take it. So move on to those and get out with the workout. Yeah. I won't put in my life. I did like one ten set this. I don't want my form with trash. I don't want to get really weak. Oh. I don't think I will get the hands off. It's one of those things. We're going to start the breathing section on the pad. So, a four-seeded practice proper breathing techniques. Should do this every exercise, but you're forced to on there. So, we're going to try to get better. Did every breath breathing the same position? Because your might chest is getting switched by the pad. It's like the blow out on the way down. Deep exhale at the bottom. Pulling the bumble there for a second. Now, the air in me, the oxygen. Feel like I'm power. Ripping it up. Let the air out. Suck it in and repeat. And like a rhythm of that. So, you're going to the same breath every time that holding your breath. Remember to breathe. Makes you stronger. Instead of shape from out of breath, we're going to grab this. Just never like this machine. Because it couldn't reach all the way. And then, really, you have to take all the plates off and lower the back end to the reaching all the way. But the one arm row where you can actually get a full stretch. Are beautiful. The way better than a dumbbell row from the floor. Just get a much better stretch in the contraction. Put it in the dream. But little tip on these. The same arm that you're doing. Keep that foot planking forward. A lot of people will put that foot back in that arm forward. You're opening up your hips. And then you're opening your body. Your core is moving the weight. But I think you can put forward. Your hips are forced to stay forward. And you have to pull some of your lathe rather than your core. So, keep it in your back. No one wants to thick. Big legs. Jesus, fuck. Nothing heavy. I'm a fucking, that's what I mean. What that mean where someone gets launched. And then, go that thin. No. No. Then someone like dancing through space in the ocean. No. To me with some overweight dude falling off a bridge. Flies in his space. It's pretty funny. Maybe jumping up to place in the little bit. I think I've got you. Two is casting example. You're doing a job? Yeah. Slow job. I will take a shot. Nice. You want to have one laugh? It won't go that much. The work I have to wait for you to work with me. I'm just going to go. I'm a machine because of the waste in the glass. They get like extra stuff heavier. It makes it really hard to lock it on the contraction. We're at Lock-In. I guess it's a rope. I don't know how you say that. But normally I put on a little more weight in the middle. Put it on the top range and on the machines. There's just where the weight will be heavy. It's putting it up here. It makes it heavier. To begin the middle range of motion. So on the stretch. And then now they pull. I guess a little bit lighter. So I can get the full contraction in my back. We're also having heavy load on it. So kind of fancy machine. I've never smart enough to use them properly. It's the only one I understand. So, give me an shot. It's hot in here. I don't know how many feet much. I can't tell the bad idea. Yeah, horse. Yeah, we're gonna rest my bowies. You'll be shit. You just got off. You got all you have to do? That way you do it for early? I mean, yeah, find out. You have to do it for a while. You have to go on with the bar. What? With the bar. Like this? Yeah, just put 135 in this. But I can't even do this. That's the only up here. This is where it's first constant. This is 2019. When my hair started to hit. My hair looks ready to go back. You're put away. How that work out for you? I think it's getting worse. It's not getting worse. It doesn't look that. I don't understand what's going on. Yeah, from mine's going back. I'm gonna scare you. I'm losing my shit. You can't cover our 6-wheel. Pro-sense Gendi.2. So, right? So, what? So, what? I'm gonna start with Mimdi. It's not going to work out for you. But not going away. For any health to the monkey, do you? For any health to the monkey, do you? For any health to the monkey, do you? For any health to the monkey, do you? For any health to the monkey. You're so good. This drives it out. I'm trying. But bro, I've been working out for a couple of two weeks now. Well, don't work out. That's good. No, I'm pushing it out. I'm not like popping it. I'm like, well, I'm like, well, I'm not going away. Tromma, I've just such bad luck with pimples like this. Like, I get them and they're like, they're so bad and they stay for so long. I'm like, what can you do? Can't I'll be perfect, mom? I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. Bitch reps. Bitch reps? I'm pulling down the curtain. You want this extra? It's a side of your statement. How tall are you? And the... I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. The tall room and the maid service, tucked at that cheetra and two deep on the outside. So, wake up. Nightingest. I'm just trying to fucking rip them up. That's what you're doing. Show them a rip with that cheetra. Ah, ah. Thanks, man. Yeah. Thanks, man. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Alright, last exercise. I picked a weight that's not too heavy. I'm going to be forced out just like 20 second rest instead of doing a long set. So I'll just decrease the rep range every single time. Going pretty much close to failure and then we're done this work now. How many likes does this video have to get for you to buy me a red rocker? 100,000. Oh, I like it. Okay. Do you think it's a hundred thousand likes? Yeah. Good luck. Why have I given it that too much? No, I've never given up. Maybe you've shown it to me. Fuck that. That's it. Go home. Help me win a red rocker, guys. What? Help me win a red rocker. Help Calvin win a red rocker. Alright, as we wrap on today's video. Thank you for watching. Thought of the day. Do something that scares you this year. I think big that scares you. Because doing easy stuff. Feels your ego. If you feel good about yourself, because you need to shit that you're good at. Heart stuff. Feels your ego. Forces you to grow. Thought confidence become better person. Try. And then Calvin's going to start taking a trip. No, I mean he said. No, he told me. So he said. No, he said. He said something. We're going to take a trip. We're going to take a trip. We're going to take a trip. We're going to take a trip. So I'm going to try and see if I can take it. I'm saying people are scared to do it. Okay. I don't do that. Somebody comes trucked up. I will make you better. Don't let somebody calving to ever. We're supposed to. Peace out. Peace out.

=== FILE: BUILDING BIG ARMS ｜ OFF-SEASON TRAINING [DawNc-1sPrg].txt ===

What are you doing? Laterking joking. No. No. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. I told you I would laser his neck or whatever you want. You know what's crazy? That thing was probably made for five dollars somewhere on the world. I spent four grand. You're? No, sort of got my patley's or bar for my bet. It's only a certain voltage that that narines can get. So my bet's always told me she had three on. I know. It's a real light bulb. That was. I told her. Chris I've all this over his kidneys and everything. Come on. Come on Chris. Come on. You're one. Two. Four. Come on. Come on. What's that? I want to put this on the air. You're gonna put this on the air. No, that's it. I'm sick. What's up? You're sick. I've been fucking pushing this off season lately and my belly is just not adjusting food. We're great right now. I had to take these binders for the mold that I have. It's supposed to bind everything up. Push it through me. And I think it's just making all my food just sit in my belly. So I've been trying to breathe them brutal. I know my drink like a leader. I've watered with my pre-workout just like hydrate. I just did that right now. My belly is even more full. So I started blocking on a treadmill. I never do that pre-workout but I had to move cash my breath. I came back to life because I'm dead and turning this fucking juicy pump right now. I took a scoop of leuker savage. I see your pure good coming down like a month and I'm fucking jones. So hopefully it gets me a good pump. Good work, it's going off. The fourth of July so happy birthday America. I should make a markup. I'll give it a go. It's one for America. That was heavy. My rope pushed out strength. Getting stronger faster than my overhead stretch strength. So I started. Fuck it. Drop setting instead of super setting. Alright, so I've been putting in low script cash. This is a name for the second one where some weird press. I'm going to do it in between a low script bench press. I'm pressing it and then bring my handle a little bit higher. So it falls here a little bit. You sit up a press where I'm down here. And it just allows a little bit more bend. More like elbow flexions. I can make my triceps engage more. This is one of the few things that I can put a decent load on. It's a hurting my shoulder. Like weighted dives, dips, machines and stuff. So I've really hurt my lathe. So I've been doing these a lot. Did I feel good? I put the bench on one inkline. Not quite 45. Like you would have to put it on flat. So again, the flat hurts me a little bit more. This one's allowing me to press for my triceps a little bit more. So yeah, this is one of my heavy load triceps. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. So I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. I'm putting it in the class. Alright, moving on to some biceps right now. I'm going to try and super set this and then this before. They're giving it a shot. I'm going to do pre-trip our curls over there. I'm going to do a little bit lower than I'm doing spider curls. I'm going to do a little bit higher. Higher your elbow comes up through your head right there. The head is a contraction on your bicep. The more I salated it is, the way less weight you have to do. So I'm going to do some basic pounds on that. I'm probably going to keep it light over there if you like. Easy bar for 25, maybe 10 on this side. See how it goes. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. Take some more of these things. Be a little bit ambitious with the tens on here. It's a really good job. I'm not going to lie. It's like experimenting. I'm going to drop the weight. You might go behind. The next set hopefully in my fucking 6 reps and maxing fucking preacher biceps. I'm not out here trying to tear bicep. Don't want that again. Braggies? So fucking 10. Like I'm on the go and now I'm going to go stinger. I need you to do a giant scalving. Yeah. Fuck, I forgot to take my preaching. You're what? I'm pretty sure. Have you seen the show The Witcher? No. Bro. Favorite TVC? Yellowstone's supposed to come up with summer. The Witcher's way better. Fucking Henry Kavill. I'm so mad though. He quit in Superman. Roll in the Witcher role in the same year. I don't know what the fuck wrong with that guy. I suddenly go see the new Nolan movie. Open hammer? Yeah. Everyone's braving. I can start a bit better. Yeah, it's more green to the barbecue though. Are you too good by that comment? No, but I want to wrap her now. Four director? No. I've made my decision. I don't want to come out anymore. Who would have the deal? But then I thought about it. Yeah, I'm the real one. But then I thought about it. I realized that I don't have the necessary requirements to store a K footage. Do you know the SD cards for the rapper are two terabytes each? Two terabytes. The drives I use for your entire year is four terabytes. I know if you're trying to say people watching but no one knows what that means. People will know. So what do you think of the level of lens? That's my dilemma. You're going to have a fun day. I guess you're going to have a good day. So what do you think of the guy who has a lot of energy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright, so last video I said I was gonna answer some questions in the comments. When I got a funny one, I put a funny question, but I led to some funny game of my class. They asked me my opinion of what I think of the question thrown around over what do you think of the clout around the trenchlands? What is it about the trenchlands? So watch the first video I've ever watched of them. I'll help you come and invent them. I got to say it pretty fucking funny. I laughed at it. I'll start by saying, I'm proud of this because I use a PED to treat that blatantly obvious. I don't like promoting it or using it at the forefront. I truly believe that as I've lowered it, I can focus more on the importance of training in YouTube. I've become a lot better by the way. So that's what I try and preach, so I don't really appreciate people preaching drugs in the unit community. So that being said on the positive notes, the dudes are fucking around. And they're told that I just, I know the trenchlands is almost like a joke name, because they're just fucking trolls. But the video I've been reading people love them is they don't have a fuck with people think about them. They act like idiots, they fight each other, fuck around, make stupid jokes. And they just happen a good time. They train hard to fuck and they're living life and they're enjoying it. I think the whole world wants to live a life where they don't go to the fuck with people think about them and they're kind of presenting that. The second thing they represent is like a fucking brother, they're brothers and they love each other. And they remind me of two people that would like fucking fight with death. Against each other or to protect each other. I think everybody really wants that kind of like relationship with a friend or a girl. So respect that. So finding the positive and why I think people love them. So they don't go fuck with people think and the girls. So who doesn't want to control like that? But yeah, I don't see it pretty fucking funny video. I'm gonna knock on my eye. I'm not trying to give them a platter or anything, but it was humorous. I laughed at it. Probably never gonna watch another video in my life, but I'm glad I watched the one because I got a good laugh. That's my humble opinion. It's like a kind of my grudger or... I'm a grudger or exactly. Like you watch his dog? What? Are you watching his dog? Is it out? Yeah. No, I gotta watch the countermeasured guy's dog and Chikilo and Yildog. I love Jack and apparently it's dope. My grudger dog's dope. It's like, talky, arrogant, like a little fucking it, like, but funny. Yeah, but then like over time he like got humbled. I'm humble, but like he really like what he looks like values of like family and loyalty. Which has always been like a forefront, but like he cleans into it lately. Because he's on it more. There's always something about that like arrogant little dude that people just love to go watch. Like Michael Jordan. Most of the people like love to hate him. He was fucking cocky. He was the go and he backed it up and just people just fucking love to watch that. That's me by it. You can far pull her opposite of my personality treat, but something to admire that is something that fuck the people think about him. I mean, they do, and they hide it, but teach their own. It's like that saying, it's like you can hate him, but you can't stop watching him. He's a... I stop watching, but I enjoyed what I did watch. I'm not going to be a guy saying I hate him. I hate him like that, but I don't know the... Dude's funny enough. Is that a really nice? Yep. You're a man who has a beard. What's in? What's in? What's in? What's in? What's in? What's in? Oh yeah, forgot. She was only Cargo. She's broken, so. What's in? Michael, my girl. Nice, thank you, what would I say? Hi, camera. Hi, I'm true. I'm this guy's time to get fucking here. He hasn't gone to camera, like literally too much. I know, I'm like... Look at it, look at your plethora of fucking... Yeah, she has a full-on sanctuary. You've been to do something less. Oh yeah, this is... You're at the grounding mattress. I got that. Yeah, she's here. She's here. Oh, she's staring. What? She's here. Oh. Oh. Oh. Nothing's changed. She's... She's still mowing. She's still the same old... You know? She's the baby, what? Same old, girl. She's the one. She's the one with her dress. Oh, yeah, that's the one. Are you just a touch? Calment. You're supposed to agree with me. Not a group of dress. No. I brought that magazine in because I knew you would like it, right? What is it? Did you buy it? It's cars. Yeah, I knew. I knew. I knew. See that right there? That's what I'm getting. But not like a readable. So he's getting guys. 69, come on, R.L.S.3. That actually is one of the... Actually, technically is one of the childhoods. Can he have one? Well, when he's staying, when his staying got stolen. He never got a camera. They gave him a fucking charger. Can't you? Can't you? Can't you? What? Which one? The first one they give him a fucking charger. S.X.T. No, it was a camera. I just watched the first time. Okay, then with the second one. One of them they get, they're like, at the end. They're like, we got to the given the keys. The black dude, the manager of the hood. Yeah. He's a game based S.X.T. Yeah, I was pissed about that. She'll be stealing my health, get it. I won't see what the camera weighs out of him. I don't remember that. Who's an SS? Obviously. I was like a 60. But did it have the R.S.R.S. It was like, isn't it? It was SS. I like the R.S.R.S.R.S.R.S. So, thanks. Bye! We were going to comment, but I don't even give a fuck. Because she might be. It was why you need like a malem wall or a big aggressive dog. Are you kidding? I'm like a golden dutel. I'm not a scary duck. I'm good. There was a gold dutel puppy next door. We should go knock in the door. That's really creepy. No, she takes the lead with X.T. I'm a... I'm already married with X. What are you... You're fucking joking. No. We're dealing for our partners. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I told you that I would laser his neck. Or when I figured he was. You know what's crazy? That fucking thing was probably made for five dollars somewhere. I said, I spent four grams. You're... No. My patley's are barking. My vet. It's only a certain voltage that that naryans can get. Some of that's always to make sure three of them. And the red light bulb. Shh. Not always at a red light bulb. But that's a fucking red flag. Right. I don't do anything for the people I love. I told... Chris had all this over his kidneys and everything. Oh, he's scarier. He's scarier. I'm so sorry. That scared the sard. I'm so sorry. Oh, we can't leave you tonight for five or two. I'm getting so scared. Welcome back. I'm sure you're hoping for her in the end. Can you hear mama? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Come back. No. Come. It's a smothering bother. I don't even think an NFL athlete gets treated better than what's the. You fucked. Did they see what these people do? The NFL's with those giant versions of that. They're full beds of that. Okay. Maybe not an NFL athlete. We're seeing a red light bulb. You're like sitting in the pod. You're like a tanning bed. It's like a bit different. Okay. Well, she doesn't treat you as well as Watson. This thing, dude. She's an innocent dog that hurt her shoulder. He's hurt his hamstring, his shoulder, his kidneys. Okay. Don't even give you that shit. Anytime Chris doesn't paint, remind them what I did this year at the Olympics for you. She massage the farts at me. Literally. Like if you don't think that's true love, then I don't know what it is. I did it. I didn't know what was painted. I've been in actually no. Well, it's been a bit of not like two years. But I was rough. I had to go circular motion. Just like the most getth and possibly imagine that wouldn't be my stomach. Just fucking night. And I was in the gas chamber room. Like literally like this. We started to do it. You had the figure in my digestion, you. How do you sound like? It's good to hardly told me no hot hot. So I put the ratch on everything. So maybe I'll listen to my coaching. Sorry honey. Alright kids, it's going to be a wrap on today's video. Happy July 4th. Maple a waffle protein to sell and stuff. We only have, I think there's only a few thousand units left. And we're never restocking. We were in a bunch, but we are never restocking it. Unless people are like it. That's my right now. We're not going to be making it. So if you want it, get it. But the thoughts going on, we're going to go barbecue tonight. Fucking fourth of July. Hashtag fucking America. We're going to get the RAMT RX, the Ford RAP there. We're going to do donuts with fucking firewood. Shoot none of the tailgate and drink beer and folks who go out. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're doing zero of that. Yeah, probably we can have a lettuce wrapped hamburger. You're being bed tight and I'm going to be cloth. That's a lot more accurate. It's a lot of new. This is a show. Can you tell the about the show? Oh yeah. So it's a success. Sorry, which year better show? I should have heard you that. We started watching a succession. I know people are going to get lit up, but this gives us a show. Take the number one on the internet. I'm not going to talk about it. So far, it's pretty good. Not going to lie. Each of the lots of coffee does an understand. I mean, this is true. I don't really understand a lot, but it's pretty big technical. I mean, you should watch something and then it'll show up on the phone for like 20 minutes. No, I'm not. I had a bed. I haven't got it right. I ashamed you want something you put away. So you were talking about your training program so I allowed it. Oh yeah. How's my 225 up for good? The company's going to split 225 by next year. Yes. Nadi? No. Brother Dave, she's not that ideal. Tell the world. Wow. Okay. We're going to go into a new one. He's bodybuilding. He's going to go from health, from what then to a fucking juice from what then. No. You guys are so rude. Just what do you test off from out of your pores? I already took one in the way. I was going to test off from the floor. You're back. You have a worse hair line than me. Wow. I think we need to get popped in on testosterone. Actually, so you'll... Yeah. Please just pull that your video because we're done getting a 4 to 5. Alright. So yeah. The wrap on the video we're going to be in Nashville in two days for a carbon culture grand opening. So if you guys need a gym in Nashville, carbon culture is the place to be. And Eons is going to be there. So I'm going to try and get a workout in with Eon and he comes back to Florida after two. So pump to about that. But yeah. That's all it's going on. So thank you guys for watching. And I will see you guys later.

эпーム What is up YouTube? Just where we are. The blue anywhere behind me there is a foreign back in Dallas, Texas, was the fucking maniac himself. So it made me go get a hair transplant and he's stressing me out of the time. I'm going to show you what's happening. It's very true. But we're here back in Dallas, so we're going to get some more cuts in, be a real bodybuilder for a day or two. So I go back home and go back to trying to run a marathon. So putting some gold into the garden, putting some gold together, walking poppy, all like it's stuff. We're here, hoties here. These in town, these two in half, we say the Arnold. So I'm going to show them what real strength looks like. We're going to get after it, hit a little back work, I don't think I've done them back work yet since you want to be a. But I'm exhausted when I'm full again. So we're going to bring it back up, fix that torn light, getting the big juicy back and you have to do it. what you don't passion? You're lying there for eight hours and in ten days, so we're going to get that room soon, and then you should recognize that. But I mean, she's my tool for teaching her. But you're going to need to come in, but she's going to come on, but I know that. She says it falls out and then after she's muscled, it grows back. Yes, she's going to tell us now. Yeah, tell us now. What? It's going to be out of love. If I do 15 minutes of running, it's a cool little like an hour of walking on the channel, so why are you doing that now? You don't even do an hour of treadmill on the during the prep. That's no good. No, you don't have a rear 45 minutes. You have a two hours, you have a two hours, you have a two hours, you go where you're doing it out of 30. Yeah, but you need to be tournable for the day. Yeah, we're not at one time. Yeah, but you're going to work there with 50 minutes. Yeah, but you're not doing it now. Yeah. Why would you never do it until before the show? They're going to get the other meat. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Let me do it. Let me do it. This is why I'm running for one. You're going to do a big deal with me. Yeah, I do. Fuck you, I'm feeling good. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. He says you can be right on where you're being from. Yeah. That's it. What will you control? Again. There. You may be funny back there. Yeah. You're going to spin it? Yeah. I don't know. Easy. Just big. You're going to crack in? First time moving. Only when I have to press hot. Good. Good. Good. Good. I didn't know we were trained hard. But we were warming up. We're going to have to warm up. Yeah. You got to warm into the offseason. If I'm doing 60% training, 80% training will get me gains. He didn't even know what exactly he disagreed with me. I think I've barely been there honestly. I'm traveling so much. But it's good. You got your car? You know I've seen him. He's been working out. I know my limits. What? Yeah. 232. No, I'm not too fit. It's still bigger than this guy. Who me? Why? Could've met a breath? You know, not running. I hurt myself running. Did you? No. Maybe a little bit. I'm only running out of treadmill. What? He says you're getting lazy. Yeah. I was getting lazy my offseason. You're home, sir. You get why are you guys? I get lazy because I'm smart. I do one show here, no Arnold. So while he's doing the Arnold, I can just be lazy. Good. You really haven't been watching. I haven't. That's a little running, flag. What's that flag right there? Is that this? Oh. Hey. Good. What a good flag. It's a high school flag. Right now here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I wonder why? Whew. I'm out of shape. It's a rough life. So I can you for sure, let it. Yeah? You still get it in the GT3 RS, I think. I think you'll have fun, it's just okay. I need to do longer for this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. Yeah, I feel like it's working out. Yeah, that would be such. This is what it feels like to work out again. I've been in my net. Whew. I like to know how you like to get everybody head start. But can we close and go up? Who knew the head start? Or should I back a little bit when you come on? Hello? Yeah, I'm on. It's a four type of four. It's a four type of four. Back, it's four. Come on. Come on, Chris. That's it. Oh man. It's just like a swine of skinny. That's that. I got it. What? What? That's the sand, it's And what? That's what you are, it is Made of sand for you all over ladies again. What? Some snow sighs. What I've got. Oh man. No. Oh man. No. There he is, don't. Something fell on your head. Here it is again. It just me. Here it is. I just don't have the strength. I think like two months off. I'm going to be fucked up. They change it because we are the three people for us. Yeah. Yeah. Community keeps you young. You can't go. Uh-oh. We're reheating. Oh a man, he might have some worried notasts. Yeah we're gonna watch out. Has he had two bombs? 3D. Ah! 0.5. 4. 2. 3D. There you go. Ah! 3D. Good. Good. Go, go, go. 2. Good job. Come on, Eddie. Soar. You're right. I'm going to work as I'm going to work as I'm going to work. Good job. Last one. Good job. You've been at the one dead. Yeah. You're straight. 4th of a p-dix. 4th of a a-dix. Come on. Good. Go. You've been now. Yes. You're the last of a shakin' day. It's got a little bit of a big one. Up to jack. It's like saying please. Cool. Oh boy. Easy. It's work so far. You guys talk shit every year, but here I am. You know? All I hear is shit about the mic. My unorthodox message. But I pulled it together every year. Every single time he does do this, and it'll be like four weeks goes by. He'll just start wearing a bag of your clothes. And then after four weeks he does like a completely new person. Who's a method to my madness? It's like a cheetah. He goes back in the stands before he counts it. For the long winter or a bear hibernating, you know? You don't want to just stick some mud to clog up my rectum. When he starts to put in the juice, he's like, he's like a cheetah. He goes back in the stands before he counts it. For the long winter or a bear hibernating, you know? You don't want to just stick some mud to clog up my rectum. But it's worked so far every year. So, you know? So now we're going to go with some clondag bars, some ice cream sandwich protein. Let's try it myself. Ice cream sandwich protein. And get huge. That's right. I'll go home. Alright kids, then the work it was Mr. Howdy Japan and Mr. Honey Rumbad. How do you think I'm looking right now? Three weeks at the Arnold. Three weeks for the skated. 100%. Better off than that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big determinant. I think you think. I think you were better off than that. It's all the matters. Perception perspective, all that shit. Mine said it, everything. That's right. I think I'm good. It's it. But yeah, it was another good work at with his hobby and honey. So, it's nice to be trained like a robotty builder again rather than rehab specialist, try not to break myself. I felt good. I'm probably going to be broken tomorrow. Yeah. He's going to be super sore. And come over to you. He's applying to it with Cameron. I'm plugging in yet. We even need to. The soul has been so cold. No, I'm cold. If you plug in the plug, you'll come over. We'll come over tomorrow for the week film. Whatever we have to do tomorrow. But we're going to get some food. We're going to get some food. Maybe tonight. We're going to keep calm up. We'll pass the bed down. Because we're going to be going to crazy on night. We're placing our tools in the car. We're going to get them in trouble. But for this, we're going to fuck the boy. I want to be a dad soon. I'm getting ready to come out. You're like, if school's stupid anyway, just sleep in. We'll chill tomorrow. So I'll tell him how big he did. No, he actually likes school. So I'll probably be sad. But, yeah, we are going to keep him up late. So we got to get going. See you tomorrow. All right, what's going on? I'm still going to put an idiot right now. Each of you is a cowboy that I'm wearing. It's like a little earlier. But excited. Because we are launching. We've already launched a woman energy in each of you. She's going to be in all the crowd sexes. So we're in the healthy living sex right now. We're in the bridge as you can see right here. And we have an end cap over there in the corner. It's like a lot more stock than that's like a warm open open air area. But, but my energy in each of you in Texas. This is a fucking crazy grocery store. I'm not going to lie. They have everything that's healthy stuff. Organic stuff. Unhealthy stuff treats every protein bar. Protein drink, everything you can imagine. Probably the nicest between us. Most stocks. We're sure they're going to do so together in Texas. It's not by a couple of men's sheets. So we're here filming a little video. We're changing to be cowboys. So you have to see that coming soon. Why we're in Texas? Because the Chinese honey films the videos for this. And we're actually together one after this. That's easy to get as it should. So super pumped about it. Try to push you to the cross of America together. And see you on. Please grab it. Pull to your story. Or whatever you guys want, we're trying to get into the mainstream area. And very excited to be doing something. So, look at the whole. You drink now. Like how many seconds are going to get? I'm going to say a little bit. Alright, so we wrapped up our trippin Dallas really fast because we didn't want to stay traveling anymore than we ever have to. We're sure to come home Friday. We got everything done on the Wednesday. And we came home Wednesday night after that flew home. Got home at midnight. So happy to be home with me and traveling so much. And I keep fucking selling a broken record saying that. But we had a very productive time. We've had to film two videos and we're out there because we were launching in QT. Big gas station chain out in mainly around Oklahoma, Texas area. And then kind of branching out of monks there. And H.E.B. as well. One of the grocery stores out there. Honestly, an incredible grocery store. I think I said that in there. I'm still blown away by how crazy this up in the section was. I bought it much of a pre-opening chicken. Bar is just to try because we were in there. But you had a lot of stuff going on. It was good to train with honey and honey. They fucking just rose in the shed and me constantly. I take a little time off and it's like it never worked out a day in my life around those two. So, you know, love the banter that I was getting from that. But it was good to let a little fire in my ass. Get myself training a little more intense. You know, I wasn't a training phase where I was trying to create more stability. My body, a lot of the workouts I didn't even really show with me doing a lot of isometric holds. Really boring shit and stretches and mobility stuff that I'm just trying to not be super broken this year. So, getting back into getting strength now obviously pushing some serious weight. Again, so I got to get my legs up to fire. I've provided getting stronger but feels good to be doing a little bit less volume. I'm focusing a lot more on like, you know, some combat movements. But not like then chest of the oppressed, but I then I don't do like 10 flies after. So I'm less sore but my strength is building up a lot. So it's a kind of a fun phase of training where slowly you're really into. I'll be up didn't get more on what those training looks like. But it's kind of all that's been gone. You came back in Texas. We're chillin. Happy to be home. The house is coming together slowly but surely they turn the pool on today. So it's not going to be a cess pool of tadpoles and shit. So I've got to give you guys a house tour. We're going to have to organize it in a ready to rock. But that's I think that's really all the food up. So yeah, appreciate you guys for watching and I'll see you guys next time.

=== FILE: Bodybuilding on Vacation. [j5OQiFsoy_c].txt ===

necesita What is up YouTube? Welcome to a low place called Aspen. I spent my own for the last seven days in the ish. This is the bottom of the hill. I can't really see. You can't see anything. But that right down there is the bottom of one of the snow hills here in Aspen. We can stay here for about six days. My knees are feeling it. But what can I do? The time change also drives hell. I'm blowing blood out of my nose. It's an air so dry here. Make myself a lot of coffee. Some chocolates and a good one of the gym. So I'm doing morning sports, so sleep. But it's caffeine down. Go workout. The slopes. And have a day in Aspen. I'm going to be making myself a little shake. I never used to do on the milk, but I did water, but it just takes better with it. I've been loving this cookies and cream protein. I'm going to try to make it taste even better. So I blend this in there. I'm going to do two scoops. I have nothing else to eat in there right now. I'm going to put a coconut. I should have health. I think corn has some collagen that she has here. Some fancy merriy collagen. This is my skin nails for a back. Beautiful in my hair. Returns to lavish this that I want to. And then some fiber. Also one is for me to random. If you fiber brands, I don't even know what this is. Put that in there. Do two scoops. Do you scoop to that? Do you scoop to that? Do you scoop to that? Yeah. That's like not enough for you. Do you scoop my pants or do you? No. That's step one, two, three. But you chopped up ice on the bottom there. Then we're going to blend this and then show you how to drill trick. Alright, so I've one shot of it. Pull the top line. There's cast suck. So it's a little watery. So I've got ice here out of it in the middle. They'll shake you. But I've been getting this vanilla chocolate chip purely a little less a bit for Noah. Another one of what we do things. Yeah, I put it in after it's blended. I like double punch in here. I'll be together to cook even cream-flavored protein. And then this is chocolate chip. You're gonna roll up. I've blend that for like two seconds in here. It literally tastes like you're having like a... Or you'll mix flour. It was like chunks of cookie in it. Because they're gonna roll up actually hard. So it tastes like you're eating cookie in it. It's really good. The trick with that is not blending it too long. Otherwise it'll turn into that thing. And then you won't have cookie. You'll just have extra chip on it. I've been there that you don't get the texture for. And I'll kind of fall to the bottom. But you end up with a little bit of cut. Got the crunch. That's it, crunch. I just moved here. And the last one. So that's when we make breakfast today. You know, it's slow. And then probably getting early a lot. You should have this in a lot of it. So... Let's take a look. Yeah! Alright, the day number five for me on the slopes in my knees and my feet. It's stuff I start to feel it. But only to come down here once a year. So I'm taking, making the most of it while I'm here. I realized when I was younger, I had all these hobbies and shit I did. And I just stopped doing them when I got older because of bodybuilding, put me out of them, or too busy with work, etc. Recently, having so much going on, I've been noticing that me having these hobbies is so much more important than ever for me to check out. Do the things, kind of get my mind off all the bullshit that's going on and just focus on doing something. Like, we're down the mountain. You can't think about doing anything else other than not dying. Fucking flying down a mountain on ice, sort of metal board under your feet. I love the shit what people do for fun. But this is one of those things. They were shooting me in the home of the shooting a bit more now. It's kind of nice to distract ourselves with that. Sadly, it's not a little bit. It's been just me ripping the mountain. Recently, I went a few times down with some other buddies down here, Chris and John. Matt, I went with one day, but I've been doing a lot of solar runs and honestly, but it really nice to just kind of put my music in, sit on the left, I'll buy yourself and just like look out at nature, be outside, be in the fresh air. I'm going to break this thing off fresh air, but there's also very little air in here. I told you guys I can barely breathe out of this hell to do. But yeah, it's just been really nice to kind of come here. And I know I'm going to get to the school snowboarding once a year. I come out here for like a week and just kind of detach on the mountain by myself, give music and just chill. It really makes me want to kind of want to get back home and the excited to get back to work, like re-energize as opposed to me. It's just like taking an app or doing nothing all weekend. Nice. And I'm someone who loves doing nothing. So this is rare for me. So yeah, enjoying these understanding the importance that hobbies are in my life now, the more busy I get. Especially with a baby coming, I'm probably not going to have a lot of time for hobbies. So I should also make the most of it well last now and also prioritize it when the babies here, because I also got to keep myself sane so I can be as the best father that can be. But this is me ripping the mountain right now. Pretty fucking high as you can see. This gun to the right is like, I don't even know like 20 minutes to get to the top. The pretty big guys mountain. And this is the mountain right at the top of town. So it's the corn. These down there are currently here too. So I can literally rip down, take out my board, walk the 50 feet. And I'm in the town of restaurant, lunch, lunch restaurants, all that shit we're going to go eat or soon. Not about day enjoying it. I'm going to get back on the hill, rip some. See you guys later.

=== FILE: Brutal High Volume Leg Workout [JI9V8ZftzFA].txt ===

Depends on how you can be nice. What's up YouTube? We're so here in Arizona, back with Mr. Justin King. Yeah, we're at his gym here and build better. So I'm in the middle of a business like it was training legs. And I was trying not to be a little skinny business today. And out there, let's do legs. I need it. And he's like, all right, we're doing a two day. I think the fuck I don't do two days. And he's like, all right, just lift him up. So what end is when you guys are doing it? And he is a two-day ball for them legs to clarify better. Yeah, they're both legs, of course. So in the morning, he's doing more of a neural type of training. So we're looking at knock-off the high threshold motor units in like grow terms. It's like, those are the fast twitch fibers. That's like one set of fibers that you want to fatigue. We're doing all of that in the morning. And then from there, that potential hits the work that we're going to do in the evening. So when we come back, it's four to six hours later. His nervous system is going to decline. Then he's going to jump four to six hours later. And then we change and then we go to more of a metabolic type of stimulus. So morning, we're going to jump into the heel elevated back squat. He's doing eccentric hooks. So overloading the eccentric, we're getting a lot of a neural stimulus, more of a strength type of side. Once we go back, PM it is just balls for the wall like burn, lactic acid like it is much of a metabolic adaptation as fast as possible. So great. This makes it to where what we do in the evening is going to hit even harder. Yeah. So it's actually more beneficial to do. Exactly. All in the same day. No, it is. It is. Yeah. If you if you play it that way, you again, you're able to lift heavier weight in the evening. The load creates more tension, more tension, more damage, more damage, more high-perature. If you're a company, so it would you do this for multiple days in the week or this like a, no, you definitely should live once in a week or you would do it. No, you can't. I like. Yeah, on one end of the extreme, you could let's say you're trying to specialize with your legs. You could do it two a day for legs. Everything else is one a day. On the other end of the extreme, you could do something that's like, there's a protocol that's called like a squat holiday. A holiday coming from like different country, but to where you do like 13 workouts in the span of three days. And like you just blast it, right? Or you're doing three a day workouts for two weeks and it's a chest and back, a legs and arms and shoulders and you space that are probably so it's all, it's all how you want to, how you want to set it up. But that's to be productly periodized. 100% left for three months to be fucked. Yeah, no, no one should just jump into this. There should definitely be like a method to. But it's a really, really good and underutilized tool for bodybuilders, especially, that can be utilized. The both hyperature is 100%. Then you can get huge gains from this. Here's gains. Okay, absolutely. That's all I need it. So yeah. Yeah. Alright, like that is two workouts a day. Get after it. Sweet. Okay. You go down. 8665.431. That box off and then you come up and you just below the top of it. Just take your time in the body. These are set for an anticipated bite that they should be at. Then you get to the bottom and it's like, oh shit, we should have had some more room on it. Yeah. Let's pop them off. Alright. So 8 seconds? 8 seconds. Okay. Take your time walking out. Okay. 87765. 433. Oh yeah. Get right. That's going to be the feel of it. But then after that 8 second, you'll do three more reps at a three zero extra. Okay. Yeah. 87765. 432. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1. You're ready for this. How often would you have someone do this like two or three a day workout? If it was in a program and you do it every day for that body part? So, again, everything is like, you're asking for an RPs. It depends on what's called for in the RPs. It depends on like, time is in time to find your talent. For you, if it obviously, this is your job. So for you, it's like a picture. I have 12 weeks to get like the craziest games that I can in this, this, this, this, this. Maybe periodized very specifically. It's all like it's dependent on what? Okay. Try steps with the last. 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, up. Take your time to the top. Best side. It's like this, I'll keep it. That one, that. 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1. That's good, quives. Time for them. 4, 3, 2, 1, up, quarter, down, quarter, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, up, quarter, down, quarter, 3. More needs, more, more to stay upright. Up, quarter, down, quarter, go. 4, 3, 2, 1, up, quarter, down, quarter, go. 4, 3, 2, 1, up, down, speak. 4, 3, 2, 1, up, quarter, go. Good night. I'll try all the last one, 4, 3, 2, 1, up, quarter, down, quarter, 2, 3, get up. That's the same one, right? 3, 2, 1, up, right, still treading, still treading, still treading, still treading, still treading. Drop it. Control. 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1. 4, 3, 2, 1, again. 4, 2, 1, up, quarter, down, quarter, down, quarter, up, quarter, 2, 1, up, quarter, 2, 1, up, quarter, We got three more. Two more. Nine of tights, so let's go. Four, three, two. What up, my quarter. Down to quarter speed. Two more, two more. We set. Let's go. Four, three, two, what up, my quarter. Down to quarter. All it. Get it. Four, quarter. That one, this step can be taken here. Let's go. Four, three, two, one. Up and quarter. Down to quarter. It's me. That's that. That's down to quarter. One, two, one, this. Four, three, two, one. One, two, one. Like you're kicking. That's a problem. Four, three, two, one, up, one. Speed. Control there. Three, two, one, that's good.

So good, my legs were crumbing a little bit at the end of that, but it's an interesting technique here. I don't hate it. It could be a big Saturday Sunday kind of thing. Sunday, double leg day, so something to try out, but obviously with a method to the madness. So we're going to chill, go get some food, I guess. Go get some sushi. You told me you had to eat a fucking food, so we're going to eat a fucking food. Do you want that? Do you want that? Do you want that? Do you want that? Yes. I hope I'll be like next time. I'll just like next time.

=== FILE: CBUM ANSWERS QUESTIONS [3dygKNuQVAs].txt ===

Not go against? No. I'm the opposite of go against. So you don't stay hard, you stay soft. Yeah. Let's go over to the red. Did you stay hard or soft, Quirt? I don't know. I'm back here. You don't know. What? Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on, you're one in two. Oh, come on. Come on, you're one in two. What's the... The idea. Oh? What are you loaning? I live in what? Here. You know. You preparation to start everything. I have a question. What is up YouTube? I'm turning this into my new office now for whatever reason I'm chilling here. But today's gonna be Q&A. I haven't done it for a long time. So welcome to Q&A Mr. SiBoom over here. I'll tell the Brazilian to pronounce my name. I don't even need to show it. So I'm just gonna jump into this video random ass questions. How many meals a day do you be? Basic question but answering is because they recently changed. I touched briefly on a my last video. But I used to always consistent in the channel. Push myself the 60 meals a day or at least five meals in a shake. And now it's reduced out to four meals in a shake. So I have breakfast, two meals that work, and then a shake and then one meal before bed. And because I've still trying to get them to see them on a protein content. Like two new 60 grams of protein. I've just increased the amount of chicken fish or whatever I put in my meal. And honestly my digestion has been a lot better. Not only is it that huge key of sleeping. It's not having a full belly. You go to bed. I can't even breathe. I can't even breathe. I can't put my belly full. So I'm eating now like an hour and a half of those two hours. Before I go to sleep. So I go to sleep. And I'm feeling like empty stomach sleep way better. Wake up hungry. And I can eat breakfast in the morning. I have to carry over and over. So what am I going to do it? How do I always say there's no perfect way to do anything. Experiment. What works my best for body. People are coming to me. I should do it. I was a minimum before. If you're bodybuilder because it's too big of a gap between it. I'm doing four in a shake but figure it out what works best for your bitchess. How was the travel been this year? Travel has been fun. I'm grateful to have been to different countries that do buy and get one of the alien everything. But the first thing that comes to my mind is overwhelming. That's the first feeling I feel honestly. It's been a little bit stressful sometimes. And I enjoy all my trips when I have fun. And I like me feel more awkward. But then I get a moment of coming back and being busy. And I'm rushing in. It has to be somewhere. Having an appointment, trying to check up and get everything ready. And then I'm missing something. And I just should have to feel overwhelming. Stress had been too much going on. And then on the back of my mind, I'm a fuck which is I'd be locking it down and training and eating more. Sistendly and that fucking up and be ringing ready for the Olympia. And then I realized like, please kind of slow it down a little bit and relax. I'm at a good point. I'm at a better point than it was last year in my body. So great things coming into my life right now. All this effort and time I'm putting into the year right now. So at the end of the year, I can separate from it so much. Travel much less and take time to punch your stage and put effort into training, die it rest and being home. So I'm a huge home body and I love that. It's very similar. So that's kind of what's going on. But travel has been fun and you know, Pittsburgh would actually a lot of fun. You could reach a chill and calving in Maddie like the good old days and the Airbnb and the economy there. Good work guys with the set that they're there. Can everything so that was fun. But it's been a lot. Who wins in a race? You've done recording. Thought race. No pushing just full blown athletic. No pushing on a cheating. I would fucking win 100%. And we have to prove it. I will prove it. We will start me in a thought race going out in the next video. Are you ever going to have your own gym? Let me show you. All right. So here we are. This is the future home of the 2023-2024 and beyond Olympia Prep series. The bomb lifting club is you will. My private little gym. It's something. Everybody dreams of when you get into working out, having their own gym. And even more so than that having a private gym. Nobody's allowed to come to somebody can bother me. I say nobody don't mean nobody. We got from the office and friends and people on the in and Brad and people can come train here obviously. But there's no AC so a lot of people aren't going to want to. And it's more so during the day it'll be like just me here if I want to train later and I other people can come. But being at revive and like a lot of people coming to visit a lot of people I know from I can all this shit sometimes it's hard to get there and like being the right mindset. It's not my music playing, it's not this, it's whatever. Just having to be able to control the environment here. So everyday I come in and I just set my own tone to the workouts. I think it's something that's really going to help me excel this year into this prep. So the goal is to build this whole thing out like by like 18-20 weeks I'll be Olympia. And which is coming soon honestly so hopefully it's going. But pure muscle fitness is Dorian is helping me out fit the gym there on a equipment distributor. And I got a lot of cool things in the work so they're helping me completely out fit the gym. Not huge just like 2700 square feet or 3700 square feet. I can't remember. I think it's around 30,000 square feet but it's not huge but for like my own building it's obviously a decent size. Like I said there's no AC and you're so we need a lot of fans sweating because it's fucking hot. But the goal is to sweat when we're going to tank top fans music blurring and just write it around. So it's fucking very excited. This is probably the thing I have most excited for right now going on. So when this is done I'm going to be in heaven. Revive gym is 40 minute drive from our warehouse right now which we're at every day and our warehouse like super close. It's like over there and down the street across the way. It's a little bit but I can drive here in under 10 minutes so. Pretty close. Super fire to hear about that. So yeah that's what's going on. You guys are watching Ceilay but I thought you need to know it's a gym forever. It's nice to be and know it's ever a lot to come. How did you find me here? Do you need a gas tube? Yep. What do you mean no? What do you want to do? Do you feel up every day? Yeah. It's worth it right? Actually it's necessary. Just. How would you function? About 700 for a star truck. I think drove and I can't walk today. In that case let me pull the one on push. You have any bad habits so you have to take control of in order to be the best version of you. Yes. I was just listening back to reporting a missile and I used the word like. So many fucking times. I feel like every other word like like like that's about how I really fucking want to get rid of it. That's going to make you the best version myself because I fucking hate myself when I say like, I shouldn't be so fucking rude to myself. But I said a lot and so honestly, people who want to get better at talking, be recorded yourself and listen to yourself talk. You will cringe you take, oh my god why I'm missing legs and much better to take. Oh my my. You can x y z and it makes you better and I never watch back my videos. So probably start doing that and get better at that break that bad habit. Where do you and Courtney go into Mary? So we got engaged like 7 or 8 months ago. People keep asking if we don't even have a plan to get on it. So if we didn't know what country we wanted to do and can't do that destination in America, whatever. So things at least landed on what we're going to be doing in America. We want it in fall but the only piece in fall on it is too soon to do with this year. And next we don't even know when the only one is going to be going to be with me. Except to mark over in November. So we have to kind of plan according to that. And on a seven. Yeah. Yeah. So we're still working on that. Who is the last person you met that made you star stroke. It's kind of a sad one honestly but it was James Fox. It's been a hospital right now. So that's a luck to him speeder recovery. He keeps fan. But we were in a restaurant in Miami and it went back from someone's like the bathroom available. And it was like locked or whatever. And I'm like someone's in there. I look at him like the fucking Jamie Fox that was just asked me as the bathroom. That's really so. That was pretty cool. So I've got any plans on new business ventures. Right now we're all going to down for a bit. Just launch button energy. But bond streets are launching. Has been launched by the time the video goes up actually. So don't miss out on bond streets. We got the best energy drink in the game that we're making. The best person stack in the game. It truly tastes like really good. Right? Because we treat with protein and so don't miss out on those. Perhaps we'll be firing the probably live right now. It's a good chicken. Alright. So we're made to the gym. Like I've got a cliff bar that's gas station that was fucking hungry and it has thick bulking. So put in the door great now in a back day. Put back to the questions. Any plans to grow beer? I'm growing a beer right now. But if you guys comment below me to grow my fucking testing biking beer again. I will do it just for you guys. Will there be any flavors of bone energy coming soon? Yes. We're currently working on like a really light lemon wine. Bright, tight thing like a green yellow. If you imagine those colors what it tastes like. Super light refreshing again. So that's gonna be our next flavor. I think for summer. Should be like in a two month. So 45 up about that. How do you control your anxiety? I think this question because you use the word control. That's what I try to do my whole life. I try to control certain habits of mine. And that's when you're fucked because when you're trying to control anxiety. You have things to die about the control you're going to put on it. You think that if you're usually from trying to put pressure on, think that over your control. But now you're putting more control on your anxiety. Just adding into your mind stuff that you don't have any help over. You create more strength. So the only way I'm going to be able to output this is to be able to get the energy. You can be able to output it and I'm still talking badly. Yeah. The learning kind of relax when it comes. I set up that it's there not to be too hard on myself. Just understand it's part of life. Whatever I'm doing is probably a reason to think me. It just gets important to me or whatever. It's not beating myself up. And also something that should be a long time to learn. I'm still learning. It's communicating about it. I have a whole life fucking hell to step in. But I didn't feel like I should like talk about myself. And I feel like I should be able to handle all my own. I also feel like I'd be a burden if I shared it with anyone. And that made my anxiety grow and be bigger. Well learning with people like Courtney and my family now to like share and talk more. But how I feel like get it out there. As soon as you release it, you feel better. And it's someone can be there and listen to and show you loving them. Now that's the compassion for everyone you do. You feel better again. So having good people around you, if you're not beating yourself up, not trying to control your anxiety. Kind of letting life come as ever does. It's not really that helpful. But I'm working on it myself. You guys have that better tip. Let me know. Well I ought to do my best to see you soon. I have no more questions. So we go home. Yeah. Hello. I just ready to go to my family. Excuse me. What's the question? What are you and where are you going to ask? A question you have for me. Me? Do I get you to think about anything? Yeah, you have three seconds. No, the challenge one. What do you have? I don't have any questions. You have to get rid of one once in our press. Don't do that to me. I can't decide. I'm getting what's the more good of my mom? No, that's not what I'm in. No, don't say that. I'm not going there. I'm just going to stress it out. Yep. Okay. Whatever you first started competing, did you have a coach? Yes. My number one tip for everyone who says, I'm going to show you the second meeting. Get your solo coach, you're just going to see the second. There's two more shit to learn. I need them to help you learn the ropes and then you learn through childhood. I over time at E and with my coach. My whole life from when I started body, been like up until last year when I had to go over. So get yourself a damn coach. Do you have a mentor to help you with your mindset? I did not ever have a mentor specifically. I've had a few therapists over the years and they've helped me a lot. But it's more so books, podcasts, and times of internal reflection that I've just put on to myself working on my mindset. It's an absolute continuous growth and then more I do it, the more I realize the more work I have to do. So yeah, maybe if I had a fucking mentor for my mindset, it'd be a little helpful. But I got some therapists that are very helpful and some good books and podcasts. So it's been got me this far. Twenty-who do you think would be a good mentor? Peter Com. Peter Com. I knew you were going to say that. All of you Marcus. No, Peter Com. Peter Com. I wish. Not Gorgot? No. So you don't stay hard. You stay soft. Yeah. What's going to be the right? Does he say hard or soft court? I don't know. I'm not getting a joke. No. You're getting a little uncomfortable. You look like a bond when I tell him he takes it up to butt. What? Do that's fine. Okay. Smear away from the handle of your money when you first started a business. Don't spend it. But seriously, don't spend your money. When you make money in the business, keep it in the business. Don't even put it out. Don't worry about just keep it all in there and keep it. Putting it back into the business. And then when you think you have enough money to pay yourself out. I put it back into the business. Don't put more in the business and then wait till the next step and then pay yourself. The rules always live to level below your meat. So if you're like comfortable living and then you get a raise. You make more money. The company makes more money. Don't change your lifestyle. The next time you make another elevation of raise money. More money, more money, whatever. Then you can go up to that first. I'll be coulda go on to you last time. So you always have a gap of extra money that you're making and you never stress about it. That's a biggest rule of thumb to not overspending your money. I did. I did. I was gonna just take the tip. Did you leave below? Did you make? Let below your means. That's your tip. You said that. Do you said I'm gonna say say the tip. Which you just said the tip. The two things below. Or take the tip. Or take the tip. Just the fucking tip. You're so fucking good. Sorry. I'm gonna say you do bad on how I feel like you guys right now. You just gotta say something stuff. It's your rimbling but gets you. What do you think else you want to ask? Do you think you have a question over there? I can come back to you. You're gonna give it a raise. I want more questions than I'm coming in. Go ahead. Don't stress. You seem to like cars with your dream five car garage. Raptor R. You like fucking love that thing. EMG GT Black Series. I'd love to have a dope track car. 69 Mustang, Mach 1, 1970 Charger OT, 1967 Camero RSSS. I could live off those cars. I'll probably jump the track every day. All right babe. That's your question. Okay. This is my question. What does happiness make to you? A little for a lot of people. Who seriously? What makes up for a filled happy life? I feel like it's filled with the happiness of two different things. So happiness comes from a cheatman success and it's good. But it is fleeting. No. Wrong. Happy wife. No. All right. You come on seriously. I think that like that like hot. Oh, I'm happy right now. And then like you're not meant to be happy all the time. But to feel fulfilled with your life is like a over sense of like feeling. You know? Where are you? Yeah. Sure. You are being your real self who living in your own path and you're working hard or whatever you love to do. Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Yeah. Are you? Yeah. Let's work on it. Good. There's more question. Anything else I should ask you? Give me a category and I'll go in that category. Rapid fire. Breakfast or dinner food if you had a pick one. All right now dinner. Psyka bags. Salt here sweet. Salt here. Are you going to go for breakfast? No. Just like in general. Salt here sweet. Great. How corn and cheese are you? A big sweet. A big sweet green. Just sweet green. It's a very fire. Um. You're the last rather loser by any. For the rest of your life first. Canada. Yeah. Who? Sorry, Miami. Dubai or Mexico? Dubai. Dubai. Perfect. It's pretty far away though. Actually, it's a little bit stuff. Um. A trucker is towards the car. The file only have one. Yep. Truck. Really? Sure. I have a fourth car in the truck. I only drove the truck. Can't you take a way more convenient? That's fair. Watson or me? Watson. I mean you. So he's getting all the chopping block. Who's getting on the chopping block? What the? I can't sit her with Courtney. I don't say that. What do you mean, bro? Don't say that. Look at that. You're not even here. You guys have like my back like, you guys have abandoned her for like three months. You're my mother. Okay, babe. Do you want your kid? You're future kid to be a bodybuilder? No. I can do whatever they want to do. But I wouldn't say just do bodybuilding. Are you daddy? Yes. Sure. Yeah. I'm gonna do. She's just beyond daddy. She's a little, a plant. She's just. They what team do you root for? Like, at any sport? I do. What? It was heavy. Nevermind. When are you guys having kids? Big. Whatever we're lucky enough to be put with them. Can you even produce? Guess we'll find out. Oh, I don't say that. We. My worst nightmare, Kelvin, just laughing behind the camera. We'll be fine. Do you rather live on the ocean or live in the mountains? But we need deeper questions like, Come on, bro. What? Don't zoom in on me, bro. I'm zooming in. I'm trying to get you in the frame. Don't worry. Um, deeper questions than that. Do you think it's hard for Chris? Do you think it's hard for Chris to maintain work life and love life? No. Do you think you do a pretty good job? Think you're for how busy you are. I think you do a really great job, actually. The question about if you think it's hard. Do I think it's hard? Yeah. I think it's challenging for you. Why don't you answer that? If you're a bush? It's the last you. Oh. Do you, will do you visit hard for you? Yeah. Yeah. Take that fruit? Yeah. In one way. Yeah. Putting it to that fruit. You know, you put your energy into multiple things in life. You put their engine into being a good business man, a good leader. Building your mind to be a good champion, Mr. Lampia winning all that shit, but you take it in the time to put effort and energy into your relationship and being open and communicating and building connection and leaning on them and being molar bowl with your partners so that you got their clothes. Sorry. You just focus the other way. Like give like examples. Like like how you could be better. If you have a busy job. Like what can you do on a week to week basis so that you're taking care of both matters? And what you guys want to do, you're really surprised as your time and you're together. And you're really great job of that, babe. I think what's the difficult for me is when I flip into a mode of like work or like fucking sea bone bullshit and like me agrees and then having to come home and then like be like normal and I'm like tense and shut off at different. So I just need to like when I'm home and when I'm here to be present and like off my phone, off away from shit and like do stuff together intentionally. What is it? Read the question. You laugh. Give the people what they want. It's something dirty. Oh, I think Courtney needs a helmet. Why? Why? Why? You're not. What are I doing the bike? What? What maybe I'll tell you. What says? What does that mean? I don't know. Means you might not be all there. Let's just spell after that. Yeah, I can laugh. It's okay. Let's go back to the time. Come on and Chris wrote us a day. Yeah. I'm skipping the questions like is your penis one inch or two inches? Courtney? Yeah, I understand. I heard you're a kid and all. You can't do it. Just move. Are you looking forward to being bulb? Come on. Yeah, you might be getting a little brown effect too. Do you want to go to your plugs with better afterwards? See actually? Yeah. Is there a good better? How about this? Courtney. What is the thing that we want most looking forward to in life right now? Um, like, in anything? Yeah. I'm looking forward to getting married. I'm looking forward to becoming a mom one day. I'm looking forward to something special with raw. That we're creating. Yeah, I put them there. What? And I'm looking forward to being in the present moment. We always look ahead. We don't know if we have tomorrow. We're looking forward to being present. Okay. That's how I'm looking forward to you. Back to the topic. Okay, three months. Six months, one year, five years. I just gave it. Married and like a year or two kids and like a year and a half kids and like two. Six months would be the thing with raw. Like, this is part of that's good. What is it for? By the time. This is good. Yeah. Let's go, bitch. Three months would be number one not traveling so much. And maybe we can get a new house. Six months. Olympia, one year. Get married. Five year. Having a family. Five years? Well, but in five years. Damn bro, you're getting me 45. I know. How for family's? I'm saying hopefully. I'm 29. But yes, I have a biological clock. So, can't wait five years. Well, you can't actually, but I mean, I just. You know, start taking that. NAD bro. Okay. Yeah. We'll be fine. Don't worry about the fertility process. We'll handle that. Freeze in the kids. Like my girlfriend. Freeze in the kids. I feel like I have more kids in the future when I stop bodybuilding. Nice. All right. That's enough of all that.

Oh, come on, come on, Chris. Come on, you won't even share three goals. What's the? All right, what is up YouTube? We're a wind of a life, but I'm back to Middle East. We're here in Orlando two days later. As a giant paintball tournament that you guys had a great idea to set up. It's actually chemical. There's like a hundred of our ambassador to be invited out here. All our athletes and we're having like a paintball tournament. I should have two hours late because of the tie roll. And I don't know if a me can put into a team or not, but we'll see what's going on. Yeah, we're just kind of bringing them together the raw squad to a little paintball tournament. Literally like a hundred people here, right? So I guess 140 or 140 or 150. Yeah, I think it's one hundred. 20 minutes. You're wearing just shorts and pretty sure, right? Yeah, I'm a man. Why am I raising a bitch? You're actually pretty old, I just don't want to. Yeah, so paintball it is. That is just a little bit. Is it just a little bit? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. We're supposed to be the one with the shorts. Yeah, we shot me this close. Beautiful. Who's like, I don't even know. I'm like, like, they siloed. How did you not be yelled at? Right. I'm so out of breath right there. I just yelled at him. I want you to look right there. So you're ready now? Wait, wait, wait. What do you want to do? Where do you put it? Wow. He touched me. He touched me. He's got a big fan, dude. Big fan. All right, so, what's the question? Where do you put the flag? So you see your base right there, back corner. What over there? Just aah! Throw it. Yeah, like not throw it, but like, like run and set it in a bigger shot you went regardless. Actually, do you have a shield? What? Bro, you should be giving your shield a new trend to the flag. They can shoot me with the shield and doesn't give? I mean, you won't be technically kid. I'll do it in the room, dude. Yeah. This is Chris Bonstead. He's got it. I know. You got it. I will save you. I'll save you. The flag is a bit on the corner. The quipped. I'll follow you. Do it, figure. What? Dude, riot. That's shield. But he even covered half of his body. This is crazy. Just try to protect the loyers. Everyone, let's say corners. Corner. I don't even know what's going on. I don't even have a gun. You're the one who's running here with no guns? Yeah. Two of his traits. I'm not actually playing this game. I'm just hiding the fucking shield. Do I ask what I'm doing here? I'm telling you. This is a good shield. It came across. Well, I'm fucking fucking wrong. I'm fucking wrong. So you're getting news that you got me hit. Hey. I got the word. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I don't know what to play with that. I'm just like that. We're gonna change it with one. There you go. I'm gonna send you in in the men's running. In the men's. Well, big hand. We're gonna be easier too for them with you. I'm ready to roll. So yeah just hide but certainly fun to me. And be my shield. Fire! Fire! I was side you on, just side it side, what's that you have? Fire in incmäng here! We don't have 8 team, and the night light is just over 20. I'm not a very good paintballer. This is a big flow moving target. Take a hit range. I got hit there too, apparently. I might have been a splatter from hitting the wall. What? You got hit here in the year. You're low. You don't play to the trashy plant ball. I'm gonna go look to the slums. Tony's on his. We told him he said I was skinny. Yeah, she said I was fat. Already. He told me yesterday he took care of your face. Looks fat, Chris. Thanks man. You're not gonna. Just gonna let that paint pass? Yeah, yeah. Wanna clean it for me? Nope. I'm gonna make two shoots. I'm gonna make two shoots. Pretty often at. We got to make one. I just lay him. Probably French Bulldog memes. Alright, so we wrapped up paintball with hot sweaty day. I'm still covered in paint, but didn't shower. I'm fucking sorry if you live in Orlando, but it's crazy to make sure I go. The traffic here is worse than Miami. And you'll get any of the good restaurants of Miami, so miserable. It took an hour to get here. It should've been 25 minutes. So, we lost the second gossip, but chest day. So, trying to make you good day of it. So, let's go on on though. Gonna hit a chest day here. And then we do the team barbecue dinner tonight. Another hour drive away. Because everything's a fucking far apart here. So, that's just a minute's to her. What? Next event in the steward. Next event in steward. That's what we're doing. Not leaving my house. So, let's go. I'm so tight man. Airplanes are breaking the seabed. I'm going to crack an ass. But I got to do dumbbell press today. So it'll be a true measure of how we got gotten. This 12 days in Italy sees the pizza pasta paid off or it's made new week. I'm going to get spot hook. Looking forward to building up from this point. I can't believe that much amount, I think it's 31 30. So, the pasta paid off. This is one of the greatest chess chess machines ever made. You guys have to immediately set one at Revive. The inclined version of the Flex Leverage Quest. And it's beautiful. You get very heavy, very quick. Free plates felt like fine plates. But it's a beautiful chess set. You have it, which you probably don't use it, but you don't suck the stuff. That's an issue. Do you stretch the class? Stretch the class. That's too late, I'm going to add a bit. Pull the drop set. Do you own the next one? I'm fast-keeping. I can hit this goal. Christopher. Give me over a year. Over a year, I want to get to YouTube something to look for, too. The third thing I can do a faster. I'm going to squat. 225 pounds. Helping? 2 plates. No way in hell. That's why. Be a squirrel. You're going to compete again? I thought it was squat 225. Give me. Do you think so? Do you think so? I think what should it be? Yeah, absolutely not. Thank you very much. Three bucks. I need some trend. No. We're done. I'm going to go back to my class. That's bad for me. Black. She thinks it'll be easier squat 2 plates. But I know it's possible. That's like starting to. So six months. Give me a year. Half year. You really only do cardio. I don't. I'm left. You don't get one. It's without trading. Okay. I am a muscle mommy now. I don't know. I don't even know how to do this girls. They do. They do. They do. They do. Yeah. They like muscle mommy's. The boys. I'm just a tweed mommy. It's like a tweed mommy. It become a muscle daddy. She's like a new shirt. You guys? What do you think? Okay. Fucking. Get this fucking camera. You know what? You tease you. And it's uncomfortable? You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. I don't want to go this at all. Hey. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. I'm not. I'm looking. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. Don't take it. We're not. Now we're. What the thermal crusade is, what did you think? 25, come for free. Yeah, I'm just kidding. I don't really draw like this. I can probably, you have not been all of the way and so long. You just like how? No, like you haven't made your own blog. Oh, I know. Maybe you should film it for me. Please come over to my YouTube. We can give the boys cooking advice how all the Chris's tips and tricks. I'll be like the YouTube of the BTS behind the scenes for Chrisford. What are you saying? My channel will be a BTS for you. So, thank you. It's like you give them all the secrets. Top secrets. Only I know what you're telling. Sorry guys. Maybe a little chair. Okay. We're gonna go back to curling. Yay. What's up? Yeah. Hello. Least the drum voice. Hey. Where's the drum voice? Hello. Hello. Hi. Hello. Try to play well.车 with your condoms. Good. Hey wait, facades. 22 30 He looks still atoba Alright, pretty much wrapping it up now. We're all back today or B&B after this for a team barbecue, like I said, but we're chilling. You know, honestly, what I do appreciate having a lot of events with different companies. I never want to take a picture of myself, but everyone, when they got here, like literally with barely filming, with actually training like hard, fucking sweating, no makeup or the girl pushing it, we built a team of people who actually loved to list, not just fucking fitness in sports or so. Something I just like seeing how the bikes and our watching people actually train hard, by the part of the team. We're at Hyra who's like the train hard, no skinny bitches on the team. It's okay if you're skinny but you can't train like a skinny bitch. Thur will. So, let's see if they're being do. Oh yeah, we're trying to music off now. I needed to pump it up. Yeah, or some Michael Jordan. Yeah, a team move to the team. All cameras on the house. Pressure is on, motherfucker. Pressure is a friendly. Pressure is not. Yes. Memphis standard. We're no latch of say, press the privilege anymore. We're not welcome to get rather a socially standard set of standard. We're not allowed to stay pushed that branch to the right, we're not allowed to stand advised. future and some of you guys come back and I know we'll be breaking back some of our athletes and the goals that I call it a reunion. It's gonna go already and so this is kind of gonna be the first of many and we wanted to do a different salad then rather than some e-create something where you guys actually get a little bit of education about it. I'll need to ask a question that everyone can hear it rather than a rush in through a bunch of people to take a picture and that's kind of what we're kind of trying to change the way we're using this in a real little bit here. So this is our first hopefully a man gonna be the best and I'll want to say our first event that we've done solo. So we're all new to this. If I run a little bit of a break I know I'm nervous up here speaking sometimes the spirit is the only one this age. So be allowed, cheer on everyone and they say something cool, something funny laugh at them, it's not funny, pretend like they're funny. These guys are sometimes we're nervous up here and we're not so into one of the things. But with that being said, a huge thing that we've been pushing is burning is finally the theme because what we stand for here is hard work being your best self and pushing yourself to limits. So this is also a celebration of the end of an athlete's first show we had that I'm sure a lot to get from our part of it and we're gonna be doing these two new things so you got them in another chance to do it. But to start this event off I want to call up our 10 athlete search winners. So first I'm gonna call up Dominat on the stage. I would like to announce the winners as well. You doing great, Crad? All right so we forgot to outgrow that event so this is us making up for it. Quick recap event with a massive success. We honestly planned it pretty quickly. We would probably like to have six months to plan like something like that. We had a few and we were pretty just scrambled to do it honestly. But it all came together very smoothly. The team absolutely crushed it everyone who came was super awesome that I'll really enjoyed it. I'm really a bigger fan of these like Q&A like informative side of events because I think you get a lot more out of it and then everyone said that they super they really enjoyed it and what was really cool whether it was like a culmination of our athlete search that had been going on for like six months prior and we brought down the top 10 winners of the athlete search down in the bottom of stage and announce them as winners and got to have them like say at the Airbnb with everyone should continent the gym everyone got to work out, go to Universal Disneyland or whatever the fuck it was play paintball all that good shit. So whether really cool we get into kind of see our team coming together get to like spread our brand message what we stand for what we love what we're all about and push just like I don't even know the culture we love with the community that we're grateful for so everyone who showed up thank you guys for coming making the event so awesome. We always have such good people out there who are like and through the acid gets great question they're super polite patient with us when we're like moving through things so very grateful for that thank you guys for making this such a beautiful brand that we're working on we'll be doing plenty more than the future in different aspects some smaller ones some bigger ones some mostly something with me so keep in store for those and yeah it's about it so thank you guys for watching to an end doing what you do and hopefully see you guys in the next event. Peace out

I'm trying to do abs to help my lower back now. That breath is great squirming. Only 5 reps. 6 points. The whole side of the gym just stopped and watched. The round gym pays respect to heavy lifts. Come on, come on, Chris! Come on, you're one. Still, or time coming up for you guys. Come on, come on, come on. What's there? What is up YouTube? Welcome to a list-uring hot day. I'm not doing it in the beach videos. We'll have a hot day in Florida. Our AC broke for the 20 years time at the warehouse. Our floor was slippery, wet with condensation. It was fucking hot. If I can't function here, I'm not that it's fucking right now. Last night, I was like 267 pounds at night. Morningway at the 262-263. So I'm just like not built to here, right now. I'm just fucking fat and slow and ready to die it on the street. I'm up soon. Put a nice beautiful arm day. It's a nice dead day yesterday. My back feeling toasted and good day for an arm day. I'll feed my cord off. We'll start with the same old bullshit and then maybe branching on some different sides. I just got the new new thing. Fucking excited. I'm on the camera. So, feel it goes. I'm not a guy. I'm not a guy that's just fucking heavy. I haven't done heavy street barcals forever. I'm still not a easy bar. But on my last back day, I did a few sets of these. I finished my back day. I felt like a really good mind and muscle connection with my biceps. I'm like fucking in the switch up. I sit there and do a heavier set. So I'm really trying to focus on not throwing it down. Not just like 10 seconds slow, but I feel it on my biceps the whole negative of the rep and a fire back up. I'll do a few cheats. I'll do a few cheats at the end of the swing with the first eight of trying to keep it super locked in. Feels like a good. A little classic barbell curl that everyone in the internet will roast you. You shouldn't fucking use a barbell just cut off the moment. Just good. So fucking. I'm gonna have you guys out of the room. I'm gonna have you guys out of the room. I'm gonna have you guys out of the room. I'm gonna have you guys out of the room. I have you guys out of the room. Every arm day right now. I promise myself this year, we're in a bit of a deep, I do a heavy dip or a heavy clothes group bench breast. Just tripped build some mass in my triceps. I'm gonna meet a good test this year. I have sticker triceps with the postage of a lot of cable movements and isolation movement. A little bit more like some cable pecking here, but allows me to move more weight. So I hope you can give me that lift. Hang down here in my triceps. Pray for the best. That's usually high enough. I'm gonna have to do a lot of hammer curls and honey. I'm gonna do a lot of hammer curls and honey. I'm gonna put it in the dumbbell. I'm gonna slide it into the top. I'm gonna knock those out and hit it in the circle part of the dumbbell. I'm gonna cut it in the middle. I'm gonna push it through my wrist a little bit. I know I can check my great y'all right here even more than if I'm holding the bar normally. The person at least feel a little more of his grease here. So maybe I'll feel that I look like fill leaves. I've been saying that five years, I'm never gonna have to but I can do it. I'm gonna bring it back. Can you bend your 25-year? I'm having a try. I'm gonna give you an extended bed. I told you, I know I told you, I know I told you right here. I need like three months. How many years left? I don't work out like I used to. I'm gonna get back at it again. Well you know where else more than we need you in the gym. What? It's a valuable asset. You're helping life-thousand non-born anymore. It's just the only thing I should worry about is stacking up energy pilots. That's cool. I've got the color of your teeth. No, that's the can. Oh, this guy's fancy. You got him around? Yeah. You got a rebel bro? I didn't know that. It's a whole time. How does it feel like I should have a VA? It feels good. That's a great joke, eh? I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, okay, I love it. He's awesome. I'm going to have a talk to Sharda. You can't be there. You gotta be there and go save her. What do you have a talk you can't go back? Fish or chocolate like that? I've never done this before because normally the weight's stuck. It's lower to the ground. I have to stand up platform to curl up. It's like, fuck it. I'm going to stand back. I let it stretch forward and curl from here. It kind of gives a bit like a spider curl creature. A spider curl hammer curl. Five to a little bit of a different pull. It gets coming from straight and set it down. So it feels good. I'm going to try to do abs to help my lower back now. That breath is quite easy. But my glutes are tight as fuck. My abs are kind of weak. I'm not training them. So it's causing my back to like, our Sharda. I want to do movements like that lift which it's busted up. So I'm working on her right now. Training abs and they cramble bit and so. Training at the diary now. I'm only bad at that. I'll sit quite. See if you've asked what? Five. Five. No, that's it. The whole side of the gym just stopped and watched. The round gym pays respect. Heavy lifts. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. For people who like training abs to failure, I said, not it. I know if all of it or not cramble like this. All right, it's going to be wrap on. Don't show that. Making a wrap protein out of your teeth. So I'm testing out the water. Let's move on to the video. I got to cry out over here watching. We still need you a full day of eating. Yeah. Do you get it Friday? We can. I just don't know. I have to film someone Friday. Remember the whole schedule. Yeah. But I do lift three months away from you myself. Exactly. Whatever. We'll figure it out. But yeah, this is the last few weeks of my off season. If I want to do a full day of eating, my brain just working right now. Connie's going to come down here. I think next week or in two weeks, you're going to come get prep started with him being down. You're just training like food fucking do. Create a game plan and get the ball rolling. So looking forward to that. Sadly, my gym will be done by them. I don't think at least the gym partly with being made next week. And Connie's making a private gym to a Dallas. So we're going to go to Dallas a month after that. And then training out there. So she'll certainly come together. That's the final part of my off season right now. I'm like peaking and strength right now. I'll probably, so I've been just trying to get strong for the last few months. I get it technically. I squat at five places in the Smiths machine again finally. If we tend to have, that's a good sign for me that my legs are growing. I've been fucking killing my legs and they're coming back up. So grateful for that. But last few weeks of getting strong, I think I'm going to keep the strength high. As a ball human and just trying to get food. So the current game plan right now. I'm hunting down. We're kind of going over. How we're certain prep. And all that could chip. But for now, that's all it's going on. When my gym uses weekend, so might do some filming down there. If tell them to make it, it's not. It is worth it. But we get to watching. See you guys soon.

I get you any passive For how you close grip and close elbows neutral grip fly Press I can get that like heck minor squeeze on this and then we're gonna get to teach that school a little bit Talk rep it out third against the more russian but it's really just feel like squeezing like up under the armpit I'm like pushing like the bottom of your wrist again like a replication of the deep front You You You You All right last Second last exercise and really trying to focus on keeping my chest up Excuse me, why is he letting my shoulders from upper back cave in and kind of cheating that you can make sure a little bit If you make chest up above him, please Keep that the whole way and I'd rather fail out here with my arms next year and cave in Close other ways, it just like you trying to keep my lower back from moving in our tune too much to the same tip of the board Oh You You You Even myself and way weaker keep in my chest up and squeezing like that rather than letting myself hold roll forward The way it is like forced actoss and I know my joint did left wrap so sometimes best to make it as hard as possible We could shit it in the muscle and it's up in traveling a lot In off-dealing see for throwing on the road. I've just been focusing on like really deep my muscle connection And had made my training so much better and not as strong they know me which kind of folks with my head But like my work gets a lot more effective now than they've been so now that I'll implement strength What's his base leading to his off season? Think it'll be a good year maybe Okay All right, so I'm finishing out the last press on the chest there with some like close grip and kind of bench Free weight It's really good to just not get stuck the machines like I did for a while When you get in the machine, there's just such a smooth like lunar larle Plain emotion that your body can just keep it on the moving and that right Stabilizing in a natural form my gravity is gonna make the weight fall on you so I'm not gonna push myself on this Just make for myself I've been done in fucking years I was in that one time I embarrassed myself. I think it's fine So it's like a little bit of weight on here Just close grip both on the old tricep little check Should take that off With that as crooked as a belt that look crooked I mean I'm on an angle so I don't know stay back so I think it was fucking good So hard to think it should be It feels good How many of the four days in American for traveling so I'm doing like a little bit combo work this I'm gonna try to set it the end of this chest there Some of those both grip press like a machine hit my tries a lot Some new little close grip can I'm gonna do some ropes and then let's see I All right last exercise Along workout do some triceps like I said I'm trying to hit like one to have body parts three because of my Chobles so I'm doing like my body parts more I'm gonna do back and buy But for now just leaving the piss in my chest and finishing them off because they were pretty active a secondary Moving from all the pressure I did earlier That'd be yeah I I All right, that's it for today's workout I'm gonna quit as long workout. I don't know how many I've already did but probably more than normal But it actually feels pretty good to them not training for some reason I work out for a really good Pittsburgh Partly because I'd be training partner Connie was there pushing me my kitchen worries better I haven't been staying in my house for a while now. I can my alleges is so bad there Life's on the up hopefully my alleges aren't bad in Italy either It's a total another day when I get back so yeah, what it is that's the end of the video Yeah, what What are you doing You're the most fucking dad you've ever had in my life I'm purely about these because we're going to Italy I'm gonna be walking and fucking a lot and chew their two nero for my wetest feet I always remember my dad wearing two E-wide new bell and shoes So I don't even like I mean actually our cool nuances, but like you can just tell looking at them Like this thing of the fucking unit But yeah come for it over everything What put it on Look at the velvet roll look at this bucket outfit We're out That's the night in the middle Brother so come here and you do I just work with broken stocks and socks for the gym You can't much okay Yeah It's a Like Look at him go cut the grass I don't know you guys endorse micro plastic again You don't want to talk Courtney hit it With the race to throw away because that's like literally a credit cards worth a plastic But you just ate Well the secret is surprised is removing for selling this house We're going back to Canada See you later Just kidding, but we actually are moving forward. I can't tell in the house It's a footage but everything away Including my rice cooker and then we didn't break it back up so we bought that in the meantime They're also only home for four days for child. I guess so yeah I guess I'm blogging it. I believe I'm gonna be his blogger. I got you guys not worried I won't let the boys down Take as I had an idea if you guys didn't film anything now is gonna take over Chris's YouTube, but he didn't like that So If this video gets 15k lights We'll be fighting that we lasted you're watching poppy and you did a fucking day in the life of poppy I could watch it if I get my own plate.

I Was okay don't even Did out of my face she's with her grandmother my mother Grammy Deb Deb is the best and she Take dirty care All right, so this is my postwork at meal. I have this new trend of doing a higher amount of protein in one of my last meals of the day Actually most of the day, but really had the last one was like two hundred ninety grams of white fish in this That's because I haven't been eating like six meals or five minutes shake even I've been having like four meals in a shake So I've been having bigger meals him. I protein's intake and it's just easier to eat Give my body a little bit more time that gesturing day and I feel better doing so so big meal postwork out I'm gonna put this down and Go sleep because that's a life of it But upcoming things Robin June third or land don't take it. They're gonna be in the bio don't miss out.

So Chris as you look to this year and the next year, but you look at the classic physique in your own this year You get to be a spectator and look back as as a judge or as a fan and go, all right Well this guy's got some parts. I'm gonna need to build mine up for this. What did you see in the top or guys from Wesley divister or Tim Wesley to bring on I mean I did obviously Wesley with a bit of surprise for everybody I was there in the morning watching Prejaging and that'll let Holy shit he's gonna win You know I thought it was gonna win I would have never guessed I going into it But it's a thing of classic physique because of the way limit we have people can come in It just shock you all the sudden you never really know That's why every year is an opportunity for people to jump play things take my title anything that is in could really happen So I think Wesley come in for a huge wrench You know, I don't think it's gonna be a top two call the like last year of me in Vermont It could be four of us it could be whatever it just changes everything it's worth it all up in the air So it's gonna make it more exciting this year for sure and Yeah, I mean I'm excited to get after and they like I said they all drive me to be better So just a little more push for me to keep pushing myself Is you feel like a like where did you feel walking away now like I got my work cut out of it cut out for me Are you like Sam I go k it Wesley who fed them last grail got it the movishers I mean like where you tell their way from the having any types of stuff like that. I just want you No, I mean I was I was side stage and I was looking at it and I was like I think he's guys I think the product I hate to swim you know Two kids this is the ones across the stuff and the bowl full of the the dads are talking about Woman up in this boring stuff. I feel like I'm like a Home full of matters I used to do that until you reach a certain level of strength And then you pretty much coast around that level and get more volume in get after a while Like on squats or bench press or double press get too strong. I mean it takes first of all so long to warm up and the risks to hide So you might as well just do more volume and stick to The same kind of weight and then move up and breath them and progress that way and get a better pump each time with Those heavy weights for the heavy to live with blood and your body on the dead Two 20 kilos But Yeah, do you know kilos or four 95? Yeah, something like five plate. Yeah, five plates But I'm not built the squat because I go like this My lower back is messed up so I'm like I My legs needed the work so I just stay to machines that focus more in the legs You should train very super heavy that lets us squat until honey told you They're not only Yeah, yeah, yeah, my weights are growing so I like that But I miss it Real for those Chris is catching up the Beyonce Maybe we don't have number 10 we're crossing theMusic Yeah, like nothing Without bringing the sweat på guy My bolt win the on clutch QK still, so you can do that. Yeah, and that's also Netherlands. Yeah, yeah, it was going to be a pro show in Netherlands for the first time in a lot of years I was like, well, should I do that? But now I'm getting a lot of advice while just folks in the league here for now Because I want support. Yeah, exactly. That would be my advice as a friend. But if you're competitive, I would tell you to do every show. Yeah, I never planned on On this to happen like this of course, but to get support to change plans. Why do you do that? No, I also didn't expect for this to happen. Of course, I wish for that. But for actually happening is a different story. Now everything has changed so exciting stuff. What is up YouTube? We're here in Arizona doing this Olympic battle promo for the Olympic Covenants here. Pretty cool. Who's going to be me, Arizona alone. And then on Sunday after Wesley won the Arnold, they were like, fuck it. We're going to fly him down and see if he can come before going home and get him in the workout too. So it's going to be a little chaos trying to train with four people and the allergy's workout or the allergy's to be at this weekend. So it's going to be kind of a casual workout. A lot of people in here. Not going to be the best, but we're going to do what we can. So can we find, fuck you up. They're ready to do it. Even though they just competed and I'm fucking mad. You see, I'm barely training, so we're going to do our best and have lots of fun. Go on. Basically everyone's out there works. Yeah. And we are alive with this.

Yeah, yeah All right, so we wrapped up that Decent workout with the top three Arnold classic champions Go away, so they're creeping into the mix So it's good to train us all these guys are all like a few days post show and strong as fuck I would not have been listening as heavy as they were especially on the dumbbell when if I was a few days post show and No, I might dumb as it probably tears of me, but it's so good for them for doing that I'm definitely a real man of the group, but had some fun This is some good way we're gonna had to dinner now But it was really cool that Wesley was able to fucking dominate at the Arnold. I still think that Ramone and or as worn at their best and I'm not sure that it would be the same result if they were all the best Conquestly with beyond his best and they weren't so the Olympia is gonna be exciting to watch They can come back and pull it together and switch it up But I have a feeling that us four guys will be the top four the Olympia again and it'll be interesting So I'm super pumped you know fired up to get back to work now when they get home from this trip I'm home for like I don't have six seven weeks and I actually am ill train and he probably and I can't fucking wait to not eat the restaurant because I'm gonna work out lots of fun Hopefully guys enjoyed that that lumpy of video the other guys I think I have some more content out if you want to watch it the bit of a shit show in the air was like 50 people watching four people training But we did the best we could have a good time so appreciate you guys saying for watching see you

What's your thumb? YouTube. Followed Feeball, mid in the house right now. And a lot of the catch-up on Life's Big Crazy Vidi, but we are currently bed-built Arkansas. The usmeding of the Sam Cup or Walmart is small-town in the Litteridge built off the back of Sam Walton, which is super cool. I was reading a book and he used the wire round and a Friday play. They get two-person drop-played. And it got an Arkansas flew around and scattered a little bit like the Nab like a fake play. That this is what the airport is. I won't reply to that. So really well hit free here, but we're about to do some beating, did some stuff, kind of changed what go-to-fers, a U-chiffer or a raw with Walmart. I'm at a Jepathetically Walmart, two-person super setting and say it was thumb of course. So we got a bunch of beatings, we're gonna rip through the end then I'll catch up with the guys after so say it to you. We'll farther back, you need to straight up to the ceiling and stack. Hold that stack position, things quickly, there's been a little more pressure behind this. The only six-five function. We'll go back to where they're toast, we'll have to go back to where they're going. Next day on open, look back, jeep. The open reach pushes into the wall as we open. So man, it's hard to be able to work that long. So if you can't get the spot to move, I'm going to go back to isolate on the beam with the occurring there. So if you can't get the stand here, it's going to be sharp, it's going to lock down. Not donate, you'll be willing, let them split them up all the way down, let them just need to just off the sides to watch the same type of wall. We're trying to get as much rotation as possible. We're going to turn, rotate, take time to the wall. Now it's going to find the extension through this rotational pattern, reach it back as far as it can. Get stretched, good extended pattern. Tighten the wall, pull it, flex your rotating. Find your guard extension, find your duty. She shows that we have horrible, my traps. They're all in this engage in the last thing. Alright, so got back from our concise. I'll show you guys the GBS guys. You have to get the new from our last club. We do some of our down here in Florida. We want to sit with them, chill in and today they're going through our work out. Sadly, I can't work out for shedding weight. So we're doing some mobility stuff. They have a training down here, burning in. He's the real deal. Kind of keep it getting more balanced, keep some strong enough of that stuff. So you just put it through like a warm up. And I'm sweating from that already in 1912. So I've done any exercises in like four weeks. So brutal, but I wish I could be doing them on the list. Sadly, I can't, but we're going to do some fun shit today. She's in guns. Hang out and do some cool shit. So yeah, put it going on. You're just here. I have to. I haven't fully addressed it. But I think they can see that on bulk. Lots of stuff going on. I'll give a recap of what happened in Turkey. I think my hair's grown back fully. It's like a weird dude who shates his head and has to stand there. It's nice and shiny scalp, but it'll grow back and I can wear hat now. So win win. So yeah, so we're going on. Stay tuned. As soon as we get down with this one, I get an interesting. Oh, I just had time to wear the feet. I don't know if I can wear the feet. I'm going to tell you how to do it. I'm going to tell you how to do that. Change your feet is so high. It's like your round of waves you have. It's like one or two more. Like true failure. Oh shit. If you want to own fuck waves, you're burning your whole life. So that'll just be a good soft stuff. It's like a really good fuck. Yeah. That's why we do so much for shame. I have to jump like that. So when you think forward head, posture, a lot of the issue is right here. Skating in specials. You can go with the pegs. So all I want you to do, I'll do it on your first, but I'll show you how to do it on your own. So do you see how the frame promotion has. Like, just kind of moving that around. Feel what you got. I want you to take, I'm going to take my back and my hand. And I'm going to put it on the side of my neck right on the side of your hat is open. And all I want you to do is I'm going to use this a little on my skin. Look this one. So I want to do a little bit of a look at training. Now I want you to slowly, so you would put this on your arm. Can I do it again? Yeah, I want you to slowly turn your head back. I want you to slowly turn your head back. That way. Yeah. You want me to press it down. Oh yeah. Keep turning the trigger switch. Just put it back to the other one. Yeah, I'm going to head a lesson right. Throw that away more. I'm, I do the same thing. I wear a lot of shoes. I wear burq and stuff. But, I felt that. Well, when the gym we want the toes, it's typically better than a night. Yeah. Burq and stuff, it's a pretty good stretch of your toes. So that tension of spreading the toes, getting the movement. So, like, I'll have guys not only we're going to need the bottom of the foot, but we'll take our fingers between our toes and kind of massage over to do that. That's a big one. You're not going to have to do it on your own. T-T-T fingers between your toes and just kind of like work on like this. And then, what do you put underneath the bottom of your foot? I go across one. I use it on the top as well. So, use it a tennis ball because now we can push. And the feedback is more relaxed. Whereas, look across ball sometimes, guys. Like, dig it. You can go like this. And if you're pissing tissue off, you're never going to relax. Like, pain and pain and performance are a one-way road. So, if you have pain, like, your brain never going to be like, all this hurt so bad, I'm going to relax. It's going to be like, ball. Like, if you're a tension, that's how we walk. So, like, I go across ball and just kind of, just go into it. Maybe move it to a new spot, easy into it. And do spot, easy into it, do spot, easy into it. Move it to toes, easy into it, do you toes? Just move it to the bottom of your hips. And I've had, especially with my fingers, always have their feet and cleats. Yeah. The clears up a lot of these shoes up in the hips. Awesome. So, you can find internal and external rotation. Just tall as possible. Stalls, balls, balls, balls. All right. That's your analysis of Chris. Pretty good. Definitely more on the front side of his body with his hips. If you can restore some rotation, especially on that left one. I think, uh, can help it. It's the thing. We're going to do some stuff for the hip flexors right now and kind of explore some rotation through internal and external. Kind of see what we can do. So now I want you to add a front fold. So from here, I want you to think about fanning your pelvis. Almost like you're going to just shoot your asshole behind your behind. I don't want you to crumpled in your lower back. I want you to think nice and tall, bring your ribs to the shin. And then, uh, taller. Tall, twist and tall. Reach. There you go from there. Now up. Now rotate to that side here. Reach. Lower head up. That's not comfortable in your fingers. Now I'm going to kind of pull you into me. Play yourself, make your confidence in a better way. It's definitely your very aware of your pelvic position. You can try to reach into the region to reach into the region to be like coming in. You're coming into me. There you go. Think about driving your back or leggings at the ground. There you go. Hold that position down from here. You're going to sign what's hand is. Loot. And I want you to try to do it. So I'm trying to face it with me. So claw your elbow. Turn. Up right up right up right up. Push your left knee into the ground. Push your left knee into the ground. That left left. More to the right. Sit up right. Turn. Turn. And now, the back into me. You're going to try to do it. You're going to do it. Hold that right. You need to come up. Push your left. Try it. Let me turn. Turn. Turn. Turn. Hold that. Hold that. Hold that. There. Yeah. Now. Alright we're at Relief here trying to bring these boys back to life getting some might. He's getting some stem cells so jealous of that. No, I'm obsessed with my stem cells and doing way too much for the last few years but trying to recover and heal everything up. So we're perhaps up to work out. They did a bit of the left, added some hip mobility and several vernas and some pull stuff I need to be doing a lot more of for sure. But we're going to get some food head to the range after this so I'll see you there. What did you learn? What did you learn? What did I learn? Torso straight, flex the glute. Don't let yourself rotate this way. Take grip. This thumb on that thumb rather than on the gun. Tightening this, elbow is locked in. Don't leave back doing forward. Probably more. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I told her, I told her when he said you should come down and I was like, I don't know. Because we're going out of town this next weekend and she was like, dad, do you know who he is? And I was like, oh, she was like, I followed him for so long. You're going down there going. You can't get fucking kind of. I'm going to do that. But I also said, I'm the only honest student to fucking jam. You're not going to fucking believe this. This is my first meeting in the hospital. I didn't realize that's what I was in my mind. I didn't realize that's what I'd come through all the meds and waning their juice. I was living a false life. I wanted to straighten it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

What's up YouTube? This is crazy man. This is crazy man. Come on, come on Chris. Come on, you're one. Two, four, two, three, let's go. What's up? We're a came in one of these and it was literally like a stripper pull in the middle, like lights and music. It's awesome. See how long it could have been. That was like the big red, all it could be. This is the car. I'm just wondering if there's anything in here. This week. Oh yeah, this tower line. Yeah, Jake picked that up with a bear Jackson. So that was super cool. Um, 1988 to 2019 for Olympia programs. So it's like old school. That's 2018. That's not that old school. But yeah, all these old magazines are in here. I think it's a little bit too old. I think it's a little bit old. It's a little bit old. Oh yeah. And you can't see anything. I think it's a little bit old. I'm going to talk to you about the personal experience. I think it's a little bit old. It's a little more professional. So there's a good job. It's a good job. It's not that old. If you think of a base, you can see the rest of the world. It's a little bit old. No way. You have to. I should take it for a walk there. No, no. But where are you going? I'm going. I'll be chipped on us. I said longer chipped than us. Yeah. Only a few hours off. What is up YouTube? You're here at the Olympia headquarters. You should be the one in the strength. Only headquarters out. We can strengthen all that stuff. We're kind of storage stuff from the Olympia pieces. There are some little shows. The front of the entranceways. Some cool old mouse trophies. We're here shooting a little promo for the Olympia. For Mondes then here with myself. I mean, we're going to get a work out into tomorrow. Some super excited about that. I really need to let it some Portuguese because all of our Mondes had to say it was just a shit crazy man. We saw it except in the speech. You know what I mean? But just to provide us this what we're doing today. You're near Zona. You do a podcast or something right now for a prime time muscle. And then train tomorrow and it's better to reach out. So say tune to her. We're going to prepare Mondes for the Portuguese. So Chris, you are the classic physique champion. You had a dominant performance at the last Mr. Olympia. But you had a chance to watch Ramon perform at the Arnold Classic. He was the winner. What do you think of Ramon? Did he get better from the Olympia? What do you think he got better? And what do you think he can improve as a competitor? I think he looked better. He looked sharper and leaner. He looked like he was a little bit tighter and drier. Maybe it's a show. A little bit leaner. He had a lot more time to prep. I think he's just going to be kind of filial on his frame. I think some of his shots. He felt him with a little bit thin. Maybe that because he looked leaner the show. But I think he looked better than he looked at. Now I just want to add something. Because a lot of people were critical of him because of his posing and the Mr. Olympia. They said, hey, Chris was able to expose you in the pose. Did you feel like he improved on the pose at Arnold? I'm tired for me to say it because I was so focused on myself. But you won't be. I didn't know it was having you with posing. But I know it was posing look good at the Arnold. So I didn't see any flaws in it. We did a live on Olympia TV. And I kept asking you, who you think can be a threat to your crown as Mr. Olympia? And you looked straight at me and you said, I think these guys are fighting for second place, tearing. Do you still believe that? They're just fighting for second place. I do, yeah. And I mean, it was Arnold. I'm sorry, I was in Vermont against each other at the Arnold. I think it's going to be that battling for the next Olympia. I just got to beat myself next year. So do you have any strategy to change anything based on what you saw for a remote? Or you just don't care. Are you going to do your Chris for the next time? Do you go do the Chris Bum set? Thank you. No, I have a strategy to be better, but the strategy to be better than myself. Not anyone else. So that's a goal. Very nice. That's all. Thank you very much. I think you could put gas in it. Just keep the receipt. We'll keep you up 20 times. But you should be okay. Take your eyes or go. It's diesel. It's diesel. Yep. As you get to know. Yeah, right. And it says it on here too. Oh, it's not the right thing. Yep. All right. You guys are all set. All right. You're all. I jokingly, jokingly. We're going to get taco tack up the Uber. I was jokingly like, I'll take the spinnerband. They'll drive everyone dinner tonight. You're all too sure. Take it. So here we are. Look, it's spinnerband. I think it's a big ask. Try it back to Florida. All right. This is a one of the bigger things. I think it's so much bigger than I thought. I just presumed it was the same size as that fan. But I had the eight key while I'm here. Fuzzy's. All right. So we made it with a crashing. The Kelvin has highly recommended. I'm going to try the taco shop. So this is his redemption for an angel of barbecue. Because that'll be better than that. I'm sure they check it. And I can't eat those. Oh, that's a good idea. That's a good idea. For here. For here please. I don't know what's left. What do you put on? Those are good. I don't know what this is. There you go. decent, right? Okay. 4G tacos. Way better. I can remember the way. 4G is a little still. It could use a little more sauce on it. It's a good chipotle or sauce, but it's good. Edible. Solid. 5 out of 10. But for 10. You're old too right now. Listen. I don't know why I keep listening to you. I wasn't gunning. Sure. Oh, by the way. We're fucking traveling. Don't let Kelvin pass. They might have been at towards you too. We look at it. Dr. Warren. I wasn't gunning for a good place. I was gunning for a taco. And last time I remember it was good. You can leave me alone. I didn't. I didn't. Raven thought that recommended. Just a name alone. Fuzzies tacos. Like it just have 30. I like a clean shave in taco. Alright. So that's a wrap on today. To the poor cheap podcast. I don't do what they sell on it. But they just wanted to. We're going to have dinner tonight. They go to bed and climb tired of fucking the hundreds. We're going to train with Mr. Dino tomorrow. So pump for that.

There's a lot of bait out in here. I got some drinking fruit. I have to finish some pump and some bait out in here. I'm gonna be eating my goddamn pace on today. But I've been really enjoying the high bait out in the workout. So it's what we're doing. It's raining today. Beautiful day. So I don't know what's going on. I think we're going to the gym. So together we're back. Alright, so four, I started this workout. I told you guys finally updated my app. I'm gonna show you guys a quick thing. If you're right now I'm not gonna go to deep in the gym. But this is my chest day from two weeks ago. It's a little bit of backlogged on me. So I can chuck my workouts and put it into the app. But this is what they do. I've stayed looks like I'm in a three-minute court so you guys can see. You're gonna open it up and it shows it goes straight to the day that it is. The today, two day, June 20th of chess and shy stuff. What it was a week ago. This is the same workout I did. So I took a high-pully cable crossover, Smith Machine and Grandch. And we're going to make the inclined process. It shows you everything. All you have to do is click. That works. Wow. That's what we've got to do. I'll start today to workout. We got this workout. So you hit, it starts with workout. You click on the exercise. It brings it up to the scene and it tells you 15 reps for a set, 15 reps second set, third set of the drops that you do 12 success, 12 reps and an am wrap for the next two drops. And it actually lets you track your weight now so you do like 15 reps, 200 pounds. Hit, check. And then it counts out of the down. And then a little timer starts. You do your same thing on the next one, 5, 200 pounds. You just check through all that like that. And as you go through over time, your weights will be tracked. I've brought every single exercise so if you do bench press today, five weeks or now you do bench press again on a different self workout. It'll still stay the exact same weight that you didn't last workout. So you can hit info, you can go back and check how to check that out. So it's a little update. We got to go. I got to do like a full actually update of it. I just keep forgetting to do it. So I wanted to make sure you guys do that because it's only one week left. Sign up for my transformation challenge. The end next Monday. So it's going to be a Seabumb-fit and a.com. 50th of all that enter. Close you guys the prize to win that is five grand plus a chance to come down and you train with me.

Either way, you can find out. But yeah, we're going on right now. So it's time to work here. It's going to be strong today. I'm going to check the chronology one. 40. No one 35. I'm a Dumb-Bill before that was 140. So I got weaker after my trip to Italy. I'm going to try to max out with Jim 150. And if I'm really cool, I'll order 170 pound dumbbells for my gym. You can see if I can move though. But it's time to get weaker and prep. Alright, I'm going to hit you. I feel like a year since I've done this. So I'm setting the tone for the off season. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. Thank you so much. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I don't know if I mentioned this. We were talking about the event this past weekend. We were going over programming this year again. 20 weeks out, just in our 20 weeks out right now. Gold just be literally a strong and possible. So I'm trying to hit the 150s. Next we're going to play it on this. I'm going to begin a compound picking movement and row movements. We're going to be strong right now. Gold just be strong as fuck. We're going to close the prep up the volume. That's when you get huge and shout it. We're going right now. This is the time where the next four weeks out to hit my PRS for the entire year. It's going to be strong and possible. Then we start prep. Hopefully you're getting a lot of food. Have a good prep rather than a miserable prep where I start myself. I'm tired. Look at a pump though. I wear a tank top. Hell, it's getting just a tweak of the Kelvin. Go on the other path. Let's see. Uh, what? Nothing. I've never been able to do a D-clines before. I've got five years to come out of the room. For some reason, recently I can do D-clines. So, try to set up a peck minor D-clines action. And then maybe push up and we'll follow the deck. By the way, for the delay. Yeah. We're going to hit a week ahead of my body. Body weight exercises. The stronger I get, like weight. The weaker I get a body weight. Definitely. I can't. Get shown up like a crowd's finish like we did. There you go. I don't know. What? What? What else? I'm not praying. You're my coach. Steer master with two hours. You're. You're my best state. This is cooking up 6x70m. They take two hours. That's the point. What? That's the point. What's the point? That's why they take it long to cook. I have nothing to say in videos anymore. I'm not like research questions and interview myself on TV videos. So, I'm excited to film it. The fourth month I'll have to go buy a set of 170s. Hopefully I can get those back in the year. I will be here. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be here. I'll be back. But I know I'm not a parallel student. I'm focused on my form. I'm going to put it to everything that I want to hear myself. But mentally, I just like you can go and stuff myself. I'm going to do it. I'm not going to cause this. I'm not going to cause this. I'm not going to cause this. I'm not going to cause this. I'll break my bad. But chest best I can do that at least. So, I'll enjoy it. Fuck. I'm going to wrap on this workout. I'm going to go some food. I'm going to have some fish and vlog fries. I'm going to have to be a few shaggers. Take care, thanks for good meat.

Come on, just! Driving! Driving! Driving! Come on, come on! Come on, Chris! Come on, two more! Come on, let's go! Let's go! Alright guys, so before the video starts, I wanted to get in the light Friday week, so bear with me while this is like going down, but it's 4-year-old benefit because there's no way to time to shop then right now. And Raw is having a buy one, get one, 50% off on the website with a few tiers of getting some free stuff and we're giving away some good shit. So at $100, we've been $100 to get a free garbage of a mystery flavor, so we're going to pick up flavor randomly off the shelf and throw it in your bin and you've been spending $100 and then we've spent over $200, you get a garbage, as I said, and then you also get a bag, a funnel, a shaker, that it, and the whole website, buy one, get one, 50% off. Last of me to sell, we didn't have that for a giant sale, not for averages on sale and we're even one away because we love you guys, Black Friday. What we do, and the celebration of giving and you want to be a beautiful life in our appreciation to you guys. That's a type of shop. Anyways, getrunutrition.com, use code. It's, it's their different codes. Yeah. Calv is going to flash big. Right here. What my code is, I think it's different for Black Friday, but this code and this code only gets you the deal, so be sure to use whatever code Calv is putting on the screen over my face or wherever you're putting it. And there's any proof. You have a dragon fruit, that average just fucking tastes really good. So I recommend buying the dragon fruit average, and then if you get a fruit, you want to probably want to be dragon fruit. I don't think we're putting that in the bundle of mystery ones. You get for free, so by that one, you'll have another one for free. It tastes really good. It's like a fresh sweet, different, different, different, it's pink, it's good. Amazing. A rocket pop or a parrot tree. So, inflavors and good sales. Now let's get on with the video. What's up, good deal. That doesn't get any better than that. Chester, you do it. All right, so we're back here at Appalachian Recombe, beauty gym with Anna, but for sure, hopefully we don't get harassed these times. I mean, how do you get some chess? We got beat up at a massage earlier, so I know he's tired, I'm tired, but it's time to wake our ass up, get to work out in, where we set only to the left, and chest-day, so it's got to be a good day. So, ready to kill it. It's good. It's good, but not super stupid, and let's just go. Then we can get high to work at his pace, and then I feel like we can get really good chess work out. And then from there, we'll decide if we want to do treasure, we'll do maybe arms tomorrow. Or we can decide from there, but I feel like all machines and myth maybe, but nothing the free way. We can do that all the way through, but we can do pre-weighting religious duties and dumbbell wise or something like that, but we have some really good machines too, so let's just kind of go from there. Good. Good. Look at this. FST7, I know what. Yeah, we're going to do some FST7, so we're going to do some really good, blood flow, my muscle connection, and we might even do some FST7 super satsin.

So it's cool. It's awesome. The great thing about it is we got another 50 pieces of equipment coming in the next two weeks. So a little kid in the can is shut. That's right. That's right. Because we have a lot of area. We got to actually not have a material. We squeeze everything in. But we have a lot of warm machines coming in. And so shout out to Anada, shout out to Primo Fitness for helping us make this dream achievable. Been working on this for a very long time. It's been great because of the vast variety of machines and being able to use not only the biomechanics to really help you create that better contraction. But also being able to adjust for different heights. I mean, we have my wife was here. We're so on her. You guys, somebody is tall as Chris. Being able to work on him and everything in between. So that's what's really great about it. So many different machines that work so well. So, great thing about it is that Chris is going to be here for a couple more days. We're going to be working on legs, we're going to be working on arms, we're going to be working on back. We're going to be working on shoulders. So we got a bunch of different workouts coming. But it's going to be just over eight weeks out. Yeah, in the Saturday, we took. Yeah, it's been a good time right now. Down here, putting them the work. And then the right mindset and we're to fuck shit up. That's it. So follow it. Love it. Kill it. That you knew like, well, could be put down on t-shirt. Could be. It's got to go on the next t-shirt now. barbecue. Can I eat barbecue? barbecue. Sure. You can smell it. I want you to want that. barbecue would be my last resort. Yeah, you would have like a very run joteer. We've got fries, muffins, and I haven't actually had four new go big because you can fire us. Fern a fairness can be cooking up a storm. Yeah. Just giving, I get cod and potatoes and everything. I'm going to get shredded. Five minutes late, bud. All right. Yeah. So it's a day two training with private layer of panata, not everything. Honestly, these are panata machines that haven't even seen. So it's kind of cool. Take a pictures and put some of my gym I think, and everything like them. So it's nice. It's going to be my knees thing now. I've made gym with none of these big, but I'm going to fucking swap out pieces. I like finding them and like them. So I eventually have a perfect shit I have to have less variety. So it is what it is. But we're going to go back to honey town. So now he has a meeting. So we're going to go back to get some food. I think I'll make train right now. And then I'll see you guys later.

He doesn't. Wasn't with me in person. So when he saw me in person and he said, okay, Chris, it's even good spot. And you could just like a little tension with leave. And then it's like, okay, now it's good. So we've got to do this this and came on. So they're in a good spot right now. Four days out, I guess. And one more workout. So it's crazy. Counting down.

You know, I'm gonna go mister and miss is going through it. Oh God. No, no. I'm gonna have to do that. I'm gonna have to do that. I'm gonna have to do that. Yeah, that's it. That's it. Only if you put me. Oh, I'm gonna do that. Actually, I have too many princesses even I can do that. I'm just like a more pressure. More pressure. No, no. Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on, Chris. Come on, you're still. Oh, come on, come on, you're still. What's the... What is up, YouTube? We're here in Kentucky at the Megafit headquarters. There have been here before, so they're bringing me in behind the scenes. How the meals are made, how they're all prepped. The food coming in, all that could show me how high the quality, the clean the processing is, all that could stuff. So we're gonna run through here. The everything's made from the bundles, the custom balls, and all that could stuff. So stay tuned. Keep watching and hopefully you have like to do it. It's nice in here. Yeah, we just did some some remodel. We just expanded the forever little more and put a new line. We still have a mill of metal detectors never hang. We literally just got a chance to do it. There we go, perfect timing. I would just send my first ever food facility a few weeks ago. Let's make our bars and some of our juice and stuff. We went in there and made this cool 30 week factory there. No, it was tiny. They run a lot in the small place, yeah, pretty impressive. This small is missed a lot of fun. Oh, it is, yeah. Let's go ahead and get y'all set up. The question is, two eggs, so or three eggs, so. The three. So you should get comfortable. You don't want to see me cook. It's so good. I leave that to the court. You know that? You have your staples. You can cook. What's your favorite? Box, pancakes. Pasta. From a box now. I can check your technical. You can actually do a refresher. I'm going to add on a pumpkin. I'm going to add on a pumpkin. I thought that we did do it. I do. I used to make it every day and then now I don't have to make it. So, how much of my poverty zone cheese on it? All right. All right. That's what I'm going to do. What would I want to do? I am like a fish. A fish. With my pajama dog pretty much and like dog hair all over. It's a good opportunity. I want to do it. This is a. This is a word that's kind of on the way. We used it to speak. It's a good move. And over there. So, this is not starting to like a big prep area. For me to cut it. You want not. So, that's why there's not much in here right now. Everywhere cool too. So, like. It's like this place. The prep room is filled with food. The machines are. It's where I've been. It's in here. Yeah. Yeah. No. I think that's what I'm going to do. Everybody else is having a big machinery now. Yeah. We still do it. Yeah. We're going to do it. That way. So, keep that in light. Yeah. We're going to look at all the ingredients on the flat growth. The muscles. You can use your six lungs. Yeah. Very good. But, you know, you can put your feet in that breath. Your body's filled with your lungs. Yeah. We got a piece of meat. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can't put your foot in the deep breath. You can put your feet in the deep breath. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can put your feet in that deep breath. You can't put all that. I guess so. It's past them. Yeah. It's not that creative. But it's good. So, this is where we grill all the chicken and we do all our ground meat in the base of the chicken. All the grub meat in there. Yeah. Yeah. All wrong. All wrong. That's what we're trying to kick in. Try to be. Yeah. There they come in door for it. It's a little cooler back there for some tuning. Yeah. So we grill all our chicken. So it gives it a little bit more tenderness. It's like real deal with it here. I don't know what this is. Oh, really? Damn. All fresh vegetables. They're shippies and daily. Nothing's free frozen. We don't use that high cool. We don't use eating, I see. We have this. We're typically in the breakfast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a hell of a lot more hard than it's worth. Yeah. You'll be the only reason I've stayed with you guys. I like you. But I actually like the food. Yeah. I've tried all the other stuff and it's like, I don't want to eat this. Yeah. Everybody knows how to talk to this. Oh, man. I don't know what people say that. Yeah. Because we eat the products too. So we don't have to eat it. Yeah. And as we grow, rather than cutting quality, we're trying to upgrade every day. Yeah. Try to use better beans and what more. That's the best. That's amazing. The nice thing behind the scenes is being bored, press. You know? The big better than the food hope. Yeah. I mean, it's good to see how it all gets cooked together. There's a lot of things they just cook. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What up? What up? What up? I'm sure. How do you like types of stuff work? Well, I've only fed here for for 12 hours. Come on, let me get it. It's nice. Beautiful. Shout out to the Texans of the world's my first time in Dallas. I'm a fan, Calvin. But I think camera won't talk to you very highly of it. Love it. And Chris is a piece of art. He's a little sick boy. Yeah. But he's like, I really like it here. It's beautiful. It kind of reminds me of that Illinois. But like the grass. The grass is a trees. Florida is very tropical. This is very. The vibe. Yeah. We're going to vibe up. Let you all come back and let you guys know my final thoughts. But so far so good. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Just being my authentic self. I think it's a minor asshole. Cheers. What is up YouTube? We are back in Texas to see H.T. Mr. Honny Rambad, but we're going to crew with us. We're here for the built-in film with it. To where that we're doing a little seminar. We've been Q&A. Mean Creek. Calvin can have all that on these series. But we are just guided in late last night from Kentucky. I don't know if I know all that footage to show you guys. Calvin was with me. But later video I'll go first. I'm going to show you some of that stuff. Maybe before after this. I don't know. But we're going to do a podcast right now with Honny. We're going to go work out later. Calvin is desperate for some barbecue. So maybe we'll get some barbecue. And some I can actually eat it instead of big torture. Just watching our prep. But the tour is right now. So we're heading to the podcast studio. We're going to film this and then go from there. So say to it. What is it called? What is it called? Color matching. What? Well you both are fancy. It's like my beard. Oh yeah. It's good. Good. Good. Good. Damn. Honny. That's really. I'm going to roll the rest room. Yeah. Actually I'm going to go too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to get a step. Maybe measuring his water. We're up like that. How much does that? How much do you think he was going to have to travel to his. He did. And what's one of those was the RS grill? Yeah. What's the difference? Of course. I want you guys to be able to try and sell things. What do you think? What do you think? Good. What business do you want to eat to go? Not as big as what we used to go. Yeah. I'm going to share this with you. I can't show it. Okay. I think we'd be just today. Yeah. When we do that, when tomorrow, like, what back? Yeah. And then maybe Sunday. Yeah. And like, oh, like. Yeah. Yeah. It's scared of doing legs. Woo. Nice. But I just actually the week is far enough here right now. By pressing it really weak. So, it's still being a bear. First workout. Yeah. How do you feel about him? Bouncing 225 for 10. Oh, you mean skinny bitch syndrome and full effect? I have a teacher that does skinny bitch. I'm absolutely about to do it. How you under percent of the other thing is skinny bitch. I'm a little sad. He doesn't want things to be too easy for us. So, you have to take two steps back to take five steps forward. You gotta put yourself a new core into the pressure to work that you're not. I didn't have no words. So, it works. That's him. I'm gonna throw this off. These are favorite being your favorite. Yeah, favorite you've had. There you go. How did you do it? How did you go? Good. Oh, you know. Are we gonna go Mr. and Mrs. Goantyre? Oh God. No. Mr. and Mrs. Olympia. So, that you want to do that? I don't know how to talk about you. I don't know what you do in the game. There. That's it. That's it. Only do put me. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I don't know. I don't know. Actually, I have too many princesses. Oh, I can't do that. I just like a more pressure. More pressure. No. I don't know. Okay. Okay. Good. Let's get it out. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. So, what we're doing is we're just making sure to go through the motion. It's not. He's not as weak as I thought he would be. Thank you. It's a little bit punchly. I thought it was going to be really, really, really weak. I've been seeing the last video. I have to do so that. The expectation was a problem with overdoliver. He's definitely set the standard to borrow low. When I could be this at the center of high and then right after I set it low, it's possible. He's a good job with that. Good job with that. Can't find any weights or injury. That's what we're trying to focus on right now. We'll arrange a motion, get in the blood and the muscle, make sure it's contracting, and we're getting out the shakes. The pushing is getting us. Yes. He's hurting us out of him. He's looking at the release of your inner beach. It's hard to be there. And he's accepted. Roll it. Yeah. Going from that to big beach. It's time for some upgrades. It's time for some upgrades. Good. Good. Okay. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Good. Good. Good. I still notice we can be tired. Here we will stronger than I thought. There you go, guys. I'm not actually speaking about it. I'm a medium, medium bitch. It's not true. You just told me you was a superstar. I'm just a regular. Yeah. Okay. So we're going to do all the way up. Go. Go now. Pause it. Just go down. That's it. We do one more set. We're just going to work on the eccentric a little bit more. Go a little bit slower on the way down. It's just going to really help to keep more time and attention. So just go up the top. Pause for a quick second. And then we go really slow. There we go. Great. Great. Very good. That's slow. Turn it up. Good. One more. Go. Good. Sit slow. All right. So we're working on the eccentric. So we're on the way down. We're getting him to pause at the very top just for a split second. So we're not using momentum. But then on top of that, what we're trying to do is we're trying to focus on making sure that we're taking our time on the way down. Trying to get those muscles to react to it. You'll start seeing shaken. Most people only get shaken as during their ab training because most people do everything but abs. When you're getting it from chastise because he hasn't done much of anything. I did chip last week. I just didn't do that eight week before that. To my point. It's why I'm your favorite client, eh? This is what I have to deal with. Everybody be careful what you guys wish for. Not what you think. You didn't whisper that he just came crawling to your door. Oh no, I'm saying that people wish they could be me. If you wish they could do this, I'm not you. You were wishing for it. You're the person who wasn't. I said, where did I deserve this? It's a terrible chat. The challenge was accepted. Now it's time. Now he's trying to make it like let's raise the barn. Like he finishes. This is a panata press. This will be pressed as a couple of different angles. You can be able to really attack your chest or triceps. Can you do it? Oh, fuck me. Can you go here? I'll also do it right here. And just put yourself right in that spot. And then there you go. So you're going to feel good. So you're going to feel good triceps. You're going to feel good. You're going to get a little bit of stretch because the bar is back. You're pushing the bit like this. More of a normal range of motion. It feels good because you get a little bit of tension all the way through. But you also can get a little bit of stretch because the bar is back. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The terror of things. There you go. There you go. Good. Good. Good. You're going to feel like you're locking into a roll of things. It's all the fun. It's all the fun. It's all the fun. It's another dad joke. Dad jokes are bad. You're waiting to sit here. I was waiting here one. There it was. Was that a joke? It was not a joke. It was just a steak. I don't know. That's what a dad joke is. It's the funny joke. It's not.

It's a good joke. It's a good joke. It's a good joke. It's a good joke. It's a good joke. It's a good joke. It's a good joke. It's a good joke. It's a good joke. It's a good joke. It's a good joke.

Now three partials. Go one. Two. Good job. Yeah. Yeah. Chances. Actually, you know, sore. You know, you have a cough? Big fun. You have a cough. You have a cough. You have a cough. I was letting myself flinch. Well, we gotta see if it's being clinched. I had to be nanny bum for like a few months. Do you want me nanny bum? No. I'm super nanny bum. But my body actually makes it being nanny bum. I don't do it. You guys go in there and do the regular checkups for. Space, please. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Really close. Good. Sneak kick. She's going to be on the way. I don't know. I swear to keep. Let me call on my top. Go and you can order my brisket for me. I'll show off. Is it down in the eat? We'll go together. Ready? You've been waiting your whole life for this moment. Yeah. To feed me some brisket? Yeah. About just any brisket. I like it. Well, then quit. You've had a close. Yes. Is there a way right now? No. Not a moment. Not a moment. Okay. How fresh is your brisket right now? How fresh is your brisket right now? I would have to have. Can you hold three? Sure. Thank you.

Texas barbecue. I'm for the off season to fully be here. Did you get a couple of ribs? Yeah. I think I worked. It came on there. You get to have my extra gluten bread. It's just going to be good. You vouched for this way. I did. I didn't know where we were going to go to night. What was the matter? Which we could at night. Exactly. What is this hot? What is this hot? What is this hot? What is it? All right, so we are at Angel's barbecue. This is Calvin's pride in joining me, try to eat it. It's good. It's amazing. He's grinning by in the camera. You can't see it. But he said he was literally nervous in the car. He could eat upset barbecue. Me and the ham not a gigantic fan of it. But I do like good food. So we'll be the judge of it. If my first bite in the barbecue sauce or. No. Yeah. Without. There you go. I've honestly never really enriched people. Parts of a cake and very anything. But I think really good. It has a lot more smoke than normal. So if you like smoking very good. I think it's really good. The sides are awesome. Haven't tried the rift yet. But so far. And I like the vinegar based barbecue sauce. Where it's not super sugary and not the molasses base. So that was a big piece. It's about. There you go. I'm big of vinegar, but it's not too. All right. So that's going to be wrapped. Day one in Texas. You managed to do a podcast. Get a workout in. And eat some angel's barbecue. So Calvin's happy. We're all happy. We're going back home to get what's in the. Because she's been hungry. But they're not very healthy. Yeah. All right. So that's going to be wrapped all right. Day one in Texas.

Clean, crisp, mustache, been bringing the beer down, and you know, I got a really clean, looking, looks this here, fucking dialed in, shredded crispy so the hair had to match the part, and it was hard for the mulled to go.

See if they have a tricep pressure. It's too thick, press. Let's get a hit. Wow! reasoning brain limp good I think it's been like a strange time-speakable to love. I'm just like an empty hole right now. And that's what is getting it ready for a new start from the car, but because if that's what it's been happening, starting in the midday night, then I'm just going to turn a little bit ahead of the now to kind of get hold of that shift wall. I'm just going to turn a little bit ahead of the now to kind of get hold of that shift wall. I think it's probably not going to be a little bit ahead of the now. I think the other thing is, I was like, I was like about 10 minutes. I was just like going to the motion that my routine got to make it up. I finally picked my song for my routine and then showed it to everyone like that it was good. And then there was another song we were debating we listened to it and I was like, fuck this song is better. This morning, today Tuesday, Tuesday, I changed it. The USB put it back in my thing, edit the other song we're doing, put it on there, and then we're trying to kind of like form a routine to that. So getting it done, just, you know, the physique is going to make the routine. And then the rest is called the wing in a baby. A press, and she put the flat trust, the collar. There's a life thing that's been loaded flat for a while. I did when I was younger, it's good life. Look at that down, it just gets this workout. I don't know why you get your, that's so much. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. All right, so we just wrapped up the final chest workout. I don't work it in a real gym of 2020 prep wrapped up tomorrow. My deacimbiltion hotel, like I said, but weigh in so we're just kind of checking that. I have a beautiful meal of salmon in the rice right now. Actually, this is fucking delicious. You don't even know how good this tastes in your right now. And this is probably my last like deacim, caloric meal into my way in. We're cutting carbs and fats back a little bit after this because I self-to-make weight tomorrow, but we didn't want me to get too depleted and too flat. So honey pretty much nailed it. I lost so much of weight yesterday and he didn't want me to lose a gem, but he wanted me to stay right there. So I ate more food yesterday and woke up at 0.2 pounds heavier than I was yesterday. It's almost exact same. So that was exactly what we wanted. And now we are going to head over to Whole Foods, get some food that I need for my carb up, because it's our tomorrow night, get some more meat, some good stuff, and enjoy this in the car. And we'll see you guys at the store. We'll see some of you get some of your food. Wait for like this after? Yeah, she's eating. Not at all, but we have already prepared for dinner. What are we doing? What? A spare guess? Natural's on our way to a bit of a cereal, a little steak. He's just can't really have these anymore though. Very particular of my apples. Can he eat these now, but whole show apples, if you had your it, so good. That's what you're doing. That's what you're doing. What you're doing? What you're doing? What you're doing? Yeah, two of Cule's salmon. Yeah, they're absolutely incredible. Thank you so much. Okay, yep, that's good. Do you think this is enough chicken for you? All of this in this? No. I never do it. Do I just get to the bathroom? Yeah, I just get to the bathroom. Right now. All right, buddy. I'll close you today. Bring that on the airplane. That's kind of a piece. I always eat no sauce or I have ketchup packs. Better. Yeah, we can get one just in case. Oh, they're good. Well, it's a neat plank, yes. I have a nice one. Yeah, isn't this? The flat. Yeah, so they'll be good to eat better. Oh, after all. Yeah, perfect. We get four of these. Okay. Can I get the log right here? That's right. Was that it? Yeah. I think that is perfect. Our sharing is not expensive. What do you think? Yeah, I'm asking her more. You don't think that is expensive? You need about three pounds. Yeah. Yeah. Steaked out. There's something to eat. It's not. Look away. I've got the eldest girls, a Whole Foods. The next gyro. Fucking have a big Lorder. We got a bunch of stuff for me, Andy, and everything for Karabab. Fucking Whole Foods healthy, Steve, I'm doing it all too. We know fun shit, really. Just a bunch of salmon, bunch of steak, bunch of clean cuts of everything. All the different types of potatoes, some rice. We got some stuff for after the Olympics, so we can bake some organic, low sugar, healthy, cakes, cookie skillets with no sugar added, dark chocolate, all the bullshit that you get probably hate me for, but I just love to eat. So, we got a bunch of that stuff prepared already, Iraq. I should have had a water, a lot of stuff going on, so we're going to pack this up. Definitely going to get someone to tell the help us, tip and ice, bellboy to bring our stuff up to the room, because I don't have the energy to do that right now. So, we get home, unpack, and chill out. All right, kids, for me, wrap on today, Tuesday, tomorrow's Wednesday, and it's a big day. They got my crack scale here, I don't know if I've explained this, but this is my, my sodium scale. How fucking intense I am with everything? Let's take the cover, actually, I cannot get you. When I have literally been weighing on my salt to absolute middle gram, I'll show you how to make it. So, if I put like mustard on, I weigh the mustard on scale, I'll take the sodium in the mustard, I'll have my protein, I'll have the protein that has sodium in it. I weigh myself on, and everything is like two a tea I've never done this before, but we're going to be consistent with this, so I know how much to pull, how much to add, and just like what we're doing with anything. And I've been having seven to eight liters of water a day, about two gallons. And just being super tracking, I would ask, is tomorrow, is the big day that it all comes out and knowing how my body's going to adjust, base off weight, et cetera, and making under 240 pounds at 8pm at night. So, we're going to be figuring out how to do that tomorrow, base off when my weight is tonight for bed, wait, we're morning, all that good shit. So, right now, I had a few, at three car meals during the day, and now I'm having no car meals for the rest of the night, so three more without. I've been talking to those in my brain. But we got everything we need at whole foods, and the fucking fat list of stuff. I'm packed, here, got in the fridge, ready to rock. I'm going to chill out tonight, I got to shave my back, I had to shave my chops in the minute again, pretty hairy, so, according to the help of that, it's gonna tire me a little more than anything trying to shave my fucking body, I hate doing it. So, I'm going to kale after that, trying to get a good sleep tonight, hopefully wake up, skinning the moral, and yeah, it's pretty much all it's going on. So, I'll see you guys tomorrow, keep it touch, please subscribe, I love you all, and have a good night. Happy good night. Happy good night. It's wrong, it's not happy to be here. It's not happy to be here. Have a jolly, jolly Christmas. No, it's all good night, you know? What is it? And what is it? It's Christmas too, all of you all good night. Yeah! Some boys that. Thank you, guys. I'm on the quadrice.

Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. What are your cues on this? First, like, what are you thinking about when you're... Did... Did... Yeah, this ice cream's already white. So, pulling you backwards. So, more than I'm coming together. And you're like, even if I'm not all the way there, I think you might be able to have in that final speed of your chest. I have. Like, here and here, coming in the other side. Rather than your arms, I mean, like, yeah. And just, just getting the center of your chest, catching it back slowly. Oh. Long enough you can feel the negative pressure. Oh, my. Oh, my. Take it. Take it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Now, kind of keep it away. I can't... I can't... I can't... Not warm up with your warm up weight. That is a top set of the same people though, just. You wanna drop it? Well, you're doing the camera off. Smash cut to, like, the set being finished in the plate to be back on that beef. Like, 220s over the far side. Oh. Put that in there. What the f... Where does my asko? I'm thinking, yeah. I don't know. Okay, got it. Come on. Come on. Big drive. Come on. Come on. I'm gonna ask the dumbbell like that. Come on. Come on. Well, you see the most extreme extreme straight. And most successful people who've been doing consistent. So, there's nobody that I know. That was managed to be successful without being consistent. My consistency doesn't guarantee that you're successful. But if you're not consistent, you can guarantee that you won't reach success. I've got every sound of the fact that it's just impossible, like. This is the problem. Given that I did live island, the problem that it teaches young people about what success is. If it's success isn't doing something consistently. That's hard. Difficult becoming better every single day over a long period of time. It's like hoping that you get plucked out of obscurity. Yeah. Like the fucking hunger game. You know the mopping game? Yeah. That's what people you get. Yeah. Because this girl who's now got two million followers in Instagram and everybody in England or everybody in America or Australia, they're the endos of their name. There's a address six weeks ago. And now she's got the two million dollar pretty little thing boo-hoo contract. Like, well that's how I get famous. But now Drake said it best. He was like these days famous separated from excellence. Oh, that's good. He always followed good one, right? Yeah. But it's so true. People just famous for being famous though. Whatever reason they've never accomplished anything excellence. People are like people naturally look up to famous people. It's a culture that we've built in. It's a lovely culture. So with their celebrities, people have been down there. It's easy to go. I think the number of people that have fragile fame. Yeah. Again, it's interesting for me because I've seen fame twice. I've had two waves of it. Yeah. So I had it the first time with reality TV and it came really easy. But it left really easily. And then this time, if I wanted to stop it now, it's like a snowball going down. Hell, it was like, it's way more robust. And it's people that know me, what I am and what I do. Whereas if you do end up on the reality, it's a V show. People come up and go, I know you and I really appreciate it. What are they saying that they appreciate you so I'm feeling on TV and the sunshine and the sun. Yeah, it's so nice. Yeah, it's like a way back to the value I find people who know me. They've just like six or six years of growth. It's just different. Come on, Chris. Come on. Take it. Big chest one. Do you do three 15 right now? On bench. Are you fucking tear your chest? How many reps? Four. Like regular 10 sets or 10 reps? 10 reps? No. I could do it on dumbbells. Like one calorie max if anything. I have no idea. Can you remember what they are? I hit a 7 10 deadlift. I never went around max squat because I was too scared. But I did 6 25 for 7 which was like the scary thing I ever did. And then bed trust was like 435. I've never had good bench here. What's that in? I can break many. Is that one landing five? That's about, no, that's about 435. Yeah. That's about almost 200 kilos. Yeah, I go now. Do you see everyone's trying to break that ton of flats record at the moment? 525. Is that a lot of training? 525 for 23 reps, right? 525 for 23 reps. I thought it was all the 21st boys. You did like a crazy 215 to about 200 reps. That's like 100 reps. Yeah, no this was the one that a bunch of people have tried to do. And everybody ends up collapsing. Partly through. Who's that Canadian dude that's like, well, no. I'll do it one more. I think he's starting. No, I think I did another warmer. I'll go. I'll start thinking about that's the key to stop talking about and to just start training. The guy that talks for a living and the guy that trains for a living and coming into him. Come on. It's friction. You're talking it's a... That's great stuff. Really nice. Yeah. I don't feel jittery. Well, there's no captain here. It's definitely a bit more fucking juice in the tank. Yeah. It's nice. I've been really liking the loads of no STEM. You can overload everything else. Are you being ethical and fucking back in the right place? Yeah. There's some asshole on this, just to be able to do whatever you can. Some asshole on this. Yeah. You're business partner. I'm sure. Who's giving me shit? Good. Right, exactly. I like it. For a long time, all the people were doing this just pushing hard on the caffeine pedal. Okay. There's only so much health meaning you can take to try and make 400 milligrams of caffeine not feel like health. Yeah. So. I mean, probably not a good thing when you drink four or two million caffeine and feel nothing. Yeah. You know, people were like, I need 500 to feel it now. So then you need to probably set up a little detail. Dude, I did 500 days at that caffeine. 500 days with zero caffeine. I got stealth caffeine a couple of times. When people gave me diet coke, they didn't have the wasn't no caffeine. Yeah. But like, other than that, 500 days. Wow. Should I just see what happened? I did a thousand days at that alcohol. I think it was really great. Yeah. So it's like, removed the part of, like, Did you notice any difference from like six months to have this? From alcohol again. Yeah. Yeah. And that was mostly consistency of habit. Yeah. But it was no great. But if you think about what a hangover is, a hangover is electing to make yourself ill, acutely for 36 hours. Yeah. So I'm going to fuck my world up for 36 hours. And then caffeine, the reason for that was I just felt like I didn't ever talk about being tired or being awake. And then I did think about what I have very in levels of caffeine concentration in my blood. Yeah. If you listen to the language of people say, they don't say I'm tired, they say I need to cough up. You're like, maybe. If you want to be a drinker over the cracks of your fatigue, you'd ask yourself the question, why am I tired 11-30 a year? Yeah. You're not supposed to be tired 11-30 a year. Yeah. So you mask over the fact that you're not sleeping in a prioritising recovery. You use your phone until 11 pm at night every single evening. In silver day and when you wake up. Thank you. There we go. There's a coffee in you before you're a denocene system to the active. You're not hydrating properly. You're not taking any magnesium or sodium or potassium. Oh, but I'm tired 11-30 a year. Yeah. Fuck wait. It was a really accurate insight. You're putting in any of your world-loved experiences. You're not going to talk about it. You're the pill. You're the drink. You're the coffee. Yeah. This is a little chess press by. I've seen you use this guy before as excited to use. Cool. Yeah. Big fan of it. Comberging. A little converging. Oh, I'm not pressing. I'm going to go a little. Is that it? I've been one I've spent my energy on at warmer. Just make sure I can do it. Don't light fall up the weight. Cross-fick press. Don't get the opposite of it. Take one and 45 up. Yeah. Take the opposite of it. Take one and 45 up. Come on. Come on. Ah. Sorry, that's not helpful. Follow me. Come on. Ah. Come on. Ah. Ah. A swag gravity is different for you when you get on. No matter how good I am. Because I can button it in the press to make the gravity go up for me. Don't press. Come on, Chris. Try. Come on. Here we go. Yep. Six ways. Six ways. Five games. And that's just a book sentence. That pushed you hard back. I often use my neck in my chest press as well. Same thing. That's a secret. The secret of a strong chest press is in the neck. That's what happens to you. Chest press to block. Chest press to the right person. Broken version. Oh. I don't know. Excuse me, Jeff. No. What's your bodybuilding? You ought to make him do a stretch of ice. That's a fly. That's okay. He'll be in the lift. What's the story behind the tattoo on the front? It's full? Yeah. It would happen to be on the front of the ocean. What's up on set? And what's the pursuit? Uh-huh. This one is not that one. That's the year I got sick. My class year a lot. I got sick and like, really didn't do that, like set the pace for the rest of my life through this. Like all of like, shit, I thought I had figured out kind of came crumbling down because of the such a stressful time. No, when I was like, I got a fucking gun. I've shipped together mentally and had operated in the world. So I'm just like floating through that thinking of the front of the chair. It's all started from that year. Okay. Let's go. Good. Come on. Look up. Take it. You're going to go out of the... Take it. Come on. Come on. That would be the surprise. Let's try again. Good. Drive. Come on. Here you go. How does this trip, Jellon? It's like, you get so progressively farther on the way up. It's just fucking deep. When you fail on this, it's just nothing left on the table. You get to do it on your way up. Yeah. Who did it? Thanks, please. Thanks, please. Come on. Yep. Yep. Take your ass. Come on. Come on. Keep moving. Keep moving. Yep. Yep. Yeah. You're a lot so truly okay. Hi. So like, you're somebody who you're in Takeru, who is built around making your body look as aesthetic as possible. Yeah. And I think that he purposefully can be in the category that optimizes for like actual aesthetics. And he makes with muscularity and so on and so forth. And yet men weigh way way way way got the best end of the deal. Getting to look at women's bodies. Make it, then do the way around. Yeah. Like even the most like curated cut well-honed male physique. It's like we got the better end of the deal. Getting to look at women's. No thanks. Like the honour we have men you mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like that. We get to like they get to look at us and it's like insurance. I don't think we would have talked to you. But like compared to like the just the female form is way more nice to look at. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Like even like for like. We've got the better end of the deal. But like the people in the bodybuilders there to see freaks. So they want to like they'd rather see the men's bodybuilders who looks like freaks in the woman's bodybuilder. You know. That is true. Just generally like I think. I bet you had it. Again, we're talking about men first women in the following in the action. Yeah. With your bodybuilding show and you asked what we'd rather look at on stage right now. Most of the cow we men and most of the cow's who they'd rather watch the men watch. Up is the unknown. Yeah. Up is the unknown. That's your cow. But that's a difference. For my traditional English leaving and the cow was leaving. I'm gonna go fire up the trigger. So see you guys there. You put it into a 500. You grow. That ones I've wanted for you. So we'll let that. I'll actually eat on a little bit more ground. So take this fucker out. So took a little bit longer. Took a couple of hours to get them to 110 internal temp. So I'm just gonna squish this on to 500 right now. And we're gonna steer these bitches and about probably a little bit. But yeah. So we let them smoke for a while and they're gonna taste amazing. They look good. The bar is in. They smell insane. Yeah. It's great. It's like a baby. It's like a baby. It's like a baby. It's like a baby boy. It's not a baby boy. It's a little bit of a smuggling around the edge. It's a bit of a smuggling around the edge. It's a bit of a smuggling around the edge. I don't know about you. But that's perfectly there.

=== FILE: CHRIS BUMSTEAD OLYMPIA MOTIVATION ｜ CHAMPION MENTALITY [_x1i1hTFme0].txt ===

Champion mentality. I'm not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live up to the light that I have. Abraham Lincoln. Winning is at once what I thought it was. I found it to be much more complex in our traditional definitions of success. A lot of people fall to their knees in tears after a big accomplishment. I partly do the joy and gratitude, but a lot of what you see is a relief and even fear. I don't say this to be cynical, but I've heard it from various people and experienced it myself. It's a crucial moment in a person's journey where you need to ask yourself what winning means to you. Otherwise, you get stuck in a hamster wheel, chasing a potentially non-existent as well. What I found is that winning doesn't happen on showday. It happens when the early mornings, painful workouts, long cardio sessions, and hungry nights. It happens in those moments of fear. We all have one face with a difficult goal, and then more so in what you make of that fear. It happens in every second of every day before you win. If you can take every opportunity you have to bring yourself closer to your goal. When everyone is as opportunities, all while becoming more resilient in the process, how can you lose? That's an exciting opportunity. An exciting responsibility to find out what you're truly capable of. A metal around your neck and a trophy in your hands provides a moment of relief. Maybe a surge of excitement, but one that will quickly and surely fade. Then you're back to square one and face with new decisions. Can I do it again? Will I do it again? Again. Why? The new challenges you face now. You're so focused on winning you didn't plan for what comes next. After all that hell you just put yourself through. Are you ready to do it again? But with more intensities? If you're not improving, you're following behind now. You've shown the world what you're capable of. And they expect nothing less. Another scary, but exciting opportunity. Another opportunity to grow. You may have busted your ass and gotten lucky once. That was then, and this is now. You can work 10 times smarter and harder than you did before, but you're still promised nothing. Entering hell blindly, there's no promise of what's on the other end, is one thing. But getting to paradise and then choosing to turn back around into hell. Well, well knowing what to expect this time was the pipe dream of a better paradise on the other end waiting for you. That's insanity. The history, the habit of calling ambitious people crazy. There's no guarantee of what you'll find on the other side of hell. You may even be crazy enough to learn that it would never help to begin with. Maybe, just maybe. You can open your mind to the possibility that paradise is found and maybe choose to look and act in this world. Paradise, like our goals, will not really be a destination, but an endless horizon we secretly don't want to reach. I'm never ending reason to keep working and growing. With the intention, not to accomplish goals, but to become someone who can accomplish any goal. Winning equally has no finish line. It's about the responsibility to ourselves to take control of what little things you can in this world, regardless of circumstances. The train you're mind to switch your perspectives and focus on being the absolute best you can be in the air as you do have control over. Having a champion mentality isn't about the trophies, medals, or success. It's about having no quit. It's not letting anyone hear you complain, standing up for all you believe in, living in your truth, and setting this standard at which you operate at for everything in your life. It's about willingly choosing to do every single thing within your power to achieve your end result. At the end of it all, you may just find that the trophies and money were never the prize you wanted. But rather the journey of the mentality built along the way with everything you've ever needed.

=== FILE: CONQUERING MY FEAR ｜ OUR FIRST SEMINAR + CHEST DAY [XPJiH89FSu8].txt ===

Wish me luck. Cam? I'm a f***er now. Yeah? Yeah? Can we get away? Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, I thought he'd probably gonna go f*** it after me. So I'm gonna f*** it after me. I f***ed it. Oh, no. Thank you. Oh. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on, you're one in two. Oh, come on. Come on, you're one in two. Come on. What's that? What did you do? What's up guys? It's definitely a good one. I'm gonna get you to rob it. I'm gonna see you in two seconds. He's sitting there. I don't know if you're looking at me. I'm gonna put him in his neck. I'm gonna sit there for a minute. I'm gonna put it in two seconds. Wait, I need to put it in two seconds. What did you do? What's up guys? It's definitely a good one, shit. This has happened twice in these shoes. What's up? Trying to get off the shoe before we go in. She gets pissed. She's pissed. Get out of here. What? You two. Stayed the day of our first ever seminar. Built from within with H.D. A.K. Honey Rambod. This is the last thing I ever want to be doing in my life. It's talking sort of a logical people to have had it. But this is a year of trying new things and taking a new experience. It's a good thing to go to my comfort zone and try not to touch a little pussy bitch. Got that in the skinny bitch in a pussy bitch. But I'm excited. Well nervous. So I'm gonna get up there. Luckily, honey could literally, as his wife said, talk to a brick wall for five hours and just have a conversation with it. So if he needs to just ramble off on there and play his wealth of knowledge, you will. And give my experience my story and share what I have to share. And hopefully people are interested in it. Then we got to cut it in the end. We're doing, giving away. We work out five of it, you would be doing all that good stuff. So the law stuff going on. I don't know if it's going to show the setup out there, but he will. But you got like a little over three and a few people come and I think so. Not bad for a first man. So if they do, and hopefully we don't shit the bed. I think no. You go work for after lunch. You look great. We're doing it. You're doing it. All right, you gave time. Which we like? Can't. I'm going to talk it up or not. Yeah. Can we get away? Oh, no. Oh, no. I thought he probably going to go shit after this. I'm going to go shit out. I just can't. I just think of. I did it. After the Olympia, you did both. I did exactly. Wow, I got my phone on silent. Yeah, I got one. They're the kicking ass gear, just go. Keep that. Let me show you. Let me show you. Let me show you. Let me show you. Let me show you. Let me show you. He is. We're waiting for him. We're waiting for him. We're waiting for him. We're waiting for him. At last, he said. See you. I've eaten. He's pushing. He's pushing. He's pushing. He's pushing. He's pushing. He's pushing. He's pushing. He's pushing. He's waiting. This is what he's doing. He's moving. He's coming. He's going. He's going. He's going. He's going. He's going to. He's going to. And. Chris comes in itself. Folks. I'm excited to say. Welcome. So my man. I'm. Rambas. Whoo. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm just gonna be the best. I'm just gonna be the best. I'm just gonna be the best. I got it. Alright, folks, can I respect you again? I call the most decorated by the mirror in the history. I'm probably gonna link over a brawl in about energy and your current. And still waiting for time, Mr. Olivia in the classic league. Ladies and gentlemen, a bigger exercise on the floor. Chris Bumson. I'm just gonna go to bed and get you up to bed. So, after that I'm gonna be the best. I got it. I'm just gonna go to bed. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Yeah. Wait. Wait. Wait. Not ready. Were you ready for it? Yeah. That's it. That's his fault. It wasn't getting out of him or is one. Really? We gotta go through all of this. Alright, so we filmed absolutely nothing after that event because we retired. Try to get the hell out of there and it calvinated of getting absolutely hammered out of club. I hope he puts the picture and he probably won't put the funny picture of him there. So the funny video of me and there too, I was in that fucked up, but we're having a good time celebrating letting loose at a successful event. So quickly to touch on that event actually went really good. I appreciate all you guys who came out. And a huge aspect of what made it really good for me that people were actually really engaged, like writing stuff down with no path nodding, listening, asking great questions. And that built my confidence and enjoyment of doing it and makes us more energetic to give more and more enjoyable and in turn makes it better for everyone. Looks like a cycle of us all making it better event. I really appreciate you guys coming out ready to learn, ready to listen. And it was the first time I've been doing this hub seminar like that. I'm someone who has pretty serious anxiety speaking with people, like when I first talking to my heart was like pounding and so I lose my breath. And I always do that when I have to talk to my friends and people. We do a little thing at the gym the other day and my heart was fucking racing doing that too. We were just talking to friends about 100 people. So it's something that I did not want to do. And when we talked about doing seminar, it's like type thing. I was like, you know what fuck it? It seems to me that pushing me outside my comfort comfort zone. Do something on my freedom and actually going to make me grow and become better at something I'm not good at. So you know, it's a sad truth of life. You got to put yourself in uncomfortable situations to grow. And that's exactly what I'm trying to do now. I'm doing another fucking speech talk, whatever, in like a health summit at the end of the year. This hybrid health summit. I'm going to talk about my health journey and I'm even more nervous about that because people who don't know who I am is talking from a huge cab. I'm not looking forward to it. But again, putting yourself in this position will have you grow hopefully make me better at a skill, public speaking. Something I'm not good at, make me better at that. So I'm going to try and keep doing as much as I can. More podcast more talking and just hopefully become less of an anxious public speaker. Could I just hate being a friend of crowd? Maybe surprise you, not to the bodybuilder, but I fucking hated it even though I was young body. But like, I've gotten used to that. I'm better at it. Now I would like to get better speaking because I don't know if it was my list or something that made me anxious talking from the crowd around the end. But something did I hate it. Trying to get better at it. I made it back home, wrapped up that event, came back from Texas and yeah, we've had 40 years out with here and then we headed to Ohio for the Arnold. So kind of internet really quick. But it's another early morning chess workout here. Calvin just met me here. He trained me for me like six a.m. So now it is time for me to get a juicy chess pump, trying to eat huge and then we're off to the airport for Arnold. So yeah, we get all this going on right now. Just warming up right now trying to wake myself up and hopefully get a happy chance before we leave. It's hard to fuck the train on the road, especially Arnold we can just chaotic. So wish me love. I think we got back from Texas. I've turned it like Tom Platt's squad. This machine like super like narrow stance super deep squat like literally to the point of like sitting in that ass on my calves. She had deep with that kid much lighter weight than normal doing like 15 reps. My legs are so sore right now. Can you even get out of bed this morning? I've never had the bad dums and I don't know how long it had been a minute. So feels good. Well, if it means I like won't be skinny for much longer. But that might be the theme of this offseason like training Tom Platt's style. Fuck that shit hurt. And the big ass drenched though. Maybe there was something to it. The dude did have big legs. So respect. I love this machine. We gotta never have a chest fly press combo. Goat machine. Make sure you use it as much as possible. Because it's a beautiful warm-up beautiful press beautiful fly to get a best of all worlds. Be on a little broken today. We'll stick this in the machines. Do dumbbell later on the work you're throwing on to go heavy. And we go over there. See if anyone deep in the machine at once. I'll close my favorite chest machine. I'll leave definitely my favorite flat chest machine. Because it's actually converging and it keeps away consistent the whole way through. Because the handles come in and force your elbows to the come in. And at the end of the wrap your pecs are contracted as tight as a fly. But it's a press. So it's like another beautiful combo of it. And my favorite machine. The rare to find too. I can't really get heavy real quick. Oh, I thought. Humbles the fuck out of you. Two to three plates feel like five plates when I'm in. Oh man. I've had the worst allergies for the last two months. My face is full and I blow my nose 20 times a day. Like only good in the gym when I'm sweating for some reason. I'm making me real tired. So if anyone has any secret remedies, allergies, they don't include prescriptions or medications of the natural. Please let me know. It's in the end. All right. Moving on to the last exercise. Which is a beautiful technique. My work is having been super long, especially in the morning. I'm just focusing on like bigger range of motion than normal. Like I used 210 on that neutral grip in climb press. And I've come here and press it. Now I'm trying to actually stretch really deep. Like I was talking about doing the squats the other day. Just fucking huge range of motion right now from my body's tight. And I'm trying to use my train to actually move through large range of motion with a load on my body. So it's actually a down for the foot. So I'm trying to kind of train like that and it's actually working so it's fun. So push it in as I can. This is going to be the last exercise. I'm going to do like three sets here. Maybe you're dropping it. And then the whole team we got to get the fuck out of here. Yeah. I'm doing it, I can't remind you that I can't do that. Alright, that's gonna be it. Good chest. I should have a decent little chest pump. For somebody who I trained in the morning, I probably should figure out why. Maybe it's insulin level of blood sugar, some ship, but actually get a really good pump training faster than the morning. So, nothing planning. Corny still kicking over there, waiting for it to finish. So, if she had more time to go, I'm gonna bang it with some attractive extensions. Chest and try is why not if she's ready to go, we're gonna get the fuck out of here. So, I guess I'll go find her. Alright, that's the wrap. On today's chest workout, a little bit of chest hips. Like, four or five sets, just a big amount at the end. But we're gonna head to Ohio here soon. We got a job to my him because it's the only direct flight. Meet up with Maddie Kelvin. We're all driving down there and they're together. So, boys trip this weekend. Together we're gonna be at the aeronels. I said to see you guys there. And it's not. Sorry, not sorry. But that's it. I guess we're watching. And I'll see you guys in the next one. Thank you.

=== FILE: CRAZY ARM PUMP ｜ TIME TO FIX MY BROKEN BODY [nnpdo7w9MOE].txt ===

Okay. Okay. 5. 3. 2. 1. 1. 1. 5. Alright. 1. 1. Hard, hard, hard, hard. Come on, more, more, more, more. 2. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. Now. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. What is up? You too. Welcome back to the gym. Do some little differ now. We got Mr. Justin King here with us from built-in better. You're good. It's a better than a gallery department. I know you like that. You're the first person that noticed that. What does that say? I don't know. He's a relative of the government thing. Yes, he does. Exactly. But he's been helping Ian with some of his goals in training and becoming a sprinter. And we were chatting and he has a lot of expertise and not just functional training. He worked with a bunch of mainly NFL and the A to all these. So, yeah. NFL NHL, MLB, UFC Olympic sports, big big spread. And you see the work with Charles Paul going to stuff on the board? Yeah, yeah. Prior to him passing our tour for Charles. He's been working for a blast to get to do the NBA before he passed. That's awesome. Yeah, yeah. But he's an expert in all things training and misconception that everyone thinks bodybuilding is very different. The functional training bodybuilders don't like to learn new things. They don't like rehab, injury prevention. They're just like PRs and then machine. So, trying to break that, I've obviously hurt myself in the lot in the past. So, trying to be preventative, fix some things up and we're going to do some testing today. See where my body is at and hopefully make some new changes to my training and see myself stronger, healthier and feel better. Yeah. And then we'll just go like you beat down at me. Like anything with the doctor or anything like that. Like did we're any of those familiar or were all of them pretty much new? I did like it. Same with pretty enough, hey, that's the main thing that was good in the manual. I had the OG Vivo that were made out of plastic bottles. Yeah. And cut your feet up. Yeah. But I didn't realize they got the update as the money just over to the new pair. That's how I was just talking to, I was just talking to one of their reps about getting something with the gym. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they're, I love their stuff. So we'll go over the injuries real quick and then anything else that comes to mind, let me know. So left labor on multiple times, right hammy tear, what head of the hamstring was it? You can go ahead. Did you tell what I was looking at it? Probably member notices. Maybe by such a smart. To the middle of prep, I'm like, who the chronic knee soldier pain towards Terries, you said it was a major and minor. Do you know like percentage? No, no, you got all the sounds. Okay. Left short head of bicep tear, dozen of muscle belly. Do you know percentage? No. No pain since though. No. Left, vassas, line of rallas tear. I'm assuming the same thing for that. Low back pain and the left side. Which, when you write it all out on paper, you see there's a lot of issues on the left side. I've looked into like fascist stuff at all. Vassas, fascist specifically. Are you familiar with like what it is and what it does and all that, to an extent. So like the morph suits that were really popular in like the 2012 or whatever, like you have that under your skin. But the fibers are whatever. Have the tensile strength of steel. But they're also sticky like a spider web. So like if you're doing all these things and repetitive motions for a long period of time, you now have all that starting to stick together and it has the sticky strength of steel. So like I'm assuming that the left side of your body is just like super screwed up right now. Yeah and that's why like all these things are trying to happen to left side, but we'll see when we go into it. Go socks off and then just standing right here. This is your big toe. These are your other toes. Just lift your big toe. That's how bad. Now go big toe down. Other toes up. That's not bad either. You should just in EMD that one. Super neat. If you as far as you can, you can't keep the knee straight. Yeah. Grounded as far as you can. Other way. Yeah. That's not bad. Any pain in the knee when you go in like that or no. That's okay. All right. So you'll be fingers interlaced, extended out in front of you. One foot out of a 45 degree. I think you're just going to hop off. Put your legs to this. Yeah. Straight arms. And pick up point over my head to scare it the whole time. But like this. Straight. Yeah. There you go. And then jump off. Now that. Other side. Immediately right off the bat. The foot pronates. Other time. Are you getting any like pain through here like nothing in the training. Or I guess you haven't trained in a minute, but anyways, other side. Good. Yeah. Go ahead. Now that. We will do this one then. All right. Same thing. fingers interlaced. And then hop off. Okay. That's like. So it's VMO and adductor on the left side. Like straight. Go ahead. And then that is bad. So right off the bat left side. The tons of issues. Right. Left side. The VMO cute and adductor cute. The. And left side. You have more issues on. And especially the adductor has really high tide to your low back. And like your transverse abdominis. And then if it's me is coming in. There's all these issues that are here. They're throwing off your back. Like it's a week or a week. Tite. But usually we can tight our hand in hand. You know, it's week because it's tighter. It's tight because it's a week or whatever. But right off the bat. There's more of an issue on the left side. We'll go right here. It will be grip out to the side. It's feet a little wider than hip width. Bend it the knees first. As low as you can. Controlled. Sit in the bottom and then back up. Oh boy. And don't look in the mirror face this way. No mirror. No mirror. I know. That's my gym has no mirror. Really. It throws stuff. It's reversed. What you see. So it inhibits your nervous system slightly. And anything balanced related to throws. So this I want. Just clean wall. Okay. Bend it the knees for a little bit. And then low as you can. Doesn't matter. You can see the difference between the right and left though. Right arm is a little higher. Anyways go again. Go up. Okay. And then face. Fucking man. Face that wall. Yeah. So I can see from the back. So main thing is going to be the feet pronate. Dorsey flexion isn't terrible. But we'll do an actual Dorsey flexion test next. I was thinking your Dorsey flexion would be worse. So that's that's pretty good. For Dorsey flexion, you need to be able to pass a five inch Dorsey flexion test. So we'll go up again to wall. So you'll go toe. Right at the back of my phone. Knee down. And then you'll reach this knee for the wall while keeping the other knee down. With your knee reach. Oh yeah. Pop man. So put the right there. Yeah. Put the. Yep. And then keep your heel down. And then reach that for the wall. That easy. How much is my heel? That's not bad though. That's not bad. Okay. So you should be able to pass that. Dorsey flexion is a predictor of over. A little further back. A little further back. Just throw your barely barely touching the phone. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Now go. So that's probably been saving. You can see that when you did all of it overhead squat, how this comes in. Usually that's pure formus being tight. So that's we're going into hips now. But your Dorsey flexion is halfway decent. You're pretty close to getting it. You'll probably have that like within four weeks. But again, that's a predictor or 80% of lower body injuries. So if we go into flexion. Dorsey flexion. Five in store C flexion. So if you don't have that, weight higher risk of injury. Is that like let's say someone's five five first six. One does that change or the middle. No. It's all their own lever lengths. Yeah. I mean. So like the idea that like a basketball player shouldn't squat. Squat asked to grass or can't do that. If anything, I would say they need to do it more because of how long their levers are. So their risk of injury is even higher. Yeah, that's a common misconception that it's like, Oh, well, like what if you're really tall like then do you get a pass? Nope. This is where we'll have to figure out what we're going to do with no table. We'll just go to the muscle testing honestly. And then we'll get in all this flat on your back. This way. Either way, don't matter. And then you're going to do our seat flex. Keep both knees straight. And then bring this foot back as far as you can while keeping both knees straight. So this should be at 135 degrees. So like your low back. Like obviously your hamstring to Uber Uber tight. What you call that like 40, five degrees maybe. Let's see the right side. A little bit better on the right side. Not much, but a little bit better. Okay, we're going to do we're going to go through different traps fibers from here. So we'll go trap three first. Each of them are unilateral. So your arm will be here and you're just going to push up with the straight arm in my hand. Like based down. Exactly. Right there straight arm. Lift. And that's more of a ranged thing or a strength thing. Like, oh, no, that's a strength thing. You can lift it. You can lift it. That's like. That's like. You're nothing. You're trapped three. That's like the biggest money making like muscle in your upper body in my opinion from an athletic standpoint. Go again. You're weak. What would you say you're like 1 RM close grip. And it's 335. 335. So your trapped three. You should be able to do that movement with 9.8% of 330 for eight with a 40 or 100. So for them. So you should be able to like, however, grab a 30 and just boom. And pour it down and control it. Yeah, no. So just that alone if I could like give you a pill and you're trapped three stronger. Your shoulders are going to be in a way better place. And since that pulls everything down, I'll start helping with Ted. It's going to help with all of this here. Like, up to everything. That's something you're like. Like my posture stuck with that. Yeah. And it's like hard for me to hold it back. Yeah. And it's more of, it looks like it's more of a trap issue. Your wrong boys were fine when we did the test for it. So it's more of a trap for you. So the trap for him has been ages. Okay. Um, from there. It's just the forest plate stuff. But how, like, how do the ankles and knees? Hips all that feel. Fine. One last time you like jump jump jump jump. Jump jump jump jump jump jump jump. I jump. I jump jump. I jump jump. Yeah, yeah. There you go. Okay. And then I land and couldn't walk for a while. But it wasn't just like controlled Jump. I'll play basketball, try to jump. Okay, and that's one of the goals is to be able to dunk the hot close so you're right now. Like can you grab rim? I'm sure I could. I haven't tried it in a year. Okay. But it gave me a nice 30 minutes to warm up. I think you could do it. Like a grab rim that don't. That's good. That's good. So, we're going to do a little bit of rest. Then your three warm up jumps are going to be on the plates because I want you to get used to jumping on the plates. Usually, it would have foam padding around it. We're living on the edge. We're living on the edge. No, that's one of the reasons we might not do the multi rebound is even with one of our triple jumpers. You'd think you's the best in the world at jumping. Even when we tested him, he's like jumping around on it. So, well, we'll probably just do these ones. And then we'll go from there. So hands on hips. If you're going to do a little bit of 50%, you're going to dip jump 50% land reset on you. Everything feels good with that. Okay, 75%. That's not bad. That's not bad. Tomorrow he's jumping over the car. All right. Now we'll go 100%. Yep. How do you feel with that? A little wobbly on the leg. But nothing. I'm also looking down and make sure I'm letting it go. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So we got a little bit of rest. Just to make sure that you're fresh for the testing. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Usually it's three tries on each, but I just want the data. We'll get in and get out. And we're good. So I counter movement and on counter movement. We'll see you about most of your rebound. Like we know. And you have like two minutes rest. So you got plenty of time. What does this show wait? No. This fits out 76 metrics for every jump. So literally everything. You see how high you jump? Yeah, in meters. There you go. You'll know that, yeah. I need an inch of how I need an inch of. And I was young and had a 42 inch vertical. Really? That's with sticks. Yeah. We don't do sticks because it's so easy to cheat you. Yeah, we, this guy, Marco Wilson, he had like a crazy compliment. I don't know what the numbers are about. Make them up. Yeah, like, let's say a 42. And then he came in and he did his jump. And it was like 28 inches. But these are very unforgiving sticks. It's a completely different game. Well, you can like reach. You can reach. Like men will like this. Oh, that's his eyes. I can get. And then you get next at three four inches off of it. I'm trying to see if I can find an example. But on the show in you later, I'll show you on your jumps. We'll do that. You got your breath back. You had to be still recovering a bit. I'm gonna tell them my jump in just once. Yeah, just once. If I want you to be fresh. So anything nervous system related, you have to be fresh fresh. I don't want to see like, it'd be like you taking a minute rest after I said and then going for a 1 RM. This is a 1 RM. The load isn't reflective of something that's going to be slow, but it's still 1 RM. So you need to be fully fully recovered. Otherwise it's going to be like we could retest tomorrow. I was like, oh my god, you're again 3 inches like this. Dang, that's crazy. It just me being here. But yeah, so I want to make sure you're fresh. So whenever you're ready, we'll go. But no rush. So it'll be hands on hips. You'll stand still, which just lets this feel what zero motion is. And then when I say, you'll do the jump. And then just make sure you land reset and then we're good. Ready? Okay, dead still. All right, go. Let's see. Point 4-6 meter counter movement depth, point 5-3. How does it even know all this super fancy scale? That's pretty much all it is. Let's see. I want to see the difference between right and left. That's going to be the main one, you'll. And the difference from right to left, almost a 20% difference. So like the amount of force being produced, that's the difference. Favorite in which look. The right slightly, but then on the landing breaking, you land it on the lack. And I'll print this out and make it more digestible. And you'll just distribute to like a squatting power and every 100% 100%. All it is is the lower body force production. Yeah, I mean, there is a difference in the speed of the contraction. So there's guys who are really fast for their strength and their schedule really strong for their speed. So like if you did this jump, but you're really, really weak, you'll turn this right away or vice versa, which for you you're likely much stronger for your squat than you are here. So all of that's taken into consideration. But nonetheless, yes, they are correlated really, really heavily. Do you watch Ian's video on his assessors? Okay, so are you right there for it? So we'll set you up to where you're in the position that's like the second pole. Like for him doing Olympic lifts, there's a second pole position. And that has a really high correlation to just in general maximum lower body force production. So I want to see what's the maximum amount of force that you can produce. I symmetrically, so you'll be pulling a bar into an immovable object. And you're just pulling this hardy to can for four seconds. And that'll not only tell me how long does it take for you to get to peak force. So that's one thing. It'll tell me how long you can hold peak force. I'll tell me the difference between right and left. And then in general, it'll tell me what your peak force is. So it's up to you and it depends on how good you feel to. I don't need it, but if you're like, we kind of close to you, like we can do it. I'm a little triad. All right, here we go. So you'll go up to it and then pause in the pins, pulling with like 50% already. Or 3, 2, 1 relax. Okay, now go at like 75%. There you go, 4, 3, 2, 1 relax. Okay, set that down. Let's go about two minutes rest. I'll bring the force plates in there. We'll probably adjust the height for more time. And then you have straps. Let me just move over there. Okay, perfect. Go down my level of use. I'll have you do one rep for four seconds. And once you're incrementally go up to 100% by the end of it, then you'll rest for three minutes. Then we'll go. And then that's your last test. Okay, ready? Go. 4, 3, 2, 1 relax. How's everything feel? Good. You get any like hot and cheap feelings in your armpit or not. Okay, good. Usually with infraspinitis or subscaps, sometimes that pull down from the load. You can get that feeling. Have you gotten that on deadless before and everything? That's good. Okay, 3, 2. Pretty like cautious of those things. And I'm like, put less force into it. Keep my shoulders down here instead of. Yeah. All right, so right below it. It's very nice. Dead still. And then when I say go go. To do that. Or that's fine. Ready to go. Hard, hard, hard, hard pull. Come on more, more, more, more, more. Two, one. Good. You are at 2600 newtons of course. Uh, net. Pretty scary. I got to do tear something. Yeah. I was like, you're going to go on my- I'm not going to. I'm not going to. Well, as you can see the whole time you're like climbing climbing climbing climbing climbing. Yeah. Be a peak. Uh, 2650. Right to left it doesn't look like there's a ton of a discrepancy here, which is good. Um, they have 2600 newtons for you way how much? 250. I like to see thousands. So a thousand newtons. You're producing about two and some change, like times your body weight in terms of the lower body force production. But easily that like we want above three like up to four even more than that. But there's a governor subconsciously and even consciously for you to read like your pulling. You're pulling it's like, you're like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no more. Which I want you to get to the point where you can pull in it's like your completely confident. Like you're not going to be dunking like crazy and running like crazy and doing all these things if you have a limiting like thing like the few consciously and subconsciously. Yeah. But yeah, that'll go up really quick. There's one thing I heard of like Kobe Bryant when he tore the killies. I like when let him go back in until he like would jump off his box. Yeah, because he was like scared to do it. But if you're scared to do it, right? Yeah, what are you talking about there? Yeah, no, yeah, no, of course. I mean as we get going, I'm sure we'll have a lot. Oh, there'll be plenty of questions. There's nothing. What do you think like he's fucked there? No, no. No, I mean there's there's things that it's like, okay, definitely we need to go about this in a smart way. There's not a ton of room for like, oh yeah, like go run a mile five days a week. And we'll be good six months for now. I'd be like, I'd want to tweak it slightly. Like it's not going to kill you, but there's a list of things that it's like it would be good to Change. You know what I mean? Yeah. But no. You're in a much better position than why I thought you were going to be in. Honestly, yeah. Oh, so that's good. Yeah. Well, no, that's good. But to this stuff, if nobody build it really do this, you think this is even beneficial for someone who just wants to be fucking jacked and shredded on the floor. I mean, if someone could compete in body building without using their body, sure. But like this is a sport that uses your body. Like, yeah, we're talking about how you look, but just like any other sport, like if you're if you're injured, you're not going to compete or if your force production is low, then you're not going to be able to recruit enough fibers that are going to be able to be high-perch her feet. Like, the whole thing is, it's about manipulating your body and trying to optimize it. I don't think that the application would be the exact same. Like, what I do in overcoming ISO pole is like, as if someone was like, oh, no, I don't care about, like, you wanted to just see what it looked like. What would I do with the bodybuilder? No, but we do muscle testing and see like, gay, like, your hamstring is a really high risk of injury. Like, we need to do X, Y and Z to fix it so that you're not like eight weeks out or 12 weeks out from like an LMPN. Then, tear a lot or am able to buy it. And like, accident, like they happen, like, for what's happened. But there are things you can do to mitigate it. And then, aside from like, the structural balance stuff and the strength of the strength of the strength of the strength. And see, like, there's so many methods that can be applied in bodybuilding. Like, it's right now. It is straight. Like, the big thing right now is working up to a top set. You do an intensifier and then maybe a back-offset. Like, everyone in their mom is doing that right now. Which is cool, but it's viewing the world through a straw that like, there's a way to do it. But there's millions of different methods you can do. And if you know how to plug them and how to play with them, who shouldn't do them in in what cases? Like, the progress is crazy that you can make. But you have to know this. I was just talking about this the other day. Like, bodybuilders are hilarious because they're like, Oh, I hurt my shoulder. So instead of doing shoulder press them, you can do machine, shoulder press. Yeah. And then you're just limiting yourself a more injury than that. You know, the inner curve you can't move. And you're just like, like, the other way. Yeah, then what are you going to do? You're sure. Your shoulders aren't going to grow at that point. Yeah. Yeah. That's not that important. And you're going to have a car. 5, 2, 1. 1, 2. 4-4-4. 1, 2, 1. 5, 2, 1. 1, 2, 1. 1, 2, 1. 1, 2. 5, 2, 1. 5. Go. All right, so they too have just just set me a straight to know what our market today because who doesn't want big arms so obviously different style training to me. He talks about everything the tool. It's time to apply it. It's not too so it's interesting. It's a lot new ones. Pretty cool doing this little tricep and different strength for the tricep and everything. Different tempo and feels good. I'm so pumped to share it. Well fucked kk Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is more of a... There you go. Come on. THE HYPER Grocer punishing his evil name. Yep. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This... Yeah. Oh! Yeah. Yep. OK. Got it. Yeah. God's... Oh. Excited. Set, run. Yes. There goes my forearms. You took that out of the town.

=== FILE: CRAZY SHOULDER WORKOUT W. SETH FEROCE & HANY RAMBOD [OphBG8xgqpQ].txt ===

Bro the three bodybuilders I've seen have been set there in flex I feel like I have For it's all good, but they're still better than they were when I told you I was training I'm gonna let you take the time off of just training calves What's that? sexy sexy Don't shoot I am It's new, not much yeah Everything this way have fun Yeah, it wouldn't be home though, you know, are you? Yeah, it's like sick what we'd say, but obviously I'm not traveling. We might have sick what we've done. Oh yeah, everything is good. Busy, very busy. Busy with just fucking every phrase. Everything. Family kids, Adela and Terrarysio, just shit. Yeah, just shit. Yeah, everything went good. Yeah, Adela and Mike ride into it. Yeah. Like she's my first born, so like, dude, she kills everything. It was heartbreaking because she was at states, like put together a hell of a fucking meat. It was going to go to regional, like, and put freaster nationals, and then Terrarysio, they're in a competition. It's a big enough. Yeah, it's a big enough. T-tune in this life lesson. No, I, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's a, that's a, we're looking at. But other than that, just fucking busy with work and kids and family and. Awesome. Yeah, it's a little fun. I'm just got one more exercise one more. So, I like it. So there's ours. Should I go to the, I'm good, whatever. How do you train that? You train like the bodybuilder? I was going hard at the beginning of the year because I just was like, I got a work with fucking doing functional work. I was doing the road split for like two and a half, three months. And then, and then I went back, I was like, I need to stay in shape. I started gaining weight, let press the wind back up a little bit. I'm like, I can take it back and function or shame. Now I just do push pull and legs and functional workouts. Like run around and insert pulls push up, set up, run in the mirror. Yeah, that's what I want to do. I want to compete with the cross-set. I want to be the cross-set game for now and so. I want to be, I want to do the tack. I don't know whether it's that. It's cross-fit with guidance. It's all it is. It's pretty shoot. The more you just hope it. No, you, it is, so it's just like the cross-fit games like there's a bunch of different obstacles. But then you run and fully get it out. Pistol way are, I've never run with guidance. I can shoot to my liking. I have a lot of them. But I've never done actual training with it. So, picture your neighbors. See, you're running out there fucking assaulting your back. Just running to the tree. I like it just because it's challenging. Like it's hard. And I know that if I keep doing bodybuilding stuff, I'm going to keep wanting to, it's myself back into it. I don't know. Because after I was done with the transformation challenge we did, I was like, I didn't have a run trend in like, four years. But like, what's your daughter? I don't even remember what it feels like. You can't have a height of like, don't you do it? You don't do it. So I was like, fuck, it just stay in the tree. I don't know. I'm old too. The dog truth. Do I say it as that? Well, the three bodybuilders I've seen have been set, they're in flex. And I feel like I feel like I have no cat. I feel like I have no cat. Plus the cat is still a cat. Oh my God. You have a better name. You should be here. You're a tall guy. But they're still better than they were. When I told you I was training, I was taking time off. I was just training cats. Your shoulders are warmed up. It's still a little light laterals. And all that. Get your rotator tough and you're going to rip a bullshit. Get the bullshit out. Fuck it. You're old faster. What's up? YouTube. You have a exciting day here in Pittsburgh. For with H.D. I'm Mr. Honey Rambond. What's up? It's 22-time Olympic coach. That new jacket? Yes. It gets a new one over here. It's a fancy man. It's also with Mr. Seth Grossy over here. What's up? Special day. Special day. There's a lot. There's a lot to this happen at this gym here in Pittsburgh. Yeah. We're making new memories for the gym. We're making a cool again. I feel like I've been training with nothing but short people lately too. That's so cool. Make me feel good. Short people. Oh, but just a troll. That's what people are. You can pass my ball. We're going to a far. Nice and low. I'll wait a little bit for those. I'll wait a little bit for those. We are hitting shoulders today. So enjoy. Oh, like, how much other? Can you do muscle ups on me? No, I've never done a muscle. Really? That's what I'm going to go with this summer. You can't be able to. He's got a swing. I'm not trying to worry. I can be like a local beer. Like... I could do the ball. Bro, it's only my flat. My last half out important. I do the air to pull up right now. You know, that's like a staple like movement across the right. I used to be able to do the 255 pounds. I haven't tried it in a while, so I don't know. I don't work at it. Okay. Okay. I've got to look at the crazy. Do you guys have a chair? He's been out. He's been a little bit of a geasure. Right up. I've been in Dubai. Did you? Yeah. It's kind of said that he wouldn't want to travel. And then now he's a world traveler. He doesn't want to go and maybe I'd love it. Yeah. Yeah, that's how it sounds. It sounds good. It's good balance. He's a world man. It's a good balance. It's a good body's nice and clean. Yeah. Good. Come on. Take your time. Take your time. Don't bounce. Functional doesn't mean bounce the weight. Come on. Come on. We're not going to have to rest. Good. Good. Come on, Seth. Drive it good. Good job. See? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love you. Fine. I love you. I love you. I love you. Good. Yeah. You're good. You're good. The cheavery is nice and smooth. Good. You're good. I love you. Fine. I love you. Fine. I love you. Good. Yeah. Okay.

So I've blowed your own my balls in the shower room with the, Yeah. Yeah. Get up in there. Yeah. It's my shower. What's you had 30, 30 night off this year? You're probably more like a young, young woman. I'm the gay, but I'm not going to keep that. He's got a, yeah. It's 10 years younger than me. You got to keep that out of my head. She's 20. I'm 20. I'm 20. I'm 20. That's it. I still got it, brother. Don't know. I know what he for you. Wait a minute. His brother younger than 40. He's older than 40. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. There you go. He's like, got something. Oh, my. I'm not going to lie. I got it. I'm not going to lie. Come on, set. He's got this. He's got this. He's got this. He's got this. He's got this. He's got this. He's got this. He's got this. He's got this. He's got this. You don't even realize how strong it is to look. He's a tramic a little bitch. No. Good, one more. Got this. You can't keep five. Put your breath. One more. But push, try. Push. Oh, that's it. That's a good. You can keep five. I'm in straw. That's something about it. I think I can't even straw. I'm in a North Stringer. He does. Yeah, I'm in a North Stringer. They call it the North. There's people that are like indigenous of the North. No, they just call it the North. No, they're like, they're not making your bullshit. No, they're like, they're not. I don't think I'm in a good place. It's good to have a good look. Proof yourself wrong. I thought it was like a North Scawter something. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm wrong, I don't want to shoot. There you go. And then you could have the North. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The pioneering documentary, depicts the lives of indigenous people of Canada's Northern Quebec. See, I know more shit about Canada than you do. Well, Canadians don't like Quebec. That's true. You say you like the one? Man, but what was that, right? It's okay. The one time you try to call me out on some bullshit. I sure do. I'll give it to you. It's not called English. It's called English. It's called English. It's called 1920s. It's called 1922. It's called 1922. Yeah. 1922. There's a story. No, no, no, no. That's called education. That's called education. You really know about that. Because you're drunk during the college years. Yeah, I was just going to say that. Don't try this at home. There's a professional. I could do not try this at home. You can move the seat up. But you are about to move. I guess you want to just go. Yeah, I'm good with the three inches. You should do it. I know. It's what you said. Come on. I'm not saying. Easy. Like wait. Go on. You got this. Go on. Keep it moving. Right? Keep it moving. Good. Good. You got two with me. Two with me. Good. Good. Good. Easy. That's all you. We're on. Come on, Seth. Try it. Try it. Try it. Oh, oh. Ah, so that. Not strong enough either. Yeah, we're going to start shaking. We're doing shoulder-pressing. No, it's your actual. Only man never make me puke doing legs or doing arms. If you're doing arms in San Jose. Yeah. Yeah. I was baby face down. I was FST-7-2. Yeah. That was the second video. Yep. Seventy-two. Second video. Yeah. We have DVDs back in the day. Showed our age again. Not the minutes. That's it. That's it. It's a TV show. Like back in the day like I was saying, this was the show, the Pittsburgh. So you come here. You'd have a brilliant day and they'd have DVDs. That. Jay would do it. Stop. No, there was no. There was no swipe in our memory seeing Jay at the Arnold in 2000. 2010. He came. We were at Muscle Tech booth. He came in. He was like, he's like, he's like, oh, catch. He's like, he's like, it's just the morning. No, that 30 K in there. Let's go. Come on. Don't worry. Oh, man. Show you. He keeps up a lot of it. Keep going. Keep going. Come on, Chris. Yeah. Yeah. Keep going, Chris. Good. Keep going, Chris. Keep going. One more. You saw you. Drive. Drive. Good job. He's a strong. He's a strong. More working. Are you want to be like that? I'll do a more. I was a mess. You were a mess for a while, eh? Oh, dude. It was 2001. Do you have to be getting any room to mess with that? Yeah. So a mess the whole time. But I won. Sure. I've been a mess. The whole time. But I won. Show. And catapult of the career in the start of that. The national is in all this. But this wouldn't was. I have a picture of me sitting on a chair. Like a lounge chair. And a hotel room. Dad. And just I remember just being cut in all the water and everything. Like cold water like crazy waterbuff. I work with a girl who needs because we're going to stress this. Who? Who? Stress case. I invented the words. It was horrible. He was walking for a soul sample. It was bad. It was so bad that when you showed up, I'm like, what the fuck did you do? Who just pictures two days ago and then showing up and looking at me in person, but would you do? Oh my god, I know this is what happens to me. I'm like, what do you mean? I said, did you go to an all-even-eat sushi buffet? Because that's where you look at it. It was bad. And you're like, okay, we're in trend fixes. And we got fixed in the one the whole row. But I just sold him a go. I did not again. I'm going to do this. I just don't know what to do. I do it. I can do it. And this is the problem. I don't know what to do. You know, that's where you pissed my set of ferocity. Yeah, I have to do it with Xenax or something. Bro, I didn't know what to do. I was so inexperienced. I just knew that I was going to do anything. I go to the lengths with training and nutrition and everything. And then at Nationals, I'm like three weeks out and he's like, I've shredded peeled. And he's like, now we're going to get nasty. I'm like, bro, I don't even know what I am right now. And that's whenever he's like, we can not allow. If you freak out at Nationals, won't be affected at all. So that's where we gave him the nickname for. For what's shredded. Don't get me shredded for roasted shredded. Because I was just, because it was just fucking such a stress case that he had to just peel me to nothings and freak out. What the one way to do it? Yeah, but. We're only done. Oh, yeah. All the variables. Whatever. I love it. Come on. This is a lot of things. Like, like, go tight. You dry. Good. Go. Go. Come on. Come on, sir. Oh, that's it. Dry me, bro. Good. Go on. Go on. With me. Good. Go on. Go. Go. One more. Come on. Try it. All the way. Good job. Five, eight. A little old now. Unsymmetrical. How old are you? How old am I? 38. This side of the body doesn't feel like this side of the body. It's going to take a kill. So you're a Panama and months of stem cells. That we told you to get out. But be younger than you're doing. How about your sister? Ha ha ha. I'm the work of the. Yeah. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Oh. Right on. Push. Oh. Push. Push. Good. You tell some stage. Keep going. Push. Drive it. Good. Drive it. Keep going. Keep going. Hello. Good. One more. With me. Come on. Drive it. Go. Good job. Oh, now you're working. There you go. We're going to do the 70s today. Like the old days. The French horned in. Yeah. I think the rest case. I got potatoes and rice. We were in Dallas and upfield and Dallas. And then he's like we're going to carve you up and since I was such a mess. He's like I mean potatoes. This white sweet potatoes left him right. Little bit of red meat. And then he's like, we're going to do something that we haven't done with you before. I'm like, here comes the hot and white stories that even like a jacepher and still he's. You get a burger with some ketchup. Oh my god. I did some ketchup. And he's like, yeah. I'm going to throw it in your locker. You're going to throw it in your locker. Because he's like you're a mess. I'm going to do a bunch of ketchup. You're going to spill over. I'm like, we get a burger with some ketchup. I was like, I just wanted to ice tea after the show. No caffeine. No caffeine. So that's a better way. It's a better way.

We're just kind of chilling in his dinner. I know you guys are always loved travel vlog. So it's Kim through that. But I just wanted to quickly touch on the reason why I'm really excited for this Arnold is because my dad this year is retiring. So I really wanted to spend a lot more time with him, especially now that I'm becoming a father myself and just realizing the inexplicable impact that my dad had on my last growing up. I just want to spend more time with him. It would be a dad that you might dad, it's like his weird, full circle thing now. So I brought him down to the Arnold and I wildly go to him was kind of like impassing with randomly like, you know, like it becomes like an ever-meat Arnold because he was a guy who was in the 70s, 80s when I was growing up, he was a man and I was like, I probably make that happen. So I asked him if I wanted to come with me, he's like, hell yeah, let's do it. I'm down to Florida, like some gals, chilled, much of the Arnold and then I'll like date two. Now that he was talking to Brian, the guy who sets it up and they'll go breakfast tomorrow, 80m Arnold, let's be there. So with there, we went to the hotel, whatever and then Arnold came or chill in there with Ronnie Coleman or sorry, thinking, pop by the Hany Jay Keller and Arnold Schwarzenegger and my dad was just like, what the fuck is my life right now? Because he's just a chill simple dude from Canada. So that was really cool and it was fun to be able to spend more time with him and just kind of chill and have some father son button bonding time. Arnold actually even signed a little book for him, gave to him and gave one of my mom's clients a book too because he's a huge fan. So it was really cool. You know, the longest I ever spoke with Arnold and you realize that he's actually just like a normal dude, super funny, crack and jokes chill and so we had a good old time and it was just, I was happy to spend the time with my dad. You know, I've never really cared about hanging it. It was like, other people are doing anything but I do just love spending time with my family. My dad is like, person who made me like calm, level headed person that I am. There's a being a reddit comedy always makes me feel work at peace. That a lot of fun. Hopefully more trips with Jaybum Mr. Jeff Bum said that we're going to be getting after it. But we're back home now. Finally home for a while. Just a couple of work done yesterday and the goal is to now finally get sued. So stay tuned. Hope you enjoyed the video. I'll see you next time.

=== FILE: DAYS OUT THE OLYMPIA ｜ BACK WORKOUT [pxiu58V1_I4].txt ===

Compared to a new 10th piece I'm going to have to go over the past few hours. How much all that really sucked in this? I don't know how that... that's crazy. It's always crazy because I'll be drinking seven-eight liters of water a day. And then all of a sudden, like, perfect timing, three days out. I said drying out so much. Even during seven weeks of water my mouth is dry. I could just need more water always. That's fine. My body just flushes it. Oh, let me go a quick run over there, dad. Yes, so we're just... like today's just lymphatic drainage again. We're trying to dry him out. So we're starting out these ankles. We're just gently gliding through, not a lot of pressure. And we're just pushing all the stuff up. And then we're getting into these thighs. And you're going to start to see this vascularity start to increase. As it absorbs and then we're using the guided PEMF from Electron Plus. So you activate those muscles. And that's what you're seeing as the muscle sort of quivers and shakes. It's just pumping it full of electrons so that it's pretty activated. And it's a really nice gentle way of getting treatment through the whole muscle tissue without digging too deep. That's the thing is we're only... What? Three days now? Two... three... three... three-ish, you know? We want to be very gentle to these muscles so that way. There's no inflammation but we're still draining them and go ahead flex. Yeah, and I mean they're drying up really nicely. So we'll kind of see more on the other side. So we'll light things a little weird. Let's go here. Let me get this plate. We're going to switch. The reason I'm switching the plate from side to side is it's pumping up this leg down through the lower back and then down through here. If I just have the plate here, the electrons just go up and down. This is going to get more of a full body flow or at least the lower body. So that way we get more current going. So right, vascularity isn't quite full and in yet. You can see a little bit but it's not surging up. And that's the goal to get that kind of pump in here again, especially for his next meal. And then I'll even do that for moral nerve too. Let's check out this for moral nerve. The more nerve comes kind of through the hip. This is a great way to treat the whole leg at once. Yeah, we're going to feel like. So the for moral nerve that supplies all the quads. It comes right over here over the hip flexors. So it's a really good way to get the entire thing at once. He probably feels it through his calves a little bit too, not too crazy. And we can do the same with the sciatic nerve on the back through the glutes. It's just kind of pumping the whole thing at once. The first thing we did is I couldn't stop laughing. I don't know if I can do that. I want to be on the machine. Three, four months. But yeah, you can start to see the pump really starts to come through. And it's a great way to kind of give him a passive pump without having to, you know, go lift a bunch of weights right now. And so even when he's not training, I'm still having his muscles get that flow. And yeah, now we can really see like from earlier, that was what those veins are already starting to click out. And that was sort of the approach that we were going to do this year to change it a bit because, you know, he has to beat himself each year. That's, he has to beat his previous self. So it's like, well, what are we changing? And this was sort of a technique, but his muscles have been recovering really great. His stamina has increased the muscle connection or the pumps. He has been telling me after these sessions, they get really, really nice and they fill out. Yeah, there's that. That's gorgeous pump there. She bring this back to us. She bring this back to us. She bring this back to us. So what did we did this before training back to remember of super depleted? Yeah, I didn't get a crazy pump, but I saw a pump, but my mind was the connection was like, and that's what that's what it was there for. And we can do another one because we're going to do a little bit on his, his a break-up, a plexus and arms because again, like, we don't need to shred through those. You know, we want to be nice to the bicep, right? Make sure we don't have to deal with anything there. So again, a really nice way to get into it. Well, how would you compare his body in this year as opposed to all the other previous years? I mean, from, from even just last year, there's, I don't feel any really not. Before there was like little granules that I could feel throughout the muscle tissue, there were tight points that were inhibiting him from getting a full muscle contraction, especially in the legs. This year, I mean, it's really just none. Information level is probably the minimal amount, and we were even talking about it. Like, he got a stem cell at one point and his body just flushed, and I've never felt someone's body changed so drastically. So there was definitely something to that stem cell. That was awesome. And we just, like, period of smooth glides. A lot of people asked me, like, how was it like to work on bodybuilders? And they're like, it must be so hard. And you know, like, and I was like, actually they're very squishy, and I like healthy, like all these muscles that are squishy, like that's how they're supposed to be. So he's feeling really good compared to the other years, and his, his contractions and muscle control is just absolutely wild. That's fun, but that vagus nerve goes down through that diaphragm, even down into the digestive tract a bit. And we can get these kind of break-up. All right, and all people are going to clip this. Yeah, every patient I treat with this there, they're always kind of half that gaggle. But yeah, we're so, that's what we're doing. We're just kind of checking each muscle group. And you can sure every fiber is doing what we wanted to do. That's interesting with this is you can see when someone's muscle is in firing. It won't fire. Like it'll actually be almost dead. And they're like, oh, and they can feel it, too, they'll, we'll be going through a section, and then it'll just stop. And then it'll slowly recharge. Because that's what, you know, each of these muscle fibers are like, little battery capacitors, and they run out of charge. I think that's really what creates a lot of knots. And so, within you can see every fiber is just firing very nicely. All the way through. What is up YouTube? Welcome to one sit. Another day in paradise. We're head to the gym. What? Something upstairs like that. I thought you just fired up. No. It just... I'll be right back. The room next to me dude. Wild. Like, party? No. It's like fucking going at it, dude. Nice. It was like this kind of door to you. You know what it was like? Oh fuck, that's it. I was like sick. All right. Anyways, one's day. We're head to the gym right now. A little bit later. Honies got the meeting with the open guys later. So, they all trained earlier. One of the gym now. We're going to be able to deep in some good kind of stay. I've had like, let's talk about them. We got to get going. Got a meal on the road. Party got me stacked. Vied me in, honey, and meal. So I'm going to bring some food. I have this to go after the gym. My parents come in tonight. The last workout is life. So we'll see you guys in the gym. I don't know what else to say. Try to do pullovers. I don't just pull the gym. I just want to do this. Just warm it up and still. Can we see this in the back? Yeah. All right. So here we are. Mr. Reigns is gym again. The final workout of the year. Tonight is big guys checkins. My checkins are tomorrow morning.

I got some nice rice and potato and chicken. I'll throw it away and get a meal. We're currently just saying sadly, honey told me no more coconut meat. I was already eating it. So the sad day eating it plain, but the potatoes make it taste better. So I'm going to eat this. I'm going to go home. I'm shaving my body. I'm a little hot head this year. I've started like random spots when I board one day. I'll do this arm and that arm. I got a clean shave everything. It takes like hours. Probably the worst part of prep. So I'll go home and do that and then... I think that's all I'm doing tonight. Literally. So let me go. I'm going to parents will come by and say how to them. We're better early. We'll get a skinny tomorrow and make way. I'll get huge. So I'll see you guys in the bill later. All right guys. Once in a... We'll tell him that 9 o'clock at night. 12 hours from now.

Mean Greeks, you see all the asses, press conference, everything get her getting 10 and just game on. I start feeding, carving up everything. So it's about to get started and feeling... It's here feel different. I've even seen some people kind of notice that. I just feel a little bit more like present and calm this year. My energy is better. I feel healthier and just like good, you know. Whatever's coming. I know I did what I had to do and did the work and I'm going to get squat. And then I said I can do this point. So I'm just kind of rolling with the peaks and valleys as they come and you know just enjoy this. This is best I can this year. Trying to keep it light and have fun. Do what I do. It's about sage fuck shit up and enjoy every single moment. This truly is like an active practice to be present. And the moments come once a year. So I've read press conference every meet. They're all super fun and if you're like just worrying about the stage or worrying. Perfect carb load or perfect this or whatever you're worrying about. You're not in the moment and you're missing that opportunity. May never come again and may know when we come once a year. So just do my best to be present and enjoy it all. Practicing that and I'd five years of practice. So grateful for the many opportunities to keep doing better and better. You better version myself and better Mr. Olympia. So let's go on. Chilling tonight. Very tired. Started to shave. Shave it tomorrow. I'm going on. But yeah. So appreciate you guys. And guess what I'll show you guys. The way it is tomorrow.

There's some. There's some. That's fine. But I bought it. I bought it. How are you feeling? I'm feeling. You're scary. You're scary. You're scary. You're trying to drift. And like if this thing were to roll. If I'm walking, it will be fine. No. I'm not going to go over. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry I passed you. What? I passed you. I was slowing down on purpose. I had a gap. I could floor it. She's pretty good. Like I'm like, it's same air. I got stuck. Yeah. I'm just, I like, this was not enjoyable. Like, the amazing service, but like, he was a fucking maniac. I was literally like this the whole time he would like to. No, no, no. He would let everyone listen to me. He would let everyone speed up and he purposely wanted to be in the back. So he could just fucking floor his arm. He could just don't want his arm. Do you want to do it? Do you want to do it? Do you want to do it? What are those drags? Drag turns. He's doing flung drag turns. I'm like, I'm not okay. I don't know how I'm like, Courtney is freaking out. I didn't tell. I'm so, yeah. I'm gonna walk away from this situation. I was literally like, trying to make him go fast. I was like, I really thought so when he was like, It's a fucking, I literally went to a disappeared condition. I just like, was crawling and now it's boring to touch up. I was like, how intense and like, like, how did he go? Well, yeah. And then he said, I'm doing it. And then my husband follows suit. Of course. So then it's like, yeah, you know? Just what's to do with the person in front of you is. Yeah. Mom and G didn't play it until then once. Actually, mom, she's a beast. Nope, not me. Calvin's the best driver. That's what I can say. Seriously. Try to pick up that. I'm not going to look at that. Like he will take you for a fucking ride. Courtney, did you film the whole thing? Rose screaming. I can't get some good guys. Yeah, I filmed it. So enjoy. I gotta retry that. He's a piece of education. Pick one on the middle thing. Try again. That's awesome. Man. Give us a lesson. You go. You go. I gotta walk back up this. You already get it. Can't even breathe. I know. I can't snow. It's easy. It just doesn't really feel like it. I think I need to do right side down. It literally just just stay on the way. If you just waxed it. I don't think it's going to make a difference. Just keep your balance. That's all you see. Okay. That's it. Okay. Well let's go. It's good. Try coming up now. Try not to play. I'll come this fast. You'll pass for now. I'm not going to. I'm not going to. I'm not going to. I'm not going to. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's broken. This is miserable. I'd rather get a full ride out of it. Is that a body boy? Wow. That was so fun. You did it. Of course. It's in America. It's just a place in Arizona. I think it says sit down. I'm going to take a break. Okay. I'll just go over there. That the people have like insane ways of these. Yeah. Somebody goes to it. There's something you tell too. Oh, it's you, Tom. It is you, Tom. They have the huge flags on them. Yeah. Dude. It's crazy. They're expensive. It seems like all done. I'll put 100 grams. What? I'm not. I got it. I got it. I got it. All right. Alright, so it's a wrap on Doom like we should buy it. Or when you just like to scream, I heard you at the whole time. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I've pretended like I can hear and I'm just boring. But she knows why. She needs to be pushed through that a little bit. But honestly, there was a lot of fun if you guys are ever in the Dubai area. You get the shot, do we have a lot of fun? But now we're going to go chill by the pool for a laks, hang out, dinner and night and then... Do you? I maybe workout. We'll see. I should probably workout. We definitely want tomorrow for golfing. Yep. So, yeah, see you guys there. Alright, so we're taking a little ride to the gym right now. I don't even know if I'll have to film that, but we're going to figure out. If I can't film them, I'm seeing the puzzle type. The hell do I film for this? But I believe in a whole iPhone, I've been able to film this whole plot. Yep, it can't be the nice button, but in a little tour on the way to the gym, on the views of this beautiful resort. So, I really can't complain about that life right now. But that's pretty sweet. I feel this hotel has one fucking pile of the gym and it's like a literal real gym. It's like a dream garage, essentially. But I got a really good chess bucket in yesterday. Today, I'm pretty fucking dead. We're in the sun all day. By the pool, red, noon, but Easter. So, just trying to get it in. It's not getting any of an even lot of food. So, it only means you'll lose weight. So, I'm trying to get whatever work I'm thinking on the street. And then we'll go back home to the garage. So, it's what we can do. Maybe that's what we should be slamming weights in this gym. Drop in the weights, match the perfect with the drop beat of the drop. Do we get copyright with this? I don't know what they're. They're custom DJs. Shoot here. I'm so tight that burns. Drop set. Drops is a good best friend. I'm vacation work ethic. Of course, you work a little harder. And then I'll have a lot of machines up with your work. I can never get used to kilograms. I might even go that way. My favorite is when people from Europe watch my videos. And I'll press like $100.0. And do like those kilograms. Like bro. Maybe a 220 pounds. Oh, we got a vacation. I'm going to do a vacation. Wow. So, you've nice time here thinking of that. I'm going to get burnt. I don't burn. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. All right. Last exercise. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt. I'm going to get burnt.

Appreciate you What is up YouTube here my garage aka my gym just moping around because I'm not a tourkout So trying to still do some content for you guys while I'm not allowed to train right now I'm on like week three I'm just about to hit week three of four weeks of no training so close but then it's gonna be Christmas We're gonna be on for a while so we're gonna be doing a Q&A grocery haul this week little stuff like that Just to get back into it and I'm doing it in my gym because this is the only excuse I have to be here and I miss being here. So that being said Q&A first question Well, I'll get a lot of questions about my kids picked a few but maybe I'll do my kids You're not twins. I promise my baby coming soon, but I'm gonna probably do Q&A Maybe some of those Courtney more focus on that so I'll just answer a few and I mean Probably still not getting me as completely, but what do you want to name your child now? I don't want to give this away either because it's probably gonna give away the second and I don't know if we will have it now Sit by the time I'm set but I did want I had a funny idea to hold Courtney. I wanted to name her daughter something that's just like very old like only an old person would have like Bob or Gladys or Cleopatra or something random like that and then make that their middle name or something So if ever their friends were like was your middle name and like oh my middle name is fucking Cleopatra Because I'll be like why the fuck about your middle name and like our kid can roll their eyes and be like oh my god My dad's an idiot and he thought it would be funny to give me a stupid middle name And I just thought it would make a really cool story every time someone asked her middle name So still working on Courtney she's not happy with it so far she's saying absolutely no, but we'll see I got a few more months to convince her who is your inspiration the answers before and still always been my dad My dad's just been the number one person I looked up to my whole life There's never anyone like on the lucid person who I didn't know or how to the concept made up of my mind If it were that I really looked up to my dad was just always like calm cool collected I felt like you knew everything. I felt like you was the strongest guy in the world when I was younger And he just like led the family was exactly what we needed as best as he could be So I was super grateful for him and I always looked up to just the way he handled himself of the father and a husband And I mean recently there'd been more people who have come into my life and I thought got to know them They'd become an inspiration, but they weren't other than that time for me being inspired by somebody don't know If I just have trust issues with people in the internet or something, but you know people like Ian has been an inspiration for me In the bodybuilding career obviously he got me into it like that people like Dom have been huge inspiration to me for business Courtney has been a huge inspiration for me Just wholehearted kindhearted living to suppress that so there's been people have come in my life inspired me in different ways So growing up I guess was my dad. What do you think is the ultimate form of self-inprovement? I'm not even really sure what you mean by form But what the answer that pops into my head is humility and that's just for the Bability to always hear criticism to understand you can be better to be the student rather than the teachers to listen and Just that concept that you can always be better to me That's just constant self-improvement not thinking you're better than anyone not think you're entitled to anything Entitlement all that kind of shit that I think a lot of people have these days You know not wanting to work for something I feel like all that comes back to that lack of humility the more humble you are the more growing the work for something More willing to learn and I just think to one of the best ways to have to continue any form of improvement Especially self-improvement the most important aspect you love about bodybuilding The tough question I would say Accommonate what comes in my mind first is like the challenge that it puts on me the Challenge to like continuously keep getting better find new ways keep getting better find new ways Stay motivated find new ways to be more consistent and just like that goal to keep pushing something better and better It's this like physical goal that I can chase that makes me Internally mentally a better person as well and it's a physical goal where as I keep chasing and keep pushing Keep getting more Olympia's but I'm more muscle build a better physique all this stuff It comes with all these mental challenges that force me into situations that are very difficult and I think putting yourself into difficult situations are like the number one thing to make you stronger Make you better at every aspect in life and life is gonna put life will eventually put you in a difficult position So the more difficult position to put yourself in the more you'll be prepared for the shit that life will throw at you I also what when I think of this now is this more so I guess I don't know It's so bodybuilding but when I hear when I go to like the Olympia's meet and grease and stuff like that I read my DMs or comments and I hear people talk about the inspiration and that I give them I guess from the way I carry myself or What I'm doing my career what I have a compilation stuff like that that really motivates me as well and something that I like really just love I'd make me want to just keep being better and doing better because I know other people are seeing me doing that and want to be better for themselves too which anime are you watching right now? So I just finished jujutsu guys in great show I still told me to get on that one only a few seasons got through pretty quick and then I started watching demon slayer And I know that's a super popular one just getting into it now and I fucking love it huge fan I feel like this is a pretty deep one too He now it's pretty dark fucking not gonna ruin it's a flick the first episode, but his family gets just brutally murdered The very beginning super sad and what I love of all the anime shows is all the main heroes Just have this like pure heart. They're just like such a good people and it shows you all these ways We're to gain power you could like go to the dark side and be bad and do bad things and treat people poorly To try and like self-lash it game more power But when you stick true to like your moral compass and being a good just kind soul It might be a slower route and a harder route, but it ultimately takes you further I think it's just a cool lesson that's in all anime and certainly in demon slayer too, but I'm really liking it so much Real Christmas tree or fake one. I've actually just talking to Courtney about this because she wanted to get a real one And I was like a little busy a little bit lazy right now to be setting up a real tree cutting it cleaning it all the shit That comes out with it when you have to throw it on a pine needle all over your house So my compromise was we have a fake tree already We'll keep using that and when our kids are old enough to even know what Christmas is and what a tree is We'll go with them to a tree farm cut it down ourselves and start making that a tradition But we'll start that tradition once our kids are conscious enough to even appreciate it So right now, fake tree soon to be real tree. What's the thing that makes you so confident every time out? All these questions are worth it very weird, but it's a good question Because I'm not always confident I definitely haven't always been confident And I've had to earn the confidence that I do have like the first I don't know three Olympias and ten shows before that When I very got off stage I was like super nervous didn't feel confident myself didn't really like believe I was going to like win the Olympia and it honestly really wasn't until the last two Olympias were like in my mind I was like I went to win this one beer like this is mine. No one's gonna beat me and it took me four titles So really feel like that and this year was the most this is your first time I ever said it allowed You would never catch me saying it loud. I'm gonna win this lumpy right thing and win the Olympia I was like nope not gonna say anything. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna show you I'm not gonna put anything out there and it was probably a lack of confidence in myself But this year I was like fuck that you know I know what I can do I know what I'm capable of I know how I look right now and I was like I'm gonna win this thing and I think the only reason I was able to get that Common is because I built it over time I've been doing I've been bodybuilding for ten years stepping on stage But it wouldn't be a seven times and after enough repetitions enough proof you can't deny to yourself just how capable I really am now so I just kind of just Disproving any self-doubt of myself and putting myself out there into those situations where I don't feel confident Improving to myself over and over again when I'm capable of and same with public speaking I've talked about this before but I've been super nervous and anxious to public speaking my whole life and the more and more I started to do it the more and more I just started to build confidence in it and the coolest thing I found I've touched on this But when I built more confidence public speaking I have built more confidence everywhere in my life and it just I could feel it transite even the smallest stupid thing So I've touched on I have you said like more social anxiety like thinking people are looking at me judging me Like and I just hated being around a lot of people and when I forgot my hair transplant done and I came back I had scabs in like dry skin following all over and look super fucking weird my head was like swollen from the water They have to inject in you and we're going to the grocery store in corners If you want to come in or do you want to just stay in the car because you don't want people to see your head and I was like fuck it You know what I'm doing going to go in the grocery store and I'm not gonna be able to fuck what people think about They're looking at my head thinking I look weird like what the fuck here No one's even gonna look at me and I noticed like getting past that fucks given I guess you could say in the grocery store I like I felt the subtle air of confidence even more so and normally have I was just walking around I was just like I don't go before and I felt good But I think just putting yourself into situations where you don't feel confident and Showing yourself that you can't feel confident and you can be more than you think your capable love Really just stacks belief into yourself over and over again more you do it more confident You'll be what's your favorite Christmas Christmas wow the list is coming in strong What's your favorite Christmas themed cheat food or meal? I mean kind of a cheat answer just to say Christmas dinner I always have like a Thanksgiving dinner on Christmas We have it twice a year thanks to me and on Christmas like turkey stuff and Thanksgiving all that but just because That's not really fair. I would say these sugar cookies my mom always made these sugar cookies. I think they're called or shortbread. Wow. I don't even know what the fuck Yeah, I think they're shortbread and they like put a little dab on a blob on a cookie sheet And then she puts a fork two different ways that it makes a little Chris cross pattern on them and they're really like they like fault Melted in your mouth like butter super sweet super good the white milk cookies are fire and I think it's just so More so than nostalgia in the memory that my mom's making those every Christmas since before I can remember What is your dream car the cost question because there's a few if They make a nine nine two GT 2 RS. I want that really bad. They haven't made a new GT 2 RS So I would love a GT 3 RS. I wish they made it in manual because bad ass was a fat wing and everything But the GT 3 manual pretty far too. So I've been a huge fan of horses ever since getting one driving them They're just like they just drive like crazy. Dom has an eight 12 super fast Ferrari which I never like loved for I reach for any reason, but when I sat in that thing I fell in love with that thing crazy And V12 and it's comfortable to see through big and I fit in it that's huge bonus for me A lot of cars. They don't fit in other than that also the old school cars 69 Mustang have a 69 Camaro So that used to be one but then a 70 charger as well with a hella fan motor and want like a Fucking thousand horsepower charger one day. So we have to get a barn one day when I'm older and Courtney will not be a fan of that. They're filling it up with all these cars, but chill chill chill chill come It's a come through what's the most influential change you made that's promoted the most growth Funny the first thing that pumps about minor unit is stopping drinking and it was more so just a complete lifestyle Shit that I made at some point in my life where I used to like party and go out and eat bad and X-y and Z and then I also and I switched to just a full bodybuilder mode and the biggest thing I really cut it with drinking And I used to drink quite a bit of a drink through three times a week when I was in college and while I still was able to make gains and progress Obviously drinking you're not eating that whole night You're clogging up your liver so your ability to burn fat through your liver is slowing down You're hung over the next day or the next two days depending on much of drink We're working out to suffering you're recovery suffering everything just off You're eating shitty because you don't feel like eating chicken and rice or egg whites in the morning when you're hungover Everything is just off the one I stopped drinking completely and I may be now I might get like a tipsy once a year or have like two or three drinks every now and then like Once or twice a year old drink, but I really never drink anymore and that really shifted I hold my Z and just being all in on bodybuilding and I made so much progress that year That was really sick of that was going into the 29th year when I won the Olympics so the proud definitely that how can we get a girlfriend like Courtney King It's actually was thinking about this the other day when someone asked him me about like how to get a girl and Bob Law how to fix people like comment joking how to find the Courtney King because she's the best Obviously everyone wants to go for a little bit here wife and fiance But the interesting thing when I was thinking about it is the simple fact of what you put out is what you attract And if you're like trying to be cool trying to be cocky trying to be arrogant trying to be this like tough guy Macho Bob, you're gonna attract a girl who's and if that's fake You're gonna be attracting a girl who is also fake and looking for something fake But if you're being like your true self, you're gonna attract the girl who matches with your true self So when 20 team when we first met the reason she reached out to me She actually saw the idea I'm fully renowned but there was because that was the year I got really sick Going into Olympia and after the Olympia I made a YouTube video talking about what I had gone through and I remember getting emotional And I cried and I remember being like I should delete this video on a fucking cry on YouTube like fuck this And I'll like you know what now? This is this is the broadest is real. This is just me being honest about how I felt and how fucking kind of depressed I had felt at the time and I put it out there and I was crying and I was emotional Super vulnerable and she's somehow saw that video I think it's gonna be her both with Jim Cher and it just kind of popped up and she saw it She's like fuck this cat different like I can just tell you got a great physique He's good looking but he's different. There's something about him like who puts this kind of older bullshit on YouTube was a bodybuilder and it made her interested so she's one of my DMs and I always had a crush on her because she was hot And she was misbeceny won't be in 2016 So I was excited that she was in my DM But that was the only thing that really grabbed her attention rather than just trying to be some like cool Instagram fuckboy online otherwise I would have attracted in three and fuck girls So I say be yourself but you're true self out there and understand what you're gonna put out there But you're gonna attract little lesson from the seabomb This bastard trying to lure me in here with a a list of patients so I will Lighten you I'm gonna try and read this if seven slippery salamanders Flether sideways super silently would you surrender? Wow, I feel like I feel I should read that 10 times every night before going to bed And I'll be better talking if you were little what would you ask for for Christmas damn That's tough. There's a lot of cool shit out there right now I really like stuff that flew when I was younger for some reason and I don't anymore So maybe a drone I think that'd be really cool and even when I was younger I always fucking wanted one of those little cars that drove like the little kid cars that you could get it in javaram You know they're super slow. I just really always wanted one of those and I never got one So now they have that crazy Tesla ATVs that actually go really fast So I would probably say a drone or a little ATVs in that rip their arm. Are you going to do a six-week challenge? Yes, so last year we did a eight-week challenge and we're building in it right now I'm so not entirely sure if I want to do a six-week or eight-week I kind of like the idea of like a six-week sprint starting in the new year and something that I need to do as well It's why I kind of want to do it. I'll be doing it alongside you guys. Same thing is before just small entry fee Sign up for the app. Although workouts and progress and everything will be run through there and then I'm gonna be doing it too Because that's when I can finally start working out again and then we'll have a a few prizes some cash money some pre-supplements Some pre-bumb energy a bunch of cool shit. So I'll kept them more information coming on that soon But it's a few for that challenge. What something you learned attending all saints Catholic high school? There's a friend of mine from high school answering asking this question and because it's a friend of mine I think this question one of the best things I learned from high school was the importance of like brotherhood and friendship We had a great group of guy friends in high school. Some friends that I still talk to today They all came down earlier this year actually like January a bunch of them came down and we were imparting in Miami So hung out every time we go home. We still hang out and talk and I just really Appreciate it having like just broke friends just like to be able to fuck around laugh and joke around about there's not many things in life you need more than that and something I realize in all stages of my life But they're in high school and college Parts when I was broke parts when I've had money even successful when I'm not just hanging it with friends in the fucking basement Playing video games or chilling or drinking or whatever is just always a great time and always lifts his spirits So very important keep your friends close What are some things you've learned from bodybuilding that you will use in fatherhood damn That's a tough one. That is a lot of things on there Something I would just think you about kind of a bodybuilding kind of not thinking about other parents something I want to teach my kid It's just always ask questions and don't ask one word questions like asking positive questions Always be the student I go talking earlier humility. I guess humility is overarching thinking of that But always being willing to ask questions like you know I went on Olympia snap, but I go around and I train people and I'm like really the workout. Why are you doing that like if some I'm like they're like I don't want to overstep until I'm like please give me advice asking questions like always Like training with people like Vernon with GBRS guys He's a a strength training coach. He's more knowledgeable than me So I'm asking questions how can I help my hips? How can I do this and he's like teaching me other things? I'm trying to be a coach. I'm asking all these tips to question and I mean I'm always willing to learn and I want to make sure my challenge is always humble and willing to learn I'd also say a huge thing is just the importance of effort before the result So just knowing that if you are ever going to complain about a result Don't claim to a bit the result, but if you have any remorse about a result You better damn well have worked your ass off and it's hard as you possibly could and if not go back and work harder and then expect hopefully Better result so I feel like I've worked at that very poorly. I'm not the right dish It's down to teach it to my kids better But just in essence focusing more on the effort rather than the result because the things that out of our control and life are as a result But you can always control how hard you work and being better and better every single day Sorry if it's inappropriate, but how did you make your life pregnant and prep? I don't want to answer that question so go ask your father because he might be saying no because he's your father I'm not telling you guys actually on YouTube Best way to maintain discipline and mentality The loaded question best way to maintain discipline. I would say structured routine is something that pops in my mind It's very helpful and this year when I was really struggling at the part where I tore my life and everything and I just have to keep my Discipline to keep locked in I was just okay. Get them and not in the 13 become a robot wake up at the same time every day Do your cardio the same time every day breakfast everything into a complete routine So on those days where you really feel like you don't want to do it or you don't want to fucking cardio You don't want to train you don't want to whatever it doesn't matter because they're just part of your routine You become a robot and just do it without even thinking just run through the days and get get through it as best as you possibly can I think that really helps and honestly is a great trick for any aspect of mental health and anything you're trying to do The more structured and routine you are the better you feel mentally also Having a good support system is really fucking important and I will always push up from the mountain top Treating people around you who are important properly so that day treat you properly and have your back in hard times It's just like such a cheat code for discipline You know if you ever have time for you feel like weaker yourself and you look at someone you love who believes in you Fuck that look at that lifts you up full of fucking motivation and gets you ready to lock it and do what the fucking want So I think that's super important and It's a discipline and mentality that relates to mentality to you know you look at like I said You look at someone who loves you lift your spirits keep you on track and there's a few think more important than that because like I've Talking about brotherhood relationships everything that's like the most important thing in this life is enjoying it with people You love and it's a cheat code to being successful that for damn sure But yeah, I get to the point where I said it rings with the questions and I've answered them all at some point in my life And it's hard for me to keep and it's very nice So I think I'm gonna wrap it up there. I'm a long Yeah, at least 20 minutes. So I feel like it's a good in the video Calvin will be that go long here, but no So thank you guys for watching back back to broadcasting on the floor. I thought it'd be more comfortable here But you back in the gym in a few weeks Thank you guys for watching appreciate you guys six week challenge is coming soon Hope you guys all have a merry Christmas and happy holidays and happy Hanukkah and whatever else you celebrate enjoy

They look like they do in like drawings. It just looks fake. Exactly. It looks great. Oh, yeah. Power for the bull sharks too. Incredible. So one thing we got to get you out of doing is, uh, so after the limpia, when you win again, right? We're going to come in back to Cinger Island, Cinger River, where you got the black tip migration. Yeah. And we're just going to fish it off the beach and just catch sharks, like off the beach. Crashing. Thousands of them swim. That's crazy. So that's fun. Because you just know both. No, she's sick and sad. Exactly. There we go. Yeah. I know. I just want to make some people over here. I'm here. There you go. Jeff, what's that in your legs? Start cranking. He's going to get you fast. You're real fast. Yep. I have a legion. Keep really, keep really. On Jeff, I'm going to. I'm going to get my two feet with the boat. Yeah. Yeah. I like that real. Nice.

All right. Oh my gosh. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go, Jeff. Here we go. If he's going to come around Jeff, we're going to walk around this side right here. You got the glove cord? Yeah. Just lay down the ball right here. Oh yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Wow. That is a nice coat. I got it. Wow. That's a big boy. That is a big boy. You've never got a woman ready to get her.

Always show me how it does. Alright, Chris, this is where I think you got to come right here. Do you just hang it out? I don't want to do this so small. You're right behind him. When you got small eyes, you need a big mouth. I guess so. You're just chilling right now. He's calm right now. Jeff caught a bigger one than Chris. You got to be pretty fast. He did. You did. You go on. You can go on. It's a big one. You're like, oh, cold. You'll snorkele it over. You can't. You kind of drag it in the water and let it go. Hold this way and then just let her swim that way. Hold this way. Hold this way. You pull towards the beach. Yeah. And then head to the back of the water. Oh, he's heavy. Walk it out. Walk it out. You're not walking at all. No, you'll be fine. You're a controller and I want you to walk it out. And then slowly start to pull it. And then get your legs to push. That's a big shark. Yeah, man. That's heavy. Yes. Pull one of those. Great work, man. Jeff, I'm the leave of a moment. I guess that goes down for the record books for your biggest fish. Actually, I think that'll be the record for life. Alright, so that's a wrap on today's fishing. Yeah, I've got over board a few times because I've not built for any kind of motion. But we came back in around Calmerwater and that was the fun part. We got the catch a few sharks. I caught a little one in my dad caught a big ass shark. This is on there at the end. That was really cool. That's something that you can't really explain what they're like. Like I was saying, like, they look like a fake picture. We're so perfectly silver. And you touch it and it's like sand. You get to even run your hand one way and then it's soft the other way. So it's really cool experiencing that. How powerful it's starting there. Just pure muscle and too crazy. So what's the biggest shark around New York? Ooh. David, did you see that? I've got a hammer hand? Four, two hundred pound hammer head? Yeah, four, two hundred pound hammer head. Probably like four of those. I'm a hammer. Five of those. Five of those. That's pretty good. Yeah, it was crazy. We're going to have to come back and do that one. So yeah, we're going to have to go back and do that one. So yeah, we watched. She saw a hammer head this year coming up down the beach followed with her drone. What would you say David? That thing wasn't school bus. Yeah, it was usually 13 feet long. Yeah. Yeah, it's grown when they were, I'll show you the footage. So I'm really full of it. We actually hooked it and then we ended up losing it. Oh, really? Yeah, and then we never saw him again. Oh my god. So yeah, we got to hop the beach. Yeah, that's wild. So we have to catch one over the road. When you come back, man, a hundred percent. Absolutely. Definitely we're going to come back here. Hopefully on the day when the season of low karma, they were bad today. Yeah, they were rough out there. So come back on their commerce. Catch them when we get eaten. So a lot of people might hear your hard work. That's a good question. Something like that. We could get eaten and enjoy it. Probably in the off season too. So it'll be good time. But if you're gathering in Florida, Southern Florida, Black Tip Beach, check them out. Appreciate that. Private tourists, charters, anything you got to need to support for. So make sure to check out their YouTube channel. There are three of them. I'll black tip beach. Oh, thank you for the meeting. Thanks. Have a nice day. Yeah, man. Appreciate it. Take a nice day.

No, not crossfit for lunch, right? I mean, didn't you tell you that you want to switch your head? Yes. I don't know if I'm doing after snowboarding championship and everything else you've been working on. Is that it again starting to skateboarding during the program? There you go. Wrap you in bubble wrap. Can you help him in on you and wrap your whole body in the whole wrap? It's still her muscle. So I know I look like 271 last night after dinner. I'm not gonna be able to do very many of these. I know. I look 268 right now. Well, no. She drank water if I got close to 27. It's still see how you do it. Hey, crossroads. You got something you need to want. I need to use one. I need one. I got three. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Not bad actually. I feel like you were going to do it. I thought you'd do like three. I feel like I was three because. Well, you look like your roles. 271. Well, you are. You said that. Prime director. Because I'm going to have to try to make a topical diuretic for your face. That was my prime director for your. You made it your wife. You made it your wife. But I'm waiting without fucking these going. I think great. My book. My book. I got to run. Rub a little bit of topical fat burn around your face. Yeah. You're okay. Wow. He's 22% body fat. But it's basically like six months out. People love skinny face. You're so lucky. You have another spot. Is your other spot you can do without hitting your head on that thing? That part. Maybe this part right? That won't fit this way right? Is that true? That's true. I know I just pull on the leaf. You can try. It's just the grip. It's really smooth. You're not going to have it on. You can get up my grip string. No. No. Hook grip. It's good. Good. Nice cross, cross, cross. There you go. Good. Much better. Yeah. Archback. Archback. Good. And then we need help to straighten out your leg a little bit when you start eating a little help. You want to. Well, well. Good. Good. And that's how you spun. Well, it's not because normally that's too wide, but because of how wide you are, it actually is probably right where you need to be. So what we'll do is we're going to start doing those on the beginning of your business. Sorry. I honestly didn't think you were able to do that many. Because that just how heavy you are. So the heavy is still. Every time you see me, I've been feeling the lift. You're like, oh, he's the press. Thank you for your help. Or yeah, when you're in other hands. Well, no. I forget that you actually used to be an open body, but there's. There's another. I'm sick of it. I never opened. You had it when you're so hard as an oval, aren't you? I didn't win over all. That was the only one in your fifth place going to pro-card. Just a rotary gives me. I've never been able to do that before. I've never been able to do that before. I've never been able to do that before. You never competed. You know, open? Yeah. No. Until this year. It's a secret. You know, a new boy when you were not here. He was like, three hundred pounds. I just stopped 30 pounds. He did a water. He did a water. No, I don't know. The fact that he texted me and said, I feel like I'm too good of a shape. So I'm going to make sure become a fat paid by the time you get here. I did say that. Did you say that? What's nice? What we'll do is let's do a row. Start getting into that reverse grip. That's stuff that we were working on last year. Try it out. They can up that back a little lat. So let's do a reverse grip then over row. Just make sure. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Control or combat control. Control. Control. Control. Control. Control. Control. Good. Control. That's it. I'm going to just get rid of the other one. That's it. And last year. Good. Good. Control. Good. Good. Good. Control. Control. Yeah. You might go a little bit wider and let's just add a 25-gram. I'm going to go straight into the plate. I was going to do two things. I started leaning forward a little bit further though. Instead of pulling, you're going to do it again. I come here. Pull a little further from my body. Some weaker obviously, but it's better contracting. Yeah. That's okay. So you're just going to make sure you stay up. Especially if it's a heavy weight. Before I was doing that wasn't doing straight legs. And I couldn't do it. I couldn't rope bent over. I didn't have the stability. And I said straight legs and then all of a sudden rolling. You can go away. When did you stop doing straight legs? When I was traveling all that much? Oh, God. Take my purse. You can fall off the roll. Good. And the air is just two. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Four. Five. Four. Four. Five. Done. Good job. Five. Five. Five. Good. But I look back a little tax from yesterday like that. Yeah. Well, normally I wouldn't want you to do that after legs, but because we're going to concentrate on those machines and the, I mean, the, those workouts. It made sense this time. I normally do legs a day before. When we did chest, yeah. But I had just done hand strength. Did it before that? Yeah, it's better to do either chest or shoulders in between. We're about, um, overhand. How do you feel about just keeping it in this weight? And then going into an overhand, I feel better about it. Sure. Okay. Let's do that because I still want to make a couple of my surgery now. I don't know if that's actually, this dream. My butt, my butt, my back, that felt a bigger butt. Oops. Let's go, Christopher. Let's go. Good. Bring the elbows back a little further. I was back a little further. I was back a little further. That's it. Back. Good. Good. Good contraction. Excellent. Much better. Much better. Good. Stretching. Good. Good. Good job. Good job. So when you're going early in the set, you started to bring your elbows out this way. And then the minute you start bringing your elbows in, you can see it when much of the stretcher going on. But I agree. Where are you saying coming fromverted, but you still purposely, for more like trap up her back. Just trying to think that you feel that in. Yeah, but we'll do track enough for back when we do track enough for back. I don't know if we normally, this is easy to track enough. But the rest of my workout, tomorrow, that's okay. I want to pick up those last. Those elbows in. Throw the weight. Throw the weight. Come on, Chris. Come on. That was easy. You're going to ask me, is this back good? You throw it, you throw it. You throw it. Good. Good. You want to walk two more. One more. One more. Get this. You're broken, don't do that. You're fine. Spine. Oh, this bad. Oh, this is broken. I broke my back. What's that mean? I don't know. Can I take some bridges back or something? No. No. No. No. No. No. This is something like that. Get ready. No, it's some of that movie. Long to serve. I think I broke it in my back. This is no one's pulling it. Yeah. Just put that back on. Mostly just all together. Would you been doing on your, because you've been traveling on a ship? I've been traveling recently. Well, I mean, for the last time, you've used your having before that. You've been traveling once. So we're in the back for six weeks. How do you think I'm so fucking jacked or how does it work? This is jacked? Yeah. So I've even just doing all of the upper back with my back. I'm doing mid and upper. Come on in and then I have two days of doing two lap. Really lap focus exercise. Okay. So I've even, always the last time you did when I'm going to my garage. I don't know. I've only two are chest supported. Okay. So let's do that. So that your old bleak stomach again. So. The bleak? See your bleaks? Yeah. But that's, I do that. I either do bent over by the way or that, because the way I pull the very somewhere. Now that's going to be a pull higher for a breath. But that's what I'm saying. I normally do barbell high for upper or dumbbell high for upper. Not low. What? We're going to do both. We're going to do one upper and lower. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good stretch. In pull. Excellent stretch. Pull. Good. Good. Good. Try. Like good. You go ahead. You go ahead. You go ahead. You're actually a lot of look at that. Stronger than you look at. That's usually the goal. I try to walk around looking to see me as possible. Right out here. They make it harder. You can do it. You can do it. Up and hold it. There you go. Come on. Pause it, pause. Good. Just a little longer. Good. You can do that for a bit. Hold. Good. Right there. You can drop that shit on my feet. You go ahead. You go ahead. You go ahead. Good. Good. You can do it. You can do it. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Three. Two. That's it. That's it. Just like it around. Try to do it. Try to do it. That's it. Nah. In that mirror. Oh, it's got to be cool. I'm very too. What do you do? It's himself. And that's. So, imagine now how you've had the problems with hearing? Oh, I thought you're going to say my toxic sarcasm. They're both. Yes. After sure it is, I don't have to ask about that one. For last one. Two. Two. Two. Classic guy. I've been doing this. That's pretty accurate. Yeah. Just a little longer. No. That's not good. That's good. It's not good. It's not good. That's not good. That's not good. It's not good. It's not good. I'll take that. I'll never do that. No, I'll take that. Hold that. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold that. Five seconds. Hold it. Good job. Good. I'll turn my leg from zoom in. You want to throw last friend? Yeah. Is that when you're seven hundred pound dead? Yes. You want to throw last friend? Yeah. Is that when you're seven hundred pound dead? Yes. You're a drug. It's something that I think is a mouth. You can. That's always. When you get the sign by dice, yeah. I knew you were going to say something like that. I had to. Because it's like there's going to be like a lead in somewhere. There's going to be a shitty joke somewhere. Mine are less shit. Maybe so, but less shit. You've got 20 cents. Okay. Let me ask you this. I'm going to override your shit. What's that? Well, we got an out of builder. We do a lot of, let's put an out of cold down. And then maybe we'll put any drop with a straight farm pull down to have to get her in. Or an F.S.E. seven, straight up, pull down there. Pull down a pull over. Hold over. Hold down. Pull over. Why do you pull over on the chance? I'll pull down. That's great. No, straight on pull down this. I'll pull over. Hold over. Hold over. Tom at the low, if the pull down or pull over. Take Chris is ready to pull over. Chris is always right. True. Come on. You see I got swinging at the very end. What's your last thing? You can take your nerve. Just like that. That's how you pull all the way through. The very unique high row. Is that how you pull in like this? I think I would hear and feel so much better. Yeah, and also the best thing about it is that with the pedonic of Indian actually there's change up the angle slightly. So just changing a little bit of that supination of the wrist can cause a lot better if you track it. Good. Good eight eight good. One. Cool Chris. Good two. Arch arch. Great. Good. Cool. Good. Cool. Yes. Cool. Yes. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Yes. Cool. Cool. Cool. Yes. Cool. Arch arch arch. Good. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Let's keep the weight the same. Let's change up the angle. What I want to do is you're going to feel a little bit of a variation. Can it feel for that? Feel a difference in your position? Yeah. Yes. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. There we go. Good. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Excellent. Keep going. Keep going. Good. Good. Good. It's like you're on stage. So I can demonstrate your pressure straight. Cool. That's it. Two more. One more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Two more. One more. That's it. Good. Don't doubt. Probably a good one. It's all about the curve. Good. Good. Good. Just get it about three more. Last one. One. Nice stretch. Good. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. You ready to wait? Yeah? No. Come on. Put in this shit. You're special, fine. Oh, it's... come on. Good. Stretch. Stretch. Stretch. Okay. Three. Three. Three. One. You going to keep on going. Good. Good. Stretch it forward. Good. Go away. Go away. Go away. Go. Okay, when you go up, march her back a little. Keep your chest down, but arch her back. Look at that. Go back to your mouth. Go back to your mouth. Go back to your mouth. Go back to your mouth. Go back to your mouth. Cool. So what that means is, as you're coming here, pull, and then when you're going here stretch, but make sure you get your chest up a little bit and stretch. You're still going to arch my mouth with hopefully much. I just want you to arch her back. But don't let your chest go. Don't link me up too high. Good piece. Lift weight is all I know. I take high kick up. I put down. Now he's losing his brain cells on top of his hearing. Is that mold? I don't get a better tooth. I actually probably argue better. I should have some serious brain fuck for what. I mean, you were literally like, had such a histamine reaction that you were just constantly like, nose was all fled to eyes were watery. You travel, you get better, you go home and you're like, oh my god. No, it sounds a lot better. Take your body. Publish your sleep, pubbery. That's good. Good. Good job with you in your back arch. Good. Good. Keep arching. Good. Good job. Good job. One more second. Good job. There you go. That's the stretch. Stretch. Stretch. That's the big back on stage. Let's go. Big back on stage. Let's go. Good. Two, two, two. Stretch. One more. Two people. Good job. Excellent. Let's see some hypers. Get the lower back first. I love back like, pump full of blood. You're like, let's work on the lower back. We're going to just go to do the hypers, brother. Do about three sets of hypers, both of the hypers. Finish that off. How's it feel? Good. Good. You know I do a lower back yesterday on my hands. You're doing it. That's what I was just doing. So would you have a... I personally mentioned girls on it. Okay, we're looking around. Come on, Kevin. Good. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. I need like a six-edron pound deadless for the lumpy. I need it. I'll boost my ego. I kick up, I could die. I'll need to throw a little. I kick up, I put down. That's it. How's it feel? Did you kick it out? No. Just a little back. It's going to be pumped. What? It's going to be pumped. It's like knowing your spine's really over arch-orthkranific. Yeah, she's good at it. Stretch it a little bit and it's just not meant to be stretched. Stretch it a little. Stretch it a little. You got to take it. That's it. Stretch it a little. Stretch it a little. I just mixed some fucking intro with protein. I don't know who did it, but someone mixed it on flavored intro with flavored intro. And then I'm drinking like lemon lime cookies and cream protein. That's fucking disgusting. That's not good at all. Why don't you make some new one? It's a lot of good. It wasn't like five seconds ago. I didn't want to waste it. It's disgusting. I don't like it when the company I can just get on the track. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I want to try this. I tried it and it wasn't good. And now I'm just getting the dark of the need it. It looks like sewage. Because you're cream. Because you're cream lemon lime. Why do you like it? Yeah, I'll try it. Okay. For you or me? Me? My battery's flashing. So you got to know. Three, two, one, go. Battery's flashing? Yeah. Okay. So he's toast. No, no, I thought you was floating on you. So he's going, I'll go. You can go. All right, guys. Got to end day three. We just got done doing an amazing back workout because we were able to get in mind muscle connection because it's all about time and attention in mind muscle connection and not just growing around heavy stupid way. So you got to be really well. It's going to be really smart about your training. How do you feel? Good. Form and then in terms of being. That's right. Perfect form then you can add to the. Yeah, then you can add away as you're able to get stronger instead of just trying to do it all backwards. You go heavy. Your form swallowing apart. You're getting more likely to get hurt and you're not going to be able to grow. So all you're trying to do now is assess or crisis that for this prep. And I think we need a really good job because you're in a good spot. Yeah, I feel good. A lot stronger and bigger than I have lived last year when in the prep. This is a good point. You came down about 16 we said last year. Yep. We started working. We've been working with it. Yeah, for 16. So much better than last year. Yeah. Your heavier, your leaner, your stronger. And I feel like it's a really good starting point. Yeah. Really rock our own. Yeah. So now it's not. What's that? Next up. Now it's about the max bed list because Calvin says it's about not. I just need a 600 pound. So we're looking for a new video. We're looking for a new video for Calvin's going to be injured reserve. We're actually killing him. But that's a wrap on this three-part series. Thank you guys for tuning in. We're going to be heading to Dallas in X amount of time that I will tell you. So no one finds me there. It will be there eventually for some more training sessions. So we'll get a few more H-Dub time C-Bum workout coming in. But yeah, that's what's going on. So you'll definitely get through watching. Catch you later.

So I hope you guys like the video and enjoy. What is up YouTube? Welcome to Morning Workouts with Sneybum. I've been working out at 8 in the morning lately, approximately for not. Not early, I don't know how people train at 6am, I couldn't do it. It's not that 7pm, it's trying to get here by 8pm. I train fasted, for the Dujis have a coffee, the Dash of Almond Milk, and some MTT oil, a little bit of fast, so I guess not really fasted. But I found what I was working all day and out that the warehouse lately or whatever. I've come home and we move to the warehouse pretty far away, so it's like 45 minutes drive to the gym. In fact, with the AirTool 5PM, the drove here got here by like 6pm, 30 whatever. I'd be miserably tired and didn't want to work out. So I tried to switch up my routine during the morning and I've been doing it for like 2 weeks and actually it feels pretty good, I'm not gonna lie. I had to pick up this weekend with my amy and ruin my schedule, but I'm getting back on if I tried it, so yeah, try it out for a little bit, see how it goes. It feels better than after work right now. But if it starts to get inhibited my strength or intensity, as I'm getting stronger because I'm fasted in the morning, I'll probably switch it up right now, feels good. So back day, in the morning, it's all that's going on. Alright, only due to work excess, right now on starting stuff, I'll make you one light thing at the end with more than that. But two working sets, and move on, turn on really squeeze, have good form, and come up back here together. So, I think we'll do some bent over rows, and then make up the work out as we go from here. Well, due to need reverse grip rows, it's really important to have the perfect width. If you're too narrow, your elbows are going to flare out, and if you're too wide, you're going to fuck up your elbows to keep you kind of pace with a little bit of water, so your elbows can come completely behind you. You want to drop your shoulders forward, like, put your track them, and then retract them all the way back, and have this huge, like, range of motion here. So, you've got to make sure your hands, elbows are getting in the way they're perfectly driving back. You've got to find the right spot, but I see a lot of people going really narrow for these and then their elbows are flaring out instead of back. In order to try and keep your elbows close to your body, plus higher that shit back. Who's that? Look at that. Hook grip. This? This? What this? Nice little. That new merch though. This is a 4P 2.0 shirt. We did a shirt similar. It's 3 straight plastic. Added a 4th gold one. I don't know if you want to call them Tiger Scratches. Mustard. One might say mustard. One might say it's a few linoes. Have to donate my hand. You never know. You never know. You should have wear it. What? Hold those on the right side of your body. What could I wear? It's a small bra. Tiny waist doesn't matter. It's a bra. The belts are also dropping next week. I forgot. I have been the biggest mission to get. So, I was adamant on getting this style. Ableather. Actually, good shit. Pick ones in the fin ones. They're like, fucking tornadoes or earthquakes or something. Or it's happening. It took us like nine months to get these belts. But they're finally here. They're dropping next Friday. The states usually have a bodybuilding one where it's like getting narrow. And then a more powerlifting style one. Like this. I wear both. But it's going to go a little bit more supportive for roses, blocks and shit. So, proctinists. Do you wield? Oh, I feel like I had a training in the morning sometimes. Yeah, Chuck, like three liters of water before coming here. I don't have to piss real quick. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Alright. To do a pull down, progristicic blow-row. Now I'm doing a higher elbow-sflared row. This is kind of mid-trap, rear-del combo. Somewhere my upper back. But I'm just trying to hit him all right now. I'm going to love this machine right here. Here's the thing on these. If you have long ass arm, you have to make sure the machine is like push back your muscles. It should be really hard to reach and start the first rep. But when you get going and actually let you have a 4-inch motion, a lot of people like are too long for the machine and the like click. Then the like the way it will touch the bottom and then the lower the range of motion. Top that and then you're missing part of the rep. So make it long. Trust that shit out. You'll be skinny bitch. What are these days? You want to use videos? Probably like that. I moved that early morning, worked at a hardcore grind and I'm finished my first head, passed it on the ground. I played light at the foot, drink your water chips, I enjoyed it. Alright, we just have chest supported neutral grip. Roll with that. Typically you guys see me do this over hand, bro. But I just did that over there on the right machine. So I'm going to do more of a low, rat, low rat, low, lat, bro. Can you make your neutral? Try to pull backwards. Help us up. Get your chin. Get of your chin. Fuck how bad you are. ric slippers. Okay, let's rub your legs, alright? Let's have a drink. Can you hear them going? Pepa. Alright, I'm finishing off the back day with some pullovers. I keep thinking I need to be more volume, but like you guys saw that last chest edge it was barn. First of all, sorry for being so weak, that was very big. But my chest is still sore, it's fucking. I was like, three, four days ago or something, and I feel like I got fucking like, be with the batter with the chest. So, it's probably not optimal right now. But I'm just trying to push chest. No more training like a little bit. I'm still pushing, weight, tracking my weight, trying to get stronger every single week. I remember I'm like, shit, I'm kind of picking one lift for thing, like yesterday. At a shoulder press, 100 pound dumbbells, for 12 reps or two sets. Next week, I'm going to go to 105 or 110, try and beat up. If you'd like to have three single legs, four legs, four plates, I'm going to edit it for 14 reps and then we try and do it for like 18, and then we try to do it for like a little bit. So, just slowly increasing my strength over time, trying to get bigger again. We're going to be in Texas in a week, for going to be in Dallas, and Connie's going to fucking gross me. I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad he's not there. Because, how do you, which would be laughing at the entire time? Especially now that he's fucking miserable, and he has, you know, you see any real stick, but it is what it is. So, wrap up this workout, we're going to do a photo shoot at a school. A little mental mental mental mental, so, we'll be fine. Maybe I'll try and seal Calvin's camera and fill some beef. Yes, or something? And you guys will see a real glad coming out of that, because that's Mr. Calvin, in Zach and Grant's job, make raw, exciting, fun, beautiful brand. So, stay tuned. Alright, it's a wrap on today's back workout. That's K-shirt, spelt, slung sleeve, and a jacket, dropping next Friday. Every 24-something thing. Falls even finished this, we're going to be posting up and dropping for straight-tune for that. But for now, we got to get home each hour. We get the fuck out of here because we're slow and moving. I'm slow moving in the morning. We're going to head over the office, to work done, and then I'll show you guys some BTS of the Photoshop for doing it in the school. And now, there's a really cool concept that guys came up with. Tell them to come up with, so, show you some of that. I'll see you guys later. Ready for your acting debut? No, I'm already off. We're going to have to start speaking. I don't like being a fan of crowds. I'm only used to what I'm in my underwear. But we have to speak. It's capable. We're just... So just have to really talk to people here. I'm really just not talking about it. You know what? To grant you all the other ways. Chase, can you move that? Nadlight in a little more on this side? Yeah. Where you want to go? I'm going like this. Staying over that. Yeah, I'm staying all the way back here. And... You know... I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous. I know it's a lot to laugh. I'm going to laugh. Alright, what's going on in class? Today, I'm going to be teaching guys how to be a badge. The formula consists of one student, four feet, one full pump RTV, and ten pills of your group of VVs. And the pills... ...to take your go from any bitch to a badge. Perfect. Kevin, talk to him a few seconds over. What? A good? I think everyone's getting kind of comfortable now. So now we just got to... ...make it a little bit more extra cringe. What do you think? Yeah. Extra cringe? I think extra cringe. Yeah. We're going to go extra cringe. So this is how you build your acting like portfolio here. Here at Raw, we do everything. We clean the rooms and we do acting. So... That's how it is. It's built. Alright. And then you just have to walk this way. The same way that you're walking. There you go. Go. Kevin. Kevin. Kevin. Good. Good. Good. Good. Shut up. You're not in the mood. Get out of here. Bye-bye. Alright. So, that's a wrap on the day folks. A little behind the scenes about it takes a... ...put together when it's all adds that you see. The Calvin and the team put together. A little fun. Well over that's me, we're gonna start acting Chris. My answer is, fuck no. If you saw any of that, now you know why? I'm awkward and I hate it and I can just, I just practice just not in my blood. I mean, I can be on the stage but not talking and not like having a script but just, I can't do it. Not for me. So you will not be seeing me on the big screen. Unless I have like a salmon roll or I can't shot in the head and I'd die really quick. Probably else you can have a fat. I mean, this go home, go to the bad. Be able to sing but working out in the morning like I told you I could go home now and relax. So you're hanging with the prop, poppy, and corneve. And have a good Friday night. So you get to watch him. See you in the next one.

=== FILE: FULL CHEST DAY AT BUM LIFTING CLUB [iwe3DVRm1_8].txt ===

One thing I didn't realize how fucking thick my hair is until I traded a gym with no AC My fucking just chrome dome and go bald this year I'm a mustache and bald look like a fucking cereal cover from the 1940s of shit Come on come on Chris Serious Watch this up Youtube to looking up to the yelling here. That's okay because we are in the bomb lifting clock. I don't know if that's what I'm gonna call it but it sounds a bit right but the gym done. So like I told you guys in the last video I had a bit of a rastart of prep but it's okay we got a prime of gym now making up for it but I've been training here alone for the last 10 week I guess a week and it's been fucking beautiful obviously having no one about it or you just like chillin, both of the work coming in here and training is taught it's a clock. That's why it's so loud to recover to big ass stands literally the bread big ass stands. Greatest name ever made. Well yeah the crib right here so the rest of my prep you're gonna see you see in a lot of this place mainly where I'm gonna be training and join it and fucking shoot up here so we're gonna be hit to chest today trying out some of the pieces here chest wall the one thing that we're actually replacing both of the pieces that we have right now so three of them that we have of like four are being over placed not optimal but it is what it is we built it really quick so not everything came in in time. Yeah gonna be fucking up a chest workout today hopefully good work out and rest of the prep is gonna be beautiful in our private little spot so stay tuned trying out new machines trying to close grip cable press everything is before so it's probably gonna be a lot of fine tuning but here's what's here one thing I didn't realize how fucking thick my hair is until I traded a gym with no AC my fucking just chrome dome and built ball to see you have a mustache and ball and look like a fucking cereal club from the 1940s of shit one of the things where if you have an injury or pain somewhere like my shoulder you can set the cable up select the perfect range of motion that you need it to be elbows in the perfect condition and it's not a fly press so it's just like a machine but it's constantly tension because of the cable pulling you from the way behind you well honestly it's like better than most press you can do you just can't do it much of a low-up but it's an injury that's really good cable press try to out by ball to you recently just push a little more ball to you keep my body healthy kind of push a little bit more calories too but it's also just kind of getting that a drag can keep fucking smith machine's body like six plates my knees are just getting too beat up and I want to be a walk when I'm older so I've been uping my wrap range that used to be like eight to ten or six to ten even I've been trying to do like a good 12 to 15 for most makeshift and it's been feel pretty good I definitely get better pumps but it's a lot more of a mental gain now trying to keep a really like constant state of tension and time and tension rather than just like pushing some weight mentally I just like stay in it a little long because the set longer is actually at the focus more so it's a nice little change and challenge I still love heavyweight but I'm gonna find my balance right between number of tension heavyweight a little more volume this year as you would have done oh okay a lot I thought I was gonna get 12 I got 11 drop the weight I'll go for 14 next set I'm getting 14 so we're doing a drop set something about fucking hundreds of regularity gives you like the craziest pump but I can never get over like 12 wraps I just have too much blood in the mouth kind of a good problem to have okay I do it in slow and thin. all right these two chest pieces right here are like my favorite style of fly to do I have really long arms so when I do a pecdec it's hard to take out my shoulders and my biceps and my forearms at a movement these force you push from your elbow which is supposed to be doing with the pecdec we're using the elbows in across your body these little four stitches to the rollers around them I definitely don't need a flat or a 10 degree and a 45 degree or 30 degrees but I like the machines look fucking why not have two so we're gonna be doing this in a two way you can do you can have a cross your arms alternating or you can like really push your hands forward and in squeeze so it's almost like a full press fly but they feel amazing great contractions so I'm gonna be doing the decline one today three sets and yeah we found these in some of the basements so whoever is basing it was thank you so figure it out the way so I know next week can Texas honey's gonna be like, collect your chest. Flex this pack. Squeeze it harder, hold it. And I'm gonna be like, really honey. I'm just super pairing myself for his antics. Another week of fucking bantering, talking shit to the fucking old man Yoda. Oh yeah. But she just keeps tension on your packs and feels very nervous. You guys know me, I am not a big fan of decline presses. Again, because my fucking troll is in fucked up for three years. But this machine, I tried it. I remember where I tried it. Some of them were before I tried it and they were alive. Got it. But the neutral grip in the angle, that can really squeeze that like tech minor underneath by like lower tech in here. Squeeze that and it's gonna be my shoulder. So it's one of my favorites. This and I can actually do body weight dips now. Like getting in a nice deep corner really helps you get that tech minor like pop your chest up a little bit. So nice to throw in on a chest step. Clown. Translate. authored. Translate. Check that. This is the hospital. No one just touched me. Alright normally we probably do pectick right now with my last chest excite and do a little tricep taster but I'm not gonna lie it's not really like this pectick so I'm gonna do the flat one of these and I'm only gonna do like one side and do Calvin's favorite little stretch cause I'm gonna keep it light that felt decently light you do like eight to ten stretch failures or eight to ten stretch holes like you're to get without being failure stretch and then go to failure so I've never done it on this machine I don't know what we'll need to do but we're just gonna give it a shot and I'm just blasting out pecs for the year for the last exercise so doesn't really matter just trying to fucking me that whatever juice I got left so do it a little bit too late I think I got like fifteen on that last rep but I felt good now onto a little bit of chiceps me coming right I could have teetuck in my cup this year but telling I'm really gonna have to now because this wind is loud it's fuck or big ass fan loud it's fuck but I'm doing some triceps probably some cables in some dips to hit a little bit more chasped with some dips and then we're gonna get the fuck out of here so that's gonna be it alright kids gonna be around on today's workout vlog you may know at the bum listing club this is gonna be your chiller my chiller it's fucking high for the world nothing you're ready done done by prep probably but I'm gonna bring like a couch maybe or like a love sack big big bag and set stuff like a chill spot so what I want to be alone I can come here and how do I want to be alone having that and then work out there and then I'll get a fridge like have cleaned there you are fucking have clean shakers cold water fresh protein shakes and all the good supplements so yeah that's the wrap on today's chiceps chiceps wrapped up with some symptoms and dips had a pretty good workout like I was saying you're really good chest pumps for pumps in general when it's hot so enjoying the heat you also feel a little bit weaker but given to take you to it to a lot better I might make these two away better and you're joining us so yeah stop randomly putting down some protein chuck a lot of peanut butter very delicious I've been fucking enjoying this and the maple waffle my oats and the morning because these are the only sweet things that I get through today but still very enjoyable so yeah thank you guys for watching next video is going to be in Delas tixas with Mr. Juanne Rombad yeah well you're shaking like crazy bro you're shaking that was the chair okay I'm here flourish well I'm talking to one alright yeah wrap this up see you later if you get to watching love you guys see you in the next one

It's heavier than my mind. No, no, no. If you're strong, you can keep that down. You understand physics? I'll do it. Yes. Something lazy. He's off to a great start. Yeah. It's been a short. He's trying to get it all out the first day. This is like the combines. I'm going to put double your body. We don't have to play to walk forward with your hands. You want me to just put it on his nose? He's just doing whatever he can. So I'll sit on his shoulders. I don't want that. You know what I mean? I already know the thumbnail this. What? I'm firing. I'm firing. Dude, on his quitting. He's going to put it. I'm dropping. I dropped on like a wet towel. I'm dropping. I dropped on like a wet towel. I'm going to put more like this. Well, it's easy to keep a higher. You're not pushing down. I'm not pushing too. Yeah. The more upright you are, the more it's going to want to kill you back. You're going to have to come down a little bit. Push it out. Lower it a little bit. You can. Bring it down. You keep telling me to bring my head to fire. Yeah. But I'm fighting gravity so much. If I do this I'm going to fall. If you feel like your break-ups, it's going to pull you back. Then bring down the handles by one. For two. Good. Good. Good. Just one. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's it. You're going to let the shots. Yeah. It's just super soft. How has it feel like you've been doing dumbbell incline more? Or you've been doing flat? I don't know what I'm doing. What's that? I don't really do it quite. Floss stuff. Just hurt some of my shoulder. I feel a little bit. Okay. So let's start with flat and do some really light. And then work all the way up. I feel a little bit heavy. So just so you can just kind of get used to that when you're most of it. And then we'll go that and stuff like that. I'm like flat hurts my shoulder. Okay, let's start with flat. Yeah. I think you can have a rocker now. No, you have that for the two. Put it over the higher edges. You said you could go up? No, no. I want you to do it. I want you to use something similar way. Or maybe even just a little bit lighter. I want you to look at a stretch and just be able to do a pressing and your pet palms facing. So going to do a missed start with that. I've added you a minute to something heavy. Normal and go down to that. No, I want you to do it now and then go into the head and stuff. Just give you a little more strength. Just do it eight to a hundred pounds. And then just really go with that extra stretch. Bring it down to a little bit. Just keep it eight to a hundred pounds. Don't go ahead. Go ahead. I've got a short suit. Okay. You're okay? Yeah. Just down to the press. And normally they hurt. Okay. Let's do it. I heard it to the other. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Do good. Good, good, good. Good, good, good. Good? Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. That table asta. That it is for the first time. Who ever says no to you? Every thing I ever ask him the first thing out of his mouth is no. Every time no matter what. Yeah, but then he eventually doesn't. Not always. I surround myself with people who say no. All day at home, whatever Cody says goes. People think it's the other way, but. No. All right. Let's go. Time to work. Time to work. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Give it up. Why? You. Come on, come on. Come on. Go on in till he's sure he's done. Oh, he seems so surprised today. Well controlled means Shengang. It looks done well here but not yet. Yeah, yes is is that all in it? Here yeah no no. Intely caps me too. Every year I get to do the 150s for like, then it's well, and that's it. Does like, you know, like the four minute mile. Is it a bit hot there? I bet I'll do it. Then you have the 170s at your gym. Yeah, I'm gonna get this. Just probably won't say that. Probably not as good. That idea. I would more have in them for rows, but. Let's go. Let's go. Get onto my piece of glass. Beware. You feel like you're a little narrow? A little wider? You're like in my hand, but it's like getting more like... ...text, stretch and contractualness. You're trying to get a lot of tries. Do you try something like that, you want to learn? No. I'll shoot a little more of my text. Bring your own. I just get less of your ways.

But it's okay. Three hours of sleeping. We did okay. We're not training. Oh, I should get there and deal with you. Yeah. Poor guy. We got legs tomorrow. So yeah. I certainly need some sleep. That's right. Let's go do it.

=== FILE: FULL DAY OF EATING 1 WEEK OUT MR. OLYMPIA [329QPlGL4zM].txt ===

I'm going to turn it on. The water is up. You two, we're just under two weeks out and time for another full day of evening. I really haven't changed much but you guys still like it. So I figured I would do it. My weight is under 250 right now so we're going to get spot. I have to make 242 way in the winter in the morning now so I've very comfortable. I'm going to make weight. It's been a good. So I actually had a few high carb days recently. Nothing crazy or a render out 300 grams of carbs just to like now allow my body to drop too fast and kind of consume this up which is something I've never done in the past. So it's allowed me to be a little fuller. I've been at work at 3 now and hopefully I just have a more like full dance look on stage. But regardless, I just finished 45 minutes of cardio. I'm still going to do 45 minutes of cardio. The morning and then I do like a 20 or 30 minute leg walk at night. I'm going to need for a digestion and for me a lot of night, right after I'm even shower and I have to do so I'll get up to 10 to 5 am and make some of the drum laying in up. I'm hungry. So breakfast is still making the pancakes. I have some random tricks I do in the last YouTube video. I did some a told me to put the plate in the microwave. I'll pour it in the pancakes on it because it's hot and hot pancakes on it are the same temperature and it doesn't create condensation and make it like wet. And it also keeps the pancakes actually warm. So I put this in the microwave for like 30 seconds and when it gets closer I put it in for another 30 seconds. And I put it on a hot plate. But the next breakfast pancakes is down to one single whole egg. So fats are getting pretty low now today. I don't know how to do it. I don't think it's going to sound a change for any of them. But I do one whole egg and that is you 250 grams of egg whites. Which is great because you'll follow you in little 10 calories. Next we have oats 70 and I don't remember where I have that last time but my breakfast has changed a lot since it's a medic breaking my class. But at the 70 grams of oats and in here I add this fiber corny add some fiber and it's kind of helped by the digestion. And I think it adds a little bit to the fluffiness. So I think it's also thrown as cruba GI from Revive. This stuff actually works very well. I was actually shocked that my stomach wasn't. Not doing bad with my dishes. I put two scoops of this into my diet a day. And I like what to do about it the next day. I'm going to put some weight better. So I'll super pump with that. And then pumpkin. This is a very secret pancakes. I'm running kind of low here. But I do like 50 grams of pumpkin. And the just allows them to stay like moist and softer to dry. And I'm going to add this to the bottom of this. Thank you. I'm going to do it. And it's like purely fiber. There's like no calorie. It's just so nice little active. And the protein. The go protein for the maple waffle it. The protein is like probably on my favorite flavor. So it's been so good for pancakes. Because it gives a little bit of flavor like gifts and maple in there. And then I'll get maple syrup. So I do scoop some scoops of quarter of that. Finally, the secret to a tasting really fucking good is that you can shit time of cinnamon. I use to put it in the pancakes. And now I'd literally just hit it like a lot. And there you have it. And then you have to be in some new pancakes. And I throw a salt into the down to the point now. We're on the one side of the track. And I'm going to show you my meaning of the day. I literally have this fucking track scale off Amazon. And I have to wait my salt. And so I'm like a drug dealer. I just put it in the push-up. Chris, the longest drink. Oh, you can't even tell that. All right, yeah, that's it. And then I had three seconds worth of water. One. Three seconds. Three. I'm going to water. Oh, the most. Easy other time. I don't know. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Oh, shit. But yeah, that's my breakfast. So I'm going to blend the shit out of this. The pans are already on because they need to be hot when you put the pancakes on. Otherwise they get like too dry. I wanted like hot. Put them really quick and offer this book. And yeah, so I'm going to cook these up. Three of those final product. And I'll give you guys a calorie check. All right, we're on low battery. So we're going to do this quick. This is a final product. It looks like absolute shit. But to be fair, all the crispy bits that kind of get stuck on the pan. I scraped them off at the end. I'm putting them in the top and they taste amazing. And it tastes really good. So I don't really care. But total calories for breakfast is 653 calories. It's still pretty hefty breakfast for prep. That big is meal a day by far. About 65 grams of protein. So a beautiful way to break your fast and a lot of volume. I actually got a lot of cake set at this. You can see pretty hefty amount of there. It's a little bit thinner than I normally did. I put a little bit more water to that last May 3 second count. But maybe it'll pass to my benefit and I'll feel like I've eaten more. But yeah, let's breakfast. So thank you guys for sharing food. I'm going to eat. Watch some jujurutu kaizen. Let's see if we're meal two. All right. So meal, new marauders. I typically take this with breakfast by dinner today. To take one of these every day to some digestive enzymes and some stuff to help. I just carbs. It's in some activity and whatnot. It's kind of mild to only take one a day. You might even want to charge right now. So that's also taking care of the skin. And this got help from her body as well. I've been obsessing over the digestion this year. And it's been helping because it helps me so much getting through. I haven't like horrible gas. Helps corny sleep on May 2 and not shitty my pants and gas changing the entire room. So a lot better this year. My stomach feels a lot better. It's tough. It's lighter. Maybe a lot of smaller waste. You don't know. But the zinchearts and also helps me with acid reflux. But it helps your gut lining. And I get really bad acid reflux when I get really low calorie. So check it out. But onto meal number two. This is 180 grams of white rice. I'm going to put in 20 grams of fresh ethylene, a cod and some asparagus. I up my protein from all my meals from 200 fish typically in 180 grams of chicken. Wait, not protein. Now up to the beach 20 grams. Just because honey was like, you know, your weight's coming down. Let's put in a little more calories. So make a more protein. You can add a little more protein because it's not that high. So this is like the high food protein that's ever been. And honestly, kind of nice. So hopefully it pays off in the end. And it helps me say a little bit longer. But that's when I put your gut meal. And then put this down. And if you have the calories, it's 425 calories, about 43 grams of protein. So simple, like easy pre-workout. And you have some hamstrings after this. And see you guys for meal number. Shake. What? That was going to say meal number three, but protein check. 10 minutes. All right. Welcome back to the world's most boring full day of eating. Ever. I had a shake after the workout when I was driving home quick, just two scoop of protein and another scoop of fiber. I used to always make a creamy beginning of pre-prep and in previous pre-prep, so it's a blend in my neutral bullet. Like as much ice and water in protein like in it would like fluff up and drink in it. It's super bloated, make me full. I kind of curled my appetite a little bit. But it was kind of fucking my digestion being that like bloated. And I didn't like the concept this year. My waist feeling like full. I'm really trying to like vacuum a lot. I'm in my abs and shrink my waist this year. It's been one of my huge goals. So I haven't been doing that. I just had either make a piece where I put a little bit of water and I mix up the protein or today I just mix it with like eight ounces and strength like a normal human being. So the head that then we came home and I threw together a nice little chicken race and it'sparagus. Probably the most staple prep meal that you could imagine. It's 200 grams of chicken breast. Again, you'd be 180 up to 200. A random amount of asparagus and every too much and then 150 grams of weight. And some pink himaline salt. Let's throw it a little bit of honey mustard on this one. This would go honey mustard from Whole Foods. It's also the lowest calorie from five calories. So I eat a little bit without it. I love it on the end. So I'm only going to like ten, ten calories. So I'm going to have a honey mustard. And yeah, that's about it. Neal number four. And then the beautiful thing about training at one o'clock is I train for like three hours of a shake. I eat this at like four, 30 and then for the rest of the day, I get to eat every like two hours, hour and a half and then the days over. So it's just a easy way for me to like manage my meals and not feel 200 through a day. So I need this and enjoy it. And see you guys for a meal in a more. Thank you. All right, so we are on to the very exciting meal number four. Fish and rice. This time I stir-fry it up with a little bit of coconut amino. The best season ever. And then I put a little bit of lemon on it. Lemon on fish and prep is beautiful. It's the season here and it's the seed soup. And then I sell the shit of it and I also added some zucchini in there. The zucchini is probably like the easiest digestible of those calories. Vegetable. Lots of seeds in there, but it also tastes great. So dump in this in here and enjoying some fish and rice. So I'll try and eat the seeds in here. I think you're eating corn. We're talking about like how crazy you go in prep and the little things that like, I just so like we're done in and make you want just like anything. Like I, we mean corn you love to snack. She's a big a chip. She brings it. She'll have like it in the last or like a month or a day depending on the summer. And then you snack and I just looked at her and I was like, What I would do right now just to have like three chips. You know, just like a little bit of a snack. Something a little bit extra and a little bit of fat in my diet. Anything shit a chicken sausage for breakfast and I was like that looks like the best things ever see in my life. Just like little bit of grease soaking out of it and it looked absolutely amazing. The only fat I have in a day right now is sometimes I get salmon. During lucky I get it tonight and then one bowl of it in the morning so I just like craved that. And I just want to snack because I'm sick of eating rice surprise was a fork. I want some of my hands like a sandwich. Oh yeah, this life, you know, it is what it is. So only a couple more days of this not even weeks left. So it's getting down to it. I'm going to enjoy this meal. This is a low calorie one. This one's only 386 calories. 45 pounds of protein sets. I don't know how accurate this is but you guys like to know my croes. I don't know how to go to the market. Typically don't go by this. I just know what I eat every day. The same foods every day and I reduce by such. So yeah, I'm going to eat it for me number five. Eat it more boring than this. Yeah, ready. Alright, I'm going to the board. Alright, one of the boring meal gets more and more boring as a day goes on. I got 200 grams of chicken breast and it's berries. So, very delicious. This is approximately 240 calories for a meal. So I'm going to get a little bit sad. But I got my sparges. I'm freshly cooked chicken to grill a bit more. Except fish in this meal. But fish on its own is just not as good. So I'm pushing my rice down and I'm chicken vegetables. Yeah, I don't really know the fuck else I can say about you. I've experienced and chicken other than having a shit in it. So, you know what I eat this? Kill a little bit more time. You know this is my meal and we'll wrap it up for the final meal of the day in a bit. Alright, so here we are. But nine 45 PM about the last meal. And as I said, the less and less six sevens of day goes on. But this one's actually really good today. Like I said, I've been like creating fats. Your salmon is just so good when you start with salmon. Cove and salt. Looks like fresh jasmine rice. Nothing on it. Absolutely one of my favorite meals. But this is the last meal of the day. It's just 200 grams of salmon. How veggies and shit with it? But how veggies all day? So, I don't have my night. Let's just eat this and then I go right back afterwards. So, we're going to wrap it up here. And the total calorie count. I don't know how I hear this shit ever is, but because I always want to know, 2,689 calories. So, still right around 2700 calories. 200 grams of carbs, 1809. 42 grams of fat and 351 grams of protein. My protein is a little bit higher from the last time I did this. Carbs are a little bit lower. Let's just kind of something that we swapped up here at the end. And this is the first prep where I have ever eaten over 2500. Probably over 2,000 calories at the end of prep. So, for whatever reason, decent offseason just good sleep, good rest. Less stressed to the disturbably getting of this prep that I liked locked in everything at the end. My body just came back to life. My thyroid's working. My metabolism is working. I don't really know. But I'm just counting my lucky star. I think I'm grateful that I meant to eat more than I really have eaten. The past you see. It's almost like a rate of passage in my suffering at the end of some prep. We're eating like 1500 calories into the cardio. Here I am doing like 45 minutes. It needs 27 grams of super-grateful fat just to join that. But we are getting close and I still have to make a little bit of weight that I got to cut off. So we're going to serve suffering probably a little bit more. But only for like 5 or 6 days, I'm not so too bad. And the carb level will begin. So that's going to be it for today's full day of eating. Thank you for watching. I'm going to enjoy my salmon. I'm going to go to bed. And I will see you guys for a exciting video on Friday. I'm going to be training with a little towel mine. So see you guys there.

=== FILE: FULL DAY OF EATING IN THE OFF-SEASON [bJs21dRmkLo].txt ===

Come on, come on Chris. Come on, you're still 14. Come on, you're still 14. What is up YouTube? Welcome to a full day of eating that I said. I was going to do weeks ago and I never did biopology, since here apologies, but here we are. But this is probably the last week of my offseason, I'm coming down this weekend and we're going to go over the digital beginning of prep. So I'm honestly not even eating it, my peak food right now. I've weighed myself last night late at night. I have 269 pounds and that's just two heavy from me. I'm not 264 in the morning is 265, I can't remember exactly. But I'm not trying to be heavier than that. So I haven't been eating like peak-bull. I'm like 75-80% of what it was, but that's what I'm having right now. So I'll be showing you what I'm eating today. Breakfast has been super simple. You guys have probably been following one of my shit, but I get to the amount of things that heat eating breakfast, my heat eating eggs. So I'm making shit. So I've been making it simple, but I'll show you guys what I typically. Gotta cream it. Do we try it though? I ordered one. This was like three months ago. I know they take for a break. That's like frozen. It's not even ice cream anymore now. No, you blend it after. You like freeze it and then it whips it. Into ice cream after. Once you freeze it. It's really like part of the get when like the PS5's. Literally. Freeze is also broken. So it's always freezing everything. This is a little bit of a little bit. Why? I should just put this in that. It's not frozen. So do you like, couple blueberries and half of the banana. Fortunately, another way to make shit around. I'm eating the same thing. Every day for so long that I didn't wait all that. Next up, 32 scoops of protein. I do want peanut butter, one vanilla. I don't know why. I just started doing this. You know, it made a good taste. And the raw one sweet and was stevia. So some mornings I was put you up with. Super low sweet one, you know. I've got a shock to body. So get these sweet and sour. I forgot to put water in there. It happens when I'm going to get in the fuck up the order of things. Stevia and super low. Is that promote muscle confusion? Yeah. But you have to like shock to body. Go back and forth. Can we just go for this seven fiber? I don't know what it is, but it's like it's really fine. Green fiber. Like corn in order. And you can have like a much of you wanted this. And it does not look you blow it or we're dead just. And also I just like a scoop on half of that. Which equates to big math. 10.5 grams of fiber. You know alongside this. I have a geeky altoast. I normally don't go low sodium to the taste way more bland, but they were sold out of the regular can. But it's like a sprouted wheat bread. Just taste delicious. Got some more fiber in it. And whole green goodness, you know. Whatever that fuck that means. Whole green not multi-granted or you don't need a different statement. I also just love the taste of like, you know, weak to those toast, badness. I'm ready to do my other almond butter, but there's one of their almond butter. So, barneys are some shit, but the almonds are blanched. And it's fire. So, they take the shell out of the, that's not really fucking bougie that you've said. But they deshell the almonds and then they burn almond butter. Pretty delicious. You know, yeah, I hit it when like almond butter is make it like a chocolate. He's on a flavor. And then you think it tastes like, it's going to take like Nutella. And then it just tastes like almond butter. Yeah. I'm going to taste great. You know, you need to add a little bit of sugar. Take one green and almond butter is the best. I need to tell my sea like a Nutella thing. Like a meat menu of a restaurant. I usually always get it. Like the Nutella does dessert or something. Fuck. Don't put that in there seriously. What are you doing? I'm just shit whole. I got a cookie. Say hi to YouTube. No, I do, but no. All right. You'd be a breakfast quick because we got Mr. Marlin. Dr. Marlin in the house. You could have picked my body up and then breaking as always. Trying to do it with almond butter with my salted poppy. But this breakfast came to 827 calories. 80 grams of protein, 20 grams of fat. 87 grams of carbs. So that's breakfast quick and easy. Easy to get down. I'm not eating lunch from like two hours. So do that the office. Let's see. Chill. All right. This is me in the mirror. Dose. I got some potato. I got some bison. A three-inch of potato. And some 220 grams of bison. I believe we'll eat that dish out. And my little usually meal two and three honestly. We have been negative meals. But we finally have a kitchen to remove into another place. We have not a good one. But I always keep all the deck. There's only two left now. But I always keep eating the fridge right here. This is like the last busy fridge freezer. So if I'm going to forget a meal, I have that in there. And then when I get to do a room meal, I have my home. And everywhere I go, I have a meal somewhere. So if I'm hungry, throw the microwave and get to go. But courty made a bunch of food yesterday. So I'm eating that before I go back to warm the set. So we eat it and then I'll count the macros that you get to know what it is. So the bonge will have. You're supposed to do the thing where you like stop it right before it. One goes to zero. I do the exact opposite. This is not really it. I have to put this back in. That's what she said. I don't know how to say he said. I'm not a real man. I have a potato choice. I've been to the baby potatoes. I get the yellow and the red big mix. And then just shop them in half and throw them in the oven for like 45 minutes or an hour or something. And they are so easy to eat a lot of calories. And they actually take really good. They call it a couple of them in avocado oil and cook away. So that is at work. Not working. 46 plus 78 plus 93 plus 40 plus 117. I'm making those numbers up. But at that moment. This meal is 718 calories. Was approximately 40. 6. 48 grams of protein. Actually that's the life. This protein is the potatoes. 54 grams of protein. And this is me and my kids sometimes they're lather in ketchup. Sometimes they don't. Today we will not be able to. Well I could mix it up. I'm trying to mix it by protein. Thorous is a lot more. We will try not to eat chicken every meal every day. So I've been having like protein different types of protein. I have an egg for a while but I cut those out. Eating a lot more fish for a while. I have a big tuna every now and then. And then having like one chicken meal maybe. But I want a few weeks without eating any chicken. Just like give me self a detox because I eat so much of it. That's such a mass produced meat. I don't know if it's a good to go all the time. So I've been in a nice and I found meats that are less popular like a bison and I'll give me meats like that. I've less likely to be like mass produced and like fed a bunch of fucking hormones and pesticides and all that bullshit. So I've been eating more of that. Hopefully make me healthier but who really knows until your old and your diet. I have to go on fatty. What? I think I don't fatty. Then Benny. Then it's him. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how to get to my new house and have a deep freezer. I just have like farm foods and my freezer right now. I don't know if she's for that sadly. But that's always going on. So I'm gonna eat this and then eat meal number three after this. Because that's the order of numbers. I don't see you guys. This is my life. I see you. I got nothing to say. All right. So we are on to meal number two. My exciting life of full day of eating. Why? So I don't know why anyone watching these things. I got some chicken in rice. Promise that actually meals are an important thing. I've got my off season and I eat chicken chips. So we'll see we can make something nice tonight. But this meal consists of 250 grams of white rice. 220 grams of chicken and 15 grams of olive oil. Come visit the 690 calories. Total protein, I'll add a count of no here but it's 50 grams of protein from the chicken. So minimum. I'm trying to hit 40 to 50 grams of protein in every meal. And I think that's like a pretty decent staple from with anyone. Cornier tell the half like 40 grams of protein because she only eats like three times a day. So if she has three meals a day like that and then like a shake maybe she's at least close to even. A pound per body weight but when I eat like five meals a day shake or something you can adjust depending on the person. But I do think that each meal. If you're like training, how should I have a minimum of 30 grams of protein because then you're actually enabling your body's person to assist her recover and grow. You don't want to have like 10 meals of 5 grams of protein throughout the day. It just doesn't work as efficiently. And as always I'm trying to eat clean food because digestion is the number one thing that helps a bodybuilder of long term. That they don't like to agree does. And I'm going to like knock a lie and say, I eat my veggies right now. I'm off season. I'm in slack in a really hard. I have a daily green chick usually at night in the morning like five times a week not even every day. And I'm in slack in other veggies. But that's just because I've been busy moving around a lot and when I get in the prep I eat a lot of veggies. So I'm like, I'll be also by 30 months that I'm going to take a five or a sub-limb. Make sure my digestion is still good and I know that other shit that I need. So down, given take where I go right now, we care about macros and clean full foods. So doing this as best I can. And honestly my appetite is really good recently. Getting good sleep, good breath recovery, eating healthy foods. So my appetite is good digestion is good. And I have to actually grow and really good energy. And good. All that shit plays up together. So been in decent low offices so far. So that the back is mentally. And it's happy with it. Put it all the way. But it's coming to an end soon. So I'm going to eat this meal. Calvin's going to go work out. I'm going to take his camera and blog. The next meal I think. Which camera? What? What? What's camera? I'm going to blog like that. I'm going to blog like that. A lot about camera. Calvin's going to bougie. So we're going to make some fucking sick shit for a lot of people out this year. Calvin stopped me here. Later that night. Just throwing a dog in the same seat as usual. So he's beating me. Luckily, so that was like 10 p.m. But I'm not 230 grams of sick. It's delicious. I'm going to have a counter-grafting. And it's quite right. So you can be locked in the middle there. It's actually just up. I'm sure I know what to do later. But we've got to get it when again. Don't feed me to feed me here. So fuck it all. Alright, so we just wrapped up this shoot here. This is going to be a sick video to fucking lay this fuck right now. It's literally 10 and 40. And I'm going home to go to sleep. So it's a rest day today. So I have less. I don't have a shake throughout the day. That's extra that I would have done. But total calories in an upcoming to 3700 calories. And that's with 300 grams of protein, 370 grams of carbs, and 115 grams of fat. So like I said, not super high calories anymore. But I feel good eating this amount of food. So it gets stronger. And the off season is going to be over in a day or two. So I'll live in the dream. People have a car that we were a chaos going on. So we're going to wrap this video up. And see you guys next time. Peace.

=== FILE: FULL DAY OF EATING TO GET SHREDDED ｜ OLYMPIA PREP [ebt17R5b7WQ].txt ===

Look at that. You're gonna eat it in real life. You got my blue leg glasses on. That's very cool. Come on! Come on Chris! Come on! Come on! We told him to let me in two pounds. Come on! Come on! Come on! What is up YouTube? Welcome to full day of eating 2.4 weeks out of this show. I think under 250 pounds of that. So we're only gonna get spot definitely gonna make way over 2 weeks loose. Like 8 pounds of so easy. I've done much worse in the past. So I'm gonna be taking you through everything you're eating right now. I had this point and I think it's cool because last year, to get the conditioning I am. I was eating a lot less. So I'll show you guys a little pull up what I ate last week. I think it's 15,600 calories around now. And then we'll see what I'm eating today. Because I haven't fully calculated. It gives hearty tip, but it's by carbs and fats from carbs and fats or so. So we're gonna get to it. But give me some oats. I'm very into sight of a slavery right now. So I'm gonna make some house scoop of cooking cream. I have this to put in a lot of cooking. I'll let my cooking just, you know, life gets boring and cook. Yeah, I switched things up. Cooking it on so it's up. It's the best way to do it. So we get 80 grams of coconut in the morning. It's a pretty hefty amount for me. And the past is going down to like 40, 50, ish, so I'm not complaining about this. I still am perfected the art of cooking these things. I've got my own, because I like chewy oats of minimal water. And corn is a clean and cooking those. But in prep I want more volumes. I add more water. So hopefully I don't fuck this up with the videos. I've literally thrown oats at twice in a row before in the garbage. Because I'm not wasting calories on shitty oats in prep. Sorry, brin, that's the wrong brinner. Turn the wrong brinner on every morning. So I'm gonna let that heat up a little bit. When it's a little bit warm, I'm gonna add the protein in and then mix it up. Lower the heat. I keep mixing it, I hope, putting it flush up a little bit. And then I'm gonna cook my eggs when they're lost already, because they don't want my eggs to get cold. So first I'm gonna make my little drink and caution. And I'll show you guys just what that is. She could be able to boil that by the way. I'm gonna have one. Alright, so this is far from me setting, but just for a little bit of a gut and digestion health. I just do one scoop of glutamine every morning. They support this in my pancakes or shake, but I don't want to put it in my stomach. And we can't agree. Next I do a quote from T-Spoon of Silly and Whole Husk Fiber. So I'll probably be able to find a fridge just to help me move stuff along. Go to the bathroom every single day. I'll be getting some rest of it. I'll straight out, I'll say this. We have a Revive Fiber and it tastes absolutely amazing. But I'm trying to avoid excess sweetenery right now, and there's a little bit of sweetenery in the case of taste. So good. This is a flavor that tastes like as in super grainy. It's kind of obviously disgusting. But I did what it is right now. And then I do a scoop of batain. This can help with inflammation market if you have blood work done in your home assistine as I. This is something that can help with that. So it's just literal pure batain and hydros. And that's pretty much the extent of that. So I'm going to mix this up with the spoon. I don't know if you can see. See how grainy that is? That's why this fiber is nasty, but not blend it away. Don't put it in shakes or you can just peel. Sure, this is not dirt. I just be dirt, but I grandma said dirt is good for the immune system. I'm taking fiber going to shoot drinking on a lot of water. Otherwise it can have a wrong effect. It's like constipated. But I'm going to like two gallons. Plus the water is there in that. I'm getting so if you're adding more fiber, you're diving. So you're drinking a lot of water too. This is eating up. No. This is going to be getting there for a little kick, you know. This is both that we different. I used to get obsessed with chocolate oats in the morning. I love this year. I'm loving it. Even my ice creams that I would make in later in the day. I'm going to even love this. Maybe I'm not cheering to a boring, good vanilla adult. It's a little bit twisted or full-danned. Alright, well that's getting cooked. Now it's our day. We're going to sit in the spray. We're going to hard-core. It's up there. Don't do. I should have filled the board at portion. Thank you a bit of a lot. I'll see if it works out. Wait. 250-250 grams of egg whites. Beautiful. I'm going to keep messing with this up. This is a boring part. You've got to wait. There's a lot of scraps. I don't know. I'm having the right amount of cooking spray. Damn, I almost broke that. That yolk though. Rookie pan. Beautiful yolk. Take what you can get. You should get a hex-clad plan. A what? Hex-clad plan. Corn cheese is the order of DC of jam. Buckingle you're ice cream. Sure. I don't even know how much pan this is. So see if it's all there need to be there. There's a lot of hex-clad for my place. I'm never going to let it go. The Gordon Ramsay uses them. The other commercial for God from Steel. Panes. Now. I got hooked in the buying one. They were the worst thing it'd ever bought. Last at a week. They'll look at infomercial back in the day. Oh. It doesn't matter. It's good. I like the fucking, uh, I like with the flex seal kind of stuff. Yeah. X-clad sand is depends. Follow me. X-clad. There. Alright. So here's the final touch. I've been thinking about you in my last video. I'm actually measuring my sodium. Last year I should have been. I've got sodium to early. I wasn't sure how much I was eating. I wasn't tracking properly. So this year, not making that same mistake. And in the morning, I do two-eighths of a teaspoon on breakfast. And then every other meal is the one-aest of a teaspoon. But this plus I get a little bit from my master's or pre-workout or other stuff. And if I take the absolute minute. So I'm at least being consistent right now. I'm not going to get the five-to-tapeer down, take it out, make way. When we pull carbs, whatever it may be, we know just what to do. So there you have it. Beautiful breakfast. Don't make that good. I mean, may you want you to calculate it? We'll be able to talk into there. Alright. So beautiful. Not so beautiful, but every can say to you right now. I thought I'd brought up 590 calories from this. Don't ask me the macros because I don't know. But there's 22 plus 53 grams of protein from protein sources, not including notes. And that's breakfast. If I have one of your 90s, pretty good. I'm hungry. So many. Alright, so, meal. Number two. Full weight. I'll try to lie down. Didn't fall asleep. Very tired. It's not like cool last night. But I can eat some weight fish right now, so life is beautiful. This meal consists of, we got in a calorie. I don't know where it is. I'm going to watch. Beautiful new forks. This meal consists of 200 grams of fresh, athletic cod. I don't need to laugh you. That's bad for you. That's bad for you. It's not optimal fish. Wow. It's how much it's left. 200. 200. 200. I'm going to do it today. So, 211 grams of fresh, athletic cod. And then I have 150 grams of rice. A lot of people in my last video. I'm really really asking what sushi maker is. It's called or sushi cheese rice maker. It's called Zoji Rushi. I got it on Amazon, but it stays hot like this. I feel like it's more like Asian culture to keep your eyes out warm all the time, which is like great. They've been laying actually put me on another thing. It's pretty much just thrown in their head start. And the stays warm for ever and until you have lawns. The stays warm for. So I keep it in there sometimes for like four days. I've been using it all year and I haven't died yet. So it is what it is. We got 150 grams of white rice. And then I insacrited a bunch of shredded lettuce. Two shredded lettuce gets you shredded. But it's had the coming yet. We got a bunch of asparagus here. Sprinkle that on top. I think crispy because crispy vegetables are a go-gosh bowl. I'm not like a half cooked, I'll dark taste. A vegetable kind of guy. I like my shit crispy. I like it. A little black. I'm not too black, so I'm not getting too many care synergians. And then the really appetizing looking meal. Yeah. I've delicious. It's like you just put grass in there. Maybe I did. Maybe I did. Keep that up. And while that is heating up, I will let you get another calories because I'm doing that this time. Alright, so that meal comes to 350 heat calories. From the cod, I'm getting approximately 35 40 grams of protein. Rice is coming out to about 43 grams of carbs from that bad boy. And that's a little baby meal to say the absolute least. 12. 54. I'm going to make it. That's going to make it. Alright, so we're just looking at the trash, but you'd be surprised how good this cod actually tastes. And we're going to bring the most shredded lettuce on there for a little bit of volume. But we're now, we'll stick with some suracha because one of the go tournaments that we've ever made. There you have it. meal number two. Shredded with your luncheon. Delicious. Alright, here we go. The world's boring full day of eating around 100. Meal number three. It's going to be my pre-workout meal. Sadly, it's the kind of failed on me and they had no shredded lettuce. So I had to shud my own lettuce. This head of iceberg lettuce. I think that is, I don't even know. But the growth like done me. She said, there's no shredded lettuce, so you're not going to get shredded grow. And it's like cool growth. Gotta get shredded. So, that's what we got. I said, but I have 175 grams of rice this time pre-workout. It's a tiny bit more than my last meal. And then I'm having turkey out of the hook. Turkey, or chicken breast. This meal. Turkey is absolutely not an oven, but it's 90% lean. 2% fat turkey. I guess I could be getting 99%. But I'm not that hardcore. I don't want it to be bad, try. It's at 180 grams turkey. And then zucchini. So the zucchini is like the most easily digestible, low calories. Vegetables. That would never made. So, on my go-to's turn is proud. Especially before the gym. I know that just turkey isn't even easy to do. It doesn't fish. Rice is nothing. It's a lot of stuff. It's a good thing. So I go to the gym and my stomach feels empty. It feels good. It gets when you're bad, bad digestion. It feels good. You're just like your energy low. It's not good. It's no one else. So I'm going to eat this up. I'm not sure to let it in. And then pull a salt time. And then a little mustard. Get some ginger. There you have it. Beautiful. And a little shits crunch. You know, this comes at about 420 calories. It's always sad when you're a meal for me to identify when the calories are pretty much all the way to the side. So, can we get to put this down? You can have to eat it in the meat. So if we work out, try to wake my ass up with a gym. I'll change the arms. And then I'll see you guys for both work out. Shake or meal number four. I think how I feel about the gym. I'm going to create your own trade. Let us see what you're shooting. Maybe that's the model for this year. This is due to everything on your own. Do you have anything on your own? Trust me, I don't want to rely on no one. Yeah. Maybe next year for prep, instead of getting ground rice and bison, you can just go hunt for it. And then it's in and stuff. And end to lap again. Or sorry, caught. Go on there. Spear fishing. Go on there. Go on there. Go on there. You should reach out to Steve Renell and see if you'll club. Netflix club. We're going to cancel it by set of the orders. It's a big camera name, just. You don't have to figure it. I don't know. I just know Steve Renell because I'm the meat eater on Netflix. Yeah, you'll probably get canceled. Sorry. You can use a spatula, right? Oh, because the book's on one other time. It should both sides take place. These chopsticks. Oh, I want to just do enough. Can you just scratch the pan? I'm not touching the pan. Start any attorney, really. I'll take a nurture and scale test for sure. All right, postwork it, meal. Same bullshit. No, let's value a real board here. I got 180 grams of ground turkey. We got some shredded lettuce by shredded by your street. I got some zucchini fried up and 150 grams white sweet Jasmine rice. And then mix up some saracha and some mustard to make some spicy mustard. And crush that down. Some made dude want to point it though. And some random tips that I've been doing a little bit. Very tiny little differences that've been doing this year though that help. That honey kind of like just like, you know, I'm going to use little zero point one percent extra on so that they add up to another percent or two breakfast. You saw I was typically well, you might cardio, maybe stretch, maybe chill, maybe shower, do all this stuff in the knee breakfast. Now it's like I get off the treadmill, I come in and I eat breakfast, so we eat as soon as possible. Because I don't want to be in the word again. Can a ballic? Can a ballic for that long. And I want to just get my metabolism going, get my digestion going early in the morning so that my meals are spread out as possible. And then I can eat my meals earlier in the day and then spread my meals out. Also, postwork instead of having a shake in the postponing my meal and not having any carbs. I've been having my last carb meal immediately after a train. Put a come home and just have this meal. No shower again. Eat it really quick. And then I go shower and then I have my shake afterwards and just getting the carbs in postwork. I'll have my body utilizing a little bit better when I need them. And you know, tiny little things that just allow my meals to be spread out more. More whereas I've mentioned before in the past so you see all my meals in like a seven hour period in the day. My metabolism may get to slow down. My energy was a lot worse and I mean calculated at the end of the day now, but I think I'm eating around 0.1 2200 calories at the moment. And last year when I was in this condition was lighter and I was eating like 1600 calories. So 500 calories is a big difference. That's like 25% or something which is a fucking lot. So and you know, I noticed that I feel that I'm exhausted but I'm just a little bit better and you know a little bit more food is just always a good thing. More you can eat while getting lean is the best for a bodybuilder. Because you mean you have more muscle, you're utilizing it better and everything's just running a little bit more optimally. So these are the tiny little things just kind of like adding point one percent point one percent point one percent. And if you do enough of them, you gain a percent and you're that much better. And when you're at you won't be level. All of us are fucking the best of the best of what we do so we got to kind of inch forward and everything away we can. So that's about that though. So I'm hungry and we need this so see you for the next meal. I'll see you. So I'm just going to do my first time trying this to this extent of the planning you could sit but just just finished that last meal. So I'm going to make my shape into like a little ice cream thing and then I'm going to put it in the freezer and leave it in there for like a little bit. Probably going to forget about it and I'm probably going to put it in the freezer and probably be too hard and probably not going to really eat it. But I'm going to try and remember to stir it and see if I can make it like a little bit more of a frozen ice cream of salt. So ice from the fridge water once the glue to mean that again I had that morning and night and then sent me crunched cereal. I don't know what going on with this protein but this is my favorite flavor for this protein to drink as like a smoothie or ice cream just with water. Very delicious. So I haven't even tried it and I was actually what I just been having it in my ice cream since I was 20 years. I love CVS. My love CVS? Yeah, but I'm trying to try not to have too much. You should make like a root beer flow. I try not to have too much artificial sugar in that. Boating what I can. Water and pre-work it and protein. And I always put too little water in and it's not in the blend. I'm literally sounds like fucking soft blade table. So I'm not a glass of beer, I'm going to do it in this way. So I've shared it to the new table that the thing actually broke for me doing that. Because in New Norwich because it's working side and I broke and then I put it in my drawer for like a month and I took it back here on a kept working. So I'll take this little too much water and I'll blend it up to easily. That's pretty good. Now I'm sitting in the freezer. I'll see you guys in an hour. Look at that. That's frosty level, shit. Frosty. Hey, southern guy in your frosty in fries. I'm not. You're good. I actually am so annoyed that you're just like playing this part that you wouldn't love that because like you... Dude, that's... You were someone who eats weird shit all the way. Yeah, but that's just, I don't know, I just can't. You're gonna eat it in real life. This is a final product of the shake. Top it's a little frozen, little bite. Almost like real ice cream. And that's that. I'm gonna put this down. I'm gonna glue like glasses on until it really cool. We're gonna wash your show and protect the eyes before bed so I can rest. Sleep easy because by the vacuum. Very big. Yeah, I'm gonna wrap it. But yeah. We're gonna watch 1883. We're gonna relive our reddit since the production day through this TV show. And see you guys from my last meal. Welcome to the final meal of the day. I can't even say the saddest thing you'll ever see. That's not that bad. It's not depressing. It's pretty good. It's pretty good. Pretty bad. It can launch a bell size. That's pretty good. But it's 180 grams of turkey combined of chicken because I didn't have enough of eye to show. So I mixed what I had left with the fridge. Little bit of zucchini. That's all she wrote. So this is a new mirror out of, I'm just saying it's full day eating 2.5. But we can say what we want to do. On the day's the way we made 16. It's 16. Fridge says 16's got to be 16. So get down to it. I don't know if my food didn't have to get lorries on this. But I wish I was slowly dropping. But I'll keep you guys in tune if it does. I'm hoping he doesn't. But I probably will just make way. I'm still like eight pounds over my lumerion now. So working on getting down there, very much in shape that we're going to need to be right now for two and a half years. But you know what we'd be leaner and again, I gotta make that way. So anyways, I'm going to go over what the macros are for this. I'm at this is a very approximate. I don't trust my fitness padlobs. That's what I'm going to track in. Total calories is 2,177 calories, 199 grams of carbs, and 18 grams of fat, 284 grams of protein. So nothing crazy, that's a wild. But nothing to jump done. So I'm going to eat this. I'm going to just show and probably pull a little mustard on this because it's all dry. Let's get me up. We're going to call a night. It's going to be a bed. We've got to do it all again. So thank you guys for watching. Catch you in the next one. Thank you.

=== FILE: FULL DAY OF EATING ｜ 5 WEEKS OUT THE OLYMPIA [5xVlV3-cAJo].txt ===

What is up YouTube? Welcome to the long-awaited long requested. Pintilong since we've done one full day of video. Come on, come on, Chris! Come on, come on! We come on, let me in, Chris! Come on, Chris! Come on, Chris! Come on, Chris! We are officially five and a half weeks out of the Olympia and time to get shredded. So I'm going to be taking you through everything I'm eating in a day right now. Pretty consistent, so, but it's been all else since I've done it. So I can finally say these won't be as boring as typical, but yeah, I'm really hungry right now. That clock is wrong, it's actually 9.45, but I still normally like to eat at 9 so I'm just going to get to this. Breakfast consists of some oats, some eggs, and some protein, which I like to turn into a good old Seabumb protein pancakes. It's very delicious. But I have 90 grams of oats. I like to put them in a smaller, heated thing here, and then I blend them in and they become more like an old flour, and then they become pancakes better. So, first up. And then you take the bigger blender and then I put them eggs, egg whites, and the secret to good pump pancakes, pump it. It's worth a five or two. I just have to put it in. All right, so egg whites, I do... I'll be right there. There are two, two, ten, two, twenty grams, egg whites, egg whites, egg whites, I can hold a little bit over because it's literally 25 calories for 46 grams. And then I do one whole egg, chop that in there, and we're going to eat with the egg yolk. Really, organic thing? That yeast's great. Next up, by the way, protein, if you make these pancakes, turn your burners on to begin. We're going to get you on the hot, not cool when they start. They want to be like sizzling hot. You want to cook these fast, otherwise they dry out faster. I put in the eggs, and I put my oats in here, try not to spill the food you wear. Pressure's curves. I'm going to let the protein all day every day. I take the destroyed ones, so that you guys can get the beautiful bottles, I can lower as you take these ones. But always pick, it's safe best when they're vanilla flavor to my opinion. So, the two, scoop of bomb protein, you'd go to some of them. Okay, stand up right there. Okay, let's do a scoop of sun fiber. Don't ask what this shit is from Thorny. I'm going to help you poop. Do a scoop of glutamine. Okay, for the gut, keep your gut healthy, and your body will be healthy. Dash of extra vanilla flavoring, for deliciousness. And then some salt for a little extra. Flavor and some sodium games. I always do this in an infregette, so. I personally do 67 grams of pumpkin in there. There's like literally no calories in this. If you're like on a diet in your way, you can stuff out. You can stuff it to like five grams of oats. And it's a cool thing until like almost 40 grams of pumpkin, because it's just like fiber in there. But that's everything in here. I personally am weird. I rather thin pancakes and more volume. So I put a little bit of water in. Whist this just like a random amount of water. That makes a little thinner, but it also gives me more volume. So put it all together. One of the bits of making delicious pancakes. All right, so also I get really new pans that are being a prep in Throo Prep. So I sometimes don't even put cooking spray on here, so you don't even get extra fat from that. But you wait till these are nice and hot. You get a little bit of sizzle. You see, my pancake is thin and it's bucked, but. However, like if you don't add water, they won't be as thick. If you add more oats, it'll be more thick. All that good stuff. But no cooking spray has shake shreds. And I like the dash cinnamon on top of my pancake when they're in here. So I just kind of cover them all with some cinnamon for it. We'll like to flavor in deliciousness. Now, now you have it. It's a beautiful pancakes. I'll get you shredded. Oh, yeah. Well, this is the final product, but I also get some delicious almond butter. Sadly, I'm at the end, so I can't drizzle it, but I just kind of dohves them on there and spread it out after. But you're 20 grams of heavy and delicious almond butter. 19 close enough. That are also taste fired. Look, they're almost like fluffy even. Like a real pancake. They're not actually. They're like a real pancake, but the pumpkin at least makes it not dry as fuck so they're edible in decent. So, let's go back for a straight now. Favorite meal of days. We'll get some of you through my cardio. It gets me up in the morning. You know, it's about 40 minutes of cardio right now and I can just simply be in pancakes after. And life is beautiful. So, meal number one, full day beating. Number one, prep 20, 22. Welcome aboard. I don't see you guys from meal number two. All right, so we're here at the warehouse new office area. I don't know if I've shown you the where I have but the full day beatings, so if we do, I'll show you it was a little bit more done. Talvin's, I don't know where the fuck Calvin is. We actually have a wrap behind the camera right now. Fill in in. We're going to get copyright music because kids are tuning out here, but I want to heat up my meal, so we're going to have to the lawn trim and I'll tell you guys what I'm eating. It's my beautiful meal, very extravagant chicken, rice, and some green beans. Green beans always baked in the oven. I don't know why they taste way better like that. And that's it. I've been hardcore this year. Partly because of honey, he said that not allowed to have sauces on my meals. He always had like sugar free ketchup, ketchup is life, Willie salsa, all that shit. And that's no more. So I have a little bit of sarah, just sometimes some chalulus sauce, some yellow mustard. And sometimes some coconut amino, because I love to use stir fries and go for a minute. But when I'm at the office, he can go to a top word on the road. I should eat it fully plain. Just lightly salted on it. And that's literally all it is. So this meal is 180 grams of chicken breast, 200 grams of white rice, and then like a little bit of green beans. Sometimes I do broccoli. Sometimes I do nothing, just because I don't know how I'm feeling. Or shredded lettuce to get shredded because you guys know how it works. But he just up, he did up, and trying to get shredded. All right, so let's do that. I already explained what I mean. Nothing exciting. My next meal is the exact same. So I will see you for that meal. Meal them in three. I'll eat three meals before I train. This is just like my work office meal. Get me through the day. Next one is pre-workout. So I'll see you then. Next meal is about the water. Very crucial. Say hi to you. Don't be thirsty. Don't be a thirsty whole. Drink water. All right, so this is meal number three. This is my white fishy fish meal. Release fish and fish of the fishy fish. If you remember that call, you're in a real one. But meal number, this is the tip of my pre-workout, but today is my rest day. So I am not going to be working but I have the exact same diet, rest days, and training days. So this is 200 grams of white fish. I like to do haddock. This is haddock ricard. Coddy, we typically do haddock ricard because you can actually get wild cod, haddock ricard, whereas most other fish are farmed. But she's sloppy. It's just no good, so don't eat that shit. Wild cod fish if you can. It's not, you know, you'll survive by dry. And so I have this, and then I fry it on the pan, and I have a little bit of rice. That's all she wrote. You want to go to the spray bay and that's how you realize it was closed there. That's what I'm going to spray. I'm going to try it. All right, so finish it off with some beautiful shredded lettuce in order to get shredded. Just so that's volume, taste good, crunched, beautiful. That's some broccoli, 200 grams of white rice, which is the 64 grams of carbs, for those that love their macros, 200 grams of white fish, right around the low end to 40 grams of protein or so. So this is a little bit of coconut and coconut amino, on there, fried up, and actually taste really good. You know, over-pick your fish, taste great. So number three, typically, we've proved workout like I said, not trained today, but I'm doing so, call you in here. Sono, rest, maybe stretch your back, let's show, instead of working out and then I'll see you guys for my shake or my number four. Oh, yeah. This is fucking even gum. I know the hurricane. Don't even Calvin. That box is your right amount of fucking face. Wow, that's a fast language. Let's say your dad probably won't hang out with you, but it's okay. You can go for 10. Make him hang out with you. Right, babe? Sure. We're getting some of the diet in the hurricane. Yeah. We're taking Ron Powski. We're fucking flirting now. I go to fucking public sound of street and it's fucking close because there's little rain and a little fucking window there. Pussy shit. Can you tell what that word? Whatever. You can't film me today, Calvin. I have no shame in the minute. I don't like you guys, but like this is not the vibe. Make the vibe. What if open up your vibe? Open up your vibe. Open up your vibe. Chris, don't even look like a little rat girl. You are a little rat girl. You call me a rat girl. What a fucking permanent description. Sorry, I'm leaving the apartment. I think I've been drinking coffee the vacuuming. You ever feel like you bounce around like back a lot? Yeah, it's not that too. But maybe as I have too much focus. Too much focus on too many things. Chris, who's a clear workout sack you could have worn mine? The court is. We're flared. Super creamy. We all know that. That's the best way to do it is. You want to pump a tense focus and it's saying energy. You should stack raw pre from raw thabbage. Bifes go to the beach. You don't talk about being a playman? What am I supposed to do to tell? Can you really beat that flavor? It's one of the goat flavors of all time in my opinion. It just tastes so good. Like a slushy popsicle combined into heaven. Probably should release it in summer not in literal winter but like better release than never in now. No real Canadian seed ice cream still on the winter. All right so meal number four. Typically I would have a shake right now but I was in the cold tub and I was too cold to have something cold so I wanted something more. So I put on a sweater and I made some potatoes and this is 350 grams of raw weight potato. I weigh most of the cook but my potato you never know how much you're going to shrink in everything fishing and air fryer so I weigh all my potato raw and having air fryer the life saver could you just cook it like 20 minutes super quick. 350 grams of raw weight potato which was 56 grams of carbs and then another 200 grams of white fish. So the way honey operates was all the stuff is he calculates the carbs from direct carbs or it's the protein from direct protein sources and the fats from wherever the fats are coming from. But mainly focusing on the protein and the carbs and subtracting stuff along from there. So we're not counting the protein that you get from like oats and the little bits and rice and everything. So this is typically my post-workout meal very delicious. I've heard somewhere that if you take your potatoes, cook them and cool down and then cook them again or re-heat them. The actually lowers glycemic index and it's less likely the spike could bud sugar. So I try to do that when I have to have to do it but normally I just take them to the air fryer and they taste better like that so I'm not perfect but it's meal number four but this down probably shaking and then last meal and hit the bed. Warm it up enough for a shake. I was going to make it into not this but I want to enjoy some ice cream so I'm going to blend up the protein which I'll drop the whole thing on my ground. Alright so typically like I said this is my post-workout shake but I'm resting today but even on rest days you gotta hit that protein goal especially on rest days almost because the rest days therefore recovery not just for nothingness so I'm making sure it's still getting all my protein and sometimes I think I'll get to the point where I'll have like a low day a low carb day on my rest days but we are not quite there yet so a two-skill was a protein I filled up like a good amount of ice and some water if you're not on prepping do this with almond milk or some kind of nuts. We're not there you're not gonna believe they're in milk then it blows up a lot smoother but getting up in a shake 50g of the protein and trying to do some delicious things here. The moment of truth every time TL worked out that's a good texture right there. Kind of like a icy from Wendy's and I see's from Wendy's dip with your fries and no you fast is. Frosty what did I say? I see. I see frosty. Frosty dip in your fries and then maybe give you what the fuck you joking. That's disgusting. No. Bro the people are gonna roast you in the comments right now for never doing that. I can't do something she burger dip a bacon either. That's not too much. You would actually love fried dip in it so good. Let's call these three colors. Yeah amazing. Anyways this is my shake typically. I feel my period of typically I do right out the gym. We have like a protein layer and I know what guy who owns a company. I typically feel protein from back there and I have it on my drive home but make an excuse tonight. It's really good. Not for life. All right we're gonna watch power. It's 50cm got it a jail and you're about to pluck some bitches up so we're gonna put on TV watching power and then I will see you guys in a little bit for my final meals of the day. So this is the final meal of the day by one fat protein source. I guess to call I either have beef or salmon tip for having a lot of salmon lately. It should get the only good to be nice and healthy before bed but I like to chop it up like this for putting it in the microwave. One bite cold one not but I think I find it dry the salmon out a little bit less when you're re-cooking it so chop it up and then I have some green beads in the air fire. That nice and burnt. Very veggies are the best veggies. Also every night my array my array of a lot of supplements and I have a nice medium every night. I'm gonna help you relax it make help you with the bathroom, you stress and all the good stuff. I'm just just a great dinner. We'll have you in body so it's up and some of this and it tastes good. Orange flavor and this is sweet and misceded so just day off natural. I'm gonna have a little bit of green beans. Okay I bet you have choice. So make an easier for my wife, you just go to your mom and that's it for the day. So there was a new day occurring and it's around. I'm probably calculated maybe I'll have come and put it in after I can't click but it's just under 3,000 calories and I just cut this meal so it's eating the exact same thing but this meal had another 350 grams of potato with this final meal I keep saying the way it feels. It's late but we just cut all that out. I like to personally cut my carbs out of my final meal. If I'm gonna cut them out of any meals for the day you go to bed after you hungry whatever you're just going to sleep and you know having the empty stomach going to bed sometimes kind of nice. So I'm gonna get this down, wake up and repeat the exact same thing again and again and again. How many days, babe? 38. 38? Yeah. Holy shit. That's about 47. Wow let's get even just a small number. This is on the fridge so groundhoged it, same thing over and over again but let's food more and more. More and more cardio so joys beat the day. That's it. I guess we're watching see you in the next video and in the next full day video. Please be alone. God. It's a hell of a hell of a...

=== FILE: FULL DAY OF EATING ｜ 6 WEEKS OUT MR. OLYMPIA [qwynB6ys5mU].txt ===

of steak. A rough steak bro. That's like perfect meat, man. It's not even cooked anywhere. What are you talking about? I mean like, there's no like pink in the middle, it's just red. This is the moment. What is up YouTube? Welcome to the first full day of eating of this prep series. You're six and a half weeks out, so it's grand time. So in a decent amount of food, but I've been hungry at wake up. Now like stomach, like they're not sure. Because I'm so hungry and all day I just want to eat more food. But that's prep. That's life. That's what it takes to get shredded. So yeah, I'm not going to get into too much right now because it's morning and I'm hungry. But breakfast is the SP eggs and oats making them in the pancakes. Super basic recipe. You're probably going to do this before, but when you're in prep, the tea is amazing and it feels like you're eating a lot more volume because it does. Essentially though, I do 150 grams of egg whites and then I do two whole eggs. We crack all my egg whites out of eggs and it was like fucking eight eggs. Get in the yolk out of there. Paying that. So go back to my lazy days, pull them in over here. So that oats, part of the reason I switched to, because I don't have any 100 grams of oats, I don't have any 70. And it just didn't feel like a lot of 70 grams of oats. It's 9.6. And I'm going to be scoop out this sunflower. This is one of four eat fibers. It's like just literally like unhumanised plain, that super light. Like mixes with water barely even blood. And then you get to a food easy on your stomach. I've been enjoying that. I've put you scooped the collagen. This is some marine collagen from the corn. Again, I just take over. She's gotten the cover on us. See, good free body. Also adds the texture to the pancakes. So give more of it my pancake. I'm also good to. And then this has been the goat protein fiber lately. Maple waffle fire. We have a little just a drop or about to drop a strawberry. Bounce cake, which is like strawberry short cake. And that one's really something to do. So I want to try that in my oats. But I do like 20 like 20. I'm the protein of the study of full scoop. And then a little bit more. And then the other thing we really see for that is the pumpkin. I already just get this pumpkin. It's just pumpkin puree with nothing added into it. So 120 grams is 40 calories. And I only do like 30 to 40 grams of it. So it's literally like, I don't know, 15 calories. Which is nothing but it, it lets stop supporting from getting hard. If you've ever made protein safety, sometimes it gets like dry and dense in the middle. The pumpkin can't cook. So when it's in the mix of everything, it keeps it like nice and moist. Yeah, that's literally it. I put a dash of water in it. Just put it in it out. Like I said, volume over everything right now. I don't have much water. I just hold it here for three seconds. And then those are my pancakes. Alright, there's the final masterpiece. And some weird nuances I do. I put a paper towel between a bunch of them. So they don't get like the moisture doesn't get in like wet and soggy. Just egg pancakes. I can have a little bit more moisture. Also cover them in salt. In cinnamon because it makes them taste great. And if not calories. And then sometimes that always, I have this kind of thing. I just want to make it look like a little bit more moisture. I also cover them in salt. In cinnamon because it makes them taste great. And then sometimes that always, I have this delicious monk fruit sweetened to maple syrup. And it's 10 calories for 30 milliliters. So I literally weigh out about 25. And I'll do this every day, but I figured, I'll show you the most of what I do. I'm doing the most today for this video. So I weigh it like 25 milliliters on that. And then I dip some in there, some mate was out. But that is my breakfast. And I totally had the macros for you guys. It does, I know you love that shit. But it comes out to 619 calories. So it's a big ass plate of 618 calories. 54 grams of carbs, 14 grams of fat, and 63 grams of protein. So not a bad browner or some pancakes on-prem. Salt. Seasoning. And we're all good, butter. Just salt. Alright, that's a wrap on breakfast. One of those meals, like I mean every meal right now. But gone too soon. When I finish, I'm like picking up a little bit of the leftover. But, you know, my mom was day, I could head over to West Palm Island and be back in town for a bit for me number two. As you can see, we are currently homeless. This doesn't have to box in suitcases. Not our home with roommates and not ideal situation for prep, but it is what it is, making the most of it. We are currently moving in our nowhere to move to. So this is just kind of the theme of the year. Everything's just not going the morning to play in. But, it doesn't matter because I don't need home. Just a kitchen. And a fridge in a bit. So making the most of it. So we're either going to be back here for me number two or at the office. I'm not sure if I'm going to be back. I'll see you guys out there. Alright, so we're here for me on number two. A little bit late today because I got a lot of work to do. I'm going to come and make Calvin show the update. Even when I told him to be 12, it's not 1 o'clock. So just run in behind. But to stop by Whole Foods, they're going to have some West Bomb and Courtney has his life act. You ask them to cook fish for you. They'll cook it for you there. And they'll cook it with like no oil. And then I think just seasoning or lemon or something. Then you all have to cook fish at home and you fish it in some kind of like shit. So Whole Foods is the goal for that. It's a little price here and I know people aren't shopping there, but it's worth it. Can they cook your food for you? You got some sauces. But, Courtney also made me a little bit of something. But this meal is 200 grams of white rice, 180 grams of chicken breast. And then got some shredded lettuce. Back in the game, shredded lettuce to get shredded. You get to know the drill. And this year we've been adding sliced up a little baby cucumber system in the meals. Because they are low to no calorie and little crunch, little freshness. And then Courtney makes this whole concoction where she squeezes lemon. And then she does some organic honey, a djohn mustard and coconut aminoz. And then she blends it all up together into this and it makes almost like a minigrant style salad dressing. I don't know, but it tastes delicious. So I pour this on this meal and that's what I eat. But the calories on this one are 450 calories. Proteins like 46 carbs is about 58. So not a big meal, but this is like a pretty simple meal. You don't feel that are very similar to this or at the day. Normally I eat it at like 113-12. Because I was eating five meals for a while. And honey wanted me to up it up to six. So I was eating 220 grams of meat every single meal for five meals. And then I cut it down 280 grams of meat and added an extra meal to it. And the day was no carbs on it. So eating the six meals now and I needed because the hungry here I get the more soup I want to eat. My meals because my appetite is just crazy right now. And I'm not eating a lot of food. They don't feel me up. So spreading it in my meals, helping build up limbs, apples and getting in protein throughout the day. So we need to snack them after the starving. I'm probably going to say that every single meal I eat. But eat this and I'll see you guys for a meal number three. I can't see where we are. Oh, wait. Not the ideal way to eat potatoes. But okay, we're going to have some. We have a better pressure to the oven. And then we would do that. Any food that's good for the grand meal. This is a meal number three, getting normally eat it a little bit earlier day. But this is what it is. It's some 99% lean ground turkey. We're going to say back cause I'm not losing any bites. The 180 grams of ground turkey. Like I was saying most women are 180 grams of meat right now. And then I have 200 grams of raw weight potato. Really hard to measure. And my thinnest pound stuff he just needed never knows. Cooked, cooked. Cooked, cooked and all the stuff. And then you cook the potatoes. These ones, partly less than the oven for too long. And they just dried up a little bit more, dried up a little bit more so the weight really decreased. So the corny does the shoe weighs some raw and it should divide the cookie sheet into four and should put 200 grams in each corner and then after she'll individually put them in the separate so I know each one is 200 grams of raw liquid potato and it's just a super consistent way to track your food. Make sure you're consistent with eating the same thing every day. So this thing is meal comes up to 360 calories a little baby has meal. Getting like 45 grams of protein from the turkey and like 40 grams of carbs from the potato and the go-to on the sun some good ol' sarachia. I don't know if only one who does this but every single meal I have in the day a specific condiments that go with it. Like I always use sarachia and ketchup with my potato. I rice mill usually has the coconut meat on the honey mustard and then I have a fish meal that usually has a green salsa on it or a different type of honey mustard and everything just has a specific match. I'm like a fucking mission so chef specific flavors that go to eat enough but minus the tasty food. But yeah this is the meal number three going down right now. Normally this is my typically my pre-workout meal. I try to cram in my food a little bit earlier than the day not going to have me six meals and I want to get my metabolism and my body going just food and me at the early possible throughout the day and I like having me at least three meals of carbs in my body. You may sit in before I go train. Today's gonna be rest day and I normally carry in the morning but I had to go to that appointment earlier so I'm gonna be doing cardio after this meal. I eat this a lot of digest a little bit. Good to carry you. I need to go back for a meal number four so that's a current game plan and yeah. T.E.S. for a good next meal. All right we are on to meal numero quadru. Now I just finished up cardio rest day today. Once the gym didn't have our cardio. Custon new pieces coming into we got a new leg press up. It was in there. There have been blabbered making sure. I want to keep it my get rid of another one not really sure yet. But more importantly to have the full day reading. I mean number four is some fish that fish I got down or corny got down whole foods and then it's fried up with some rice a little bit of broccoli's long. Tread lettuce and cucumber again. Tread lettuce and cucumber has been the go too lately. Corny put the together for me like a week ago for the first time maybe 10 days ago and it's been fire so nice crunch and very refreshing. But this meal is only 434 calories like 40 grams of protein, 57 grams of carbs. So all these meals are like pretty much 100 calories except breakfast and they are leaving me very happy. This one I haven't had this this year yet but last year I had this Tom's award winning original gourmet mustard sauce. Absolutely delicious. So I'm gonna put some of this on and enjoy it and honestly it's been loving weight fish. I have 200 grams that have 180 grams like the rest of my meals because there's less protein content and technically in fish program so just make sure you know that when you're putting your meal together. And yeah it's really all that's going on in postcardio meal. Alright so Calvin left so I put his camera on a box here and we need to help him out. We're going to replace that quick. But I forgot he's leaving. We're gonna trigger some safe saffords which will show you but I have a creamy typically or a protein shake. Sounds really fucking weird to say creamy but these things blew up on the internet and I ordered one and they're actually pretty damn good. They make a protein ice cream. Probably heard of it the ninja creamy. I literally I posted it and people were like I wonder what recipes are going to be like I'm excited to see I'm like first of all I'm not creative. I'm not gonna be good. Second of all I'm gonna prep some recipe because it's a water and protein powder. That's literally it. But this protein the raw dark chocolate protein is definitely the best one I have used for it. It feels like a really rich dark chocolate and I don't put the only trick I really do that probably do you have the amount of water you should for two skips so it's really like flavor is very dense and yeah I literally shake it up in a protein shake cut pour it in here freeze it overnight and then let's put it in the machine. Okay so the only trick I do actually have for this is when you use water it comes out like flaky as you can see. You can even see that not really actually like ice cream at all because it's just literally shaped ice pretty much with protein but it's a lot more calories than me. You can put almond milk, oat milk, any kind of milk make it drizzle on top and then blood is again it takes two minutes you do it for another two minutes. I can't do that because I'm in prep so I literally just add like that much water to raise them every time and then I run it through the machine again and it comes out way more like fluffy like ice cream. All right so as you can see texture now is way better. Never know how to focus on this camera. Let's see if we can do that. There you go. Take sure the way better now literally. That literally a little bit creamy. Hence the name way better than blood and the ice in the in the blender and that's not a bad little protein I can't forget that for nothing but water and protein powder and I promise you guys the start chocolate protein is the best flavor I've been through a bunch as the best one. We also just made that strawberry one though strawberry would probably really get as well I'm going to try to rub it in my house and then it's creamy. But me and according I'm going to watch succession we're getting into that show so I'm going to eat my ice cream and then we come back when kelm becomes back will be eaten. Me and the number five. Oh, that's a pretty technical answer. All right so this is a meal number five. We do not feel exciting at all so I'm not gonna do that. That'll along this one pretty much the same with my last meal but smaller 200 grams of white fish fresh Atlantic wild caught cod and 150 grams of white rice. Let us answer my master's so that's it. And what's it? Get her bone. It's okay what's your favorite bone? How do I eat all of these right now? I'm going to add all of these right now. Alright, so this is a moment where I would literally eat, make it eat both of these right now, easily. Now you don't think so? I don't know. I think I definitely can, right now, it would be amazing. It would probably taste the crack, but this is all we can taste like, crack. This is the memory of eating. Just that. So, car was no wishables. I'm going to kind of work with the next 12 hours. The Kelvin is a master of the trigger. That's making steak that I would literally never take the time to do this kind of like three hours of cooking steak. But it's probably the best way to cook a steak. I can't live. I've traveled a lot. I've lived last few years. I'm going to stay counted because it's how we kind of like make up for the shooting of a traveling. And it's hard to beat a fucking 12 triggers to get a get live. So, I've been enjoying this here. Some Joe Rogan method where he's here, is it? He just said, I don't know, he can explain it one day. But it tastes amazing. So, this is meal number six. It's 200 grams of steak. Oh, fuck. Fucking steak bro. That's like perfect medium. What do you mean? You see a medium? Me, rare. It's not even cooked anywhere. What are you talking about? I mean, like, there's no like pink in the middle. It's just red. I mean, it's just moving. Is there a rope round it? Yeah. I'm going to go fire. There you go. What is it? Okay, what's it like? You can comment below if you guys think that's still rare. You guys think that it's so rare, I'll sell my trigger. That's rare. That's a rare. That's a rare. That's a rare. That's rare. That's rare. That's rare. That's rare. That's rare. It's a bit of a illusion because it's smoked. So it's more cooked than it looks. But. Okay. What's the next one? I'm sure it's what's in what? Do you want to go? Do you want to go? Do you want to go? Yeah? Oh, good. Okay. All right. So it's coming right up on this floor. They've been we just cut a rabbit whole time. What can Egyptian pyramids in the Great Wall of China? And I'm dying of David Goggles. I'm going to run across it. So what's happening is that I'm really fucking saying it. And we're going to get a bit. But to wrap up this video currently six and a half weeks. And I'm at six and a half weeks. Or five and a half weeks. Six and a half weeks. So calories came up to 2,739 calories. For macros were 257 grams of carbs. 31 grams of fat. Oh shit. That's low. That's right. 31 grams of fat. And 330 grams of protein. So it's a fucking high-end protein diet. But you know, that's how we're going to trip this year. So that's everything I'm even hearing right now. And I'm very happy to be here. So I'm going to go back and do that in the wake up. And groundhogs day begins for the next six and a half weeks. Do the same shit. Everything will day. Cardio, office, sleep, gym, eat, repeat, sleep. All that bullshit. So yeah, thank you guys for watching. See you guys in the next one. Peace out.

=== FILE: FULL DAY OF EATING ｜ CARB LOAD BEFORE SHOW DAY [v1BKT_eIYDQ].txt ===

Like you said you busted pretty on three times, but if you were beaten this guy I'm doing telecasts. How did he get you in this sport? You the first guy who ever beat me class really back in 2016 my first ever coach showed Yeah, he came in nowhere. It's where I should begin to and grateful for that show, but I wasn't ever going to happen again Come on come on Chris come on you are Jerseylor you're in your stake Where's the easier I need it over there in It's 150 grams of full ay, 150 grams of rice, 100 grams of sweet potato and 100 of bread potato. So, just a 14-6, and 40. Just a little bit of meat. A little jumbo-eye of carbs and steak. I'll do this thing just to eat a shit ton of steak right now. It takes so good. It's good, yeah? More fillet on the way. I'll look at you. We're going to get some man here and there we go. There's a couple of them. Make sure the press conference. Chris, you want me to have bear just time to do it. We're going to have a little bit of a short bear and probably call it. One more next meal. Right now, pretty much. You can weigh a little bit. Because I'm going to eat this meat court. He's going to make it right out. And then I need it. Or you can come to your job. I'm going to eat that first. I'll just take it. Did you want me to take the steak? Yes, sure. Keep digging up on me, Nate. Right now, so I tell you, if you can't. So, it's a take in every day except for the game show. And then morning, she went morning and she went out. I just wanted to take it just keep. Thanks for the long days. You're not having diarrhea. I just want to be with you. With your governments. I want to be a little bit extra active. So, I'll do this one. All right. Perfect. What is up YouTube? I fucked up already today. Kevin wanted to be a full day of eating. It is. But I had to wake up. Kevin told me when I wake up just like eat. Because we were up so late last night. You wanted me to get my food in here. So I ate before. We started filming. But it was a simple meal. I had 120 grams of oatmeal. Chased the delicious. And 115 grams of chicken breast. Not that delicious. But we still need to eat some of your food. Right now, I typically wouldn't. My carbs go up. My protein goes down a little bit. A for digestion volume. Me need less protein. I'm not like trying to build muscle right now. Just like give my body what it needs. Play a menu. A lot of steak right now. To see a lot of creatine. We've trained fat and that. Also helped really fill you up. And give you like a full look. And salmon as well. So kind of adjusting that stuff. But I mean, we're going over everything I'm eating today. Pretty much. So that's what meal one I had at about 8 a.m. I ended up eating it when it was cooked. And then I went back to bed because we were up to like 2. And now 10 a.m. and we're going to be eating again. So eating almost every 2 hours with the press conference at like noon today. I said noon. So I wanted to get 3 meals before that. Because sometimes you sit there for like 3 hours. And it's just long. And trying to keep me just full right now. So I woke up at like 2.39 point. Something whatever. Like still under 240. After eating a whole bunch. So my body sucking up the food. I look dry. It's fucked zero diuretic. I might not even take it. It's beyond us. It's like flush with yourself. And honey is still like on and of being like minimal everything. All natural food is best possible. Just to minimize anything when your body. So super happy to know that. Happy to tell my body this one. Happy to get to eat. It's collating me already about now. Like it's beautiful. It's beautiful. So what do you want to eat? Doing this up. Cornies up food. Fucking great. I just want to eat. I just want to eat. Yes, today when we were trying to make way back and forth. Hanies of maniac. But he did it. Making way. That's perfect right. He's a maniac. In the best way. Pock on me. Like the cycle. We were just so good at what they do. Because they've come to pick you up. Perfect. He did it in corny with a machine in the kitchen. We got the team fucking roll in right now. It's still good, can eat this apple sure you have in the meals made so stay tuned. Taste good already, one on the rice, plain as potatoes. Thanks babe. Hey, yours is so beautiful. Take your nose off, cute cats. I think you guys are on this side. Okay. That's a good piece. Well, he's a well-peeled juicer. I don't know. I'm going to have a side-to-side. What's up, Vannas? Oh, man, am I excited? Folks, we have seen the most competitive lineup. I think maybe even in Olympia history, I'm full of itself for this year's Olympia title, that's not just in the men's, but straight across the board over 400 athletes qualifying this year that does make this the biggest Olympia of all time. I could be happier that we're back here in Venice. All right, the men, the men, the legend, as you get here by the crowd, they said, you know what you heard first? Yes, I know. Because we back in Vegas. The stance is back, better than other. The stance is back. Yeah, I've heard of the mode this year too. I think that's very, very different. Better on you than me, that's for sure. All right, Chris. We had this conversation every year. You've got some great contenders coming, but, man, you just keep doing the business over and over and over but last year you were getting pushed right till the end. And I know you had that nice heart felt acceptance speech at the end of the really touched everybody in the Olympia audience. So, anything different this year, I know every year seems to be a struggle per se, but just gets more and more tough to achieve the same. Is it getting harder as you go on at the retaining the smile? I guess it gets easier in harder and way to, you know, you get used to it a little bit. And, you know, like you said, it was a competition coming up. There's some crazy younger guys coming to look absolutely amazing and they push me to be my absolute best. And, you know, that's what happened this year. This is my 47-comment in here, so I know the rodeo. I know how to do that. I want to do how to do what I do. I'm excited, so, you know, only I know what I did last year. I know what I did last year and I believe I did that. So, I'm excited to show you that. You did, you did have some good young talent coming up in Ours, a cow will sit and speak. You've spent the weekend this year. And he said young guy was 22, 23 years old. I think? And, like the beer remiss, of course, if I didn't recognize my Brazilian buddy, Raymo, Dino. Oh, no! Oh, no! Or Gino, I think Taylor was teaching me some part because of Gino. So Dino, I was for dinosaurs, that was at the cake with the... So I made them a steak, I've going out of podcast. I actually didn't take Ramon to win. In the next day, I hit my Inba. I hit 4,000 dinosaur emojis. And I'm like, what is this? Like, I'm all about Brazil. Oh, no. We're learning things, gentlemen. Now, every day, to defending all plastic plastic physics Heavy in from the United States. Terrence, from Brazil. Oh, no! Oh, no! And for a two-time plastic physique, to let me get Heavy in from the United States. On Ainsley! You guys know each other? We met the high school. You met a two-time star. What up, Tim? Hey, everybody. How are you guys doing? I love you guys. Thank you guys for being here. Real, when it comes to class, you're talking a little bit about stage. What about the fat, man? You know, it's just beginning to class again. I was very kidding play. And Greenland said, nobody is going to know who you're talking about. We got a few people, right? I'll be over three or five people, right? I remember kidding play. That's quite dirty. But... See? It's always in somebody with them. These guys don't know. You don't know the people play. You really don't know. Yeah, I don't think you're doing it that nice. Don't think you're doing it that nice. All right. We're back again. There's a lot of talk this year about it. How do everybody guess saying that you should have gone to the two 12. They said your time here is done. You can't beat this guy. This guy's sniping after you. You got your one show last year, right? Thanks. Was it the Olympia Lester? Two shows you got it. Three shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. Two shows you got it. You've given consideration. You said you got some unfinished business. But you haven't ruled out in the future. Don't want into the two 12 division. No, I have not. But definitely I'm finished business. Here comes Saturday. I want to finish this classic. My last classic here this year. I want to be the gang of the gold medals. Do you're moving on either way? Yes. Yes. Okay. It's going to be an epic battle because this guy is just unrelenting. I mean he hasn't shown out one bit of weakness. And all Terrence is done by the way Terrence is the best poiser in the business. Are none. Okay. So let's put it in out there because it's kind of a lost art. But you classic guys have really brought it back. Do you spend a lot of time on the poiser and your routines? Because it's her looks like you do. Definitely. Yeah. I think to be the best you have to put the work in. So I've been going this way about a decade now. Here we see what they are going to do. Like you said, you busted three times. But if you ever beat this guy. Yeah. I haven't seen it. Yeah. I brought him to me. We don't like to talk about that show. I don't like this. How did he get you in this sport? He used the first guy who were beat me in class. Really? Back in 2016, my first ever coach showed that he came in an oar. That's where I should begin to. And grateful for that show. But I wasn't ever going to want to happen again. What a baby back there. Yeah. Cool. You got to try. Yeah. What a show you to color. Hey. What's up? My name? Talk about truck. Do you see the shit? You know, he's about ready to show me right now. This is what the color I was thinking. You might have tried to. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Do you like that? I just love to use them. Yeah. Do. Yeah. I got to walk down. I'm going to work now. All right. So just wrapped up press conference. Honestly, making weight last night wasn't that bad. And it was kind of nice time to wake up this morning. Rush quickly to make weight. And then eat quickly and then rush to the press conference. It's at every two hours and rush back. And everything's so honestly, it's working out pretty good right now. And I got to end up the press conference pretty quick. I feel like they're rush this a little bit. So I mean, good for me. I don't have to sit around. I fell asleep back there because I was up so late last night. And the Chris, you're going on and like what? And I wake myself up right out there. And there are a few questions. And they let us leave really the same last time they made all the winners of the previous year's April the end. They're two of the main of the open bodybuilders say till the end. So I got to sneak in the early. He used to suck back there. But come back. My neck and head still hurts. So I'm going to roll out on the ball right now. And then I got to shave my whole body down to a fucking naked morat. I should say corny to get a shave my whole body down. My job. She's shaving my butt. Yes, today. Just just true love helping me fart and shaving my bottle. I'm not gonna let her go. You guys think this should talk, Lamar. I will actually the boys are probably like it. I was giving him an abdominal massage that he could pass a gas like a little baby. And I was shaving his butt inside. And not to the ball. Not that like in fact by me pretty much I was like scooting your butt over and like you know. I'm pretty fucking lean right now too. There's not much fat hiding my butt just glute. And then you have hair right here. So my baby needs to like bend a little. He's like I don't want to. I'm like, bend to suck and shave. Sorry. No man wants someone's hands down there. It's just everything my body's like, don't touch me down there. Well, it had to get a morat status, you know. We had to fully shave down with the razor because my tan is tonight after the meat grease. So we're gonna do that. Give me grease. Tant like 930. And then come back and sleep because I'm gonna be fucking exhausted already. So I'm still doing on. I had a meal backstage. We ran down. I had the eat. I wanted to meet eat right before going on. He took a while. I don't even know what I ate. What did I eat? He ate 140 grams of salmon. 150 rice. Yeah, 100 yum. And then 100 red. And now he's going eating the same thing but back to meal too. So instead of salmon he's doing beef back to full light. Around 2.30 I think. Yep. There you go. 3 team does it again. So yeah, he's just gonna. I'm gonna roll my neck up to get ready. Do you want sweet or what? I just want to eat my lunch. I have a whole sweet. This meal babe. You like it? I can never remember the whole weight this meal. You want to thank the blood? No, I'm not.

But it doesn't look like a lot. Like when you wear it. So when you do that, it's like going. Yeah. And it means something. That's what I meant. Yeah. So thank you very much, sir. Of course. It's very nice. So that's great. Now it's not like super crazy. That's what I want to be. I want to be like subtle. So it's super easy. I know. I know. You just look at your box. What's the answer? I'm hoping that like damn. It's markedly. Yeah. That looks good. Yeah. But it doesn't look like you're just passing. Yeah. I didn't want it to be like body. Yeah. Guess we're committed to the look on now. And then where are you going, Matt? I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I don't know. I'm just going to be a change in there. I'm going to be a change in there. Right. Should I set? And we're off again. So I'm going to time's light down today. And I'm going to die. We just shake my whole body down. But like, now we're, he's posed a bit of time. Now we're headed to the end of the night. Because I am being done. There we go. Get to meet a bunch of people for a few hours, which is fun when I get my energy back. But right now, we're not long enough. Because we have a tan immediately after. Get home at like 11 again. And then chill out tomorrow. So we're going to get to meet greet. Be some people. Have some fun. And get home with the night. Can we get some photos? Yeah. Okay. Let's do like, let's do one. Just like, we'll fall it up. Okay. You can't find it line. Actually, can you sign this for my little brother? Got a marker? Okay. Do you want sign this for my little brother? Okay.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh my. Did he come in the Cho운? Yes, sure. Yeah. We should be at our dinner and have a really good night. I did it out after two to a bit of hours, but there was so much of a line. If you were one of the people I'm so sorry, I was so much inspired and I had to dance. And I was also wondering if you guys like to just sort of get a ride. So everyone saw the camera. I appreciate you guys. I love you guys so much. I will be doing more of me, Greece. Much possible to see you guys. Sometimes I just can't see everyone. I really do my best to do it. But so one few weeks ago we had lunch because I set my stage on my best and I got to do what I do. I do my best so I'm literally going to fall over at the point. I love you guys. But time to get stand up and go to bed. We're going after that means we're in the boring meal. But still taste good to the food. Yeah. 40m, thanks to your 50 grams of weight, right? That's 160 grams of chicken. So, so cardamom, it's a fucking blue turt. But so taste good. So, get it down. Give it a hand on. What are you looking at? We're always coming after you. Yeah. You're turning around and Derek just naked on the chair. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. Yeah. Who's that? She's a family character and he treats Kate. I think it's about seven. What shall we check? Good. Right here before the show. Big day, carbon up, even some food. Eat some good food yesterday. And that's not good food, but a lot of food. So, I'll get the eat. And I woke up the same way I woke up as Wednesday. So, my, I fluctuated my water a little bit. I had less, but I thought like, four liters of water yesterday. My way still coming down. So, that's like, my body just like fucking sucking it up. So, breakfast was going to be 100 grams of weight. How much did you get? 150. 100 grams of oats and 115 grams of chicken breast. And then I woke up late and still not flat, but like not quite full fully yet. He's like, I had some more oats. They actually now let's those as some rice cakes. Because dry shit, I'm like beautiful. That's a rice cake. So, he saw me having a rice cake here and now I'm going to be kind of going over some guys. Everything I'm eating today. The day before the lunch, the day that matters about getting everything inside of you. Tomorrow, you hopefully wake up looking like you're supposed to look in just a crime tuning of your little thing. Eating like, well, our rice cakes, a little breakfast, some rice and potato and simple things. Keep your luck that you already have. So, you're going to be trying to go over all that today. And do what we do in the field. Take a change. If chicken is so much better, I'm going to taste like this season. Yeah, super big. I should have been a doll. All right. So, because we're a little low-hunter like I get some fats in, but I didn't want any more water in my oats or anything like that. So, he's like, rice cake and avocado. What have lost them on the butter? But this is obviously a nice little refreshing way to finish off breakfast. Calvin gets out of here. So, I'm just filming this as a coordinate. Don't try not to miss anything today. If I've tried my deus, I miss a meal for them rushing in. Not thinking that my brains have fun with me. But I have three rice cakes and 50 grams of avocado spread on top for a little bit of the laced fat. And that will be the actual wrap on breakfast. So, be safe. All right. What's going on guys? We are back to some old school Seabomb South Folder eating blogs with the camera on the box of Nutrivalet. Great name box. If I had a my house properly camera up, and here we are. Start with meal number two. It is approximately 10.45 in the morning. Day two going on no water. It's just getting out of their joke. My cat is logged. I'm actually still drinking water so it feels good. But this meal consists of 140 grams of steak. 100 grams of sweet potato. 100 grams of yellow potato and 150 grams of white rice. I am definitely going full booze eating filet right now. Every meal and it is absolutely amazing. We will probably make a lot of my steak. A lot of you here today are just like you chew it. It's like butter. You get no flavor to be beautiful. And it's just a lot easier and you're something to get down. We are eating right now and everything right now I am doing is optimal digestion, optimal bloating because I don't want to have a bowl of stomach or vegetables passing through me. How healthy. Delicious. We have healthy oven eating. I am cleaning everything. For so long. I buy it and I use eating ship foods. Some people want to carve out them when I have hamburgers. They want to have treats, chips, sugar or whatever. And you can get bloated back of your digestion and you are something to take your digestive water. You don't want that. So you get all super organic clean healthy fresh cooked meals. By chef Courtney here's the back. Doing the damn thing. Fucking smoking off. It's a pretty damn smokey. It's a fucking smokey. It's a smoke of fire alarm. She's been killing the game because in the middle of the day and they're all bland, no sodium. No seasoning. Just food. So. I'm going to put this down. I'm going to watch an X-Men movies specifically Wolverine. A watch. Origin Wolverine. Now watching Wolverine. Then I'm going to watch Logan. I'm going to skip out the X-Men bullshit. Because I just want to watch you Jackman. A couple of heads off. So I'm going to leave. Even I'm meal. And I see you guys for the next meal. Alright. What's going on guys? We got Coach Man in the corner here. Almost serious in the sunlight. It's just a little bit like a monster. Just a mysterious man in the back telling me what to put in my body. I was like, you know, some beautiful salmon, rice, and sweet potato. I love eating all this fucking fats right now. You know what I love my fats right now. I love everything right now. But salmon fat, all this stuff going to me. It's helping me just have energy right now. Nice having like energy through the day. Every day I wake up and then go back to bed. I just couldn't say a week. And now I'm like, I'm alive, you know. It's good to feel back to life. And looking better and better at the time was on. So people grateful plans going. We're doing good. It's 1224. And number three. Getting the carbs in and chill for the day. So this is it. Rice, sweet potato salmon. Meal number three. Check it out. See you for number four. All right. So meal number four. It's only 2 30 PM already for me. So beautiful day. Now I got some avocado. I wish I could stuff avocado in there and turn it to work in Moli. But still delicious. I got some white fish. 275 grams of rice. Five ounces of white fish. Like 140 grams. And then 60 grams of avocado in there. And sprinkle a little much of lemon on there for flavor. So that's my condiment for the day. And eating this, getting it down right now. Delicious. My parents are chilling right now in the room. Corny doesn't have to pant to them. I was going to. But I didn't know if the parents would want to be too. But mama pop up on the center right here. Yeah. Mom and dad made it. They've been to every single Olympia. They're here to support. And this is our kind of, this is our chill crew that we can just lie in the room in the relax. So hanging out eating some of the people from raw just came by and dropped off a little cortisol for me in the nice little note. So you're sending their love and support. So much appreciated. And yeah, that's it. I'm hungry so many eat this meal. So you guys are million them in fact. Yeah. Just like do a like kind of a right of a street. Like do any kind of support. No. Okay. Okay. That's what I guess I'm starting to like. I'm so, it's been like 200 or more. I'm going to. All right, we're off to 10. Number three. I just told you miss another meal. I'm sorry. I didn't miss using one, but it was a bunch of 300 grams raw weight, breast of potato and some steak. So same old chef. But I got to fix it in my pocket. I tried organic, thick, sodium free sugar free. Well, no sugar added. These things taste like crack right now. I'm not going to do a sugar and have it. So eating this on the way over there. Get a tan. Got a meal with me. You don't want to eat it over there. I'll probably get a naked tan. You might be able to naked them off on that. So three quarter day of eating. Sit, two. Now it'll be like seven, eight meals and I miss one meal. I eat it. You eat it. Yes. One. Yes. One. One. One. It's a big boy. I think you need to leave and walk me back at the toilet. You need to go to... Okay. A little tanning booth. A little naked brown dude. Played dude. Brown dude, black dude. All in the same brown in the end. And once I'll talk over the way, I'm ready to rock a roll. I'm ready to rock. Yeah. I'm ready to rock. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm ready to rock. I'm ready to rock. I'm ready to rock. I'm ready to rock. When you got to eat, you got to eat. This has been a number. My favorite thing. I think I would eat a lot of cows. I'm eating over two hours. I've no idea you've been to any more. It's like 150 grams of potato. 150 grams of rice. And 140 grams of salmon. I stayed kind of put together. I already had one. But he said he wanted to be eaten. Every two hours. I'm here. I'm not dry yet. So what better is waiting till time. That he's salmon right since the potato. Absolutely delicious. I enjoyed it. Hopefully by the time I've done I'm dry. I think I could get the pork out here. I'm going to go the bad. I'm going to eat a good one. I'm ready to go. I got to go the bad. I got to go. I got to go. I got to go. I got to go. I think I've got to go. with this, right? I mean all in here is stronger real. So I think by tomorrow. We don't that quite. I want to see that quite further. Push down that quite. Right, pushing down. There you go. Yeah, so if you want to see that, Yeah. I want to see this deeper. Yep. I'll be right up like just... Guys here. Boom. Boom. Go up and then go down a little bit. Go up. Yeah. There you go. Don't let me back too much. Right there. Perfect. Try such a straight. Getting some nasty way. You're gonna make it back. Go ahead. Go ahead. Back looks like... Yeah. Good. Give me the most muscular crack, not most good. I'm scared. I think yes. That's a fucking rush out. I'm not sure what's that thing. But just don't you feel like it's digesting? Because if it's not, we can do anything. You can. You can make it through me. That's what's pretty up there. You know what I'm sure that. You shouldn't have. Only once, but a good chat. Just me one. Try my sneaking in. Pop there to this one. Right. I thought maybe it looks like you're gonna crush that chat with your cookies in there. There is some. You're hitting under the stick. I'm pretty determined. That's the moment I... All right, guys. So it's gonna be the final meal of the day. Right. Same old ship. Got some potato. Some rice. Some for life. I mean, you know. Finish off the yellow thing this. Click nine o'clock. Gonna go to bed after this. Try not mass out. Get some good sleep. And we can shred it in the morning. Right to rock and roll. Tomorrow's game day. Going to the plenary now. We're gonna get a good plan. Put the whole squad here. Right to go early morning. One more ten. And then we're heading over to the. Comments and center of the Venetian. Get on the stage. Show them what we've brought. So. Let's do this ship. Let's do it. End time.

Yeah. That's from last season though. I don't know where it is. I took it. You took it? Yeah. Well how would I use it if you took it? I'm saying you should have. Yeah it's first bread bread for you to have a toast and then more we can eat. She got a zet. These are what I was doing. Passed it? No. I thought it was Canadian but then I did a podcast with these notebooks and they're from Toronto to ask. How he said pass that he said pass stuff. So, maybe he told me he was just so. Okay. That's okay. I should have passed my breakfast right there. Butter and honey? Delicious. But that's it for breakfast. Nothing crazy. I'm going to calculate that right now and then sit down and eat this and all that you know how many calories I just ate. Alright so breakfast. Holy calculator. It's 1,073 calories. 59 grams of protein. 47 grams of fat. 101 grams of carbs. Beautiful way to start the day. 10 to get huge. Cheers. I'm done. Thank you. Alright. So, going to be beautiful. Sweet potato. You've ground turkey for some reason. Ground turkey goes way better with sweet potato. And chicken goes way better with rice. Typically how to do it. And I was running out of food today but always prepared. I have a bumble in the freezer. So, it's defrosting right now. Somebody to eat for my next meal. For now, I'm going to have a number two with 180 grams of ground turkey. And 250 grams of sweet potato. Jalsa's meal rakeo. Nothing. 400 grams of sweet potato. 400, 180 grams of calories. So, smaller meal. Breakfast with the kind of like 40 grams of protein. And I didn't really call them. So, I'm going to steal some of these ketchup from the fridge. Too much ketchup. Let's do lunch. We're going to spoon in there. It'll make sure that you're going to be happy. Yeah. The potato. The reason is that corn you make it for a market. Because you check the whole potato. They're putting the oven at like 400 for like an hour. I don't want to have for some shit until you can put a nice throw. It's really soft. And then you just scrape it out. And it's like big potato mashed potato. Super easy to mix. And then you just have a big container of mashed potato. And the fridge. She's going to make my kicks and I eat it for me. It's going to be a little tricky. So, everybody wins. But some meal number two. Take 12 o'clock and I got 12. 30 lunch time. And I'll see you guys for another three. Alright, meal number three. A beautiful, old bumble. I think bumble from make a fit meal. Take a fit meal. Take a fit meal.com, shut up, plug. I honestly don't know what's in this. I'm going to have to go on the website and pop the calories. It's like 180 grams of beef, brown rice pasta in it. I'm like a marinara sauce on it. And it's a easy way to get on a bunch of calories. Perfect with a bills in the off season. And a beautiful, pretty workout meal. I'm going to put this down. You did take some caffeine. So the gym get a workout. And then I'll see you guys for a number four. Tip, do you want to be in the shot? No. Definitely not. Alright. Like what you got. Don't be a jack. Go home. Oh my god. You got it fucking twins. You got it fucking twins. You got it. You got it fucking twins. You got it. Alright, so post workout meal. Courtney cooked up some ground bison patties. We'll have some white rice with zippy because we don't have any bison to have the burger. And I don't really want to anyways. But, meal, do my row. 500 grams of bison. 250 grams of white rice. Probably going to put ketchup on that again because ketchup is life. And he's already going to ketchup. And that's what's going to be. This meal comes up to about 766 calories or so. It's super simple, super easy. And clearly you guys realize it's starting to bulk out. I don't know if you like poo. This is the closest thing to a burger I would ever have consistently. I don't know where the discretion of body building. And just eating like shit and getting huge came in. Could body building. And this shit was like a healthy way to help your body and to be disciplined with your diet and put good things in your body. Care about it and it turned into people eating fucking chick-fil-a and McDonald's and delicious bison needs. Crumble. Not crumble. The fucking breakfast. Like coming these. The breakfast sausage is whatever. The matter is like shitty prickook meal. And you understand that what you eat literally is what forms your muscle you're building. And people who go get massages and are fucking like beat up and do section caps and have black shit coming up and like all that shit from the gross side shit you got to cut it again. Cut it on. Cutting. So because you eat like shit and that's what's sitting in your body. Stagging in your blood and that's what you're trying to build muscle with. So get that shit in your diet. You healthy food. Get some nice bison or just can be. It's not putting shit in your body because of how people will. And it'll help you be a better body. It's my rant of the day. The body called me just like a few minutes ago and he told me that there's like only like a few places you can get like ground veneison and elk and like bison like grass fed from. I got it. It's like oh can I? It's hard to get that kind of stuff. It is inexpensive but like cut costs somewhere else in pay for your food because what matters more we're putting through buying literally you are what you eat. The whole other shit you know what that. I have Dr. Marlon always massage me and he's like grow your tissue is like tight sometimes but it's like malleable and like loose and soft and like fresh feeling because they drink a lot of water. I eat really healthy food and I give my body what it means. So do the same and you'll feel better. The last longer in the body building world. And in life I guess. I think my book okay if I just close it on my YouTube channel. Check out what according to keep it up. What according to keep it up. Why do you get that on the shot sorry? I think so too. Don't do this to me. Oh dude. Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me. It's like dog shit bro. Thank you. They give this new box. You green box. They agree. No when you come home and you see a flash of green at your doorstep. You have some beautiful food. We're going to find one mega family. I'm going to play that clip. Well, one where I can't pay for your face. Because I put your face on the big tree. Yeah. Yeah, I thought that would happen. Calpad was all the honey. What was that? They give it all. All the ladies all over. Trying to set new. I got a stick burrito ball. Thanks. I'm going to get better. Just a little bit. I'm going to be looking super boring though. They're literally just chicken and rice. Stake and rice. So there's not much going on like setting here. But I'm one of my amy this weekend and I didn't want to cook or get an airb of me. So I found a hotel with a microwave and then literally just bringing like 16 of these. So hopefully the trip that I don't get skinny. Make it for meals.com. Let's go see them. Loki's home mega face. He's an absolute life thing for so go buy yourself some humbles. But my final meal is going to be chicken and rice because I thought I wanted to eat. Why is it frozen? They make this really fire sauce. It's like a lemon olive oil. Dressing. Bang. Fire. Love it. I'm going to be good. Stay there, bear. I gotta do your pause. I'm not ready. I can't do it. I gotta do my pause. I'm not ready. I can't do it. All right, so last meal is a day. It's going to be a mega fit custom meal that I just got beautifully delivered at my door. It's 180 grams of chicken breast, 200 grams of white rice and then there's like 20 grams of olive oil in the season. So it's a nice fats and easy food to digest. I've used some protein shakes all the time before bed. Sometimes I have like a sandwich and a protein shake. It makes me feel like bloated. So I'm having a normal food right now. But this comes to about 200, 400, 500, 600 calories or so. approximately, about 4. But that brings my total calorie count for the day to 3,559 calories. 369 grams of carbs, good luck number. 121 grams of fat and 240 grams of protein. So nothing super crazy here. But simple foods and like I said, I'm literally eating this and pretty much every day. I'm not eating my shitty food all the time. The moral of the story today is to eat healthy foods and give your body the fuel that it needs to thrive. I just get calories and because you want to be huge and fat and unhealthy. Eat healthy. But this is the beginning of my abs, and this is probably the lowest my food will get for a very long time. So I'm going to be enjoying the ease of eating this food because there's no problem getting this down right now. My digestion's on point. Sleeping good. So I really can't complain. Come back to me when I'm 360 and fat. But it's good. The goal this week is here. It's not to get too chubby enough. Season. Stay lean. So we're going to keep the food low with a normal, more cardio and just being a little bit more, more, more, more, more, with medical with my eating. So first, I'll be eating for the last season of them. Thank you for watching till you never. Well, first of all, my time is having to ask you something. What do you guys want to be? First of all, when are you going to increase your calories? When are you going to increase my calories? Good question. I'm going to go another two weeks on this. Chacking my weight, my weight doesn't go up at all. I'm going to increase my calories by like 400. Show me right around 4,000 calories. And then I'll just do that for a month and see where my body goes. I'll go from there. Second. All I want to take for you to reverse to this point. I'll take to reverse two months, eight weeks. I'm going to take a long time. I just slowly started putting in my food and then stay lean. I kept my cardio for a long time. I kept my cardio for a long time. I kept my cardio for a long month out of pure laziness. But the last two days I've done it, let me get my shit back together. And holding it through my ass even. But in eight weeks I was recovered. My body wasn't like in a deep shit hole. I could've been in some preps. It was a much healthier easier prep. So I would've recovered a lot faster, hopefully. If you consider eight weeks fast. Great.

Let's go on Two Meal number two Looks extremely kind of stuff I've got to tell the master It's like a jar of less meal I've got to play with me I have some of my two right now So I can see it My apologies But super-plamed This is actually a meal from Megafit I just put it in here If I want to add beans to it Yes I said beans Cornier disease organic beans That come in glass Not a can I'm not plastic but a glass It's totally organic They're corny cell beans And I'm getting my fiber So from Megafit I have 180 grams of rice And 180 grams of chicken I'm not a big meal And then I added like I don't know A random amount of kidney beans Into there I don't know exactly how many So this meal comes up to only 480 calories And like 45 grams of protein Super-plamed I'm not eating a lot right now I literally wasn't even probably getting my protein goal Like last six weeks or so Since I'm still on beer So I'm just totally ramping my food back up I don't need to go crazy And get fat right now And the bowl is just as I'm getting back And the training Give myself more protein more calories So that as I'm progressing and training And progressing and food Instead of just going all into my food And getting fat So I'm kind of slowly Regressing and watching my body We've watching my body fat I've gone from there Well trying to get some good digestible Fiber So I can go to the bathroom Well I might get this healthy And honey mustard Because honey mustard is delicious So meal number two Very basic Let's get it Let's get it So you also have to clean it Oh yeah, how does it take? Normally I wouldn't do that I honestly kind of made me I stomach feeling a little like Not hungry So I'm eating this at 2 p.m. right now But that's okay Fiber is tasty So I'm gonna have some cake No I'm gonna eat this And I'll see you guys I'm gonna live right here We're basically going to push that core out You know, first relax a little put like a little A little bit of a chocolate So it ain't keep it down the line And then just drop it Everyone like can't skip Sprung it like whatever And then it goes through another cover It coats the whole thing again And then it has a drizzler And you could like drizzle the bar So that was the direction you want to go I missed your meal You're gonna turn it to a pretty good amount I don't breathe Dangerous Fog is chewy Come on, good pot When you think of that pretty cover How long is real good? It's crack It's bad about any race between Every five so that's really good crack Delicious Alright meal number What meal is this? Three Thanks man We've been all over the place today And I very late on my meal right now Normally it's like three or four to five forty But this is the goat meal I'll make it fit in my opinion the bumble Because you see me make it my brown rice pass up And gonna be a fit to pass up And they put some really good seasonings That's how I want to do so I'm not sure if you can change it really good But this is my favorite meal right now Pancakes with chocolate chips are pretty fire But I don't know if my chocolate chips So it's probably my favorite meal today I don't think that's exactly what I'm actually going to have to ask them For it because it cuts the my that make a little bit bigger for me So yeah brown rice pass up and beef this is the goat So we guys want to check out my get through meals like up I don't have every meal for me or you should have two a day Five days a week so I should bring two to work And it's a lot easier than meal prep meal at the time Sometimes I meal prep but it's just so much easier Have anything plugged in my fridge every day So this might go to It's at the bumble it's literally sea bummedable because it's best But when it's all that uses I'm really fucking stuck right now I'll probably fetch from my pillow As we go on And then I got a cram in two meals before bed Because that one is better because I'm turning on my good sea table So see you guys I could go for a meal full Jogging cook Because I'm not allowed to eat the shit I could sell my babies I'll technically buy a travel certain Favorite Alright so here we are with meal New Merrow quadro And I calculated the lot I pulled up the last meal from megaphit Because they have all their stuff Track day and have all the stuff on my fitness belt But I made it a little bit bigger because my meals a little bit bigger The 720 calories and 48 grams of protein that meal So there meals actually have really good amount of protein A lot of other meal companies have like 25 grams And they're no bueno But anyways, moving on to meal number four Have I said I have 350 grams of raw weight yellow potato I'd shake diced it up Throw in the air fryer for like 15 minutes with some olive oil spray on it And it's good to go I got some zucchini in there For a little bit of vegetable and a little bit of extra flavor Why not? And then I have ground turkey And I combine 98 percent lean with 93 percent lean Two packages in one to make it 95 percent leaner whatever And it just tastes better than not a dry And that's 210 grams of that I'm honestly eating so random right now That's I don't know exactly how much protein that I think it's 50 grams of protein in there 51.9 grams of protein But for those that are like starting off season starting in plants And I'm dying for the first time to try and track with the first time Biggest tip to you I can say is just eat consistent for a while Don't even worry about it and when you're on a consistent realm Track it, see what it's going to be at And that's probably your baseline If you're fat or than you want to be, eat less If you're skinny than you want to be, eat more Right now, I'm a little bit skinny and I want to be So I'm going to track this right now, see where I'm at And then I'm going to make sure I'm at least getting enough protein I want like 260 grams of protein I'm 250 right now a little bit more than that And then that's a bare minimum And then I'm going to up my calories from there Probably start with carbs and then add some fats I'm going to just kind of put whatever I want to into the diet plan But it's literally all you have to do And you know, normally I'd be like starting a full day Meaning I bet I need to eat biceps and calories for the full day Meaning just to look like I'm not skinny But that's not how I actually eat So I'm showing you guys the truth I'm not eating a lot right now And I'm still going to slowly put on weight Recovery better and say track it Okay, so to be number four, my weight free patees Cool down for the very hot And I'm going to cover them and catch up the catch up The life and it had been a long time I've had ketchup in my full day of eating So welcome back at you But miss you combining with the throught joke, ketchup's okay By the way, whole foods are getting ketchup But the best ketchup ever, my favorite But yeah, throught you ketchup See you later Really showing on my pills Yeah, so I'm on a huge pill kit right now Because I just finished the Olympia And I'm half an adi-cbum right now Not full an adi and I'm trying to get very healthy at the moment So I am taking lipid From my cholesterol, I'll bring up my healthy HVL And bring down my healthy L Taking liver, I'm also going to have glutathione So I got a prescription for it that I take twice a week Make sure my shit's all good Or make it 3, it takes all the time I have like 15 of those a day I don't think you have to do that But that's what I like to do I'm taking K2D3 Good for your heart, your grip bones, grip for your immune system All I could choose Taking heart is great for overall health Heart function, burn the butt Also let's draw on heart Turn my current inflammation and then Diver it support Honestly, this is actually a life saver Because what I was on prep My thyroid went to shit Much at all But I want to don't want to be on that long term So I came off and started taking thyroid support for my body And it actually helped a lot So yeah, getting my shit healthy right now And then I got to do blood work next week because we can have there See where I'm at And then get healthier, do more blood work And then the oxygen officially So this is what we're kicking my right now Test levels of 10 Test levels of 10 No, there are 300 probably I don't know 5 days in and out and I'll share it But I can throw it in the back Use codec above and provide subs.com I'm hearing you Alright, so according to the here But I'm going to try and make a monkey Without anything ingredients that coordinate me makes for me with it So this is going to be risky But we're going to go for it Also, I'm actually going to do a video talking more about health stuff Through those supplements right now, but that's not all for health And I think it's a very important thing that I would like that I focus on in my life And I would like to talk more about And just like keeping your body healthy, doing blood work, checking out And you know all the stuff that body building isn't healthy Gotta counteract it the best you can In other words, so I'll do a video talking about that in another time For now, you can try and make a monkey I got it And egg in there And tiny bit of egg whites Already in there And then I use vegan protein Because vegan protein is better for baking Actually, if that's good for the milk If it's good for the milk Never bake anything and you want to put protein in it Begin just bake better for whatever reason Other should get kind of dry, so That's a little bit of that, that I'm going to use some baking flour Loosen free, I normally use baked potato Seems weird, but like mashed potato actually works really well with monkey The corn he does, but I don't have any, so I'm going to randomly put 50 grams of this in it I like almond flour too, but I also don't have any almond flour So, you know, happy birthday to me And then pumpkin is a huge key to all baking Because it makes it moist and it's absolutely getting too dry But the only way I make these is I literally just like put the egg in there And you have to save the time out of egg you are And then you put protein and then I just add a few times You have to save the time out of egg you are and then you put protein and then I just add flour Until it's the consistency that I want it to be And then you just run the microwave But easy as it goes We do that texture Are you going to box this Totally give a bunch of that, but if it gets too small Even for egg white and flour You have a little baked Calvin Corn he's kind of the best I've been eating in general Yeah, this isn't actually, this is normally looks like what she's doing It is a sick fucking bread dough I have not given up hope yet, let me get somewhere I go in tonight Okay, it was the last thing that you should be doing in here But if you don't look like a baking your fucking moon or something You know what I do is with potato But like, not baking a potato at 10 o'clock in the morning I'll let it sit She's not that bad, look the life I've never done

He don't least please I have no sleep I don't fit me to give skinny legs Come on! Come on Chris! Come on you won't steal Oh, come on you won't be able to go for this one Whoops there Music What is up? YouTube Welcome to the first lady in the wild Did not want to film today Did not want to train to film It's a couple of years ago I think the analogy is random with kumi Some life in the middle of the night Well I think one of them But I'm not going to be a little bit today Because the gold nut is going to be a bit straight now So it's like right now We have a few new athletes out with the ball With the football Adam gave Nathan gave Joel Gabby We've got four people down here right now This training around the gym is doing chess today though And legs are just a little bit extra for me lately We've got just mid-double So, give me doing that So you can choose a couple of leg-dates I do like like one to half-time to weeks Then not on a seven-day slow right now But I've been combining hamstrings, calves and calves all together Just to get them getting back into it My legs didn't really shrink But I only need to come up too much right now My asses and begins, I'll probably split it up But I'll go over my split with my true asses And really get some of them I'm just kind of learning how to train really hard again right now So, I'm going to keep pushing myself Probably focus on mismission squats today There'll be a good go And go from there And it's warming up right now Turn out to hurt myself Oh And so I wanted to start This was what you'd do But everything I wanted to take in both hacks was taking in both of the chains up She's backspotted me What? She's backspotted me Real backsplots? Yeah It's too broken for that What? What? Just doing Why? Hit him, knees please I have knees please I don't fit me to give skinny legs But yeah, so anyways Starting with this And I'm really honny, want me to really focus on rebuilding Like good muscles And actually I'm not taking too much time off training Before I start getting the heavyweight So I'm trying to single leg and I'm holding for like a one-two second pause at the top of each rep So I can't anymore than I'm ripping out like three or four Really build And then my muscles can actually make my quads A During life Can be just for this workout just get my squat fight And then you need to do quad focus Miss squat after a long machine ready So hopefully my squat is nice and primed by that And I'll be tired again I'll hold you All right, so main first exercise moving on to Smith squats I'm trying to do these a little bit Close stance I might feet almost behind me under the bar and seven front of me And it's really driving your knees forward Because it's your body to stay up right? Or doesn't folding over like a powerless yourself squat It's just put a lot more emphasis on your We've been on your knees If you have bad knees don't do this but more so on your quads I'm just really trying to get some juicy quads right now Let's try out the Tom Platt style of Squatting is super upright close stance and make sure to keep it body up right So it's getting it much and much and the reflection of the possible The greater the angle The reduce between your calf and your hands ring The more quad-flection you're getting the more straight motion the juicy your quads get Simple brozans This one The acid Alright, typically they have to do walking on just forcing the leg like press only just to keep my head up. Tricky my hips even today. I thought I'd do something where I was sitting down. So we're doing this, trying to focus, it's just not really contracting each leg one at a time. Getting good range of motion. Can't get quite as much knee flexion from the leg press that you can't have squat. So it's a little bit more glute, but I'll part of the leg. So this next has got to hack squats after this, some machines, some calves and go home. I'll go forward. I'm not going to do this. I'm not going to do this. Well, how about getting your work up with out bands? My knees aren't taking me for this one. Can't see three. Very light head up. See the more? You know a lot harder at the end of your work. That's going to be it for me, I'll press it. Hands, we'll close the calves and anything to go back. And then, we'll close the calves. And then, we'll close the calves. And then, we'll close the calves. And then, we'll close the calves. And then, we'll close the calves. And then, we'll close the calves. And then, we'll close the calves. And then, we'll close the calves. And then, we'll close the calves. More blood, my legs are just in the long time. It feels good. Not a few bum. I guess half not a few bum. So, got it. Alright, I think we'll say, brain dead. Fuck it now. There. Alright, it's going to be a wrap on. It's really awkwardly quiet here, you know. So, I'm going to whisper. Get the fuck out of here. But, pretty good like this. Like I said, doing these like 1 1 1 1 1 a 10 to week. But, I'm probably the next mother, I'm going to just put my legs up. Into quasi hamstrings. Not a show to hold it to you, I know. But, finally, I also finalizing my app. So, I'm training on my app. You go for this.com. We're upgrading everything out of nutrition. A lot of cool shit. So, I'm going to keep letting you guys know what's next. They're tired when they roll out. But, it's looking prettier, more efficient. I'm going to talk more features in it. So, I'm going to say it for it. Put it in that. I'm going to get some food and you can't feel my head. Catching with some pumps. To be a little bit of a day to be alive. I'm going to have a first official photo shoot tomorrow for my manager. I'm going to have Calvin get some beer roll. I guess they'll probably get me a car free down here. Take some cool shots from the Olympia. Amazing photographer. Calvin will be doing a cool video. I've got the 18. Renting it all. Bronco too. I'll show you get it out tomorrow. Super excited. So, see you guys tomorrow. Alright, what's going on guys? Yeah, after like that. First photo shoot for my manager is going down.

=== FILE: Full Day of Eating ｜ Off-Season Bulk [sr88Fv6D87U].txt ===

What is up YouTube? Welcome back finally to another full day of you getting. Now you guys love these and they hold me accountable too because I'm like welcome that eating enough at the beginning of my outfit and I'm just getting things rolling. So I don't even know what I'm eating. How much of anything I'm eating because I haven't tracked anything since the Olympics honestly. So this will be interesting for myself. Given how much we were traveling, I was eating out two to three times a day for weeks at a time like literally not so. So I definitely wasn't getting an opportunity of getting too much sodium, probably a lot of fats. Much of shit in my digestion wasn't feeling too great. I had no appetite and eat my food would be like coming at my throat like acid reflux. So I came back home, chilled out on out eating for a little bit. I haven't eaten out in a while because I'm trying to eat clean and now we're getting the ball back roll. So that being said my metabolism obviously is an entire thing I want. This is because of my both. I want to eat huge but I don't want to get fat. So I'm going to be showing you guys what I'm eating probably four to five meals a day depending on how my day goes and this is just not me forcing food down just be trying to get calories protein, give them that wasn't going on. Make sure I'm recovering from my workouts. All that good stuff. I realized when I started training harder again but I was eating enough. I was so sore for like five days because I wasn't eating that protein my body was recovering properly. So I'm trying to get that back in so I'm not as good a bit. So yeah it's breakfast time and I'm hungry so I'll start cooking it. Okay. I'm gonna use our regular fat. What to do tonight? You go sit. Alright, so the final product. Honestly, one of the more aesthetic meals I've ever made in my life normally was like crap, somehow it's kind of came together. Got some potatoes, eggs, avocado, and turkey bacon. Like I said, I don't eat it every day, I kind of rotate it through breakfast because I haven't been in a good routine. So it is what it is. But this meal comes out to a thousand calories. Hestee and the fat. I cooked everything in butter today. Cording's got me hooked on the good old butter, chain of cooking stuff in. There's why the hell not. It's nature's anti-pan sticker and it tastes absolutely amazing. So loaded up on some grass fed butter and I've been covering any bread I eaten, ghee butter and delicious. So the macros to this come down to 50 grams of carbs, 66 grams of fat, 54 grams of protein. Pretty hefty fat breakfast for a while. Literally just eating bison, butter, avocado, and whole eggs and no carbs essentially and it was just other than from the avocado. But it was just a heavy fat breakfast and I was feeling pretty good. But I was getting skinny so I've been in a little bit of carbs and still have to be mine fat but the great way to start the day. This is like 9 a.m. right now we should eat between 8.9. Next meal looks up a lot of hours, be hungry by then and ready to rock. So I'm going to get this down and I got a little kiwi. I don't really have this very often but we are whole foods and it looked really good so I grabbed a pretty slight kiwi. Now I have some fruit with that. Call it a day. So enjoy this. See you guys with the next meal. I'm going to eat this morning and I feel really good to eat. You know what it's practically like being pregnant. You're being menstrual and you're being diagnosed with a baby. Why don't you have that abrassive morning because for some skin, you're huge and I'm like I've been 265 and I know exactly how it feels. And I'm like so true. Remember both of the 265 when you are not meant to be 265? Walkable flight of stairs and you are out of breath like you're in America. So I say it's the same thing. Quilf on top of the bowl and bowl and food on my stomach. It's different. Prairie women please. Or mom. Have my God. He just said no. The more pregnant women the marriage can you do is you get up to 265. I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. All right, meal number two. Lunch time. A little bit late here if I move the floor today. But I got a nice little makeup that cuts the meal. They make these sweet potato fries. And that are literally just sweet potatoes with some seasoning on it. So if you see any of them meals with that, all of them are always good. Sometimes they have a really good garlic mayo dip. Sadly, they didn't come with this one. But I have about 250 grams cooked weight of sweet potato fries. But it's actually sweet potato. And then 220 grams of chicken breast. And also grilled the chicken breast so it's absolutely fire. And I don't have to cook it. So shout out to Megapha for that huge lifesaver. Drinking my favorite beautiful orange juice in the crater. Great one, I love it. But this meal comes out to 577 calories. About 50 grams of protein. Super simple little basic. I've been slacking on even remembering to order these meals. Typically, Courtney will make me food. Sometimes she doesn't. Then it's completely my fault for not having food because I'm not prepared for my own life. So try to get ahead. Got a little mini freezer in my fridge in my garage. So I keep frozen food there frozen food here. If I have to forget a meal, I got that ready to go. So I'm always stuck up. Not trying to get skinny. So this meal number two typically I trained in the mornings. Like I said, so these meals now, which you kind of get in calories in. So I'm going to do it the day. So I got to say, I'm going to do it as a meal. And then two guys for meal number three. And then maybe we'll make something interesting tonight. Okay, so do that. So I'm going to make some of those. Been a long time. It's a bad abumble. So I'm very keen to have them these again. I don't know why. I just, Courtney's making pasta. I'm going to make just didn't order any bumbles for a while. But these are probably so one of my favorite meals. They get this is not the most glorious whole day of eating. Not very exciting. But real is what I typically eat. Placed brown rice pasta. Some red sauce, 600 calories, a little 40g of protein. Throw in the microwave for a couple minutes. And you're good to go. So this is going to be meal number three. I got to get out here. Didn't be in Courtney. I'm going to be doing a birthing course. But I need to learn how to have a big, she literally just texted me. They remind me of her for 30. She's reminded me of a 500 times. She thought it would be late. And it still might be a little bit late. But that's okay. So I'm going to eat this. Get out of here so she can't give me a ship of being late. And then come and go work out after that. I'll see you guys for a meal number four at home. So that's it. Alright. We're going to look for her. We're going to look for her. She's going to be a bit more than I have. Baby, pretty much I'm going to keep clearly ready as she's busy. She's doing a birthing course and I started it for her. Pretty much ready to rock. I think I could do it. I think I could do it. I think I could do it. I think I could do it. Yeah. I've got to be in her year with Spring Champion mentality, motivation. Teaching a set the damn standard that she delivers the baby. Because, you know, what? I think I could be a good motivator. You know, I thought about mindset, visualization, not believing in another way. You got to believe there's no way out. Well, there's actually no way out. Yeah. It's not that. But like when I'm competing, I'm like, there is no way out. I will never quit. So you just have to do it and your first thing. So you can't quit either. I'm just going to be a visual presentation. Part is going to carry the boats. But you got to carry the boats, baby. And the logs. All right. So meal number four. Some good old chicken rice, zucchini and carrots. You cooked these carrots? I'm sure they're carrots in there. So this is going to be down in there. She's cooking a little bit of butter. Don't know how much. I put in some whole foods, guacamole on this too for just a little bit of extra flavor. I've been on a huge avocado tit lately. So I've enjoyed that. That already drowned at all in olive oil. But another simple meal. Not even a whole lot right now. Just trying to get in my protein. So this meal is 837 calories and about 57-60 grams of protein. I've been eating higher amounts of protein. Typically I have like 180 to 200 grams of it because I'm only eating 45 minutes a day right now. I'm having like 250 grams. This is 250 grams of chicken, 250 grams of rice and probably like 100 grams of guacamole. And I feel like that's just the best way to get protein in. When you're feeling like you're slacking instead of having a 6-7 meal a day, f***ing impossible. Just eat bigger meals. It works and it still gets you jacked. So I'm going to digest you can handle it. You are winning. So yeah, I'm going to put this down. Probably the last full meal of the day. I'm going to eat. Usually I have a shake at some point in the day other than the morning at night. The night when the morning's going to have it at night. Then enjoy this. Do that for the final snack or whatever you want to call it. Alright, welcome back to my pantry. It's been a lot of time in here. We've got pantry. We're working on organizing it currently. So we have pretty much a whole supplement store. I've ever even bought a product in big emblocks. It's in the counter time. It's like two because it's a little excessive. Something like that. The job was to forget to have them and I get more. But I'm going to be making a little shake. I made this in one of my other videos. But I still love it. It's delicious. Using the raw cookie is a cream. I love this flavor. It's a huge fan of cooking cream. Everything. Favorite choice. Where is the child's fun fact? With her sheet cookie been cream. I love the way chocolate's little chips. Anyways, you two scooped to this. I have some ice in there already. It was a lot of milk. We found like a no sugar added, no gorgums and from gum. That's the naïdded. Oh milk. It's a little bit of calcium. And for one of the reasons I just had it in. So that's good stuff. To choose who's that. We are very honored. That's what we are going to organize the pantry soon. And you guys will see it in a beautiful way after that. Do a scoop of corn, sph, and some sun fiber. This is easy. This is a fiber of stomach. If you need it. And then I also feel some of her collagen. Oh, it's my neighborhood or what. But it is a 30-night and people deliver DHL Amazon. Whatever. And I live kind of far out there. You know, close anything. So I'm going to carpool that my driveway is. I'm like a jiggle. Fuck it. This. So it's got you. But no, I guess delivery people come. And all we have is a little bit of a knife down. Anyways, some of the collagen in there. I'm a hair growth doc. Nothing good. Get some nice thin down. All that good stuff. Put that in there. Mainly all I really taste. But protein in there. I'm not a lot of stuff that I've got. But I'm going to put keeping the scoop of almond butter. And then we've got roasted. Same. When I came about, macros last time I set up doing like a tablespoon of almond butter. And I did like three tablespoons of butter. That fruit-blood of pinkened butter. But all I got mum butter. So this is what I was probably too healthy to do. Never know, over the bottom of your tongue. All right. So this is the trick for this. I get this really Elizabeth Benilla chocolate chip. Essentially literally tastes like crunchy cookies. When I dump it in, after everything's already blended, just put away this. And then we'll put it in. And then we'll put it in. So you're going to get a rough ice cream out. Probably half a ton. Put your calories fish. And I'll put that in there. And we're going to quick shake. And you've blinded it for like two seconds. One too much. A little bit turned into like crumbs. You can't taste it. But if you do it just perfectly, everything is simply getting a little bite of a chocolate cookie. And it tastes delicious. Beautiful. I could've blinded it even less than that. It's like one second blind. All right. So that's going to be it for the full day of eating. Nine o'clock fish. Eight thirty-ish finishing the last minute right now. I don't like eating too late night. I'm not going to bed early lately. But my total calories for the day is 3,807. I've got these asap. It's been so long since I've checked my macros. I have about 280 grams of carbs. 130 grams of fat. 280 grams of protein. It's honestly right around where I want to be protein right now. From like that adds all carbs. All every like trace protein sources and everything into that. So weighing about 250-55 right now, 280 is pretty good. I could even handle a little bit more than that. In the past I've always gone back and forth a very important protein I need. And in last year I just opted and I'll see how it goes. It's just like I used to do when I was in college and I definitely realized I recovered better. I realized my body can handle more protein but it's also hard on your system, your digestion. We aren't getting through every shit tons but that's kind of up in the near, whether or not that's true. So I don't do that all year. But when I really need it, I'm going to turn up both hard and I'm not recovering. Like the peak of the pulse of my strength is really high from our the end of the prep. I have my protein a lot but being a little bit over one gram per pound of body weight is super safe. So 280 is good for me. I'm going to enjoy this and good after every time I start going from that camera with a immune. It's so nice by the way if you're bodybuilding, you can be like 5-6 minutes a day and then you go to just eating three and not carrying any calories you get. But every time I go from that back to actually tracking and trying to eat more food, I really have how much food I have to eat to get it in like the back of the cylinder 30-800 calories. It's bonkers to me. I actually like I did use the consistently eat six-5 calories a day. I'll probably never eat that much again consistently because it just sucks. But I still got some oxygen. I gotta get away over 30-100 especially to get my metabolism rolling so that when I do start to die, I don't have to start myself because it really does help you. So I'm going to get working on that but I'm not going to go anywhere over 4,000 calories any time soon. I'm going to open my body just to this. Bring it my training and 10-10 so I'm actually using all that food. You have to kind of play with those numbers. Watch yourself, watch your scale, watch your body fat. If you start getting too fat, then everything just starts to fall apart. You don't feel good. You're in some sense if you get the fuck to early on and the beginning of your grow season and everything starts to fall apart. So really easy to do it. Focus more on healthy, amount of carbs and fats. High protein and lifting up your training intensity and watching your recovery and your strength and health progressing. And your weight of course so just track everything with closely as possible. And I'll try and kind of show you guys how I'm doing that over this office. But you enjoy this, let the dog go, tell him in the name. See you next time.

=== FILE: Full arm workout with my baby mama. [TTpdjyryzZc].txt ===

What is up YouTube? I'm hooked on my morning routine, a mask bin, and coffee, and you'll actually like something I showed you, so do not again. I'll be warming up water for Courtney, so I'm not moving here. But I've been in this awkward phase of like sleep trying to actually sleep a lot, because I've been traveling so much and then I can't sleep. On the west coast, I can wake up early early, go to bed early and I feel great. I'm going to come back to the East Coast, which has been every other week pretty much. I can't sleep. I can't sleep early. I can't wake up early here. I can't even talk in the morning. I haven't. So it's been a rest of me trying to wake up early in the morning, but Courtney, the doctor's appointment, the afternoon is morning, so taking the day off, one of the gym at like 9 a.m. and then we're going to go to appointments, but I've been trying to keep the body's work else, but it's kind of later than normally right now. So I'm going to have a shake right now. The night boy who's just over and he took all the cinnamon and cranberry cereal that we had left in the warehouse, go through your soul dough, and it may be really wants some milk, now I'm craving it, but I'm going to give him a stroke of gold, so I'm going to have some of that. But yeah, I'm going to mix this up, but I've been using this mouth tape and I've been eating for a while, and I just got a different type of mouth tape. It's called passage tape. This is not my sponsor, it's literally not because I'm still this morning. I ripped this thing off and it took off half my mustache and I fucking hurt, but I've also used surgical tape and it's got tape and it's put like one strip down on my mouth like that. She's keeping my mouth close, could one little heavier and eating one point on some weight I would breathe for my mouth and then I sleep like shit, and I pee like 20 times throughout the night. Using this stuff for any other tape I've been pee like months and I sleep in way better, still waking up late and really tired. So hopefully if I catch up on my sleep travel a little bit less, one of the hell that's going to happen. I can actually sleep better, but for now, I didn't want to get so many mixed up the shake, drink this coffee, get a bunch of liquids in the electrolytes, protein, no carbs, I'm going to go work out, we'll upper body care for each of you daily, we're okay, just instead of for me so I'm filming out of Kelvin and then I'll see what's going on today. So I'll keep me. All right, so I'll provide you day. Gonna be traveling for the next nine days, essentially tomorrow we're going to add land and back in the same day. The answer is that we're going to Vegas and we're going to Dallas. So the next couple of days and probably not really going to get a full workout in, at least not a good one, so I'm going to do a full upper body day today. This is a Justin King workout, one of the guys got to come down and put me through it before. So I'm going to do a little bit of everything, supersets, arms, back, chest, all the good shit. Really only one exercise for body part and we're going to move through it. So I'm warming up right now, a bunch of external rotators, trap-up areas, doing like 20 reps of them and my fucking rotators and traps burn like crazy because I never train these things properly. So I'm trying to get those stronger so my posture is better, shoulders are more stable, less than injuries, a lot better. I'm also supposed to do like a neck strength fitting thing with the medicine ball, but I don't have one so I'm going to use the band and then do this little warm up a few times and they get on with the workout. Mgov, boom. Whew! We're in headphones. Do you like my music? No, I do. Well, I use a new birth course. There. Upper body. You? Baby. Baby training there. Baby training. So, it's five. Get after her. What? Alright, so, Tryna warm up. I'm not even supposed to be really training like a bodybuilder right now just in trying to build my body up to not be injured. Like I keep doing all these little things. But, not came. Well, people come and I want to train with other people and clubbing shit. I want to live heavy. So, I did some heavy shoulder press. I haven't even benched over 120. But, I showed it press 120 because I had to train with cool and people here obviously. I'm sure those are tight and sore. Like you haven't been in a while. And I got to do upper body day today and I'm feeling it because I just haven't been training heavy at all. So, I feel like the only way for me to ever get back into it is just to train through the pain. I have a little pain in it. But, Justin's more of the preventative, rather than reactive when you hurt yourself. So, you're in the really stand for that kind of shit. So, I'm combining the best of both worlds right now. People around, I'll lift heavy on a train like bodybuilder. But I'm also going to follow the program. So, I feel like I'm feeling it today. But, still going to try and go ahead because I want to be strong. Alright, the goals for both of these sets. So, you get three working sets of eight to ten rounds. And the tempo is three second negative. One second hold repeat. So, on bench, I'm trying to use three seconds down, pause for one second up fast. On the semi-supernated pull down, pull it down. One second pause, let it up slowly for three seconds to control it. And he does it just in does it, where he wants to start off with a 20% variance of your working sets. So, if I started a 100 pounds press, then the heaviest I should go to, the 120. And I keep that variance at high or if I have to drop, I only go down 20% and then as I progress in the program, you want to bring that down to almost like a 10% variance. So, I'm building all three sets at like 115, 125, rather than 120. So, one of his little things of getting strong is possible. So, we're going to give it a shot. Oh, now. That was a hard eight, not gonna lie. Hard enough that I thought it would be. I'm not sure I can do another eight here, but I gotta try. Very made that. I thought these things posted on, I think it was fuck Jerry News. So, I don't know how accurate it is. But some billionaire is making a version of the Olympics, where you're allowed to take steroids. And I feel like, first I thought I thought it was like the coolest thing ever and it would make some crazy shit. But realistically, I'm not the athlete, probably I'd take shit, they know how to cycle it. And all the good athletes who are training from the age of like four because their parents are fucking crazy. Probably won't let them take drugs or cycle properly. And those are people who are training way harder than someone at like 30. Who's like, fuck, and I'm taking steroids and do the steroid Olympics. So, I feel like even though it would look really cool, it sounded really cool. The nattie people in the real Olympics would still always beat the nattie people. Just because I truly believe a lifetime of proper training and nutrition for something even with that steroids is more beneficial than taking some gear and trying to blast it off quicker. Especially for performance sports. When it's not based off muscle mass, I got a building. But I would be interested in seeing various things to say. If I wasn't nattie right now, I'd probably enter them myself. Probably get waxed too. Cross it in hands would be dope though. I'd watch that. When I'm trying to count reps and tempo, I can never keep track. So do this weird thing where I go like one. And I go like one, one, one, two, two, two. Because I can't go one, one, two, three, two, one, two, three. I'll lose fucking track well the numbers. I normally don't count my reps at all, but I'm trying now. So my little tip of the day to count. Just looks like me. I can't dribble at all anymore. Especially with my arm pump. I have a shitty dribbling even in high school. Fly about basketball. Also ordered a hoop. It's coming tomorrow, I think. And I'm going to put it right out there. So I'm between sets. I can practice. That's all I got. Corny, you can play basketball, right? Corny claims she's more athletic than I am, so our kids are going to be really gifted. I didn't see her the least athletic. I just said I thought my sister could beat you in a race. She probably can't. She probably can't. Not long distance. Not long distance. What is that? Let's see. Drill ball. Yeah. Oh, I can't even catch though. Are you between the legs? I can't walk. Actually, I'm going to get that by far. I'm going to walk in dribble. I'm going to walk in dribble. Really? Yes. She used to play basketball a lot. I think. I think. I'm not a ball. I'm not. We'll see when the hoop comes. Play some one-on-one. What? Can you quiet me? I can't. Breathe out! Breathe out! Breathe out! Breathe out! Breathe out! I'll sit in the fire! Congrats. You slipped! Asking your EXTRASE. Evening. I've beenbilited always. problem with the semi-subinated grip or subinated or mega-fingin general your forms get toasted like a fucking I don't even know what you call this oven mitts alright, I think I've done this before but I'm switching up the grip a little bit because I fucked it up last time but it's a mechanical advantage drop set so I'm keeping the weight in the same but I'm moving my arms and grip to make it easier for myself as I go along so I'm starting with semi-pronated clothes, semi-pronated water and insupinated water where I'm strong so we kissed middle strongest hopefully I can finish a triple super set with that bang I think you're gonna have to hold this thing up close fucking forearm blaster working this was a take 10 seconds rest that was a little bit heavy for me but it felt good so I'm gonna drop it down the two 10s instead of a 25 so 10 pounds total hopefully I can finish the set like that I'm supposed to get 10 pounds every part of the tricep I got like 8-7 there so lower the weight oh no oh come on oh alright let's get me a wrap on today's workout I'd skip one part of it because of shoulders I did shoulder the F today but I was supposed to do a standing Arnold press I didn't make any of the job set but I literally just did shoulder the F today was enough so we're skipping that one I convinced Kyle not to eat his right to crispy treat before the workout so I'm gonna open it oh you opened it you're worried about to take a bite and you're eating it but now it's sitting here so I'm not gonna eat that but at the wrap we're heading to Courtney's doctor of the appointment now the check on baby bum see how the bulking phase is going we're bulking phase right now though alright the next four weeks six weeks baby's gonna go half a pound every week at least so I'll tell you a fucking huge I'm on the bulking baby bum we're feeding each other all three of us so training a big inject but we're going to be late so we got ahead of this appointment and see you guys later Thank you

=== FILE: GROCERY HAUL & A BIG OL’ CHEST WORKOUT [CXBfNVdh_tU].txt ===

Pastor Bird. Pastor Reed's no hormones. Your steroids. Good life for free not to get second hand series. Oh, my God! Come on! Come on, Chris! Come on, you're one in steel! Oh, come on, come on, you're one in steel! Come on, Chris! Come on, Chris! Come on, Chris! Conversely! I'm gonna be really late headed. What's up YouTube? Today, Chester is a Sunday, Courtney left to hand for E3 yesterday. We're traveling so much, I decided to stay back and just sleep recover. And every now and then I just need some more time to decompress. Come, take us a time I need for myself. So, I'm home alone this weekend, chilling, grinding, going better early in Chinese days. So, training Chester and pretty much all this going on. I'm talking the younger life, I said it's dropping. Probably maybe before our afters video comes out, probably before. So, you may miss it anyways. But Chester, we're trying to press some heavy dumbbells, warm up with her, it's fucked up, it's called Tecde. So, I can't see straight because I'm my head right now. But, get my chest warm and then we're gonna tune the tremles and heavyweight for that. Stay tuned. Alright, that's it for Pecdec. You three working sets drop the last one because it's again fatigue. I'm not trying to kill myself, so no supersets are drops, it's anything reset my work ethic. I want to focus on my power to push some dumbbells over there, so I'm gonna go there. Most have done this half-season 140, so gotta get 250, and then hopefully this year, I can request to buy some dumbbells over 150. Trying to get stronger than I was last year because we didn't have that opportunity, so, see if I can come and down to buy some big old dumbbells later. So, I'm gonna go there. I'm gonna go there. I'm getting absolutely shit sleep because my allergies are getting bad again. They just go up and down. And it really makes you realize how fucking important sleep is. Can I feel so weak fatigue that will cope with the headache? What's up on life? Fucking blowing my nose? I feel like out of my presence sleep is like the biggest, obvious, one youth seeker for getting it. So sleep. More. Alright. I'm gonna go there. I'm gonna go there. Alright. Yeah. We're gonna go there. If you want to go there, you just ask me about it. I think I'm going to go there. I think I'm going to be like, can I go there? I don't want to say anything. I'm going to go there. They're so early having it. I'm going to go there. I'm going to go there. I'm going to go there. I'm going to go there. I'm going to go there. I'm going to go there. Alright. Alright. So I just did two sets of inclined dumbbell because it was heavy. I'm trying not to overtake myself right now. Focus on getting some heavy combat wound at the beginning. I'm going to build my strength and move on to machine. Flex such. This is like one of my favorite machines. The flex lever is all piece. They actually converge a little bit. I'll obviously part of the function of the chest is to bring the elbow across the body. If you're pressing it here, it still hits your chest. But it's different. Deeper type of contraction when you actually come across in converge. So you know it's going to change over the best for that. And yeah. Doing this three sets. And we'll make it up from there. You can see it. It burns the mic. It's not even put in the upper. It's a bit of a bit of an inch taller. This is in your gut. So you have it. So if you have an elbow, you can do it. I don't know. How long? It's going to hurt your collar. Like I said. That's nice. I got one. I'm going to do this for 20 sales. So I can't really do any de-kind decime presence. I'm going to show you stuff like my labor and my tour for ever. Never probably can be 100% so I can't press down here. If I go into a neutral grip, I'm going to be able to fly on the cables here. I'm going to really close the elbows to the body. I'm pushing down on here. I'm still getting like peck matter squeeze. I have this one to do a de-cline. But no stress on my labor. So I've just been like a new go-to. I've done the last four or five chest days. I've been enjoying them. So keep it a try if you have fucked up shoulders. I can't do de-cline. I'm sure some are not going to take that all year. You're going to like get me with these white flubbers that call them. All you still wear back in college. I wanted to know what Jim Gear was. I was like pants, show us from Walmart and my speeders. So we're back in nostalgia. Kind of like it. I think we're going to let this take me to keep my gut in that all-tones. But we got the barrel hanging in it. Can't know that. Movement of the day. Did like three flies over there. Kind of like a close press fly. I need more of like a wide fly. I'm doing like a close to feed eat not full failure in the fly. I'm bringing it in and I'm doing a bit of a press where you're a little bit stronger. And I can bang on a few more reps. It's kind of like variation of a superset but not wrap it up here. It's like close sets. And college a day. So kind to like. The puffs man. Don't push. No chill. Oh shi bir, go! I guess it can be a Prochesse. Honestly, these are little chest pumps. We have a new RTD pump and it's got liquid glycerol on it which is amazing. A bunch of beta owning shit. That's the chilling out of the gym. All that good shit. I took it with no caffeine today and it actually gave me a little pump so I can't complain. How did I told you guys going to the town right now? So I'm left to send from my own. I literally have to put the plates that I threw in the garbage when I told you they'd do dishes. Probably won't do laundry so she's back. I ordered a shit ton of make-of-fit and the probably new version of it like pre-cooked chicken or four fucking snacks or something because I'm hopeless as ever. I've become very codependent on here cooking skills and here providing so grateful for that but what she's gone, I gotta make do with what I got. So I'm so pissed off I'd throw it after this kitchen food but the rough ones today chest day, I'll see you in the beginning. I'm not even up in my supplements at all this year and I've like forgotten that I haven't done that so I'm the training card at uni properly and growing and getting stronger without them so it's kind of nice honestly. This will be like when that he crisps looks like when he's like retired from bodybuilder so the future is great but I gotta get some food so catch you guys later. Alright, it's a post-workout meal. We are going to sprouts the Easter Sunday right now and we are so lonely. No family, no Easter dinner. My parents used to always make a beautiful turkey like Thanksgiving style dinner on Easter and now I don't get to dinner more than before so kind of sucks but I'm gonna go and replace the Easter dinner beautiful pie and gravy and stuffing and mashed potatoes and baked turkey and I'm probably going to eat some chicken nuggets because I love chicken nuggets so yeah I hope they're open now because Easter Sunday. Google said they're open but we don't know if they're open so we'll find out soon. Stay tuned. Leave you guys on a huge cliffhanger. First time around the grocery store. It's the last time Courtney was at a town. It's sad to get this stuff alive but someone's gonna do it you know. Whether in the store did you have a picture but you got to show her sometimes she sent me here and I usually get the wrong shit and she has to correct it. I think it's what it is. Is that Harvey? Yeah. Harvey fitness is following us to the zoo and stalker. She'll be GT 500. He's James here. All he pots. You haven't had one? Yeah. You haven't? Yeah. Wanna take a mountain valley? What? I don't know. Boring. So you nice in? Sorry? Still you nice in? Yeah. I'll get the nice and paddy. You're not allowed to eat the meat anymore, eh? I'll get some of you to rub it in your face. I've been through the blood cell count two times so we're gonna let it be the more. When I tell you it's all he ate, it's all the other ate. So I'll catch that. I'll catch that. Yeah. Honey's coaching Calvin. He's gonna be going into the 2024 Olympia and replacing me. I just bought like four pounds of medicine to put such. This is the best brand. You got the interest for one? Yeah. Always. It's going hard and low. How good is it for you? The only way I can eat hard and lower. Good, hard and low. It's gross. Pastor Bird. Pastor Bird. Pastor Bird. No hormones. You're still your boys. Get that for sure not to get second hand surgery. I can't see. Holy face hair. No. You're the mango. Mango scares to the best. Pineapple and chicken rice is almost as good as pineapple on pizza. It's delicious. All of their juice from my smoothie. Okay, if you're gut. Very healthy. Rice cakes. Rice cakes. You're the rice cake, King. What did you use to put on it? No. I was checking it. Oh. Oh my rice cakes? Yeah. Hey. I've got to check it out sometimes too. I think we're talking about some milder videos. These with a waffle maker. That's right. I've never tried the protein one. So, we can go shop. Because it's just that water to the no protein. We can check out the Mexican food. That's what we see. Roll any ketchup. Get your good life. Can't look at that. So they're feminine if I walk around like this. Look at their purse and watch. Real men carry them. Those chips that are really like here. These chips are fucking so good. They're veggie chips. They're as crispy as the real potato chip. There's one. The jerky guy or what? I'm glad you're here. Do you even try those? I have those protein gross. No, they're amazing. It's the real reason I came here. It's chicken nuggets. Can you catch up our life? Yeah. Delicious. Corning out like these but the big ones. I don't know where she found me. This is why I can't come here without her. Well, it wouldn't be free and not good for you. No, no. What does that even mean? I'm glad to myself have pretend that it's a little bit free. It means you're healthier. Absolutely. Nothing. So, cool treaters. You got my guilty pleasure. Some time to throw it in the freezer. I'm a late night gummy. Pull the dead of the freezer. That's where we go to bed. Alright, so, survive the trips that go up your store. And didn't die. So, they don't go. I know Courtney's going to make a button. We've been going in there. We've got her, but we did what it is. Made it through it. That's the chicken nuggets for a beautiful Easter dinner. What else would you want on each dinner? Is it chicken nuggets? It's a little ketchup on there. Watch them that book that's living the Dan's room. Now the question is, it will even fit in the front. Look at that. A little fit. It's a practical chunk ever, but it'll do for free. It'll do for small grocery runs. See you next time, babe. No, it doesn't look like I used it, but I actually did it these days. Since hard day, I don't even do it in class. I would just turn my heart rate high. I don't even really try my heart rate. My heart rate was at like 145, 145, 145, 145, 145, 145, 145, 145. I'm like 20 minutes straight. My heart rate is 142, 20 minutes, like right. It's so pretty fucking bad. So, that's hard. What? I don't think that's hard to do. I'm saying like the fact that my heart rate was at LV just from biking. Not that there'd be a difficult thing. It's not a good thing. I think my heart rate would be at higher. Do 45 minutes class. I'm trying to be healthy. I'm not saying it's good. It's getting... I wish it would make a fit or cereal. I'd have to sandwich that to me. I'd go. No, that's one of the other. Pretty cheap. Or make a fit. What? It's always cleaner here when court is gone. I know. I know. But it's okay. It's all not like clean right now. But these are clean. There's a dirty actually, but... These haven't told me what I should do yet. I have their cereal. I said both. Well, they're one of the other. So... Well, cereal is quicker. But... Yeah. cereal. I'm going to put some cereal. That's just in terms. And the beauty of cereal is sometimes I'm really like an hour so I'll eat it again right after. But if I eat a big meal, I don't really feel like... There's a rest of all your three wishes. The box isn't a garage. It's sick on one half some too. We have boxes of the cereal, which one you want. It's a minimum of the best. Yeah, I don't know. The special maybe cinnamon and the special ones. Actually those are honeycrunchies. But I'd say that one might go two post-workouts. If I'm having like late night cereal, three wishes. Because it has some protein in it. But the post-workout. And it's like different GI carbs. This is just like pure, fast-ighassing rice. Crisps. So I have this... I probably should put almond milk on it and not put my protein in because I like fresh. Light almond milk is my cereal and I'll drink a shake on the side. Lots of liquid, but it's more hydrating as I look at the whole case. I'm also probably going to have this like some banana milk. Courtney made some all natural ingredients. Very healthy. I'm going to have a gluten-free banana bread bread before she left. So I'll probably have to have that last night. And I'm probably going to have another bit after I have some cereal. So the post-workout is delicious. It's a big part of it. It's a big part of it. Yeah, this one's a keto or something. It's all fiber in the sugar. Let me try this one. We're big hands and three wish each each. All right. So I only had this little bit left of this. My favorite protein is a last little bit for a while, actually. So I only want to keep a slightly scoop of chocolate in there. And I'm doing a scoop of... This. What do we do? I have some gluten in there and also, we put it down some fiber. Because fiber helps you put. I have like two scoops. Two and a half to three scoops of this depending if I have beans or not. And that day, make sure we get all my fiber in. Hashtag health. You can do it's even. But yeah, that's the post-workout shape. Just a little ball there, isn't that? Yeah. Sure. It's kind of a sad amount of fiber. It's all the rice crisp. Rice crisp. I have less. But that and some extremely corny king style milk. Unsweetened milk cashews. No added anything. There's filtered water. I think cashews. No gums, no bullshit. All games. It typically do almond milk. Honestly, what I learned is that blanched almonds, which means the shell, for whatever, the skin off of it. They tell they make almond milk. And that's actually anti-inflammatory. Well, I like my anti-inflammatory shit. Sometimes almond can be inflammatory. If you get a lot of them, it's only because of the skin on them. So, if I drink a lot of almond milk when I heard that. Because it doesn't love almond milk. But according to like, to make it same without. So, doing this. But as you can see, we don't eat trash cereal in the house. Like I said, my full day of eating. Not just about getting calories in. It's the type of calories you get. And honestly, you should be eating all whole foods and that's great. But I like to eat cereal sometimes. Invernantibrid sometimes. So, there's healthy alternative ways to do it. And I'm not going to shit your pants. I'm like a liar to you. I don't know what that means. Once you don't have shit stuff for a long time, you don't want it anymore. It's not like, oh, if I'm going to eat cereal, I'd rather just eat like you try them. No, I actually would rather eat this cereal and I'd rather eat this. Because like you try them now, like two sweet, two artificial ones. I don't even enjoy it anymore. This is like equally as enjoyable as anyone else would eat any real sugar treats. But it's actually better for me to just don't like refine process sugars and all this other bullshit. So, it's a lot better for me to do it if I do it consistently. And I don't even do that consistently. So, treat your body like a temple. Do any bullshit. I'm going to follow you guys. We're getting X. We're getting X. Are you getting X? I don't know. To get a race. I'll let that digest first. What's your opinion of Tiger Woods pulling out of the master due to a leg injury? What's my opinion? I said good for you. I've do what he needs to do. We feel like you have to do anything. But you tore your biceps and still competed. So? I'm just saying. You're the middle of the master's? He was at the final round of it. I don't even know that it needs a glass hole. No, they got one more. They do. They do one more round of like the all the holes I think. I think he's trained through like fucking broken feet before something. He has broken. I think he's like torn as ACL. His fucked up his knee. His lower backs all fucked. He got from the heart of your knees. If it was pretty hard. Really? Yeah. Would you go from your turn? Maybe. Probably not. All you guys are wrong for those of you who haven't even have to say. It's fine. I mean, shitty for the first bit. But it's actually fun when you start to get like balls on the fairway and stuff. Yeah, I'm usually bad. I feel like I'd hurt myself too. I'd hurt my wrist. That's what's the driving me into fucking fucking their wrists up. Turned the wrists and do's. So you decided not to cook all the ingredients and you just feed it up and make it fit? I just cooked those that steak. I just cooked it on the trigger. You can cut it up in the cube. You don't have a trigger? Oh, yeah I do. I just cooked that steak about it. You judging me? Yeah. Fresh cooked gourmet meal. I saw an, um, what's it, Joe Rogan's on YouTube? Joe Rogan was making a Tomahawk Alkestake. I like really good. Tomahawk Alkestake. Yeah. That sounds pretty good. I only had to hunting one of them. I've done one of them. I want to believe we left over again in America. Catch man in Moscow hunting cry a little bit because I don't actually want to hurt anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone but I like. And then eat it. Nope. Come on. Come on. Come on. We need to be paddy to do this video. I'm going to see you there. So we can watch myself and eat steak. The last thing I ever want to do is put it like that. Off for a hot. All right. That's going to be wrap on to these video. If this is before May 12th, I already know what's not. But some May 25th April, 25th. Young and really drop. Let's go to see what. Make it sit. Cool to see what. But for real. I was talking about eating healthy in the last few videos and we're going to be doing a transformation challenge in May. We're going to launch the registration in May. And then we're going to, I want to do a sick giveaway this year. So comment below something you want to see. If you have a chance to change me, maybe I should tell a money. I don't know what to figure something out. But I really want to encourage you guys to actually be healthy. We're going to put it here. Like an ebook of like proper eating healthy eating and it's going to be a transformation child. Not just like get jacked. So we can ever put themselves in the best shape. And we're going to do that. We're going to roll that out with update that's hopefully ready for my app. So we're doing like a full like update weight logging tracking all that stuff. And then in like six months from now we have a full nutrition system coming in. So we'll probably do another transformation challenge in. But that's coming soon. So stay tuned for that. I may be do a full day of eating where I explain how to maybe build your macros a little properly before that. And then there'll be more. So explain for those who enter the challenge. But that's what's coming up. Not much else to be going on car shows this week. Maybe going to tamp in next week for summer shredding. Maybe. But that's it. So thank you guys for watching. Remember to subscribe. Like the video. And we're just there goes. Don't tell me that man I'm home alone tonight. I'm already paranoid. Alright bye. See you later guys.

=== FILE: GROCERY HAUL OFF-SEASON WITH CBUM [LtSMBD9bVBM].txt ===

Alright, what's going on guys? Just kidding. What is up YouTube? I'm the throughout how YouTube has been so long. But we're here at Sam Cup. I'm gonna be running you guys through a bit of a grocery haul. I'm slowly starting to work out again, but not really full training because I'm so not supposed to train because of my hair. But still trying to get my diet on plan. I've been slacking on meals a lot, so I'm gonna do a little grocery haul. I'm also not a diet, so I like getting some snacks and some good stuff and there's some great snacks here. So when you run into you guys through everything I'm buying right now, last trip before the holidays, and then really gonna lock in my diet afterwards, and I'll do another grocery haul that. So let's get to it. Alright, where are we start? Next was for Courtney. She'll get her a nice, old-hand, or they have a soft she'll watch it soon. I don't know if I should avoid this snack aisle or go through this snack aisle because I have no self-control right now for food, but we're gonna head straight back to the meat aisle and stock up up for breakfast. Alright, so I love sandwiches, so turkey breasts is the goat that goes on it. The fat box is the turkey breast. I'm gonna roast the turkey breast. I don't eat these a lot, but I just love sandwiches, so I have probably one every other day at least, and I stuff it full of meat, so this will last me like a week, maybe. We've got a tired of eating lean meat after prep obviously, so I'm actually been, I don't like eating a lot of red meat consistently, like multiple meals a day, so I've won, but I have been eating a lot of salmon, so I'll have salmon like one through twice a day right now, taste absolutely delicious, so Atlantic salmon is the way to go to. Let go. Two fresh fats, we'll make a threes, one of the goats fats that you can eat, so eat a lot of salmon. By the end, as been the go-to ground meat, I'll get like sticks and then bison. I actually kind of like the flavor more than ground beef, and because it's more of a wild game animal, not actually wild anymore because we live in American 20th century, but they're less likely to be farmed full of drugs, all that kind of shit, so I stick with bison lately. Two dollars is $68, two sixty eight of pounds, the hell if we could price for chicken. But unless the chicken breast can't beat some chicken breast, and Corny has a master of frying them up, the go-to-me-no's now, so I actually been enjoying that. Chicken and rice meals always a fresh go-to. Alright, go, they only have one of these left, the USDA Prime, beef, tenderloin, aka filet minuel. This is my go-to cut-of-stick. Some people are like, it doesn't have enough flavor, but I don't know, I love it. Little barley and then some, and to me taste amazing, it cooks taste even tender, so it's always my go-to steak. A little bit bougie, but I like it. Alright, the bag of chopped kale. I don't use it for salads, and I do not use the poppy seed dressing that's inside it, but if you fry this up a little bit, either on the stove or in the oven, it's like some olive oil coconut oil on it, fried in a little bit, gets crispy thrown and chicken and rice oil tastes amazing. So, try it out. Alright, I don't know if this is typical in Florida, they have these year-round probably because it's Florida and they're the orange juice state, but Canada, we only get these around Christmas, I mean, it's a little bit of a time, these baby. There's another word that you could call them. I can't remember. If you remember my sweeties, they were coming. They were something else. But I love these and they're nostalgic at how I'll bring like four or five to work with me every day, and they just taste great, and I enjoy them. So, plus why do you mean see? What I need to do is nostalgia, I don't even know how to drink that one. I was going to give you a piece of that. I'm not fit in through here. Alright, this is my treat of choice. People are like, what's your favorite treat and never have an answer, but recently I have been absolutely enjoying chicken strips, aka chicken nuggets. But when you buy the ones that are called chicken strips, we're usually a little bit more bougie, and then they're breaded a little bit like lighter and crispier, delicious. So this was like a honey mustard, honey mustard mixed with like mayo or ketchup mixed with like the raw chan, dip them in there, fire dip, so I'll be enjoying that. Sweet potato, chop these up, skin them, chop them up, and now that I'm not dieting, cover the shit out of them with coconut oil. For some reason coconut oil will make some of the most crispy. Either a spray or you can melt coconut oil and drizzle it on top. Put them in the oven on like three, 15, set of 400, and they actually get crispy. I burn them a little bit. Just to get as we would say to fries, and they're not deep fried. So, another go-to. That's really a good idea. That's kind of cool. You can actually pretty fire them, stock them at home. Who actually is? Are you a user? Yes. I am too. Are you awesome? Very cool. Yeah. It's my normal thing, according to my groceries, but you know, sometimes I've got a stuff because she's pregnant, can't always leave the house. Ah, y'all? Not today. You have frozen, they passed the frozen vegetables. You look like a dude. You have fucking frozen vegetable medley. This is a lazy man's secret to chicken surfries, or any kind of surfries. I put him in the microwave for like a minute or two and I just throw him on the pan and let him get like a little bit crispy, and then I put my right thing to get in there. Taste fire. Delicious. Pizza bagels will be fire. I'm not gonna lie. See, if I was like actually working out and doing cardio from my allowed to, I'd be spoiling a little bit more on some snacks and treats, but I got my chicken nugget at least. It's trash. The place all that was about managing next to you. Maybe. Full eggs. I am absolutely over egg whites, so I'm making sure you know these are broken. That's what eating egg whites for fucking four months. I'm eating the yolk from no extra egg whites, so it's all I'm getting. Literally debating in my mind right now if I'm out of you, I probably won't stop just gonna leave it. I'm gonna pretend I'm being that healthy right now. You could definitely go for some raised strength. So it won't walk by that fast. Single ingredient. All that actually two. All mint and salt. I always try to make sure that the next one added oil to this. There's only $7 for a giant tub of lime, but it's actually a great place. I'm off complaining. I'm trying to little shit about my toast in the morning. This is Calvary. It's toast. It's not something you need to tell her when you're at my house and prep. It's still. Figured. Why did you say, oh, this is your life's wife? Well, like I said, it's pretty straight. It's a little bit more like breast-room. I don't think so though. I don't think breast-room is quite expensive stuff here. I think that's America. I feel like becoming a dad. I'm gonna have to start liking stuff like all those black-loak ration. I don't know if I'm ready for that. All dads like those black-loak ration in the root beer. I'm sorry I'm actually like a root beer, so maybe it's coming along, but all those and black-loak ration is just not for me. All right, that's the third thing. No. We're making a better version of that for a month. I mean, that was not quite insured. All insured is sucking sugar with it, pretending it looks just a meal. They probably are better than that. That's with my grandma used to drink it, but they taste fire, but we're making a better raw to do so. Coming soon in the new year. This is always super cool to see. And we've come here three times. At one time, they had everything in stock. And this is the second time that there's one pre-workout left. All the creatines gone. So a bunch of protein, but we have extra protein anyways. So pretty cool. Coming in a grocery store like Sam's, not the Zings on the shelf. And especially seeing a lot of the sold out. So I knew you guys had our here at Sam's, but I appreciate you guys for some of that. And if not, take us some damn crazy prices. So be sure to check it out. It's wide, man. I'm fine. Good, dried mango. Very elderly snack to like to. Look at these. Pickled pasties. I had one of those here. That sounds disgusting. Do you have any popcorn here? There you go. Yeah, the variety pack. All right, I needed a snack. If you ask me what I wanted to get as a snack, it would be these. I'm gonna actually have these ones that peanut butter filled press with our fire. But these are like my little lover snack. When I go on trips every time I see them, the airport I buy them. There are a lot cheaper to buy them at the store. So find a box of those and they're actually low calorie. So I'm still working on not getting fat. The bulk will be coming in the new year. I think that's everything. I'm leaving in like six days for Chicago and Canada. So I'm running everyone's way right now. I'm feeling like I'm having anxiety, we're never on staring at us. So I'm going to walk out of the hallway. But yeah, I'm leaving like six days. So I think this will definitely hold me over. If worst case, I can just leave on chicken nuggets for the last couple of days I'm here. And then nothing's talking about fridge over Christmas. So I'm gonna check out and go home and see you guys there. I guess. Can you everything we're saying? It's an empty sack. It's about the full sack. Oh! Let me look back at how? I'm really ugly at it. I think it looks so weird. Oh. I need the raw credit card. Don't ask questions. It's probably every day at five. Are you coming home soon? No. We just started working. Well, I would like to go on. I'll take a Spider-Man or go to you on a pony. Probably the pink fits me better. What? The pink fits me better. Really? Yeah. If I want to Spider-Man. You got a mask with that, no, it's not a mask. Let's get number one. Those training wheels are not gonna hold as bad as this. You're gonna get booted at the start before we even get in there. Yeah, that's four wrapped there. I think that's a gen 2, the gen 3 up in here. All right, kids, everybody gets to pick one toy. We're giving away. This is qualified as a toy. We'll hatch it. You're too young for that. Put that back. Oh, this is pretty bad. I have to bring one of these. The massage gun. That's a good one. Big one. Big go bigger, go home. This is actually one of my favorite things. Building no things, though. Yeah. Had a track that was like six feet tall and a little full loop. Is that us? Which one? No, one actually looks like a little badass. Come back and shock them. Little balls. I'll get that too. Like Peli. As you can see, it's like a color gun. I'm gonna cut it like this and you could just come in here by whatever you want. A good life would be. What is that? I don't know. A little gel ball. It's like a BB. Yeah. That's what she did with that. Well, Charles, our little piece of nostalgia and every round. Look at my nail, like a little bit. That would. I don't want that. If we 500, 500, that would be great. Oh, or not? Not made out of money, kids. If you move it. I think definitely an iPad version of the computer. It's gonna be good. Yeah. From here. Yeah, could we get two pairs of AirPods in? Is it one of us a little rubber on them? Yeah. These are the third ones. These are the second ones. All right, you sold me. We'll get these. Okay. One of those. We'll get one of those. You have iPad too? Yeah. Grab an iPad. There you go. Apple watch. Apple watch. Get an Apple watch too. This Christmas, you know? Besides. Yes. Medium. I don't even know who's credit card this is. There's something in the car. I can't even count it on the ground. Right over here. Yeah, that's what it's gonna do. Look now. They got me. We add this to the order. How do you have that in your pocket bro? Yeah. Yeah. That's a great week. We're buying it for this guy. No, for me. I'm the child. All right, so we got a good old toy haul here. Got all I could shit in there buying whatever the hell I wanted under the raw credit card. So, God bless. But awesome stuff we're gonna be donating a bunch of it like I said. But we're also gonna be doing giveaway with a bunch of goodies. Gonna iPads and headphones, massage gun, bunch of cool stuff. So all you have to do when we make it super easy. We'll like this post. Follow it all you need and you get into it to win the giveaway. Just a little Christmas spirit. I'll be appreciate you guys. We love you guys. I'll be supporting. Good things coming for 2024. So stay tuned. Thank you guys. All right, so back in the gym right now. Not really officially starting to work out. I'm still not supposed to change for like another week. But I'm just gonna do a little bit of movement, train a little bit because when someone says take 30 days off what they really mean is 21, because they know you're not gonna listen to them. So 21 days back in the gym right now. And we're gonna be doing a little bit of a back workout for the next couple of weeks. I'm gonna do like four, three to four workouts a week. I think I'm gonna do like a push pull like South's, but just like ease back into it. It's fun to do some of that mobility stuff with the GBRS guys. It's like obliques my hips, my like joint inship, we're like sore. And you would think taking time off actually would help you feel better, but it makes you feel worse because I have a lot of muscle that was already tight in sore and not moving, sitting in desk, sleeping like this, everything just got more locked. So I have a lot of muscle that just got tighter because there was no movement to it. So by movement so important and while taking time off and then moving it all feels like shit. So I don't feel rested right now. I feel even more sore. But my body internally, my nervous system. I'm sure is rested more than I understand. So we're gonna ease back into training, do a little bit of back and buy today I guess, because that's what you would call a pull. And ease back into it. And then the new year when I'm back in like a week, I'm start really getting training a little bit more, got the transformation challenge coming up. The signups are gonna start probably on like January 1st for that. I'm gonna come back while you guys through how I'm eating, which is gonna be a little bit more fun, like sandwiches and our abshits and my basic ass bodybuilding prep, but still very consistent with my protein. Training, a little bit of cardio, stay in shape, not like good stuff. So I'm trying to get his workout in and then I guess this would be the last video until the new year. Dom sent me a DM yesterday because Bon posted a story training here. He's like, I bet you anything you're gonna have ham prints all over the mirror tomorrow morning. Bon? What? Bon? I just got the season's going to do it at Revive Gym. They're like, we need against? Oh, okay. Well, then maybe you're talking about you. He wasn't wrong. Damn. You're trying to get a little bit more freeway through it now, but it's so many machines and prep. But my body becomes fragile, I had a bunch of injuries like when I tore my lat. I had to avoid a lot of stuff, but I would like to be a little bit more stable and sturdy. So I'm gonna do now that I'm especially doing lightweight. Do some barbell rolls, pull ups, maybe some of those with training. Some of those rose DJ was doing. For the fact that he went up and grabbed a hundred pounds of one leg and just did that without warming up, I was actually impressed. I couldn't do that. So maybe I'll start with 80 today and then work my way up. It's cool when they're talking about one of his ways of training. He's like kind of warmed the body up, but not fully and he's just jumping into something. He's like, they have to be used to hiking for hours and then into combat. You know, you know, time to fucking stretch your hips and rotate our cuffs when you're... I've been acting. I've been acting. Imagine. I'm not gonna do that shit. I'll break them up. I'm still gonna warm my ass up and take my time. But it was cool hearing that. Yeah. Oh, shit. I'm eating a week you can get in six weeks, five weeks. Yeah. Hey guys. Good. Good. You have a mic. Oh yeah, looking at you. Oh, I'm not sure. What? Another day. You turn my mic off? No, I didn't turn it off. I'm not sure. Do all. How do you? Hi boys and girls. Welcome back to Chris Trading. Someone's calling. It's you guys. Take baby. Take girl. Take off a picture. Give me a day. Well, there you know, but we'll baby girl. Let's split with you times. You're a big thank you girl. I am, yeah. You're a good guy. Scary, but yeah. But the beginning will be great. Because I feel like she'll be my best friend. We'll team up against you. But teenage girls is terrifying. Literally no doubt. Yeah, I can each feel. I'm starting here. I'm going to hop back on trend for the first time. When she's like 14, get some more tattoos. Fucking shave my head. Ball girl. Beardow. Move DJ down. You might never. We're just going to fucking terrified. Anyone who just talked to her. I mean, we're a girl. Yeah. We're a girl dad. Yeah. It's getting quite a bit. I feel like a girl dad is like the best things to start with for me to like soften you up, you know. Yeah. After being a bodybuilder for 10 years, I've just fucking suppressed and compartmentalized everything. No more of that. I feel like I'm talking to you. Yeah. You're gonna be kidding. You always said, we're not fully injured. Well, that gets wild the girl, but you can't spoil boy. It's different. It's different. It's like you're gonna be upset with him. You have fuck. I put all this pain bomb on me. Like menthol CBD. Pain bomb because we're traveling today and I had to get in a headache. This shit fucking works. I'm like a lie. There's a few things I've taken of natural remedies that work. But I'm like frozen, sweating, burning down. Who's this hoodie with all this shit on? But it feels good. It relaxes my neck. I'm attention that I've homo headaches. It's actually helping a little bit. Not solving it. But it's helping. So, I might fucking be myself and menthol every single day. Now, it'll be like my new cologne. I don't have the quarter inch for this. I'm really happy. I feel like I can have four weeks of stability training and I'll be able to do a backflip on my snowboarding January. That works right? So this kind of thing, a pretty old как mate. I'm also a bit Annual in here. But I'm particularly fond of them, and that's fine. It's these tiny minor rails that I want. This got me another 80. Oh no, it's 90. But yeah, I'm not telling you. Understanding, I didn't know why exactly. Those are good other than stabilizing your core. But when you think of doing a rose, what I just felt in my mind, there's so much movement you can get from your hip and your leg and when you're bouncing like that, you have one leg up. If you let your hip rotate too much and you pull from that from the row, so the motions come with your hip rather than your back. This throws you off balance and you start to shake. You have to really focus on retracting, pull-chacked, and you're just going to pull it up and only roll it from your back. Keep everything else stable and just make sense, you know. So, not bad thing. Not the best bodybuilding thing because you can't load it as much. But definitely something you could get a good feel to get like a protected shoulders. Help with the move you're scapula. Alright, do some pull-ups. I want to get good at these. For some reason, I'm sure there's a biomechanic explanation for this, but pull down and don't translate the pull-ups at all. And they just want to get really proficient at doing pull-ups. So, I'm going to be pulling out pull-downs for a while. At least over-hand pull-downs to do it in their hand. Put in some pull-ups. You can only do like 10 right now. I'm like first set. So, goal is just to get more than that. But I don't know what I was saying. It feels more like a fluid natural motion. Just like my body can move my body around. And he's at the pull where it feels comfortable rather than a locked in position. So, we're trying to do right now because why the fuck not? Not to we feel the unbearable. You can try some new things. I stamina on these. Just about two or three reps. I'll only take a minute recovery set. Can't explode at the top. Explode to muscle-up. Drive your channel to the bar. Feel like you're a chef. Put your muscle-up? Probably. I'm gonna have a little bit of muscle-up. I'm going to go away. Why not? They'll know me there. You're tearing it to the muscle-grace? What is it this time? Amtering shoulder, lap, bicep. What's life without a challenge, right? Life is about the suffering. I felt really skinny fat. I felt really skinny fat. I worked out once. I got a little blood in my muscle. I felt my muscles were just tired and dormant. I didn't get that skinny yet. I just got to go to get my lose. A lot more muscle than this when I take time off. I'm going to at least stay here. Start building up from this spot. I'll be £300 right babe. Is this here? Yeah. Doing the open this year. I'm going to be bigger than Samson. Let's go. You said you wanted to do something. You tried to get a special debate. I don't know if you would play. She said it so gently as if I already didn't know that. I didn't use your credit and you liked to do things to what? So I'm like, what do you do with your face? Ooh. When did you cross it? Fuck you, I'd be okay with losing. I wouldn't even finish the first event. I wouldn't finish. I don't know what you did. I genuinely think that there would be more people watching this. I'll fucking care about it. How bad it would be? People who like the thing is I wouldn't even want that because it would be like a disrespect to people who tried so hard to get to the game. And then people are tuning in just to laugh at me. It's like devaluing their brain. Yeah, I hear it. So I'm going to train for it and then I'm going to win. Yeah, but like. It's like Matt Fraser going to the Olympia and competing against you. Yeah. People like the fuck's going to do me. But you destroy us on CrossFit. I'm not saying you need to do that. I think you could put you actually surprise yourself and you'd be better than you think. I would take 10 years of training and going back in time, 10 years in doing that, 10 years. Yeah. Like you could cross that or train that you like a body that was just too different. I would not do good at it. I would probably cross it. You might be like. Maybe when I'm like 35, I'll train for a year. Do one. Yeah. I would do the games. I could do like the local porcé and Lucy. Wad. Run around the parking lot and do some pull-ups. I should get you great. You got it. Even if you don't play. You just want to finish. Not a place. Do you want to eat a kid? I don't think we have the genics to get for a kid to go to the NFL story, buddy. He's like a big thing. There you go. I wouldn't stop him. I wouldn't look at an eight year boy and big. You're going to get brain injuries. You can't play football. He'd be like, what? And then we have a fucking kid walking around to help him to afraid of everything. No, he's going to try everything by himself. And he can learn from his homestakes. I don't think that's it. I'm not putting fear in his brain. I wouldn't be able to cross-fit because it couldn't stop training biceps. And I have really fragile biceps. So the tighter and stronger they get, the more likely they're going to tear. I wouldn't sacrifice them smaller. I'm just going to see some kip and pull-ups. It's not worth it. It's my snowboard training. Sorry, I should be doing off our mops like. I just hear her. It sounds just like that Velcro. I don't know if it's the Michael Paca. Let me just like Velcro. Alright, so that's a wrap on 20, 20, 3. See you guys later. Appreciate you guys. I feel like maybe I should do like a really recap selfie because I'm kind of fucking insane. You're not even going to remember what happened. I should do it for my own player. I don't remember what happened this year. But we're heading off to the airport. I'm going to Chicago today. Calms are going to trip too. We're going to pick this ship back up in the new year. So we're a Christmas. Happy holidays. See you soon. Where does he say, Quar? Hi, guys. Thanks for being the best ever. Love you all. See you in the new year. Bye.

=== FILE: HAMSTRING WORKOUT ｜ BACK TO CANADA [C7c3Io9f0kc].txt ===

But it's been a hell of a year and it's just my year of like flowing things down and being grateful for every small moment So this is a fucking big moment. I mean I get under a squat bar right now And I'm trying to go out. So now I'm not gonna be able to spot this in the council the rest of my life I should enjoy this moment. It should be present right now And enjoy this not just like thinking ahead of what the results that it's gonna be and this is another moment We're just the fact green here at all as cool. So just reminding myself to slow down sometimes Be mindful where I'm at and be grateful because life is fucking beautiful Why do you need to shit if you're not gonna enjoy it so yeah Come on I What it YouTube like it here good over by Jim has some new equipment so I'm trying out the pedad machine Testing some shit out how to tell me if we want to stay too I'm gonna bodyweight to warm up when you're in straight legs and then double walking on just but gonna Canada tomorrow So it'll be in my for a little bit So figured it out get a little like day before my flight back Canada, so yeah, so it's going on They tuned before not week. I'm not gonna dead love heavy today because I fucking a little back a little bit last time So I'm gonna focus on to chatting my hamstrings lunges and machines and trying to get some big thick like So oh Alright so they're like four variations I do for RDLs either dumbbell without touching the ground, barbell, dead stop, touching the ground, barbell not touching the ground and then dead look into a little bit more leg drive and hip than anything. The weakest I am is when I do barbell training control the stretch, don't touch the ground, come back up. So I do less weight with a little bit less tension from my lower back, it's also more movement less weight so less intensity. The more I'm patient, I kind of cycle through all the different ones. Obviously I love dead legs because I make the movement more than a weight. My nervousness in my lower back can handle that every week was to follow you in my train for everything else and to my parallel features. I do not do full body movement or get the foot dead lift and shit everything a week can you apply up and die? So small explanation of why I'm going to try and do full of five plates today instead of fit control a little bit more. Top set job at down to four for my second set, do a more body than today's equation. I felt like time was moving into slow motion, took everything quite. There's not a shorter easy sheet than I don't fit in anymore. I've never trained lunges on hamstring day. How can I get in like a lot of them? I need them, not warmed up properly. Normally I don't want them anymore, so I'm going to have to warm up my knee down hamstring day too. This feels good to walk in one. My heart rate got up to like 1.65 there. I don't know what the fuck can I do today. I will put my fucking back in action and it's telling me that my HIV is shit in my sleep is shit and I record my shit. So I'm going to get that shit in the trunk. This crepes there and I got to be on the phone. I'm taking my sleeping pills. What? I'm taking my sleeping pills. Your sleeping pills are brutal. It was just like feeding me down there or triple fan of something. Sure. I'm glad they're. I don't know. You didn't even know. I'm going to get that shit in the trunk. I'm going to get that shit in the trunk. I'm going to get that shit in the trunk. I'm going to get that shit in the trunk. I'm going to get that shit in the trunk. I haven't had this flavor in my sister came out probably. So I'm feeling nostalgic today. I know honey's about to tell me. It's for the chocolate chips and it's a good idea. So last few, a couple of times I can enjoy and they will say goodbye to me in chocolate chip. But yeah, I could have made a lot of it too. You didn't see me lose them. But we are going to all much to take a picture because we first do a video but we had to ask one more video. But we're on the beginning of the Walmart. Surprise. We have to go pick a picture out there right now. I'm going to change shirts and do a rock shirt. We're going to run over there. Snap the pick. I'm going to go look at my two months or two. Maybe for like a week and I'm curious what we'll stick right now. They were working on it. But yeah, we have a few new products coming for Walmart. Tell them we've got them in the back of this car. So I'll show you guys what those are. But we have to get the fuck out of here. So I'll see you guys later. All right. So pull that to Walmart. We're going to be filming a cool video here. I hope we're trying to get permission from Walmart. This is some new products we're dropping to. We got essential fruit bursts coming in. Grave flavor. Fruit punch but more of like a starburst eat fruit punch. It's not just like a plain old boring one. We got glazed donut, way protein blend. And then we also have electrolytes. Finally job in either the stick packs and I'm pumped to get these. It's what a fucking lot for it. No excited to have it. But it's pretty fucking cool coming to a Walmart. And again, there's no targets. It's just Walmart. So growing up my whole life when you need like a anything you've got a Walmart to do. Have anything and everything. It's pretty dope that now that anything and everything will include round nutrition products. So it's been a pretty fucking wild ride in the last three years. To be fired up to be by the shop and not growing. If I had to make a shop so well, then I'd like one of our first degree Taylor's. Now we're getting into Walmart. And a few other things that are coming under the raft. You got chains coming up soon too. It's not going to be a good talk. But it's been a hell of a year. And it's just my year of like slowing things down and being grateful for every small moment. So this is a fucking big moment. I mean, I get under a squat bar right now and I'm trying to get about this. So now I'm not going to be able to spot this in the council of the rest of my life. I should enjoy this moment. It should be present right now. And enjoy this. I just like thinking ahead of what the results that it's going to be. And this is another moment where just the fact green here at all is cool. So just reminding myself to slow down sometimes. Be mindful where I'm at and be grateful because life is fucking beautiful. Why do I need this shit if you're not going to enjoy it? So yeah. Really pumped for this. I don't have the exact drop date that we're going to be Walmart. But we'll be putting it on rock socials in my socials and everything. And I get it. I get to that really funny video. We're trying to hopefully if we get to do it, it's going to come out. But that's what's going on. Also heading to Canada tomorrow. So I'm going to be in my for about a week. I'm going to send mode at my parents house on the lake. I'm social media for a while. I'm going to bring a book. I think it was mom and dad going to the lake on their boat. And just relax. Get my mind ready. Go work out to gyms. I can hour away. We drive in this one podcast. Working out. Getting huge eating, sleeping, relaxing and getting ready. Start the dam prep. We were 12 weeks out today. Time to win a fifth of Olympic tail. And I've ironed up this year. Super excited to this one. So maybe a good year. Good big a time. And I'm excited to bring you guys along with the journey. So one week break. And the full swing ahead of things. And then we're going to get roll on this prep series. With my gym's ready. And usually we start like eight weeks out or so. So we'll see where we flow into that. But yeah. As always.

Day three, training with the trolls. You trolls today. What's up YouTube? Honey Rambad. What's the king of dad jokes? Yeah, there was even a bad joke. Yeah, there was even a bad uncle present. Especially when you asked, I wrote a little bit of a window because he couldn't tell there was marijuana leaves or fucking flowers on our steering wheel. That was a bad move. And she said she had weed in the car, but it wasn't on the steering wheel. There was this young girl driving her car and she had flowers on her steering wheel. It looked like weed because you know there's a little water leaf. But it looked like weed. Exactly, but it looked like weed. And he's literally like, I'm going to ask her. And he's like, well, then you're going to run like, scaring this poor girl. No, she wasn't. She was like, oh, honey, I follow you on Instagram. You know, she actually got pretty excited afterwards. She's like, they're flowers, but I have weed in my couple of days. And so I was partially right. She's like, thank you guys great to meet you. Have a good day. She asked for some weed though. No, it's the no weed zone. No, no. Sorry to interrupt. It's back. The little guy named Derek Lonesford. Are you ready? He's in here too. Would you care?

Why don't take it off? She has to not say it. All right, so that's a wrap on today's workout. Moving to the open. Just kidding. That's a good workout. Grateful to be training out with some of the short kings of the industry. You didn't hear me. But short kings of the industry that we just had. Yeah. I'm literally the best of luck and in there. Huh? Short people. Say some of our short people. Better watch. Short kings. Well, I lose a bunch of weight and come to the classic. I don't think you're going to ever make it. Yeah. Like you said, when we retire, we'll just switch the dishes. That's like a plant. Yeah. So we're hungry because we've been setting up too long. So we're going to go search for some food. We'll see you later. What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? You've got to come to my easy dog. How to do it? Everything. There we go. You're going to pause the ride. I'll go second. Second. Second. Where are you? I'm shooting the second. Oh, shit. That's the last for a ride. Oh, it's the last. Yeah. It's the last minute. I'm saying it's pretty much you should do like three weeks. What was about what we're going to do here? That's a lot of a big help. Yeah. But now we're doing the old plan. Like we're going to take it up. How are you doing? You're doing well. You're doing good? Good. Thank you. Do you want again? Yeah. Ridiculously busy. Try and have to think about it. Yeah. Yeah. Here we're going to do a Dubai. We'll go some ice. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. I said. Wait, there'll be a, you know. I don't think. Yeah. I don't think. Ready? Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. It's funny. I don't get to introduce people that often, that create the response that this guy creates. When I walk back there, we're afraid to see a long line. I always say, when you see a long line, what you know what that means. You know what means that somebody in particular is at the head of these days, because it's turned out where he has become such a great ambassador for the sport, for the industry. And I know a lot of you guys are here to see him, to meet him, to get to take a photograph with him. If you're so fortunate, to take a selfie with him, because I'm into you post on your social media, you then will become a big deal. So it is my great privilege to welcome the rain champion of the classic physical Olympian division. One of the all-time greats, one of the greatest who ever do it, please welcome Steve! All right. What is up Pittsburgh? You know what's funny, you can get us know me. I still get angry because I don't want what's video, I don't even know what I'm doing. But when you're presenting to me with the opportunity to have them come up and talking from my crowd, or take my clothes off and post on your back seat right now, while here I am. I'm standing here with my toe. Also, it's pretty hilarious. My mom called me and every time she got these shows, she sees these guys. She's like Christopher. Are you getting it? I guess you guys? I'm like, wow. If you see big grabbing stamps in back there, you got to like 330 pounds. Probably 70 pounds have your knee in short of the knee. Shonslory does probably two feet shorter than me, so it's way more than me. So, there's no chance I'm getting that big enough. Don't worry about that. Well, that being said, that's what you got there in sports night. You got there in front of the street, you're very rare, that you got to get on stage, let alone together. Maybe not being the best shape of your life, but I can guarantee you, but probably the biggest, and then equally as in person to see, and something that probably even more rare to see. So, if you guys are fans of what I really, together in pre-hello the street, if you're watching the image, show the pro show, give us aspirations. Step on to see it one day, this show to be at right now, this is full of just formation and inspiration. So, I hope you got there, I'm enjoying it, enjoying the show. I want to give a quick thing to the man used, man used, man used, showing, or putting on the show, I agree here. It's beautiful show that you get back to see if it's very, very good. And then bring us absolute great talent, but I'm going to show for you guys. So, they can have a blast with the man he's in, and it's beautiful show that's what I'm going to do. And also, tell the better it's tonight, we're putting on a show for you guys. So, show a long got a tooth, give a while, they rarely have a complotist. And I'm not going to talk to you guys until it's almost tonight, but look at sports, you've got all the boys, you know, be up to be held a show, go for number five. I would appreciate all you got the new support. I love being at this show, there's some stories of everybody back there, and memories of show and felt them, because they made people come to the show, they made the people, what you do is run the city into the culture, history of the city, it's super cool to be a part of now, I've been here for a lot of years, but being here now, I'm hearing no stories and I hope looking part of some of those memories from the I'm truly grateful. So, for yourself, I hopefully, you guys can sit back and join the show, and just get the huge round of applause because you're a bunch, but I'm not going to show. Thank you. Oh, I'm here at C.Con. Damn. And we're going to come to the camera to get my office stage to see you, sir, family. Being here, came up with a business together with a club called PDW, who's probably going to bring me many, many years ago. So, we can't argue here, we're going to just like you, Chris. And of course, we can't let you out daisy, my friend. Because a few boys, please, the nurse, said you're going for number five. If you have some good memories, we'll all make us a little bit of a baron, but see if I'm just a gentleman, man, right? I can ask the goal in question, Chris. No, you're not ever an actress in question. The classic physique division was good and not that modern, you know, brand new. What was you have done in your career, or what you had for your, there was no classic physique division? I don't have a little tired. I'm going to lie in 2016, I shouldn't have thrown out the no-good bodybuilder and had you wait, I had you wait, I'm super ready to wait. At 6 o'clock, we're on the wrong, we're on the wrong side of the stage. I know a lot of the judges were there just a week, so thank you for that, bro. I kind of appreciate it. But I honestly, with ready to look at that, I didn't have a, I didn't think I had a future in open mind, but it wasn't something for me, so it's probably a recent little year every day. When I'm setting my stage up, I'm so grateful for the classic physique division. I think it's open up to such a bigger variety, so people to watch the sport, kind of coming to it, to a more modern age thing. And now we have all the divisions kind of checked out, we've got the day mass mass suits, the short mass mass suits, and the times the guy had this, you've got everything something for everybody, so I'm very grateful for something for me, this guy who's impacted the joy and beauty in my life, and everything I need to enjoy today, so it's just a great full day. Man, this is something I think that helped a different domestic world of men. If this division doesn't exist, it's a big bond, doesn't exist, at least in the Turkey, you know, now he's a massive huge father. You know, it's fun watching the divisions come alive, when you think about it, there was no 2012 divisions, we might not know the name like Suits, so I think there was no class physique division, we might not know the response that the new guys are in fact, a couple of bigger stars in the world. The one question that I know you must get at a lot is talking about whether or not you want to make the transition into the open division. I know that's something you have to hear a lot. So if the benefit of the thousands here in the millions watching around the world, what are some of the things that go through your mind when that question is presented as you evaluate that possibility. I don't know if it's so much what goes through my mind, but so much of who goes through my mind. I see people in my brother, I see people like that, you know, see people like that, they walk here, they write me in my mind. I don't know what goes through my mind. And obviously the first step possible in my head is like just so grateful to be where I'm at. You know, like I said, plastic could be just given me a beautiful life. And so many moments that I will never forget ever come out of the seed in life and to remind me of the one in the stage. And like it's giving me so many moments, so many experiences, so many people in my life that I can never think of living there. So I'm sure joy where I'm at in present, enjoying the journey and the kind of fun. Okay, good up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Before I go, I'd like to say that people ask me all the time, what is it about Christmas and what's the fascination? Why are we also wrapped up in your life and your story? And the way people respond to you is it's without rival. And I always say, I sum it up in the one simple word, and this is something that you're out there, you are aspiring fitness, celebrity, a bodybuilder, or somebody who is trying to connect with fans, I will sum up Christmas secret in one word, and it is often ticketing. There is perhaps no one who puts themselves out there exactly as they are, the way that you do Christmas and for that, we switch you. Thank you. If you want to be a star, I would love to be a project. First, when I make my call, I'll be a wish. No, I'll be a wish. All right, so it's gonna be wrapped on Pittsburgh. Got the train with Seth, got the train with Derek, the good work out, got to meet a lot of people, very grateful for it. Not great flight to go up on the stage and talk. I am, but I go up and down to my ability to speak last one I did my Emmy, did a great job this time I trashed it. I started racing, I got nervous, I was like fuck, I don't know what I'm saying, and I just lost it. This is what it is, you know, maybe one day I'll be good at public speaking, but you think that the amount of time I've been on stage would get better, but I'm nervous to tell every single time, so this is what it is, welcome to the life of Seabum, I guess it'll never change, but I just gotta keep doing it until I get better, because that's the only way to do it. But that being said, I appreciate you guys watching. Back to Florida for a few days and then we're going off to Italy on a nice little trip, so hopefully me and Calvin can get like two videos or so this week, so I was no gap of content like crazy when I'm traveling, but they probably will be, just forgive us for that. Thank you for watching, appreciate you guys and I'll see you guys next time.

=== FILE: HIGH CARB DAY + BACK WORKOUT [95VSKCYOx6Q].txt ===

I guess I got cereal I think I had like a treat or something I can't remember I had some in and out burger some stuff like that some amazing stuff sadly No hamburger today, but I'm bumping at my carbs from about 250 grams of carbs to 500 grams of carbs in my fats from like 30 to like 60 70 Is then I have to be perfect because it's just like see what my body can do with a given range But gonna be doubling my carbon take which is super good eating pretty much exact same foods So I'm probably not gonna go over every meal because today's kind of a crazy day anyway, they calmed it around So we're on the tripod today, but yeah, that's what's going on to breakfast is gonna be very similar But I always have pancakes so I'm switching up and having some oats and some eggs, but with it I am having right now the exciting some of you guys But some eaters cinnamon raisin bagel. So this has 50 grams of carbs and then I'm having 50 grams of other carbs in my oats Which would make typical 70 grams? So adding that if you're going to the cup today and I fucking love bagels So I'm really gonna enjoy that, I don't even put it in the oven I could eat it raw toasted whatever but I'm probably gonna toast it But anyways, pointy what I'm starting is start people use it like eight to ten week perhaps and then 12 week Perhaps became like the golden standard and I honestly think at this point 16 weeks of the bare minimum This is the leanness offseason that I have ever had and I started it at about 15 16 weeks out And then I had this like five week chunk of just nothing going right And I was still able to pull it back together and get where I need to be because I gave myself enough time But if I had a good 16 weeks I could have been having a refuel like every week my metabolism would be firing Mentally it'd be a lot nicer because I get to eat more food and it's just a lot better to do it that way Rather than having a crash I and jam your body down and not give it refuel days So if I can give a tip prep longer than you think you're not gonna shove it all away Especially if you're properly doing refeeds and you really need to understand your body My weight wasn't dropping like crazy right now, but I started to feel really flat and really tired And we're about five weeks out so this is like my last chance to jam about your food in me and not worry about being put back a day or two Because we're getting into grind time yet So if I can tell anyone anything silly in your offseason and start prep early I also just I just didn't want to cram trying to lose 30 40 pounds because it's just really bad for your body to lose like 50 40 pounds of weight and muscle to try and make weight and weight caps was 240 so to 60 to 65 with my weight cap like peak weight this year 2025 pounds I can pull that up in 16 weeks no problem So anyways, I'm gonna get cooking here because I'm hungry Ultra on the stove and then I'll treat you on my breakfast when it's up All right, so my go to protein is still gonna be the maple waffle right now It's just amount of vanilla-based kick in this maple waffle taste absolutely delicious So when we put in this in my oats do some good old scrambled eggs and then I have the Dave's killer bread Bagel those bagels are not gluten for you any that bullshit I'm not gonna be that guy. I'm a cheat having gluten free bagels So I got normal ones, but they have no high-freak toast corn syrup They have no artificial bullshit in it. They're relatively and they still taste absolutely amazing So I'm gonna cook this up make my oats and don't judge me I use the same fucking thing for eggs and oats or you go fuck try to do less dishes Correspondents that here, so let's shit. I have to clean But yeah, it's little to no method to my madness Accept me trying to juggle too many things at once and my eggs over cooking 30 on too high I'm gonna shut the camera off and get the cooking because I don't know how to cook an electric stove I'm used to gas and this thing is just randomly get the hottest buck Like 10 minutes in a cooking food so wish you luck Don't mind the correct camera. They're really not a straightening. It's not really care of the hungry But this is the final product right here of the basic good side of it my Bagel is currently in the toast there because Not okay waiting for me because I want you to fresh toast it I don't want to get like cold and soggy shit. So I'm way for that live life on the edge Full sugar ketchup ketchup is life and it's rare that I get the good shit This whole food full sugar ketchup is absolutely delicious It's not like it's organic, but it's still got added cane sugar in it and it tastes very good So I'm gonna put this down get the bagel and then touch base So this is it also salt the shit in my mouth like because salt tastes amazing all right now for the good shit having the bagel and Looperies how do you tell me have some fruit some blueberries and an apple to there? Also gonna have that not going towards the 500 grams of carbs and made me for I also forgot to mention on these data Typically take some type of GDA glucose disposal agent I've never taken insulin and they're absolutely no need to unless you're trying to make 300 pounds So stuff like this natural things like burbring chromium different types of supplements Actually help you take up take glucose help you in some sensitivity if you're eating more carbs in your use You're just eating a lot in general. So his actually has some digestive enzymes in it So I'm using that today typically I'll also use revive glucose. It's like six pills This is one pelvic glucose a little bit more of an extensive specific GDA. This is like no good It was a cheap meal. I like their carbs little enzymes for digesting food that you're not used to eating and a bit of it Also I kind of go back and forth doesn't really matter, but using a GDA when you're getting more definitely helps a little bit not crazy Into the world, but yeah my bagel is getting cold so I'm gonna eat it Or something though eating like something with your hands like I say I'm much I might as well not bit to chicken and rice Like one solid thing is like by a side of spine when you're in prep Some good job. All right, I'm gonna run around next meal is gonna be chicken rice So a lot more rice. I'm gonna train have some good food after good to me Silicid-percent ball. I'll probably show you postwork of meal and then we'll wrap it up and all whatever But yeah, all right pre-work up meal meal number two that nearly has fun as a bagel, but it's Some fish and some rice. I am currently in Matt Jansen's office and I'm breaking in don't tell him I'm doing this On the way to put the camera, but he has salt and I never have salt and salt to feel he can't run All right, so mission accomplished broken Matt Jansen's office Even never watch my YouTube video So I'll never see this, but I need some salt. He's always got it and I know he supports the body building dream Gentlemen, so it's so helpful support, but Super simple 200 grams have white fish fresh Atlanta cob 250 grams of white rice and then I got two these Rice cakes right here. These are like the cinnamon flavor of rice cakes like corny and She just has them in the thing. He's about 20 grams of carbs each I believe and then 250 grams of rice So it's the getting me my pre-workup meal. Yeah, that's better We have a call here so I had to run into the office Oh call my life still I'm trying not to do a name call five minutes I eat the gore to the gym after dream and I have to come back to the gym podcast for the GBRS group that I mentioned Calvin's a Virginia right now That's what he's doing with these guys filming content for the club we're doing on the hydration product Don't even mind into the charity. So we're doing a podcast with some of the wealth which I got a record He and the office Kelvin has this lab set up that he put in here before you left Someone quickly eat this get on the phone call go work out try and get you to have a sick problem because we have a Me and my food You've all cast and then I'll see you guys later All right, so back day high carb day trying to flood the carbs into my back because what I need Especially right now for new machines, but yeah, so I've been starting off with these ever since I did a two work That's at the beginning of this year. Who's this guy Eddie Paul the muscles is Instagram the trainer This is really cool machine the new machine, but also just a really good training techniques and he had me warm up with these Doing like a low tight cable row Evo close to the body and you rotate your body away from the weight So you're getting a full thrash of the lap. So having to rotate your body too much It's my machine. You don't really go heavy, but it feels really good to warm up so I'm certain off full sack in this I've done a bunch of warm up already, but I'll full sack in this for like hopefully 12 reps and then just kind of wanted to set to these and we get rolling All right, so apologies for the camera angle stated probably horrible Camelk's a 24 now, but second movement have your compound do invent over rows I'm gonna do some overhand some underhand really trying to focus on pulling low in my hip I was in high to get my chops less hit more lower lats something to honey trying to stress on me to do more of because I tend to Overactivate my chops all the time probably why you had eight fell the time But we're just trying to get like the depth thickness in the lower back a little bit more just density mid back So rows here we're gonna do it. I'm gonna be doing probably at least two overhand and then putting off your one or two on your hand right after a As you can see, I'm trying to first see reps, squeeze and hold at the top. And it really focused me on contraction, the part of my back. I want focus, helps me focus on contracting the part of my back that I want, rather than just using my hips, legs, chops, whatever. I actually feel my mid-Christmas feedback pulling, squeezing, holding it, and then controlling the eccentric part of the motion. So, get in the best of everything. All right, so, get in the switch it. Underhand grip now, it just allows you to squeeze even more in that lower lat. You exactly where I'm trying to get it. Of course, you pull it into your hips a little bit more. Otherwise, you're going to be pulling from your biceps and your chest. You want to keep your chest low. Spine, neutral, lock the ins, straight with your core, and then roll super straight back. And I had to drop the weight, because I'm weaker at this. I have no people there. I'll take the weight off both sides. Typically, that works. I'm all uneven, but I'm not that uneven. All right, so this machine speaks up against heavy really quick. I normally do two and a quarter, but I carb this. So, doing three plates today, and I'm going to, it's nice. This penata machine is nice, because you can start from a little bit of a pronate into a super native grip, neutral, underhand. We can kind of rotate it into three different directions. So, I'm going to start a little more overhand than lighten the load and do a little bit more underhand. But I just did like three movements from down low. So, I wanted to do more of a pull down motion, and the penata machine's been great to me. So, we're going to move it on to this now. How did two overhand, two underhand, and then two that capable of a genus sets? And we're going to do like three here. All right, so like I said, I dropped down on the last set, and I did two and a quarter for overhand again. Now I'm going to switch this grip. Super easy to understand, and I'm going to do a drop set. But because 25 pounds probably not going to be enough, I'm going to do the same way they did on last set, but you put the 25 there first. So, I can strip off the 45, and make it a bigger drop, and then I'm going to do one drop set of this underhand grip, and then move on to this machine. I'm not really fully underhand, it's like slightly, but still like it's the same effect. All right, it's tripod is a piece of poo. Fucking CG, Mr. Christian Newsman told me about this tripod every time I set up a new leg. One leg just falls, and it just falls in. So, I'm going to be pulling out the four half of the time, and I've got it both to die. But you guys know I love doing the chest supported dumbbell roll. Get a bunch of shit before this. Normally I start with that because it's longer free weight. So, I'm going to be doing chest supported T-BI roll here on this machine plate loaded. And I'm going to say I have a four plate, I haven't done four plates on this machine I doll yet, and then I'm going to drop it down and do a drop set next set. So, turn here, but it's coming from a diamond set, so I'll see you later. Jas, can you get a fight off it? Alright, second last, back movement, some good old neutral grip pull down on your cable machine. You're gonna do some pull over after this. So the baby and I see them gonna do more of these are pullovers and then a little bit of biceps. We're gonna call it a day because I gotta get the fuck out of here and do this podcast. Alright, so I have a pretty good idea that I fucked all the audio on that because I was trying to use these new mics that I don't know how to use in KELV is not here. So it's probably sound like shit and KELV might have to just cut it with the working sets and show it with music or whatever. I don't know, I guess we'll find out. You'll already know by now, me saying this. But I finished up with the biceps curl that I filmed and then I just, I gotta get out of here really quick so I just stopped filming and I did a pullover superset with the Jim Leco biceps curl. I felt really good. Did like four sets of the drop set of the Jim Leco biceps curl, three sets of pullovers and just wrapped up the work out like that. So I felt really good overall. I could tell my energy, just like able to keep pushing like on that last back row movement. I could do a triple drop set with a respawn on the two plates and I had energy to do it because typically I'm so depleted. I can tell at that point in the workout. My body's just like, there's no more go like a junior muscles, go home and go eat something. But I actually feel good today. So that's why I was putting into my back. Jim put my back up. I got like some more to hopefully still have a little bit of carbs left for that leg workout. But we're back on diet after this. I'm gonna have some beautiful fucking steak and sweet potato fries after this. One of my favorite things to eat in prep. So I'm gonna have that after. But I gotta go eat quickly, just a boring probably another fish and rice meal and then do the podcast really quick. So I'll see you guys afterwards for steak and sweet potato fries. Yeah, I feel like I'm gonna get the fuck out of here. Alright, so next meal. This one is a special one of mine because I love sweet potato fries. Sadly we're not at a habit, girl. My last cheat meal, I got to go to habit and it was a little bit better but I'm not gonna make a man, it's still beautiful. I have 500 grams of raw weight sweet potato. I weigh all my potato rods you guys know and I have 100 grams of filet man y'all. Cooked by Miss Chef King over here. He sends up being about 100 grams of carbs, 25 meals a hundred grams of carbs and 670 calories. So it's still not a crazy amount of calories but 100 grams of carbs in a meal for me. They lot right now. Yeah, I'm sure we'll get to catch up because this is why I eat. So I'm gonna put this down. Enjoy some beautiful sweet potato fries. We loaded these in salt. I couldn't even see salt though, no more salt. Do you want more salt? I don't know if I'll have to boil some more salt but a little nice filet and sweet potato and a little green bean carbs today. So I'm gonna put this down and enjoy. Alright, so wrapped up that high day training day and all that good stuff. I don't even forgot to close this off yesterday. We just had to stay in potatoes but it was a good day overall. Podcast was super cool. Trade-dewing that was a GBRS guy that wish I could have been down there because they were doing some bad ass shit. They were running through some tactical drill and some more cats and some really cool shit. So maybe one day I could go up there and actually run through some shit with them but they were really cool dudes. Sadly we have some technical issues with the podcast as in my luck when I'm alone. But overall I think it's a good podcast. They have those guys probably have, I know they have so much knowledge to share and they're like, they've been through some de-hardest shit with the biggest sacrifices and now they're so like aware of pushing mental health and transitioning into this civilian life and everything. So it was super cool to be able to chat with them and talk about just various different things. So you guys should definitely tune into that podcast. They're mindset of how they approach stuff to do what they do with absolutely insane. People talk about sacrifices of bodybuilding especially what I do. I think it's like lose a little bit of touching grip of the sacrifice that make a my relationship and stepping out of like technically what's healthy for my mind to be the best bodybuilder I can be. And I talk to guys like that who are overseas protecting their fucking teams, their families are country everything absolutely crazy. So it was an honor and a privilege to be able to chat with them and we're doing some really cool stuff like I said was their group TBRS. We were with DJ Shipley and Cole were on the podcast so definitely don't miss that podcast. It was awesome and hopefully we can do more stuff with them in the future but that podcast will be coming soon on a RAWU on the RAWU tube. So don't miss that shit. But other than that we're back to regularly scheduled regular scheduled programming. I always say that wrong. And I come up with a bullshit today back on the low carb life live in the dream, training I shredded when the fucking one piece going for number five. So yeah, thank you for watching. This is the center of the day but in the video so peace out.

=== FILE: HOW I’VE BEEN FEELING ｜ LEG DAY BATTLE [TyXOWDcCqWg].txt ===

One point is a vibe and a verbative on the count. But when I think of a body, it only gives me a... Without a damn doubt. Come on! Come on Chris! Come on you're one in steel! Or a ton of color you want for you guys! Come on Chris! Come on! What's the... Yeah. Hey this is too loud. I can't even hear myself. I like the work too. Better? No? What? Up. YouTube. They're final day with CG invading Florida right now. So we figured we'd finish like we started and hit some of the like. So like they did, Calvin and Christian second round. We got, I think our last video was the same one. I think we've done something. But it goes like a picture of us. But yeah, that's all it's going on. We're fucking doing a little shoot. Stay for outfilling, and cut me in all the shabang, and then now we're just trying to get huge light. So that's what I told you. I was slacking on for a while, so I'm doing a little bit more consistently now. We're the frequency closer with less rest days in between. I just tell myself that you're huge right now. So like day, a little more hand-tink today, and then... There's what do you think about the new leg, there's new weight cap on men's disease? There's not baby legs now? No, they said they're going to judge it. They said they're going to say legs. No, you have to. Unfortunately, the leg will get dark. Dude, you think so now? Nah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That's going to be tough to do. They're still looking for legs, but still... There's not to change, but never... Snips the top of your leg. No, we're saying it. They're way too big, though. Some of them are not like, but they're going to go in and make waves. Well, I feel like I need to... This should just say like, when you pick the best working weight. I have a feeling a lot of the men should be kind of sad. They would wouldn't make a class for the equipment, and they'd do heavy-butt, but kind of do the same. I feel like they're not short enough, personally. Most of them. Yeah. So, I got a trainer. The board is it? There's no way to get it. It's not good, it's better. But yeah, it's good. It's good. They're like Christmas. Right? You're ready, like, for a kiss in. Yeah, I'm just trying to... I'm like, yeah. He might distance her in the work eyes. He's a little stressed. You know? You never see Christmas, I feel like he's the little... What about us? Oh, man. Is this literally that much? Is it going to affect him, fuck, no? but easily do this over I'm gonna do it right. Do you really think so? What? Do you think so? I can do it like that. I'm going to warm up a lot. I'm going to do it. I mean, I think you should crush your gun. Yeah, yeah, you can. Do you kind of treat the last night of it? I was wondering what. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. Try to keep it on your ship. What? Try to keep it on your ship. Turn up the break. Yeah. Really? I'm back in court. 2%. I can't double series. What? I can't double series from now. I tell you warm up a lot. I'll see you for 3%. You know, it's like 2 cents over there. 2 cents over there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. No, look out. There are some knees. There's some high value knees over there. One can do this, you can do this. See my cover is small. Look at this. See that boy next to one of détocks, pull his back, pull his arm, on your jacket. The chain is stuck. Afterwards you should see if any one of those No wrong chambers, good detail that I've hit in that work so bad, nooo man, I发 a minute cap say that and just want to make you feel like that rotation with a There we go. Come try to slow down my rep range. Not bounce like I used to be trying to get me shit for that. There's a lot harder, especially when you know you threw it. Slow your tempo, control the last bottom, and then consistently to consistently explode I was no bounce. And it makes me feel good. You also turned off that to greater song ever. I've heard it too many times. Two. Oh, that's pretty good. We're doing it. You're a good guy. Then it looks good. Well, push him out. I've never liked you. You're maxed back from your base, that's like horrible floor. I don't like going down the floor. You just... I remember this one. Hey, the thing I did is... Oh, bon pannings. It's really sick of him. I thought I'd give another thing instead of you. But, like 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45. Is that a little bit of weight? I was at 15, 15. I was at 15. I was at 15. No, come on. We sat here with Marion! They're in a cow-free in the entrance! Oh, they cut. Oh, hard to speak. Okay. Damn it! Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. I heard the broadening last year this. Maybe that more forever, like my throat's closed. I think I was like two days ago. Really? Yeah. Oh, what? I don't know. I definitely never wanna. I don't know. I don't know. No. Ah! Ah. Never. I'm gonna have a shake up in the gym. A lot of stretchers, you're like 30 minutes postwork in. Yeah, good. I'm gonna have a little one. I'm still hungry. I'm gonna have to have my workout. I wanna go eat. I just wanna get in one place, and one, two hours. No way. I wanna go. I wanna go. I wanna go. I wanna go. I wanna go. I wanna go. You brother. Yeah, it's a way to super-be. I'm gonna keep talking to you. Five five. You can tell it's like if someone needs something like you need it that's it bro. Okay. You're a little like a man trying to hide in your body right? You have to establish it. Something like you. Only two. Eh? Only two times. Why is one able to divide and provide it with you? The one that I think nobody's only used. Without a damn towel. I'm not feeling fucking sorry for every second. It's like everybody sees skin has those days. Everyone's it's equal and jam. Everyone gets like fucking humble. Even Mr. Lydia. Not Calvin though. That's Calvin is so bad dude. Uh, the why? Why do you think I stopped Olympic lifting? Too many bad days and I quit. I think I tried to do this one really like. So here they're like, okay, I'm gonna feel like you need to just sleep on a nice bath for a week. I will pray for this incubation. If you've ever been to the next fucking 40-2 weeks or so, however the fucking one appears coming because a body is already falling apart. A body that's actually feeling better from training but not training maybe feel like something worked well. I don't know. I need some super soldier here, I'm just a lot of time. Let me get huge. Alright, so we wrapped up that like day and like Kishio was saying we were having an out day by day but we finished the workout. Did it all? I really did not want to do straight like that. Let's go back with the fucking pump after we made some machines. We sucked it up, no skinny bitches wrapped it up and pushed through a little bit more hamstrings of calves and my knees are hurting for the first time in a long time so it's time to start getting more massage and stretching because I'm not trying to have bad knees again like I did in 2019 because I was fucking miserable. But yeah, we wrapped up that like day. It's Kishio's last day here at 4am. I'm like, I'm so sorry for my... He's pretty much moved in so sadly he's leaving us tomorrow night or 2pm tomorrow. He had mac on and maybe we'll spit shoot up the heat and throw a chip sometimes soon. But what are you trying to say? I've no idea what I'm trying to say. I'm just a little bit fucking mischievous and he's gonna leave us there open. That's life, you know. Colomedy and the myths of chaos. What? Talk about the going on right now and a little bit. Talk about the waves. Talk about what? Ways okay,otic. Why am I so chaotic? We all got, we all got our own shit that we're working on right now. Chaos. So G-Dez Cortez, you do, I do. Let's talk about it. Our house is chaotic because you tried to sell it and we had to turn my head to the funeral to get it and we've been going back and forth between the most unenze house in our house. We've been eating here, getting close here and driving to most unenze to sleep at night. And then coming back here and we have to get all the pills, all the vitamins, all the supplements, all the clothes and all the dishes and everything out of here and all this whatever. Shit that, the fumigation gas can absorb by tomorrow. So we've been taking the truck loads of some of the news and then there's piles of boxes of our life in there now. So we're living in a suitcase with the boxes for the next three months or months. July. I'll guess September. Like three months or so. So beautiful. I didn't know before that we were traveling for three months. So haven't been in a routine or structure. It's sleeping at the same time, we can get the sleep time. Haven't slept through night and four or five months. So, how old are you to be in bed as you guys saw? So it's just been like, for a couple of weeks. You couldn't, you couldn't, for an hour, you were coughing like this. Yeah. Yeah. I went outside. Yeah. Like this is like a pretty consistent two. I feel like awful. So we're like trying to do everything and when he's not good, I just like feel bad and, and I'm just doing, I'm digging that. I'm fine. He's ready to go. But I'm stressed out that I'm like, I'm very hard on myself or I need to be. Like, Mr. Olympia, the wind, Mr. Olympia now. And it's hard when our life has been so chaotic. But I'm fucking motivated to be in routine. We get into this Airbnb. That's going to be home. And we're going to lock it down in there. Traveling is slimming down now. I've locked it down. There was a few trips, only one meeting greet. And then no more meetings because it's taking so much out of me. No trips out of the country, all casual trips. So, and Hon is going to be on some of the trips. So he's going to kick math in the gym. And yeah, once we get into a little bit of order and a little structure, it's fucking scasical limit. Because it's from succeeding in this chaos right now. Once we have structure, it'll be fucking rocket shipped to them in. So, a little bit chaotic right now. But that's the way it goes sometimes. I'm tired. For you, so you can do it. Yeah, that's cool. That's where I'm kind of kind of kind of kind of help a little bit. Just like, you know, you're doing your great job. Helping, Christians, cultures. Good people. How does this meet then? How about is it a little? I feel like I... For Chris or like a doctor? I think it's good. Even you said last night, your Christian is good shit. Because when you see on social media, people are friends or acquaintances, but when you actually get to hang out with someone and we're chilling in the house, we're all going to dinner. It's... It's... I think good energy. You said good energy. I've watched your vlog for a while. I didn't really get into the room to know each other deeper now. I didn't know how, like, I don't even know what the right word is. What? That's interesting. No. Yeah. But, yeah. So, obsessive, find detail, like hardworking, like... Like, I'llfully was no mistake. I'llfully lined with no mistake. And like, I didn't think it was. But this is completely different seeing how some of the operates for a full week. And being like, holy shit. No one would have made that brand, no one would have made that facility. Or a treasure, you haven't seen anything. I know. Yeah. I believe it. What do you think is going to be like, well, scratching the surface of it. But the dude's a man, he, I can't even learn everything he's got. So, it's also very motivating for me entering the business, and what it takes to, like... I feel like I can tell what's going to start happening in a few years. Like, it's just a people managing sense for the companies. Yeah. Because it's the same type of structure, really. And without the structure, implementation and, like, HR and all these kinds of things that you don't really think about too much, like... It's going to start taking away from Chris's ability, and, of course, the ability to be peace, be in present, honestly. Yeah. If you don't put things in place now. If you do, we'll do better things. Yeah. Your favorite words are HR and full of HR. HR and full of HR. Yeah. Poor HR. Yeah. Yeah. Chris, in this favorite words, it's weird. But, like, even outside of business, like, you're good energy. You're a good person, you know? You really are. Like, you're, it's admirable, like, what you do, and, like, what you've created, and whatnot, but, like, you're, you're a good person, too. Yeah. For sure. For sure. Okay. For my therapist. Yeah.

And there's a few people I'll do that with, and then there's a few people I let them to my home, and then into my life. You know? Yeah. It's not really a cloud. Yeah. I'm thinking, I'm trying to get a call. I've been more, so, like, twenty-nine teen was. Yeah. And then it's, like, affirmed until, like, just shows up in my house driving your car, just, like, what is normal? Like, we don't feel, like, it's, yeah. Just, first show up.

Did he have 50,000 likes? No way. He was 100,000 likes, I think. I said 50 actually. It was 50? I think I had that 100 though. Yeah. Well, that was, like, the camera, the same price.

So there's really a lot to it. Christian, you want to wrap it up? I think I've watched the subscribe piece.

=== FILE: Heavy Chest Day. [wBNYccFR2MM].txt ===

What is up? I'm looking for a new one. Welcome to my pantry for spend most of my time. I'm sharing this shelf looking for a snack for you. But right now, I'm searching for pre-work at that hotel. It's a company that doesn't have anything else. But also very exciting. This citrus grapefruit essential flavor. I have been pushing for this flavor at the Energy drink and a pre-workout for over a year now. We made it, but it just took forever to nail the flavor and to bring it out. Fucking love this flavor. And we nailed it. 10 minutes and I had it yesterday. I enjoyed it. So, crushing it again right now. But we got back from Dallas, which was backed off the trip to Vegas. The Super Bowl and all the stuff. So, I've been all I'm going on. I think I touched on what the Super Bowl name is. But it was a super-rowing, we had fun. I enjoyed it. I got C50 cent live in the night before, 20 minutes savage. Horrible lives, but you know, this is what it is. It's cool to see you in my other way. And then, thumbs up videos. And then, lots of texts are really big. We finished really quick. So, we are on the At the Fuckout there to come back home. So, nice being home. I'm actually going to be home now for two whole weeks. So, my goal is to get fucking jacked. And something is skinned a little bit. I'm being an absolute skinny bitch. This entire year. So, I haven't even had consistent training. Just in trying to have you do proper program, follow it. They give me four weeks start-up things. I get my body prepped and I've been like eight weeks. I saw it in the finish. So, that's the kind of shoot we're on. So, today, you're reviewing a variation in the last upper body of your stay. But, different exercises. So, training is strong. It's trying to change the huge. I have an Arnold and after that, I'm going to train with Eurs and Ramon. And Arizona flag and Olympia battle thing. And they're going to be competing at the end. So, I want to be strong and make them all face can be good. So, I got to get in shape in the next two weeks. So, while we're doing, not enough time to do it. So, I'm going to down the pre-workout. Get to the gym and let's do it. Again, real old. I feel like when I rains, I can feel it in my joints now. Which is a sign that I'm turning to my father. He's in his 60s, I'm in my 20s. So, pretty much the same thing as the bodybuilder. But, trying to warm up, just get my joints ready to rock. Because I want to go heavier than 120s. Last week I got a 3-thats-a-1-20. So, I have to go up at least 10 pounds this week. Hit the 130s. And yeah, that's about it. I might swap for the pull downs. For pull ups this workout. Because we're having an event for a rough, we're opening up our big gym. And the other city, we're our warehouses. And we're going to have a big event. And on the Monday, it's going to be Memorial Day. So, we might do a mersh. Now, this is the only thing I'm going to do it. Because I can't do more than 10 pull ups at a time. And after doing 3 sets, I can only do 2. And I can't run a mile. And I have to run 2 miles for that. And I can't do those push-ups, or your squats, or anything. So, I might be more support on a little electric scooter. It's a train people on. Feel like Calvin, or the other sales guy's definitely probably going to win this thing. Now, I'm just going to meet you later. So, we're going to have a list. I want to say, do more pull ups when we can do those after this. But that's what's going on. So, stay tuned for that event. So, we're doing, I can do like a little mingreel, a seminar. First, early access to check out our new gym when it's built. And then a little endurance run slash mersh. Thinking on the Monday. So, give us some more information soon. We're going to start with the first one. The word for the wise one warming up. Most people care when they're getting heavy. And they're trying to muscle the tear muscle. When they're trying to muscle up the weight so they get them here. And then they get that little jolt where you like relax your muscle to get deeper. And then you explode out. So, when I'm warming up, I try to do like pause reps. I really lower down. And I let pause in the stretch so it sinks down. And then I press from there. Just so that part of my muscle is actually warmed up in the stretch position. However, you go the more it's going to naturally stretch you down. More like you're going to fuck your shit up. So, warm up slowly. Don't just like wrap out. I see a lot of people warming up and they just wrap really quick. So, then you're warm up. So, you're more than the working sets. Don't hurt yourself because we're all getting old. Where are you days? Well, we're at the 17-1. I think you got a little head of myself on do 143 here, but you're my hands. I'll fuck my shit up. That's proof I was being a little bitch left. We won 20s or hard. Can't do 142 again. I got 8 reps, so I can't. My bench is crooked. It's going to fuck me up. So, it's 10 out of 10 progress from last week. We're two weeks ago when I was fucked up. Last chest workout we saw them was probably two weeks ago actually. It's how slow we were moving traveling. But the beauty of taking a while of time off and feeling weak at the beginning is every week your strength just comes back so quick. Like at the end of last year's off season, I was wrapping 150 dc. Last week, I was only doing 120s. Touched the 143, so I'm set right now and slowly I'll come back. So, trying not to kill myself. Too much, I did one heavy set of 140s drop back down to 130s. I'm focusing on really controlled reps. I'm actually building proper strength throughout the whole range. Feel good. So, maybe actually we'll last year, like I'm not going to need everything 150s. But I would love to have to need them. So, maybe I'll hit up during them. You know, I need some 170s, 160s. Work my way up to 200s. Probably not. Alright, next. Moving, doing a T-Biro. I love doing the machine ones. It's gym, like I want to with 4 fire. So, I'm going to keep doing the same kind of concept. So, I'll try to get strong as fuck right now. I'll list them here as a white, but with controlled form. It's cool when you really start an off season or a strength building program with perfect form. Whereas, in just like, trying to throw the weight off you fucking everything up. You actually realize you get stronger. More efficiently. You feel better, stronger everything. And your weight will keep progressively moving without injury as well, which is always nice. So, that's a goal this year. I always try and keep my form pretty damn tight. But I have to reiterate that out loud. You guys, to force it to myself to do it. Because it builds a better physique. The last thing you're used to getting stronger, I'll be in a bit of an old world. So, I'm starting off with that now. Control the negative. You know, wide grip here. Really focus on my mid back. Some a little bit further down the padderas. And over top. Feet on the ground. Pull away. I'm not going to do that. I realized I took my bike off and I left it over there. I just explained what I was doing. So, essentially, doing the pure iron. I was very able to tell the pure iron machine over here. This is one of their inclined presses. I think it's a prototype still. But it's pretty much perfect. It allows you to kind of connect both sides of it. So, you're going to do one arm or two arm at a time. Because I've fucked up a lot of side of the shoulder. I like doing one arm at a time. Same with constant as a dumbbell. Make sure everything is symmetrical. But I'm keeping super controlled. It's pretty light. But I want to really have you with the dumbbells. So, I'm going to do a little bit of rest-puzz. We just saw a lot of set with my body. Like I said, this is my last set. I'm going to aim for like a least ten. Pause for like ten, fifteen seconds. And then do an aim wrap. Oh, sounds so cross-hip when I say the word aim wrap. I think you do the cross-hip games this year. Oh, I can't breathe in that spot. Oh, I can't breathe in that spot. So, the way harder than I thought, so if I can get you four ups here. I'll be proud. Oh. Oh. Oh, are you sure? How's tough? I don't know what I'm doing next, so I can go figure it out. Alright, it's probably gonna be last two moments. I'm going to do like a set my super-nated grip here on this pedal machine. Same both through the four super set with some push ups. And pulse the beginning, push up at the end. And I'll never be able to do a more like that. So, I'm just going to keep pretending. And now I'm actually doing it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm going to have to get one of the kids. I remember I had the perfect push ups. He had a little thing that like twisted and you hold the grip and you push up. And I could literally just double clap push ups and I felt so strong. I could do those in my basement, trying to work out. And here I am now, I can bench like three in your pounds. And I can do way less pull ups. Push ups. Can't do clapping push ups anymore. It's like I've degressed from 12 year old seabomb and it's basements trying to be jacked. But those were the glory days. And I can't do the same thing. But I can't do that. But I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. Alright, so we wrapped up that workout and didn't owe a show at so we're here at the office. It's 4.59 and we're all trying to get the fuck out of here at 5. So I'm going to wrap this up. But training has been feeling good. I'm going to come back together. I am so unbelievably sorry to do this 10 sets of 10 drops. Except for my calves and I haven't been able to walk for like a week. I'm feeling good and motivated now because I've been home for like a week. Which is the first time all year. I've been home for a long and a week. So actually getting back to that rhythm. And then after the Arnold this week, by the way, Arnold, photo up tickets are on sale. If you guys want to stop by. But after the Arnold, I won't be traveling until my baby's born. And I'm out after that. So I can spend time here with Courtney and the baby. So I'm going to be able to get into a really good routine. I have a proper offseason trying to get you trying to get Jack. I'm trying to throw him in the fuck this year because that's just the goal. So that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to do a full day of eating. Show you guys what I'm eating right now. I'm kind of getting back in the routine without like I said, traveling is fucked all that up. But it's also really coming together. And I got some treats here. Some literal bond treats. He gave me these to try. So this is my snack for the day. I'm making some protein pretzels. And they're like chocolate covered protein pretzels. They're different flavors. And they taste fire. It comes like a coffee flavor. They've got like milk chocolate mocha. And the ones that white chocolate vanilla, another regular milk chocolate one. They're better than any other like chocolate pretzels you have. And they protein in them. So super good. But we're going to be having those come out in the future. Probably be part of my bulk plan. Getting these tasty. I think then might get me fat. But as long as I'm huge and strong, that's really how the matters. But yeah, it's what's going on. I'm going to get a full day beating out. You guys come to soon. I'm going to get you more into depth with my training. Trying to get strong this year. And we all are. I'll be high. I am every year. That's all it's going on. So thank you guys for watching. I'll see you guys next time. Maybe my kitchen. So peace out. Thanks for watching.

=== FILE: I'M BALD ｜ FULL BACK WORKOUT [WsCC1oPbdBo].txt ===

Music What's up YouTube? Welcome to the most chaotic and organized month of vlogging to history. This is a camera we work at right now, given the ball. So we're just kind of doing random sherry now, but I'm going to get back into training, January 1st, and everything. We're going to take a little hiatus for the holidays. But people were asking about my ball head. I went down the turkey after we were in Dubai. We were in Dubai for a swell and do-by-mustle show and we kind of had a chaotic event in general. Just chaos. This is all the events. Then we went to turkey and we got a hair transplant. This company now hair time flew me out and did the procedure for me as most people like when the best place to do it. But the procedure is pretty painful. You lie on your back and they jab you pull the needles to freeze your head and it just... ...at hurt like a fucking beach. Really hurt. They numb your head and then they start injecting your head full of water. It's full of like, effort and effort and it's well, my heart starts racing. I'm like, I'm having a panic attack on my bed. And then you lie there, face down, and they drill into your head. 4,500 times, pulling out one hair at a time. Putting a little peachy dish in your line, they're awake uncomfortable. Until that's done. Then they flip you over, jick more water and shit in your head. And then they put all those hairs back into one at a time. So there's 9,000 times, essentially that they drill into your head. They can hair in that. So, it's pretty intense procedure. I'm not gonna lie. But it's not the end of the world. There's even a half hours total that I was in the hospital doing that in the procedure. So long. But my hair line looks pretty clean right now. I've been looking super weird and super bald. I had a scabbed head that was super itchy for a while. Honestly, the worst part was having scabs in the net she had. I was in the procedure. But overall, 10 days later, I'm like, it really wasn't that bad. Can't complain. And if I have a full head of hair, it will be worth it. So you guys will be obviously staying up to date with the growth of my hair. Apparently like, 4 to 6 weeks after. You get the procedure. All the new hair falls out and it re-grows and it stays after that re-grows stage. So it's 6 months. I should be looking like actually good to go. And until then, I'm probably gonna look weird and patchy bald in the buzzcat. See, bum, but that's okay. This is what it is. So, keep you guys up to date with the progress in my hair growth. Others in that were just chilling. There was a workout video that we took three or four weeks ago or something. That I'm gonna throw in here just so you have some more. I'll footage could be forgot to post that. And others in that I'm not allowed to train for 30 days. Post procedure of my hair. So I'm using it at the time for my body to recover. A little bit of stretching, a little bit of cardio, but I'm not as close as sweat or improve my blood pressure at all. So, using this time of chill, take it off. I'm gonna go home for the holidays, joyousy my family. And then we're gonna get it come back full seem to head. I'm actually gonna be having a transformation contest. We just thought because I'm gonna be just getting back in a working end. Like January 1st. My as well, like right at transformation contest through the app. And give people opportunities to do that with me. You know, new year and new me all that kind of bullshit. So, the documenting that of course, more information will be coming on that. But other than that, that's all going on. So, today I've been trained in three weeks. We're gonna show you getting all video. I'm gonna be getting skinny and fat over the holidays. Joyous, be to me. And as well, let's go on. So, yeah, we should you guys enjoy this old school workout. We're gonna throw back work out, I guess. And I'll see you guys later. What is up? YouTube. Welcome back to Lifeposts 5 feet. It's always weird weeks after the event. Training is weird, I'm tired, I'm weak, but I want to work out because I'm eating more and I've got back on diet that I did a photo shoot yesterday. Full photo shoot was a really old school vlog for a name per Binal. Very different from what I normally do and I haven't done a photo shoot since 2018. Maybe. Like a photo shoot photo shoot. So, what's interesting? I think they picked a little bit good. But we're just trying to get back in the life now. Now, I don't have to die anymore because I've got a number of photo shoots and no more shows. I had a shit ton of pancakes this morning and my belly was just like the fucking empty here. Corny made these like dense pancakes. So they're all natural organic of course. And I'm just like trying to catch my breath now. So, for the gym, train some back. No crazy work out. It's just still trying to move. Make sure my body just doesn't lock up. Yeah, I'm trying to move. It's going on. Good new car, right? So, we'll take you for a rip after this. We'll see if Calvin's still remembering how to dress thick. Hmm. So, it's weird because so old. Putting in to gear compared to my porcicle porcicle. It's like, alright, it's in a new no idea. So, it's fucking 50, five years old or 54 years old. So, well, maybe rip that after this. But, be trying to get some back warm up. I'll have a look for it. I've been the shop for nine months. Pretty easy. So, yeah, so I'm hoping to get that vaccine. I'll probably park it in back. But yeah, it's too numb. So, I'll have to it. It's funny. My body doesn't have the ability to push after a show. It's just like, it dead in my w- It makes it down. But, I probably need to get myself out of quit rest because for the last two weeks since you won't be able to sleep in, like, most nights, like, eight to nine hours in bed. I'm gonna sleep like, six to seven hours. But I'm fucking exhausted continuously when I wake up. It's recovering from perhaps self. So, making do is what we can. Training now is not crazy, but, for a little more super sets, a little more volume, pushing a little bit less. So, for a good. I'm gonna try to put this sweater on because it was cold outside today. It's for the first time in Florida. What kind of sports a playty? Problem? Um, it's like I made my own money. I have more of that to come today. Cause ,all in my office, after that, I've got all kinds of<|en|> I'm in it. How big? How's the field not being able to have to hide without your pregnant? I'm still hiding, not really. Field great, I'm free. About the degree. What the heck! I don't know if I'm going to do any free ways there. Looks like lazy as fuck. I'm not going to train for like 12 days to two weeks, going to stand myself, going to get my hair done. I'm going to turkey and get my hair changed. That's why I have shit hair cut right now. I can't cut it. I'm going to cook a bun for a while. I'm going to look like a fucking scabbed up mess for a while. I don't know if I got bald weirdo for a while. Then I'm going to look like fucking youthful, anti-aging, see if I'm going to fall out of hair. So get ready. I did not work out very well. I'm going to spend some work out anyway. I'm going to switch my work out a little bit. Now, I'll give you a more of an update when I actually have a figure out what the fuck I'm going to do. I'm going to be doing a little bit less intensity like gross blood style. So I'm going to like kind of push pull legs very ashy but not quite just so I'm not doing like six exercises on chest. My chest has been locking up and fucking up my posture. How am I favorite right at train? But I'm just training like let my body relax a little bit. I'm still training everything I need to do and then like recovery period. That is a month after competing at the Olympia. So I'm going to figure out what the fuck I'm going to do. But right now I'm going to be like three heck back exercises. I'm going to read out some biceps. Now that'll be the full workout rather than like six full back exercises. I'm going to figure it out my head. Why do you put it like this? You're not trying anymore. Why? You're not trying anymore. Yeah, but it's hard when you're just fucking compete, bro. It's like this dump of motivation for this one day that you're training all year. You look good, you're strong, fucking on all my shit. The house and you're like there's no goal. Your body hurts your tires. Your nervous system that was like running on quarter the law for months. It's just like crash and can't catch up on sleep. Please, you're going to stay motivated but not be a whole bitch. But I'm still going to be fat. Honestly, I like food more than bodybuilding right now. But keeping another couple months and it'll be back happens over you. You're going to do a nurse in six months. I'm going to take care of this pull-ups. And you pull-ups every day for the next six months. My head hurts. What? Non-mope heart. I know. I got to earn the mope heart. The mope heart is like the dream one. It's got to be perfect. This is smoggy so easily. It's like pain. Yeah. You can see your reflection. It's an old girl. You're going to pull fucking five feet on the license plate. Fastest to take you to a meal. Probably break down on me just like my truck did every time I drive into it. I have a foot. Part of the fun. What do you think he was new car? This is another car to fit in the house. What is very cool? I do. I sense hostility. I sense hostility. I'm not hostile. I do. It's been happening. You're lying. It's beautiful. I don't know much about cars but it's pretty beast. It's a pretty girly. It's a girl, right? It's a girl. It's always funny for cars. It's his gift to himself because he's having a kid. So he thought he needed a reward himself. Yeah. For a shark. That's exactly it. He's just like, wow. I did a good job. He did a good job. Yeah, right. I got the truck last year. Well that's yours. Wait. Wait. I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it. Oh yeah. I've misheard everything. We all just said. I think it's all the kids. We're helping. We're helping. We're in the China. Oh yes. Then we'll put the baby in the passenger seat with the half seat belt over it. Let me take Courtney picture of that. Just a baby with the half seat belt over it. I'm going to say sitting in the chair on the side seat. She's going to freak out. I need to do my own set of pull ups. I have to do more pull ups. Yeah. Pulling the authority right now. You do a hundred for a Murphy. Yeah. Or maybe a 40 if you're motivated for it. So I don't have to be perfect. What? I don't have to be perfect. She's a little bit. She's a little bit. I'm floundered. I don't see the hardest part. I'll probably be all of it. Squats in the run. Fuck me. They were going to do a Murphy when you're pregnant. Can I borrow five of her? A monster. A lot of her. A lot of her. You can do a half-murf. Is there a few male merch for you? They do the same one. They do the same one. They do the same one. It's hard for us. They could probably do it easier. A bunch of giant judge will like a hundred pull-ups. Hard. A hundred pull-ups. A hundred pull-ups. Yeah, a hundred push-ups. A hundred push-ups. I can't even do two pull-ups. I can do three when I even was the perfect one. I don't know how long you could take you. From start to finish, just do a hundred pull-ups. It'd be like two days. I had a lot of joke. He'll hit me. It would. She's got a hundred pull-ups. You're supposed to also do Murphy for the 20 pound bass. Let's just start basically. Got a 20 pound bass on. Yeah, I did. I don't look cool. I did. What? It's your turn. What? It's your turn. Yeah. Got to beef that baby up. Yeah, it needs to run a cycle on first day out. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. Oh, you got to be talking about the baby. It's going to come out like Benchay and like... It has this cycle. Unlike you guys, you guys have to be one of those guys that don't touch my bar. Because of that not. Yeah. I mean it's not for a page up so... But it's like... Keep clean. It's 60 in like 20 minutes. Really hard to enter. I've been doing 20 each set. You get it? I know you have to. Why could you do 20? I'd be crazy. I feel like if you're going to do 20, then you should do 10. If you get close to 2 plus a failure, or whatever you do to your own career. That's great. She sets the tap. Yeah. She's just shooting by steps and redelts for the rest of the year. Yeah, broken. Oh my god. She's just a child. Someone's going to do the trip. Wait, wait. Where are you? I'm going to get one stop. She's going to get scared. Really? It's good. Hey, I'm coming back. I'm going to get you back. She's a chef there. I don't know where it's going. Come back if you get me. I'm going to get a chicken and a shoulder. That's going to be a lawnmower. I don't know if gasoline is wasted just burning. It's going to fall apart. It's a little choppy. It's like driving. That's a catch. It's a good catch. It's a good trip. It's not very important. It's not very important. It's a good push. It's pretty good speed. That was second year. It's probably a 35. There goes the back tires. You can't drive that. You can't drive that. It's fun. You can't drive that. You can't drive that. It's fun. You feel like you're fucking taking back a few years. I don't know what's going on for the rest of the time. Maybe. That thing said. It's a good trip. It's a good trip. It's a good trip.

This is fucking insanely beautiful course. If you have no me, which you don't, I can't golf or shit. I can't even the ball through it. I can barely even hit the ball. You guys saw my snapchat stories. I'm miserable. I'm kidding. I'm just going to meet a pretty much a day of laughing at Chris. I've never the worst at something that I hate being the worst. But today I think I may get behind the turn of the golf. So wish you luck. You didn't say what's up. It's in your blood. What is up? You two. She added that at the beginning. Oh, Chris was really on it. I don't perform well on the camera. I don't know. Need some of that sand? Wait. Is this the first time you're using a tee? No, you used a lot of sand. Oh, did you?

Every time I hit on a driver, we've had three or four people pass it when it works. I think it's four with four people pass it. It's even playing for almost four hours and we haven't even done nine holes yet. So, they're native us, but. It's a little rough. I've had like four good shots. I think my putting fin decent.

It's been a long time. I don't normally talk about vehicles or anything like that, but you know what? I'm going to wrap my car today and we're going to log in the day. So this is my new vehicle, my daily beautiful little driver. It's a nice little truck. Also known as the Raptor R. It's a beautiful 700 horsepower off-road Baja. Jump in truck. Absolutely unnecessary horsepower and tech for someone who doesn't take it off-roading. But beautiful and it drives great and it sounds good. So, you think it's better? Not bad. When I told you to get this and you said no. Well, I didn't think I'd be able to get with these things that are really hard to get. So, you've showed it to my boy that bar toe forward, bar toe forward after your in Florida. Go for dealership. But yeah, I don't love the color. The only color I can get is the only color I can get. The only color I can get with the anti-matter blue. So, it's kind of like a dark blueish black. And it's cool, but I really like, I had a white truck my whole life and I really like light-colored trucks. So, I'm actually going, I got it like four days going up going to get a wrap. So, I'm going to get a wrap. This is like really cool chalk gray. Like the same color as the chalk Porsche. They make the dom has it, you know, it is Porsche. And I really like just light white color. So, we're going to get a wrap, one of one color, the wrap there are. And yeah, that's all it's going on. And we're going to head to the warehouse. So, we're going to drive there and come to get a cup. We're going to talk about how we're going to wrap it and then pick it up in a week. And I'm sure you got the final product. So, see you guys over there. We'll take this off and I can be traces with the black. So, we can do it to black, please, right here. And we can actually keep quantity. Yeah, yeah, sure. I think I want to be set. Yeah, if you're going to have it on the R and then on the side, just let that stuff go. Yeah, that's up in the back. Right here. Yeah, up here. And this is going to be a powder coat, too. It's kind of thing, it's plump, plump. It's easy to do. I'm just going to come right off, so we won't see here. And we're going to head back. I'll see how much we've painted this and get it off. I'm sure it's going to cost, I'll be on our box. Better go to the will. Or I don't. They just going to pick it up. So, go straight up. I'm like a charging thing. So, as I take off, it's out of the way. I'll see you all some of the picture of the first, good measurement, see if the more charging. But whatever they want to charge me off, charge straight to you, I need to make my own out of that. But if you're sure, of course, yeah, so I'll pull this. We'll keep the orange on there. Do you want to do black right here instead? Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. So, it's like, it's all black. I know, do like a black, you're matching. You can't even do black, you're matching. You can't even do black, you can't even do black, you can't even do black. You can even do black, you can even do black, you can even do black, you can even do black. So, you keep the gray. Like, with this, it'll be all be gray. Yeah, that'll be gray right there. All across. Yeah, the middle will be black. Yeah. I do black. Kind of like the nearest inside. Yeah. But, I'm going to get some of that. Almost looks like panoramic. You're going to be like, I'm going to see it as our Audi. Yeah. I'm like, okay. Yeah. Yeah, like that. Yeah. Yeah. You can look at that a lot. Yeah. We're back in something to redraw that. Do you want to hold that? Yeah, man. You know, it's kind of nice to be with us. Are you from here? Yeah, from here. Not from Canada. Not. Or not. This is what we have. I love this totally. There's things, pretty. Baged off in the door. Really? Don't open the door. It's from a same PDH, pre-delivering� inspection. all the time. It's the only goes to 25 miles an hour. What is the first one? When the guys were in the dealership, they scuffed their stuff to there. Susie came and took a picture. She's a client. I'm gonna ask you J and have her contact with Mondays. Yeah. And I was a youngster. I saw this all night. I was like, thank you for showing me. Yeah. Take a close look at the chocolate. Yeah, it's perfect. Take a little blue hue and set a sandwich here. Yeah. I think I had a white wrap at the before. It was just like the light color. But you wanted to go generic. I wrapped it in a circle. Yeah, it's like the perfect couple. Yeah, this was it. Yeah. So you... All right. Sad times. I got a new vehicle. I'm really sick about it. Very quickly. Just dropped it off at Palm Beach Raps. Like 30 minutes from my house, but Dom got a lot of his cars here. And whenever you go to a rap place, if you see a Lamborghini or a sitting there, I think they're pretty good at rapping. So, trust them with a lambo, trust them with the truck. But I'm gonna leave you here for five days. He said, they're gonna rap it. I'm gonna look like a brand new beautiful truck when we get back. So, that's that. We're gonna head back home now. For the warehouse. We've got our shipping above energy. So, I think I'm gonna have show you guys all the beautiful palette above energy. Let you guys know why exactly it's gonna be launching. Because you're very excited about that. So, stay tuned. Oh, I guess this. That's the worst feeling ever. All right. Given update, what's my going on? Yes, right up there right now. I can't breathe. All right. Update, what happened last week? Last week we had Carly down to you guys saw that we shot for about energy. Those pictures are looking fucking sick. Coming up soon. I'll talk more about that one, the whereas we see it. But we also had a really interesting few meetings. What's that guy that we hired to be our chief brand officer? So, we have a lot of creative this in our brand. A lot of branding we put out. But a lot of structure to the lacky. So, we hired someone to kind of come in and really forward. We have a lot of companies coming up next year. So, we're trying to like, streamline and organizing them. And building proper brand, voice and message for all of them. There's something that we've been missing and to really take our actual brand. To the next one for others. It's like product. We needed somebody to help us. So, we hired to have me camped out. Using Terry getting us hanging out with everyone for the last week. Kind of putting systems in play and talking about shit. And then took all our information, talked with somebody company for a few hours. And then he went to go home and he works with a team and they put it together like a deck. And he works with that going forward and created like brand campaigns, creative campaigns. Just like suffocating forward to create like one of our vision of the brand. So, we are very excited about that. Big main focus on that is for a really. Because that's our kind of baby right now that we're focusing on the drugs. So, I'm really excited about that. Do it's pricey. But, you know, we're pushing putting our body back into the company right now. Just to like elevate it as much as we can. So, it's really fun to kind of see different levels of the business that it's coming to. And, which way do we need to take it? Obviously, like it's cool like promoting supplements and stuff all the time. But, like, you see brands like Nike and fucking the theaters even, whatever the bread bowl, these huge companies that are more of a brand than even our product. They're not known for one product. So, it's really cool, even Jordan. It's like different than Nike, but it's own brand. Both of us are in the same umbrella. The plastic is really cool how they built that long lasting like life to the brand. So, that's what we're working on right now. So, that's going to be coming out next year or so, and forever on. So, come to about that. But, not just chilling, but the dream. Not jumping for a while, so, can't you play in? That's mainly what we had a party this week, too. And you will rob, rob, free-live party. Like, uh, what you call those? A work hour? A gala? Dom has so many businesses outside of just us, and then brought them all together with rob, and to like 160% gala. And we did it, and we gave it a war, it's kind of rewarding our team members and employees who were putting in that first stuff. And it's something you've done for the last like four or five years, which is really cool. Because I was at one of the first ones, but we did it in a restaurant, in a corner of a restaurant. And there was like 15, 20 people there. And that was like athletes and employees, and all the shit now, there's 160 people. Like, 80 people they couldn't make it, so it's pretty crazy how much there's an hour team of grown. Very exciting. Dr. Fucking Beast, he's taken it over the world, so she said to me out for the red, but that's actually like I don't know. So, we'll see you get the door and stuff. I should have your face too. Jesus, I'm caught off. Leave me in a fuck alone. And you've stuck on your face, sir. Okay, well, like, don't film me that. Why do you need it? You don't film me, you babe. Please. I'm done being roasted. Did you see the story yesterday, Calvin? Yeah, I know. I thought I was softer too. Oh, all those ones, yeah. This is how you become a viral. By being a viral sensation. Yeah, by being a gross, double meme. That's how Chris got up to his popularity. Babe, I'm going to follow your footsteps. By the way, I won't be by well. I'm kidding. Not filming me, and then everyone makes fun of me on YouTube. I'm not really knowing. Yes, I do. I'm really not one person. I'm really not one person. I'm going to fuck you down. Everybody just follow me. Oh, I'm just going to fuck you down. It's so... It's so... The best I could do. I'm walking away in shame. Alright, so that is the morning. A little bit late today, but it's okay. I got blocked in my job. I'm going to be a little bit too busy my car. But it's our day. It's a really more than our day. I'm actually going to be taking the next three days off the gym. So obviously, I have to hit our before I take them off. But I'm doing blood work on Friday. It's the most accurate way to not have like high formation from her eating. Not too high. I had it in a bunch of other blood markers. It's taken a few days off the gym before. So that's what I'm going to be doing. I'm trying to make sure I'm all healthy. Before you have this Aussie to go on. So we blasted our workout early morning. She ate this morning. I had like a bunch of oats. The morning kind of starving when I woke up. And I went there ready to do a fast workout. So a little bit of food in me. And my brain's not fully awake yet. So pretty good job to do it. Alright, so I like to start with this long-ass rope. If you don't have it, you can take two ropes and pull the attachment to the side and make each rope long. And attach two ropes on it. And I'm just trying to make sure my shoulders aren't locked in. But not able to pull it then. I'm going to make sure it's back into the fully contracted position. The tightest spot you can get your triceps behind your back. So I'm looking like pushing. And almost like pulling back a little bit. Almost like a lot pull over. But I'm just pulling for my triceps and you really feel tight. So it's a good way to warm them up. Then we're going to do some like close grip. So this machine I think. So I'm just trying to make sure that there's a lot of blood on my triceps. And I know her myself in the morning. She's going to do that. She's going to do that. Who would you? Paul Press? Yeah. Or freeweight. Floor. Would you like to? Jenga. And you crossed the gym. So floor prosthetics. Yeah. Does it give me a paddle? I don't know how to get up. Oh my god. My athletic. I'm going to do that. What floor press? It probably been three years. What's that done this? Actually feels good. Kind of the purpose of floor breast is working your lock out. If your paddle is doing your lock out is essentially your tricep movement at the end. So focusing on triceps right now in the press. Getting less stretcher my pecs. Marvellous coming as far back. I'm just trying to keep it all right on my tricep. My tricep touches the floor. Contract and lock it out. It feels so bad. I'm just going to get you off the ground. Sorry to have you. I thought she felt really good. I'm not going to lie. Floor plus. Floor plus. Floor script. Go to. Floor. Floor. Floor. Floor. Floor. Floor. What else can I do? Finish tricep before doing biceps? I can't handle my biceps. I can't handle my triceps. I can't handle my triceps. This is my go to the favorite machine in the gym. A classic staple. I can't handle my go to warm up and I'm not doing heavy. At least you have to mean. Actually it's a train back in the day we go back and forth. Trying to get really heavy. It's good. At the time, I'm really trying to build my arm. I feel like I'm doing a little higher volume. I'm going to drop it and see how many I can get. One 25 on the rack. This is the warm up. Don't just go. I can't be on the fucking YouTube. I can't be on the fucking YouTube. Huh? You just finger it all the kids. What? You just finger it all the kids. Just you're not called them the children. Mad babies. You just finger it on. The mad babies. What? I can't wait for them. I literally cannot. I cannot. You guys are still in pain. I'm not in the mood. See? Still. Oh. Sorry for the trouble. It's something I wanted to do. I'm setting on the machine. I have to hold the bar up. Here, on the bottom of my hand I have to go over here. I feel my body is pulling along this way. I have big ass hands and skinny wrists. I'll talk the wrong way. All the motion you put on my delir, my four minute film, I'll buy a set. So, play round with it. Move her into the room. All right, taking bicep and my girls, I'm letting the bar fall a little bit down my hands. I'm holding it at the top of the demo, rather than middle of the bottom. And I'm coming up and pulling like this. I'm really focusing on pulling in my bicep here. I'm actually taking that rather than just letting your wrist touch and pulling shoulder up and shit. And feeling a little bit more inside of my bicep. I'm trying to get those fucking fillets for arms. My clothes. Should we get him blends? No. I'm feeling it. Fucking huge bro. No more skinny bitch. But if it's a little bit too weak, it's out. So, be with him. Left and here. Left, вариант. Mmm. Alright, last try set thing, we're gonna do is behind the head cable kick back strap extension, name that myself, but just a little bit of a nice way of doing school crusher here is over the head something so that you get that really deep stretch of your tripod with a little bit less stress of a dumbbell or bar ball going over your head and literally crushing your skull. So, I'm gonna do this and then try to find out the bicep I accept to do. I wanted a little of cables but they're taken so I'll just stare at those ladies until they lead you. What's going on? Big man, nine torn one looks smaller. Is that your torn one? It's working work. This is bigger. I know. Oh. It's still all the protein I've been taking. What? Can I have that? Yeah, just let me have a sit. What is it? I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't. What? It's a packet candy. This is a rocket candy. Alright, so, so we're gonna do this up there yesterday but we forgot I'm gonna left up. So, we're doing it today but I wrapped up that our morky one home had breakfast made it into the warehouse and I wanted to show you guys the amount of bun menager we have lying around here. We have about 4,500,000 cans of energy drinks. So it's a lot of energy we have to drink it all by the weekend. Yeah, we have a lot of time to tell you. It's fucking good. So, what were they getting in the talk about? This is really good. It's a lot of me trying to talk. It's gonna be launching April 16th in my membership. Approximately around that day that's the goal. First of all, we tell you that really bought an environment shop because of our history with rough. It's gonna be there but we're also gonna be on Amazon. So, we're gonna be announcing on the bottom energy Instagram where it's gonna be available on Amazon. It's gonna be selling by the case and in the fridge and somebody have been shopping by the case on Amazon. It was 12 packs and yeah, I don't know if I could fully discuss what it is. But it's 112 milligrams of caffeine. I know it's 2.5, but I just don't look right here. Can you read this? What? We don't look for it. Just come here. He's already motherfuckers keep sealing from it. I'm fucking still anything. So don't blame me. I bought mine. I buy mine. For our losing my turn of thought. Anyways, 112 milligrams of caffeine. The goal on the back is says here. One can, you can go to the 12 ounce cup of coffee, approximately. But this is because we all like to drink energy drinks like multiple throughout the day. And I'm not trying to have like 200, 400, 300 whatever milligrams of caffeine and one drink. We can enjoy it, sip on it. Like a light orange flavor and then a cherry frost flavor, the other flavor. Super delicious. It's got 250 milligrams of cognizant in it. It kind of helps with brain clarity focus and it's actually really good for your brain. I think 500 milligrams of cognizant, so it's like help us to mention Alzheimer's and stuff and stuff that we're probably not should going to claim, but I can say whatever I want on YouTube. So that's going to be launching in April. Stay tuned. Follow up on manager room. We do a bunch of giveaways. We're giving away cases. Another shit if you follow the account. So stay tuned for all that. Amazon's worth going to start. We've got new flavors already in the woodworks. This is a rocket candy. We're trying to match one of our pre-workouts. And we had a blackberry lemonade. A rocket candy. It's a fucking delicious. None of them are super strong like CRP. They're actually a good light taste. You like CRP. Cojun can see them. These are just very good tasting. And if you guys have any flavor suggestions coming below, I'm thinking like a nice peach maybe or like rocket candy buck realmated stuff like that, but we're going to be coming up with a bunch of flavors over the next X amount of years. So come and down below. We'll take it into consideration. And yeah, stay tuned. But manager is going to be really singing the next month or so. So don't miss out. Just going to be fired. Hopefully we're going to be all over our gas. My dream is to be in gas stations one day. That'd be fucking cool. So yeah, that's all I have to say about. Can we wrap on this video a little bit all over the place? But that's my life right now. We're a little bit all over the place. So thank you for watching. Please subscribe. And I'll see you in the next one.

=== FILE: LAST LEG WORKOUT ｜ 6 DAYS OUT THE OLYMPIA [zhMd46oSmXY].txt ===

Part of the people, the heartburn, the gas, the consultation. It was the game. We'll make sure not to spit it tonight. We're gonna double tea bag you. No. No. I'm not eating. I've been stunned on teas. It stopped on. Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on. Come on. We come on. Let me in. Come on. Come on. Help me, sir! That's why we got to make sure the water is really high right now. Because that helps with moving. That big, big, big, big, big water. You know that, that's what's interesting. The water and then getting you the digestive enzymes and then getting you something is going to help with a little bit of that amazing question. We'll be doing this. Well, maybe also if you drink that caffeine, that back in the act of the stimulant to help too. What is up, YouTube Saturday? 70s out. Peak because we got him. It's game time and guess who joined us. Game time. The sir. Honey himself is an entown. And we are about to hit the final leg day of the 20-20 to a limpia prep series. So welcome aboard. It's going to be a good one. Do you have full legs? Everything we can kind of hit, caps, the hamstring quad. Maybe my life liked it the entire year. Could I hit it myself, trading like the first one? Maybe you will see probably not. But yeah. So... Okay, right. Thank you. No comment. We'll see that comment for a while. We'll see if it's a lot of the show that we drew us out on. But yeah, I mean, I got some energy right now. So we're going to try and get the fuck out of here. It's a gym. It's a nice dead yesterday. So we're hoping it's like that again today. You know, crush this final leg workout after this we're cruising through the week. So it got some weight to drop. So it's depleting so I'll push in. But, you know, it's very rocked peak week. So let's do it. The shower. You like it? The whole kitchen. Yeah. What is nice having real cold water? Are you in the detonate? We're going to make a stand. Okay? Yeah? And then I'll show you a set of my two sides. Choose a Wednesday. Fuckin' out for a guy outside. Saturday, bro. This is a video for a week already. We never hear this early. I've been going by pretty slow. But this is also like the longest you've been going by for a day. It's been going slowly. One day. I think I haven't been that long. I can't do it. I can't do it. I dropped my water. Oh, I just built ghost all of a sudden. I didn't want to cold it. I still need to hold it. That's all still heavy. Thanks. Well, they didn't get it today. Well, I had my revive like kidneys. In one hand, there's a lot of kitten. And I went to open up another one with it in my hand. And I did this and I just dumped like 400 pills on the ground. I was like, I just threw it up in through my mouth. Fuck it. I just bought a cane. I just wanted to get it. Yeah, it's rolling when it down and fucking go dude. Okay. I can't have the dynamic blooded spinal cord. Everyone's just kind of like, just rolling when it's down. Can you Kevin, can you please? Okay. It was like after you ate it. It's fermented. I'm telling you, I'm telling you. Let's see if guys, I don't sleep next to him. I sleep over the blanket. I was suffering blanket. It's just like, you know. What do you mean it's always before the gym? It gets so worse. I'm telling you, fish before the gym is not the milk. Yes, he's asking. Construction. I just kept doing it with the camera. I love everybody. I'm very grateful. Well, I'm in the middle of the workout. One week after my final leg day, I love you even more. If you wait until I work out to ask me the questions. Finally, what's the plan for today's workout? Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to get blood in his quads, hamstrings, calves. We don't want us to throw in a mileyess body, but we want to be able to continue to keep that fullness in that way. It's as much as possible. But the reason why you don't go 100% is just to throw in, is because you've got to make sure they're nice and dry by the way. So it's about 80% and it's just a matter of just keeping that volume in the station and all the muscles in the lower body. You know, the carbs in the my leg, you know? I like carbs. You make a carb up with nothing but a inhale burger and diet-tapsy because diet-tapsy will make sure you let's go. Okay. You can see the cost of the elevator. Did that run up? Yeah, I remember you only had your lunch. They have a bacon, peanut butter, hamburger. I think they need the carb up here. Have you ever had peanut butter in your dinner? No, it's not that. So it's a major. It's a famous place called the Working Out in Canada. It's like 200 burgers and they have one-celled skater boy. It's like peanut butter for Dama, burger. Yeah. I've never had peanut butter in banana, but I've had peanut butter at slators down in certain calfrey. And they made peanut butter burger with this jelly. That's like a marmalade jam. Yeah. It's so good. They also have a bacon jelly peanut butter one. Oh, that's fucking good. I really want. Fucking a huge chest. So good. I'm ready. Let me touch you on here. Yeah, you want more? He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. There it is. Good. Good. Hey, turn your tongue over. That way. Get your child. There you go. There you go. Go. Go. Go. Good. Nice. Very good. So nice. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You're going. 14. Yeah. It's a little different. Hold on. Just so... You're pretty sure we're good. Where are you just like... Well, I switched on. Just a speaker to the final leg workout. I'm gonna have a chance, Camer. Can you get out of the stairs? I don't know. Too late for them to implement it now. But next you will have new tickets. Okay. I'm going to do it. One more, one more. Go. All the way. Slow. Good job. One more. Just go away. One more set. Come on. Two more. Good. Hold on. Hold on right there. Good. You're going to keep closer together. We're just going to do like... You get 12 to 15 reps. You just... Really get... Like... You're going to flex there. All right. All right. What we're going to do is we're going to focus on being able to just get some reps in some quality reps. We're going to keep this feet a little closer together. And go with it and just really finish up those hamstrings. Get that really good contraction. Let's keep it moving. Keep it moving. There you go. Good. Good contraction. Good. Good. Go. Two more. Good. One more. Good. Good. Good. Good. Press. Just go away. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. You see that jump? No. It's good. It's good. Good. Yeah. I feel like I'm going to do it. There you go. One more. The building is the room. One last pleasure of the world. Sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have a carpet anymore. It's going. Damn. What's the coffee? The sad cardio session. You know, something anymore last year. You know, it'd be like dogmas to the parking dog and brother. I can't get up at 3am and I'm running 50 miles. That way. What? I'm going to get under 240. How happy is that you are for the food on three places. It's just so weird right now. Because the first two routes feel like really light, but then I'm just so tired. I feel like I could. I would just go to the room on this. And then you'll see where that goes. Because I think you can probably get what you want to 50 on this. It's weird to like, it probably get like, eat the 10 on this. 5 place empty plate. But as soon as I hit like eat, I'm like, oh, like a plug-to. But if you want me to hit 12, then you probably get it. Just push it a little bit more with some more laps. It's ringing the people a little bit. So, that was all the time. So, I'm going to go to the bathroom. So, I'm going to go to the bathroom. So, I'm going to go to the bathroom. So, I'm going to go to the bathroom. So, I'm going to go to the bathroom. Go. Yes. It's so easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy to take any bed of 13 beds into a bed of 11 Yes. Yeah, there's probably the best I think for me In any breath like normally it was not be able to move that way now. I'm in your left I have no problem. I'd be fucking like like I'm used to my muscles or a limb and also the fuller. I'm lean it. It's just like there Is well like what two two three we talk you have nothing else What But anyway, Paul is there Where are the lutes back? What? Where are the lutes back? It was turning into one of those susboys. Not on me. I was thinking of the other nudge. You get more of these. I saw them in a title to the video. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Push. Good. Good. Good. Good. You can move it. You can't wait a little bit. Good. Good. Keep it moving. Last set on this. Come on. Move it. Three more. One. Two. Go on. And drive it. Good. Excellent. Good. Good. Good. This one. You're looking for a minor champion for a title. That's a really different. Yeah. And more. Mm. Come on. Let's get this working set here. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on. Good. Smart. Ready to go? Go up! Watch out! Go up! How's that way? Light? Turn it until I hit five breaths. I see it has it feel to take a couple of months off our lifespan in the car. Feel pretty damn good. I know, it's what I say. I hope you enjoyed it. I would say it's good. Do you know? What two months up on the lifespan for you? Because you just are feeling a gas. It's my muster gas. This is the ship you were going on. The heart part of the people. The heartburn, the gas, the consultation. It's the game. We'll make sure not to spit it tonight. We're going to double tea bag you. No. What do you think about it? I bet it's done. I don't even know what the heavy size is. It's a sexual one. We need to drop your balls on someone's face. I don't want any of that. You're wrong. Get away. Can't so be able to be a part of that tea bag. Sign up for the free speech. I'll help you take it application. The raffle, 999 at fibonfinnis.com. Top two into tea bags. See you. That's so fun. Oh, so many. Yeah. What? I'm shaving. What? My beer? Two, three. I should have like three inches off my beard. I was like, little different. I was like, kind of fucking beard. Well, thanks. We'll shorter than him. Not quite done. How do you keep growing that shit in about a week? Yeah. Did you ever see him when it was really long? It was pretty, uh. And then he bleached it once. And then it made it look like Hoco in. Yeah. He's got a kept that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good job. Yeah. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Good. Good. Good job. I think that's how we feel in the most right now. And the quadrine I glue. Big glue. Upper deep hip. I think he's hip-riss. We're going to upper thigh. Sorry, Tommy. Yeah. Don't want to go in. Don't go in. Come on. Slow, slow, hold it. Slow. Good job. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, wait, slow, slow, slow. Slow, slow, slow, one more. It's like that. Go. Hold it. Slow, slow, slow. Hold it. Hold it.

You're done. You're done. You guys all get the moves. Those guys are on. You got the baby. That's really bad. You got the baby. That's what I'm talking about. You got the baby. That's what I'm talking about. That's the medium. Good. Good. Feeling up. Feeling up, eating. Just a bit. Your face is like vinegar. You're not. You know, a fancy, like you. You know nothing. She's a dreaded lettuce. No shred of lettuce. Not even loaded. Just a little bit of this berry. This, this, this, this, this, this white fish. You know what's going on? You got your barbecue buffet. Yeah. You're doing last week. That's one. We're doing the first belt. Very fun. You remember? You feel a pressure of 130? Yeah. You're hit for a little more. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Okay. That's probably your own camera. I'm gonna see it. Yeah. This Mr. Dr. Marlin, the GOAT best RMT. Cairo I've ever seen. I can say that with pride. I've seen him twice since been Vegas twice last week. I haven't seen him once or twice the week. This prep and it's been helping me so much open out my clots. Flutes everything. He just like knows the body so perfectly. And he's not afraid to hurt you. Luckily I've been doing it for a while. So we opened up a lot of the shit. Yeah. I'm not afraid to hurt you. And he knows how to beat me up too bad. No, I'm glad we did that work beforehand because I don't know how it would have gone. It wouldn't have been a little too rough. I'm going to run for it now. That's why you gotta keep up with the body. You gotta take care of your body. It's so crucial last year I didn't do this. When I felt it in my body, I saw it on stage. So I'm doing it all this year taking care of everything I can. Trying to cheap my body rate. He's helping me do it also. Not perfect. We get it on my soul. So let's see here. You want to do hamstrings first or you want to go and do hamstrings first. Or you want to go into the quads and inside. Where do you feel during your leg workout? I think so. All right. We'll hit one. I have to change the calvone. You get the lot of your ass to put it on. Okay. You're still. Yeah, because the quads will be nice. With that, we'll get you face up here. Let me just get, sorry, if I play a little music. It's kind of like the vibe of things. Yeah. Yeah. Over so if you focus anymore in those upper quads, so we're just going to lather down. I like to use a shade butter. No essential oils or anything wild into it. They've got a tanner that's going on. And you don't want anything to irritate the skin with that tanner. So plus it's just moisturizing and it's good. And it glides. It gives you enough grip. Because sometimes some oils are too slippery. And I don't, I don't like that. Just go ahead and give me a little flex. Let's see what we got. Just nasty. Let's just sick. So yeah, what we're going to go do more. We want to focus and start to open up this line here. Because you can kind of see there's a little connection and then up through the top. And then that's going to be sort of a mangle. We'll act it there. Yeah, we have them pressed down that heel. Does this process called reciprocal inhibition. Pretty much you turn those hamstrings on and it'll turn off the quads just for a little bit. And it'll be enough for it to let go. And I just check in with it's face because. You know, he's read my face with it. Get to the bad part. Yeah, because if it's, uh, he's got to click that. Just try to think. If it, uh, you can just soak up a lot of heat. Put 600 pounds on his back for fun. So a little bit of me. You put. And the puss. So we're opening up these upper quads. His lower quads, they contract really nicely. Go ahead and flex. There we are. So we're starting to open up that channel through here. And that's what he's been wanting to focus on is these upper quads to fire when he's posing. You get the deep, like, cuts up into your hip. I've missing that last year. Now we're going to change it up. So that was just kind of a deep dig. Now we just kind of change up the technique to more of a spreading. Doesn't look too much, but I know he can feel its openings like open in his Ziploc bag. And press that heel down. Flex. Here we go. Starting to get that open. How's it feeling up top? Good. So what we'll do here, bend this knee. There you go. Let it fall out. We're going to follow this our tourties up. And the sarturious and, like, all the other adductors, they are pretty sensitive, especially when we get to the top, they feel like fire. And the second here, we're going to see those veins open up. You can start those veins sort to really pop out. And that's what we're looking for. So open up those adductors to allow that to really flow through. And I mean, he's not even on any sort of, he's a very hard load right yet. I'm really can only imagine what this is all going to start to look like. Real food. Yeah. Lossium. And I can't really imagine. So we're going to have a roll this leg in. What we'll do is kind of. Nice breath in. And you guys can't feel what I'm feeling, but there's, because, like, little rice Krispies. Next, what I call them at the least. And those are little micro adhesions of the fascia. And as they start to cut weight, it's really between the muscle and the skin. And that's what we're trying to have it let go. So that the skin doesn't have that rigid look. It's just look like a layer of wet clothes over the top. I shouldn't even be seeing it better. See, here we'll just test that out. Give me a flux. There they go. Really nice clean. Let's get that. I need you to have a let's go. Oh, flux. So I'm going to go ahead and go approach this sort of little straight line. That's going on in there. I'll just go to feel it in a little part. One of the beauty with these athletes is you can see the adhesions on most people. There's usually a 10, 15% body fat that will cover that more. So these guys, you can just really see it. Flex. Here we go. Starting to loosen up, relax it. Just twitching. Flex. Here we go. And now it's starting to let go. Perfect. Let that side relax for a second. So Chris, everyone probably knows how to injury to this quad, right? What are one? Minor. So it looks just a little bit different. But we've been working on it and we've actually been noticing some fairly good progress. Let's get it shiny. We have flex. So we want to get up into this ridge line. Get up into that upper quad again. Nice and easy. Bend that knee. Just head of fall. And now slowly straighten that leg out. Sometimes I get a lot of people who ask me like, is it exhausting to work on these big guys? And you really be surprised. It's actually pretty, find it a little bit easier because their muscle belly is so big. That you can use your full hand contacts. You can use good knuckles. And you're just leaning on them. You don't want to push too hard. That's too exhausting. Just all about leverage. I keep my tables low so I can lean. Some massage therapists and facial workers. They'll keep their table too high. And they're just using too much shoulders. Here I can just really lean into it. Some of it's effortless. And I let their body do all the work. Good straight in that leg. Flex for me. Sounds good through that channel now. Try to straighten that just a little. There you are. You said that does. It's just insane the versatility. It starts really filling. Go ahead flex. Yeah. Now we're getting those straight. You shouldn't have to come out. So let's follow the certatories here. These are as long lines. Not everyone's looking for. I think once you see a good sartoria song somebody. That's when you know they've gotten to there. One more flex. So yeah. We're getting those separations up here. Now it's that TFL. We're in a lighting in this room. We'll have Flex it. There we are. Hi guys. Let's get me wrap on today's video. Like the no more leg things. No more leg did till the prep is over. So it's all done. And this is a new thing I did for the first time. Was it last Tuesday or something where you told me he's like no it's actually good to train legs and then you get a leg massage immediately after. And it feels so it feels so good. The next day if you're more recovered the blood's moving blood's flowing and like everything moving the way you want it to not tight bound up and beat up. Especially right now because we can help remove all the inflammation and everything through me get those deep cuts that we're working on. So super grateful for that. Take care of your day and body. Very important. If you're in Florida, Dr. Miles of the man to do it. So. You're going to say that about people on the road through. So. But this is going to be our one-day video. Thank you for watching. I think Calvin's doing the other videos. What? Are we doing the other videos? Calvin's grand time. So send him your love. Send him your energy. He needs it. And thank you for watching. Catch you later.

=== FILE: LAST WORKOUT IN FLORIDA ｜ RETURN OF THE STACHE [QXojpehxhbg].txt ===

Now Chris, I told him it was very very close to the end, but at the end of the day it was the mustache that brought him in. You know I have to pay the latches at the one time and got there at me. I was ready to rock this ass on stage, but this year was... It's alright, now it has to be done. Come on, come on Chris, come on, come on, come on. We come on, let me check, come on, let's go, we won. What is up YouTube? Not really ready, because my hair is crazy and I didn't even know that I was going to do it. But the mustache is making it superior. The beard is gone. I'm like a reverse sips and if you know that guy is, the shape my beard and my classic easy comes up. So this is when it's down to the nitty-gritty of the time I shave my beard. If you have no, you know the first year 2018 that shaved off my mustache wasn't ready to rock it. 2018 my bucket rocking the mustache on stage, first ever in a few minutes. And I've done it ever since now. It's like my symbolic game time, lock it in, face the skinny, and I'm ready to fucking go. So, the beard's gone and this is our last day in Canada or Florida. This is a fucking weird. The last day in Florida, according to actually just last, because she's bringing poppy to Chicago, leaving poppy to Chicago and then she's meaning as a big as tomorrow. So, the last day here, last work here, here, everything here. The packing, the name is ready and it is hard to fuck packing. When we get a show, my brain is like, I'm like tired, I'm like, if you can go out high for my own. I get super lazy, but Courtney absolutely hooked it up. Don't worry, you can show the fridge, haven't I? I have all my meals trapped in here. She's got even children. She's got four meals trapped. Some cucumber, if I get hungry, a little bit of bulk chicken, a little bit of bulk turkey, so I can freeze and bring with me, and some bags of rice, so that I have everything I need for the day. I'm going to eat breakfast here, then we're going to beat up there and go grocery shopping, do everything I need there. I'm losing my money, so that's all. But also, join over with me and bring it to. This is my like fun little thing. I've had these sitting in my garage for a minute. These are no loss and fountains. These are the Chicago's OGs, 2015, Jordan Monz, that I've been preparing to wear the Titsa Olympia. Michael Jordan used to lay stuff his own shoes himself, everything was game and it was like his ritual that he has to do. One time of train actually lay shoes up for him and he's like, fuck that, he'll get me new shoes I need to lay some up. So I'm bringing these to Vegas like this, and I'm going to be rocking them just kind of leaving the peak. We've churned on my inner Michael Jordan, don't we ask for that 4-peat? Yeah, that's kind of what it's going on. I'm trying to finish packing that thing. Today's arm day comes again in the terracat. We're just kind of getting everything finalized, so I'm going to be gone for about 3-4 weeks. We're going to go to Canada for Christmas and then we're going to go Chicago. First, we're going to go on Peterwin. So I'm making my meal number 2 right now. And you know it's a great sign when honey sees my chickens and he's like, alright. Yes, really he told me not to do night time cardio tonight, I'm doing night time cardio. But he told me to add some fats in my diet, so I get some avocado. And I get either more avocado at night or steak at night, so I might stop by frozen, get steak later tonight. But it's a good sign when you're week and a half out of any there. Okay, if I can peel, we don't want to get you too flat. We've got a little less cardio, we don't want to eat it like the shrink down. We have a little more fats, just kind of like fill you up a little bit and not like with her away. And these last few stages feel good to like be on point if not ahead of anything. It's a lead to make a weight, so we're working on that. But that's everything that's going on today, so I'm going to finish up packing, get my food ready, get all my stuff ready, get everything ready. Eat, probably not taking nap because I'm exhausted just from doing all this shit. We're going to go treat some arms, bring it in a little pump, it's just possible. And that's it, so we'll see you guys there. Alright, so this is the... Final last workout in Rwajum. Luckily it's a little dead right now, but shouldn't be music because it's opening, so put my headphones in and get to it. You guys know the drill, just trying to get my blood flow and blood flow right now because we give my body up right now. The hardest thing to do, I went and I laid down the spawning after packing and shit and I just like chill. Maybe I'm going to read what you're sure is something you should close by for a second and then I couldn't move for like an hour and I woke up. I was like trying to get my ass out of bed and it has to hold shower and just like slot my face and wake up. Eat and come here. Hopefully that means tomorrow on the flight, like a five hour flight, I can just close my head and take the whole way. But until then, we're going to get to see how I'm workout. I've got a crush just how I'm workout because I'm there at point where I've got this here. I'm not losing in the last week, so we're going to get a good workout in. We're wrapping up here in Florida. Call us today. Yeah. Yeah. This machine was too late for me. My off season. I could barely use it because it's too late. I actually didn't get 10 reps. Fucking hell. Yeah. Yeah. Good. You're a whole thing about today. Three people. Oh, male, I couldn't die. It's all I want to hear. Someone said you look good and I'll look like fuck you. Oh, male, I couldn't die. Okay, look like what I want to hear. How do you make my face even more sunken in? Perfect skeleton. Red skull. Fucking Captain Mercury. Oh, it's been over. It's been over. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

No, I don't know. Do I have a sex thing on the other side? I don't know. I don't know. Lovely. Welcome to have a buddy. Yeah. We've got a couple of treats. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's like Czech cereal covered in powdered sugar. I made with protein powder. A powdered gel. A cup of sugar. A cup of sugar. A powdered sugar. A protein powder. A peanut butter. Just like a little snack. You're far away through a heart. No. No. Usually I look good in the back. I respect it. I'm respecter food. I respect that. Hydration. For champions. For champions. Fab check. That was it. Bab check. Bab check. Did you get a drink of toast? I'm mixing it. I got it. That's a dairy powder. How much does it bring to treat? Does it give a joy of the toast? I like to eat it. I like to eat it. It's like sour strips or what? Well, I think the best like if you want the carbs. If you guys have a glucose, it's like the Mexican candy glucose. Yeah, yeah. It's like salt and sugar. It's the best. The best. Yeah. It's not so hard. It's not so hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. Are you not used this level, Worma? No, I'm not used to it. I'm just a fire. Are you going to get me to get you a fire? I'm going to get you a fire. I put you on your plate. I'm going to get you on plate. So you'll start grabbing some plates. I don't know. Christmas viewers don't know what a sunshine set is. Sension set. Okay. So this is kind of a bitch test we call it. So this is what's going to wake you up and see who's willing to work. So we are going to start here with Chris and I will do five plates. So we're going to do around a 12. So 12 reps. He racks it. So when he racks it, pat in and I are going to put a plate on it's side. So then he's going to do five reps. We're going to do five reps. We're going to do five reps again. Another plate. Eat side. Five more reps. Another plate. Until he can't go any more. So I think it's the opposite of a drop set. So everybody does drop sets. We want to make it harder. So we're going to do a Sension set. So it's increasing plates each round. I think it's going to go as long as you can. So the goal here probably for him and I is probably going from five plates up to 10 each side. So you like I said 12, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5. For her, I don't know. We're going to see what she can do. So I'm excited to see that. You just say homie. 10 plates. Yeah, you're going to change with 10. Chris. We need more patty. I like. Can I do this up two there? Just up two. Get that key. We're going to both. We're going to both. Yeah, I'm first. Okay. Yeah. I'm going to wrap it and then you're both going to put one plate on. Then you go set sets of five. Oh wait, are we going to alternate here? No, no, just me. I'm saying there. So I do 12. I wrap it. You put it on like a five. Wrap it. Put it on a five. As many five as you can. So we're going to go. This is to get to 10. Yeah, I'm going to get to 10. I might make sure you're spot.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, pancake, you're a mouth. What? These up YouTube. Welcome to travel vlog for the first time in a while in the last time until the Olympia. We're headed to Nashville, Tennessee, a great opening of one of our friends, Jim. Carbon culture. I'm going to be doing a Q&A and M.M. I'm going to talk a new, I don't know how many people. Like a thousand people are coming. We've got to custom seeking to trip to workout coming and the smash-filled flavor, which is like their natural lemonade or something like that. So I have a sleep, it's currently at like six AM, which I never do in the pitch black and I'm weird. But you can get my pancakes in, we're all packed up, got meals where you go. They've got food ready for me there too. I think I'm going to say get in, try to say I'm prep. That's all that's going on. I've got a E.T. pancakes and get to the airport. So see you guys there. Go to the me back home, play on the board. I found a few cardio six weeks out. Hello, I'm here. You weren't even doing it for a week? Yeah, what do you mean? I don't know, I just wonder if you can wake up and do it in the office. I don't know, maybe. I'm up at like 7.30. Are you? Get my turn on. That shit works. 45 minutes of cardio. You sweat like a pig on it. Yeah, a lot of times I eat, that you look on you in the garage. Oh, yeah, it was a lot of shit. Yeah. Yeah, my next little sore, a little longer than the bed, but don't completely speak of it in the middle of the plane. So, she had a breath, her chin gets inflamed. I'm sure it's all in my plane, but... Those are like boiled with a fly. What? Those are my legs, like this. You're gonna make it real? Yeah, that's true. Those are quick flights, they need to... I'll eat for you, land, but I'm not taking it. We fly pancakes. Oh, we're gonna have to... You're definitely a Kevin, so... I'll try not to get these balls to make it easy. I'm not gonna get these balls to make it easy. What does the national level of fuckers mean? I don't know what it means to know how to do it. You gotta go pee, okay? You know what I think? I do, probably. I can't wait to get my back. It's probably gonna be like six months ago. So, I have to fully film shit everywhere. Tom, so when you get one of these coffee makers for the office, I do. I do a big group. Even at 50-50, if you can have some regular coffee, so I don't have to get too much caffeine in the train. You know what? I'm just kidding. It's on the internet. Yeah, it's a little tired, but... This morning, just get off the boat. Yeah, it's on the boat. Yeah, we did all the class for the class. It's on the boat. It's on the boat. I know. Yeah, I know. It's on the boat. Yeah, I get a line. Yeah, it's on the boat. Yeah, it's the one for kind of carbon-carbon-douper. Good. Let's do a round of tasting before they get this guy shit right there. Yep, yeah. That was it. I think I was trying to take that. Yeah, great. There you go, Tom. What is this? Great, yeah. Fuck yeah. That's good. That's like good. Like good, too. Well, former was it? Yeah. It's like great. See you, B.A. The camera one? Uh, shan, how much did a man's good you have in that? I have a couple. They've had the meal and the dinner right there. Oh, that's the meal. I think it is. I think it is. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, that is. The meat is from the oven. Yeah. Sure. I didn't know that I could taste that there. So, that was good. That was good. Yeah, shit. That's red slush that you all got. Yeah, that's the same one that you've seen a thousand times. Yeah, shit. It's literally the food slush though. He gave me the lowest. I like it. It's like it's good. I don't know. 24 hours. I don't know. That's the same kind of a hydrogen. I mean, pre-extreme is the exact equivalent of that bucked up stuff. Same thing. That's the mood. So, didn't you get that thing? Call it Bumjeece. It was out. It was out. We'll be in every place. We've got an American bottles of what actually could be sold. I told him I wanted to make a Bumjeece flavor per pure. I don't know what it was. I think we could do it. It would go viral for sure. Yeah, maybe I'm like doing exclusive. Yeah, sorry. Was that blue raspberry? B-A. Yes, sir. J-L-Dats. That's your new one. How does it feel? It's good. Hopefully it was it. Red raspberry. Red raspberry. Did you get like the red slush that set? I think that's one. Yeah. Yeah. You like the current, all right? I can't do it. I think that red slush is like a slushy mission. I think so real for real. Yeah. Better like a snow cone. Maybe a snow cone. Blue raspberry has revision 3 ace k to cover that back end. I don't know how to do but. I like it. Okay. Get it. I'm not gonna do that, okay. You covered up the uh. I just don't love the blue raspberry. Did you like bring up the- It's like something else is like a strawberry in the front. Yeah, it's coloring back end, but it's like different from the front. What'd you do? I'm about to flavor just a little more. I think it tastes good. I think it's good after days now, though. Yeah, these are so hard. There. There's so little. This one's. You got over 10 grams of the uh. Me doesn't like that. This is really good. Kind of a little more than one that hydrate. Yeah. Just go kind of other way. Oh, there's not. There's not. There's not. I have the texture of one of these. And put it on the protein. So that one should get it got us. See, view sweet and one of these. Some point. Especially for hydrate. Whatever the best hydrate we have that you think we can do a stevia base hydration. Okay, that's like a little bit off. So can you sugar? Yes, but I don't know. I agree. I don't know what I mean. Is that all it's like, dude? Like, because like, people don't care about water too. Gramps of sugar. Good. Long wind the flavors and then use some stevia too. So it tastes way better. Yeah. Because you don't taste a stevia at all. Just like great candy. Great. What do you want to cut? I get a little more of that. All of these are so refreshing. That's kind of the good thing is that you don't want these too sour. What's that? What's that? What's that last one? There's like a certain amount of potassium. I like that a lot. I think it's like a certain amount of potassium. Yeah. Absolutely. That's all right. How are you? Very good. What's better? What's better? What's better than last time we came here? I never thought. Oh, you never came here. Oh, no. It looks so much better. I did. Yeah. This is the new carbon culture gym. You need to be Nashville Athletic Club. I definitely know what it is called. Something else. Pop of the gym. It's actually just a chain here. It looks completely different. It's actually the front of what you look like. It's completely black. Clean, new equipment now. Looks beautiful. Got this little leg area here. We're here testing it out.

We're going to have vintage masculine ovens. Yeah, very vintage masculine. You're like, we're only the medieval kind. I feel like it's like your grandparents house, like when you're not allowed to touch this stuff, right? This is like this room in that room. Oh my god. Do you have a casting in there? I don't know. I think they might be leather. But I like leather to show. Oh, okay. It's all about portions. Yeah, exactly. And the gym. Oh, that is. Yeah. You're going to go back there too. Oh, this is all about. Most of the ladies, most of that. Let me score a few of the boys in the room. I don't know. I think that's actually like this part of the gym floor. I think it's 1000. I think. Now. Not sure how much of old. Oh, there's outside. There's a lot of old ladies. They're making an anime stuff. I'll show you this. This is where like the ground line. You're going to go in train. So I don't go up here. Sorry. That's our one piece of car. We're going in there. It's not like. It's all the car. There's sometimes. We do a crowd. So that counts too. Yeah. We're just walking up and down these stairs. You know, like, shits. It's terrible. It's so cool. It's so cool. It's a little toast that you just converted. Yeah, it was actually a business. It was like, like some sort of like specialized furniture business or something. Yeah. Yeah. So it was like when I was like, I was training my first minimum at 40. And then like I, when I kind of just ended there, I kind of told him, I was like, hey man, I don't really, you know, know how to Berge this, but like I'm kind of leaving and do my own thing. He's like, oh, he's like, yeah, I had no big deal. I was actually like this close to telling him, I'm going to like over my own place and just trying to get you away from your anyway. I was like, oh, sweet. He's like, all this fast track. He's like, we'll get something built open and it's possible. And I was like, oh, he's shit. I was like, all right. Sweet. And so later we just started like looking around at places in the real estate agent. Like a first look at a bunch like, you know, Palac warehouse style, like building and then she's like, she's like, she knows Dave's, he's like, he's like, you know, all the fancy, like, decorate all that shit. I just picked all the equipment, but all the design stuff I got on, no about fancy things. And so anyway, she's like, we got this really, like kind of like cool unique building. So I don't know if it'll work for a jam, but like I figure it'll show it to you. And so he basically said like he had an idea of like, we can keep that. He wanted office out of his home as well too. So he was like, you think he can fit everything in this part. And I'm just like, yeah, share it with you. And also like I just kind of like, I did like some like really rough like square foot sketches and stuff. And I had a pretty guy like, I'll just order a little bit less stuff to start. And then there's like kind of piece me all together. And yeah, we got perfect. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, go to the floor. Nice. Yes. Pardon me. Pardon me. Love it. He started really young and I did like, because when did you turn the probe? I took a probe, twenty one. Yeah. I thought that that makes shows. I've only done like a lot of 12 shows total. Yeah. That's good though. That's really nice. I'm doing really shows. And that's the rough part. Yeah. Maybe we'll maybe let's do it. Maybe we'll just start. So you don't have to go like, he should have eaten. Maybe we'll just like a like, super set, maybe like, lay curls and lay extensions. And then just kind of get everything warmed up and probably do like maybe. Probably like the way I prefer to. It was maybe just like one heart set and everything today. And then maybe towards the end if we have something pretty locked in. Maybe two cents on something. But I started the isolation stuff and now we don't have to do a billion points. If we do like a squat variation or a leg course variation or something. Two. Two. Three. Time you guys. Yeah. Like don't. So I need slightly just a little more more. I'll go over back. I'll go over back. Yeah. And bro. And this one we'll try to block it down. Slag your legs a little closer together. Actually turn it there. Go your kneecaps. Point a little more straight up and turn that way just tap. There you go. See how that feels. So a bit. Just one. Just one. Just one. Just one. Just one. Yeah. All those warm-up just pop. Both hands kind of like you were doing almost a million. Four paws. Don't quite let it rest. Good. Do a couple of worry bringing down just about three inches right to my hand. Pause. Then back up. And then four wrap down is bottom. All the way hold. Then up about three inches. Then back. And then four wrap. Just do a couple more like that. Right there. Pause. Yeah. Back up. Pause. Yeah. Or a squeeze. You know, just a little bit. Back in. Or a squeeze. Just one more. Each way like that. Pause. Go again. Squeeze. Just a little out. Right there. Or it's going again. Good. Pause. Pause. Toes up. Down point. Can I go? Definitely. Like, somebody doesn't say it's like dramatically like I'm feeling something needed like cramping in my lower leg. Somebody says I'm feeling my calf cramping in my shin, you know, that 18 muscle cramping. I might kill him something. But if nobody says anything, I just leave him wherever they go. Let's do a couple of the same things here. So, I'm always the top. A little longer. Hold him. Bring it down. Just a little bit right there. Back up. Good. Same thing at the bottom. Just go down. A little pause. Are we up? Oh, with that go. Or the squeeze. Hold it down. Up. Squeeze. Up. Same thing. One more. Two more. Squeeze. Or we down. Or we down. Just a little hard control. Yeah. Nice. And super fancy between those pauses or whatever. But like, obviously we think about it's like the kind of common sense thing. But obviously if you're going to exercise, you're doing it intentionally to use your muscles. But sometimes obviously if you're just kind of going through the motion, even if you just do the pauses, sometimes you're still just kind of going through the motion. Or if you literally even give yourself because obviously the distance doesn't matter. But if you go from like a full contraction to like, okay, I'm going to bring it down through and then contract again and then same thing at the other end of the range. Because nobody messes up in the middle. We mess up at the ends. I'm going to exercise basically. So just like a little. I'll do it half time when I'm warming up. Just to see him like am I actually thinking about the things that I'm doing? Or I just. Yeah. It's going to the motion. Because I was like, that's the, I think the most neglected it. Not I could say it about a lot of things, but one of the most neglected things for people is their warm-ups. But it's like all they're thinking about is getting their top sets. So obviously that's half the point of them. But it's like, well if you get just do a couple really simple things to think about like, I'm not using my muscles the whole time, and obviously it's a more effective use of your warm-ups. And then some stuff as well too. For people that are like actually strong. Like if you can do things to make things just a little bit harder. Like I don't like to get too cut up with the tempo stuff. You know, we're doing like, you know, eight second negatives are really long causes or things like that. Like I like the idea of having something somewhat standardized. But if you can make a little bit harder, again, like from the top, little pause, making sure you're really in contractions, then it's going to be at least still as challenging on the muscle. You know, any one has to put quite a billion pounds on the challenge of the joints. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Especially like your big movement, because what I tell people all the time is like squat pattern and things. Like that's almost every time like the little slower time tricks, the longer pause in the bottom. And it's like it'll, you know, humble your routine of it. Because like your muscles are quadriding it just as much stimulus, but then you have, don't need as much loading or tire spine, or so everything else. Is it more of a thing? You do cut a little bit more. I don't know if there's one or two set of. But if I'm going to let your last one off, that your segment last will still do the same tempo you would normally go that. Let's go over the last two seconds. I'll try to put the answer just for a last. If you select it, this will be shim. It's going to be a little pause still. Just get lost when you do it. Don't worry, then. Okay. Thanks for that to be. I think that's the stuff that I think makes a settle difference over time. And you get spawning straight forward. Just do pause, right? You don't have to do the end range, like short ones. Just a little pause in the bottom. Hard squeeze at the top. There you go. Just think really smooth in that top. No bounce. Nice hard contraction. Squeeze. Good. Just whatever one or two more. I'm going to have a little less volume on the big stuff. But generally for hamstrings, do I like it? I don't do a whole lot of different replanches by muscle group. But for some reason, I do think hamstrings respond a little bit better to slightly lower. So, generally, I always do like a working set with hamstrings. I can 5-8, you know, whereas most of the things, that's a huge difference. But most of the things are normally kind of lower and more around like, 7-8, something like that. Have you used a seat belt before? No, I'm not. I'll be trying. I mean, it's pretty straight forward, I'll show you just a real quick. Should I go? Yeah, it's a two-back one. I feel like Chewbacot was probably a beast in the gym. So, let's think it makes sense. That's all I say on this hand, but just before you get yourself in, I'll do the same thing. I'll probably see it. I'm showing how to do the seat belt from like a flight attendant. I fucking know how to use the seat belt. But just the tightening is this part right here. So, if you think that is tight as you go, then that's basically how I want it. Set up as tight as you possibly can before you're in here. And all the same thing will put this down because that's why I did that before. So, then I want you to smash this as tight as you possibly can down on your thighs. Just so basically have nothing moving. And then the only thing that will be slightly different on this is like you actually want to use it. So, it's like normally when you start a leg crunch, you're kind of like smashing into here and when you start. When you're coming into the finish, like that's the only issue obviously you could have here. So, the weight is pulling you that way so it pulls you out of the seat. So, just feel like you're pushing into the hamstring. As you're, excuse me, into the seat belt. As you're coming into the finish. Very exact. So, actually, again, I want to use it. This is where you go to show that like people think of equipment manufacturers. You know what they're doing just because of machines exist. But I would say like the number one proof like if there's any machines that you think would have like sea belts. It would be like a leg curl or like a leg extension. It's just like a leg like fucking sea sun you out. But they don't do that. They put it on the hamstring shoulder press. Right? Have you seen that? You know what I'm talking about? That's like I'm going to always, and so it's the one that's pushed as you fucking down in the seat. And that's the one that would have to see belt out. Like this is just let you know they have no idea what they're doing. That's in case like the whole gym tips over a while you're there. You only want to do this right? This is the pull-up. Which one is that pull-up? Oh yeah, yeah. Some of them. Some. Yeah. You just keep them to your left. You can see the part of the top. And the longer part of the rest. The whole length of the exercise top. And the pause. There we go. Squeeze. Now you see where someone just practice kind of pushing into that seat belt as you can. And the pause. Good. Hard squeeze. Just thinking traction. There's nowhere to go. Just can track. There we go. Because that's where I was just thinking about. Just thinking about what I'm going to do. Just squeeze. Good. You know, take your left hand on this one. And track. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Let them. Go one more. Pause. Part of squeeze. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Yeah. Nice. That's the opposite. That's the opposite. Right. It was a pretty just like that. That's like I think my how I can make the top. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Nice. Good. That's where they count. Come on now. That's right. Come on. Hard. You just think the same thing. Visualize the same thing at the top. How hard can you make it? Good. Come on. Again. All the way up. Hard squeeze. There we go. Keep going. Couple more with that. Just think about your quality. How hard can you can track. Go, go, go, go. Again. Slow. No way down. No bounce. Hard. Contraction. Come on. Up. Up. Come on. Ten on ten. The hard can. Hard can finish finish finish. Nice. What is up YouTube? You're here with Mr. Joe Bennett. You go live. Having you to make some job. Yeah. Got him on about time. Okay. The hyper-chipy coach. We're down here in Tampa for a summer shedding. Day three right now. Whatever. And half Joe. If you could put me through a workout. He goes to eat out. He just trained like so he's not training with me. He's really good. He's always not training. Last time we trained like together and he kept up. So I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. I have it that week's document and so look back. Yeah. So you can't pitch out. But yeah, he put me through a leg workout right now. We're here. Is the chairman of a name or is it just kind of like incognito? All the lines down. The lines down. Yeah. Private the loge in that that was loud. So here are by ourselves. Miss Olympi in the background training likes. Just in my back there. I think that doesn't know. But that's really all it's going on. That's what we're going to be doing. I'm going to show you the transmite. So stay tuned and listen to Mr. Joe because he's full in all the gym. We're trying to learn how to do the advice. Same to the positive time. Let's go. Perfect. I'm going to wrap up. Everyone might die. Awesome. Time. It's sweet. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Again, I think smooth to the finish. Don't think about where the pad does. Just contract those in. Here we go. Good. Again. Pause. Contract. Contract. Contract. Good. We got another one. We want to pause the top here. And we'll stretch. And we'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it. One more. Come on. Go. Go, go, go. Go, go, go. Go. One more. It's smooth. Come on. Go, go, go. Yeah. Nice. There we go. You don't get that one. There's your movement. Yeah. That's what I'm holding this up. There you go. Nice. You know what? Yeah. That's the point. Good. Good. not doing time just keep them pretty don't think about reps just keep in the same I got that finish for you smooth pause hard squeeze yeah good we got another one squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze but don't want last one go go go go go go go go I must need to stretch on you staying there mean for keep pressing down just a little bit wrap on here like hug it there you go and hold I'm going to count 30 seconds keep the pressure on here light pressure down and there you go don't let up keep going come on about 20 seconds left perfect keep some tension on breathe into a nice and slow 15 good minute keep going like pressure 10 keep going keep going 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 nice I almost feel bad so you can stretch on you I just stuck it in hug my into the pity it so you can just keep that thought for us just keep it wide enough great reps that's your focus not better right here nothing to do with the pad how hard can you to stretch there we go there we go good rep and come on best ones now same pace don't rush out of body hard squeeze good lower drop of control everything the same now come on up up up up up up got another one slow on the way down let's go hard up up up one more come on best rock now best rock let's go finish finish finish nice it's really nice it is heavy it is heavy you guys have no idea that's him and we have no idea that's him and we have we just go I like the Atlantis on the way I'm so happy with this it's just my favorite nothing really magic I honestly like this really heavy like I said you don't put a button to add to it like a platform angle it's basically made defining factors for like a heck or a pen it's really kind of the platform angle relative to the art you have some shitty ones people get on like they don't like you know the way it feels or what they're need sometimes like that's the self difference is normal the angle is like too close and that's what tends to grind up people's needs it's going to go too up yeah yeah because it's as soon as you basically have the point where you know as you're folding you want your need to be able to travel forward as soon as this doesn't fold anymore then it's got to go somewhere else next join line is going to be the knee so if you're not taking it to the end of your ankle mobility generally it's going to be more comfortable in the knees and you know taking it just making sure that you have a stance you know that's comfortable for your hips as well through the better your ankles can move and the better your hips move the easier it is going to be underneath and then obviously generally it's easier for you to get more of your clothes so that's easier to bring them down just a little bit then if I'm off you can take them down that's more comfortable so that's what I feel down bragging here your knees and these are crazy it's only crapping you minor so much worse and that's my knees have got to be better like honestly have some like the loudest like crappiness in the knees ever and it's not a good thing I don't know what like they were in 2017 of the worst and they were like bad for a while and in the last year yeah then the best they've been yeah hopefully get better I mean that's one of the weird things normally you know what is this down to freight car literally on freight car literally like the first signs of not going to be good but I mean it's a little bit of again the controversy is can you like regrow car literally you're not and some people say no but you know but if you can find because like that's half the cliche things for something like something or tough to tell when you're doing them it's going to be like orthopedically bad and like tendons stuff is kind of different but with like car like you have kind of like a you know two bones articulating you have car literally on car literally like you can really find places that are immediately comfortable it can kind of spare that basically so it's like the joke to is you find things or footstances or positions that are less loud then you're literally just because it's it's just a matter of like surface context so if you literally just stands and stuff sometimes instead of putting more pressure in this position it's more pressure in this position so you can actually have kind of different wear patterns you like the exact same thing every single time that is one arguments for having slight adjustments and like you know movements and things like that not come more narrow of my stance over the years yeah that's just better if you know it does okay maybe just because of the hips yeah yeah yeah it's like squat like super like pretty wide yeah now I can like come here like my capability of better something so I can closer and then yeah maybe it was exactly that yeah yeah you kind of built pretty well for some hours so if you can go either way then kind of just go where you come good rest nice and you can pay some that long really work on that piece any slower into the bottom fight that button there we go you know someone like eight to tenish maybe yeah yeah what do you think normally put the most volume someone's like like let's say like beginning of the season and the end of off season the prep like where do you have the most like probably right in the middle of like kind of in the middle of the beginning of prep so like typically like so what I'm doing is for Terrence right now is because his recovery phase I took volume wrap button and then so now we're kind of starting to point where you can grow a little bit and so I'm just working up now but I'll kind of keep this or that kind of like what I would call if I'm looking at different levels like kind of medium volume and I'll probably not know if you need to go yeah medium volume but look well there it's probably I'll work up slowly to probably twice as much volume as we had in the recovery phase and then when he starts a prep you know I might the first maybe anywhere it depends just kind of the state that he's in where his nutrition is at like that's why just having ideas where he's doing from his coach you know there might be a little bit of a taper up there again so like generally in the beginning of a prep anywhere from like you know if it's he'd be doing like say a 16 week prep 16 weeks out you know maybe somewhere for ten I might taper it off just a bit of it's going and then generally we'll get to a point where kind of stable life is then at some point time I start to taper it back down a down. Yeah but it's always saying I try to really prioritize I'm still much rather prioritize intensity then volume pretty much at all times because I still always go back and forth like you know it's like there's so many moving parts it's like for me to honestly compare when we do those volume ramp ups slight because I like basically another weekend and then there you should lead to a little bit more growth but then I still always the bait like would it be better if we just kind of left it where it is and just wouldn't you be able to progress a little bit faster so I always mess around with that subtle amount like from you know offseason the prep or whatever because again I still think you know again intensity like what he's doing for specific exercises for specific rep ranges is more important than you know how many sets can we do you know those files you need to finish somewhere up perfect actually all I regret like that not contagious you got you you thought keep it the same old net bond yeah keep going up good I make a part of me come on make these reps down the first one's own it own it own it own it our breasts bounce out of the bottom and we thought it's going to make it hard done and control on that bottom there we go come on we got another one that's the reps now come on pretty control control control our push our push one last one come on one more that's going on stay tight control control our push our push finish I got you know that was your last good not mine did you know your last good not mine yeah I really just watched that much that feels like you're in the walk you know it's difficult yes that's not good I'm used to pedal in the long time yeah that was a good set like honestly I literally like I put my I'm sure you can probably fill my hands on but like the like the third the last one I lose how my hands on the second the last one I probably give you like a couple pounds so I'm just giving it the right spot so it feels like I'm doing more than I am and on that last one obviously just that's thick and point but I'm you know just a little bit see now I'm not the fucking person you really like yeah no like half of it is it's like that one you feel like that's thick and point because like whole fuck I just couldn't go back down right where it's one of those things we're half is just training that that again if you just stick with it I can give just a little bit right through that point and it's not bad to get up because the same thing it's like one like I said I don't I don't want to see you die today I don't want you to die today so I don't want to do a shit ton of work but it just takes a little bit kind of getting used to that point just not okay if I'm I'm going to hit it I'm going to make sure that you get through a nice and smooth and also not getting the point where it's kind of productive like it is the point where you just do like ten past failure things were shaking and ugly you can't feel anything I'm going to work out so over if you're one of those yeah yeah this is the first say it's just getting a lot of your thoughts anyway so I don't like that's what I don't like this and not like I'll be back just to you you good? yes I'm good you sure there's end of that light you're trying to get all that pop from the shot you just just do that just just in time I'm going for the bro pop what so you you're going here is like when before you go almost feel like you're trying to lift your leg up just a little bit so press and work on the top of your thigh so you're not having your knee press down so hard like just lift it up just a little bit and then really feel like you're just pressing through the top of your thigh as you come up that makes sense yeah I'm going for your knee up you don't want to go eat shit to where you feel like you're actually trying to like hip it's not a whole week but that'll make sure that you don't have a kind of many of this type of you know if you get your knee pushing down here that's what really allows you to kind of pivot your pelvis up if you want people to lift their ass up now it's because your hamstring crosses over your knee and your hip so most people here trying to shorten it but as you hip flex because of the crosses over your hip it's basically kind of stays the same like that but I'll say for simple purposes it's shortening at this end and lengthening at this end that makes sense so right when you're getting the power as the heart is the most people will intentionally lift this up so that the hamstring doesn't actually contract anymore you're just kind of almost holding it in the same spot yeah just a little yeah that's great just like that it's perfect it's a good same thing nail that's not going to be perfect you're trying to get your hand good that's perfect how do you feel? okay There you go, touch it. Oh, wow. Oh, my mom. Oh, my, my, my mom. Oh, my, my mom. Oh, my, my. Nice. Yes, but you're keeping it. Look at the same thing. Okay. Good. Good. Right here with you. You just think contract with that. I'll get you there. All right, squeeze. All right, good. Beautiful. Right man. Everyone like that. We got a couple to go. You just think squeeze. I'll get you there. We're going to go there. Perfect. Another one. Control. Hard. Hard. Good. Let's go another one. Go go go go finish. I got you. I got you finish. Nice. That's it. Two more. Come on. Come on. Farewell. One Pancake You can do that range. Keep going man. Keep going man. Keep going. Keep going. Keep the left man. Don't stop. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going man. Keep going. Keep going. You got four. Let's go. Get your head on man. Come on man. Come on man. Two. Yeah. Good. Same thing. I'll focus on that contraction drive that sign to the pad. I'll get you there. Good. Smooth reps. I got you. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. We got one more. Keep a smooth five press into that pad. Yep. Yep. Yep. Just a bottle of rest. And then pour it a little bit. Just keep it smooth. Alright squeeze. Not a ton here. Just keep him pretty. Drive that thigh down. Hard squeeze. We got two more like that. Come on. Squeeze. Yep. Come on. One more. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. I'm slow just about half. Right there. Not in that high. Keep him slow. Right there. Good. Keep him going. Right there. Not in that high. Right there. Come on. Five. Four. Three. Two. Last one. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. The chili. Don't tell anybody about the secret chili. And a lot of chili. People don't really think it's chili. Alright kids. Could be wrap on today's workout. Was the real dad of Rodney Trisha, actually. I'm the fake that he's the real dad. Intelligence and children wise. So wrap on this workout. I appreciate you putting me through it. Yeah. Sure. So nice little tips all the time. It's also something that I was forgetting. And I turned on someone like you. I was trying to talk with him. I should probably be doing that more. Yeah. The appreciate. I'm trying to explain to him some of the smart things. So you learn a thing of two. You go to get in the way. I know how to do it. Like you're saying everyone's like, I know what to train. But yeah. They're always good. You can be better. You always forget a little bit. So much appreciated. Yeah. That guy's been over. Yeah. That guy's been over. Yeah. That guy's been over. Yeah. The dream coming soon. Private June. But yeah. Thank you for watching. We should have checked out the hypertrophy coach for all your training needs. We've got an app. Everything you can desire. Lots of free information on his channels. Check him out.

It just moved it all out how to punch a movie's come putting in storage We had to get everything out of our old house too But this is where I've been spending a good amount of my time doing it today because I have a roommate be The gym is literally behind those windows and I will show you and And let me what more excuse you need to know that I was being alone Walking at you so pretty dope honestly and definitely some mayonnaise for just some like a lawn space and somewhere to like a Nap on this beautiful Costco couch and then watch some TV watch some bleach some anime whatever I haven't adjusted this up, but I even brought my PS5 over and that hooked up in there This is pretty honest with you set up. We've got a fridge in here right now. It's pretty boring Literature's got some sugar cups and water gatorate and some honey my favorite condiments But eventually I'm gonna have like both of our cats snacks treats good shit when I'm not in private I can make sure eat stuff. We've got a little desk set up over here the microwaves and All the supplements you could imagine that you need for it workout, but right now It's like day and I had to come in here. Let's move over there and move some shit So I'm gonna eat my meal right now. It's kind of sad now my meals. I only have a type of where that's like this big But they do not fill the top we're at all anymore. They're getting pretty low Okay, so I'm just coming up my colors again and up the cardio a little bit more so Time to fucking get shredded my way to come in down now. That was so totally good signs I mean eat this chicken rice meal. Watch show train legs here in like an hour Comes in to come we have a merch shop coming up next week which by the time the videos up honestly We'll probably be live. I think but we gotta shoot some more shirts because there's a big a strap and yeah It's all it's really going on today. So my correct warm this meal up All right, so this is pretty much a setup, but this is where I spend Good amount of my time especially my pre-workout time We got some nice chicken and rice got 180 grams of white rice 180 grams of chicken breasts Maybe I'll do a full day of eating. It's pretty much the exact same food that been eating just less calories So I feel like it's just boring to continue to do that and I'm getting to the point now Where my breakfast is pretty good. That's still have the same size pancake breakfast that I make and it every meals a little bit smaller My last two meals don't have any carbs so when I go to bed I am like fucking hungry like I email ask me to go right to bed so I've suddenly most of it But by the time I like breastfeeding teeth lie down Something is like grumbling in hungry and I wake up through the night like starving and wake up in the morning starving Do my cardio and then just like crave those pancakes in the morning. It's beautiful So been enjoying that pancake but the days have been hungry I've been trying to keep myself busy, but also get really fucking tired now So more keep myself busy. I'm gonna get to the gym later on day whatever I'm like overly exerted and exhausted because I just have no nutrients or energy inside me So kind of a fine balance of like not sitting down and going crazy thinking about big serving and not overexerving yourself Because of me going for like a walk into not even walking around the mouth. I'll go into them I'm exhausted at this point. So it's pretty fucking sad life But it's a life of a bodybuilder training. It's so I'm gonna enjoy this Got some nice honey mustard for my pre-workout meal because I love this shit I know I have calories, but I've been eating this on Consistently the same amount of meals for my entire prep so as I lower my calories everywhere else It stays the same I'm not adding more Condiments are more calorically dead as condiments so it really doesn't matter But yeah, it's my pre-workout meal down this horse and bleach Chill out a little bit warm up a little bit at the gym because it takes me all the other body of life stretch walk whatever and That's what's going on. So I'm gonna enjoy this and see you guys later You All right, here we are like day at 3.3 weeks out The Olympia so that's like 24 days or something I don't know I should probably know exactly but that means I have a proxonedly one two Including this like three more quad days workouts real leg workouts So getting down to like those final workouts time to lock it in I tried to do like some dynamic stretching and probably like a fucking very inflexibility Because I don't I do those like once a week maybe for the last four weeks to sort them up for legs My body just so like tired and like energy is like movement and the more tired you get the more you sit around and do nothing And I just get fucking like stagnant So you take move my body stretch everything out a little bit. It's actually a little bit energy going So I can start this workout, but you're gonna start off with quad extensions as always I'm not trying to rewrite anything new now trying to handle your records. That's for the name sure right now I've dropped some weight some officially under 250 pounds now Which made me I lost like a pound and I could feel it in my body. It was tires and I'm getting drier So I'm starting to start protecting my joints a little bit more and not hurt myself But I'm gonna start with this as usual move on to some same bullshit I've been doing over there We got a new like hip press like press from pure iron so I might try that out today I use it one leg so I don't know if I'll really use it or not today, but we'll see I'll try it out and then we'll go from there but I'm starting off here Woo! crown I'm so happy I got to do some heavy leg press after this. All right, the three sets here. I would do like five to seven reps and then when I felt like really like my most connection was like belt throughout the set, I was just doing the lockout portion to really squeeze up into my upper quad and hip. I'm making sure I'm just getting really tight contraction and I would do that for like five reps. And then I would just try to finish the set until failure. That three times over and it really gets your good squeeze and your upper quad. Sometimes some people like myself, you're like lower quad, it'll be more dominant unless of your hip is taking into it and I'm trying to get like that waist to hip flare. So that's why I've been doing a lot of different style of things that's used to build my upper quad with rather than the deer drop. All right, like press squat press, whatever you want to call this thing, it might be loud with the wind right on my face and I know you guys hate that. But fucking love this machine lately. Again, filling it up into my hip to right here super deep into my quad. A little bit late sometimes. I'm pretty dead this morning so we'll see if it's like 12 reps is hard. But if I get to eight reps and it feels easy, I'm going to rack it at eight reps. This is all because it's max out. I'm going to rack it at eight reps, rest pause, 10, 15 seconds rest, go get in the fat out there just to get even more than 12 reps out of it and that's going to be the top set. So yeah stay tuned and wish me luck. Off! Dead! I've probably got a heavier from last week, which is the good thing. So push it into weight, but if my body's getting leaner than it needs to be, it's three weeks that I shouldn't be. Me, too, I'm saying the same strength. Otherwise, it got to start fucking cutting a lot harder. So yeah, but I'm gonna keep pushing the weight. And the other set, the same weight, without the rest-boss, trying to hit like 10, and move on from this shit. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Sometimes I get scared on these machines. If you look at such a small machine, or me and Leighette, it's a few of the things that just small machine to have fucking 22 times, 45 place hanging on the edge. This napped while I'm pushing it hard to the can, something breaks in my legs just like lunch. Yeah. All right, PC, boom. I like to do this belt squat at least once a week, depending on what I'm doing in my hamster or quadale, do it on either day. But last hamster and glute day, your phone just fell. I did single leg leg press, really I was pushing on my heel. So we're going to be doing this today. And at my spine, got a little bit crush I was doing overhead press. This thing was like two and a half plates. I kind of overarged a little bit too much in my back like hyper extended. So it was a little sore, and this is going to be honestly pulled it in the opposite direction. So another reason I'm doing that, fix my back, get some fucking big old meat sticks for legs. Oh. Oh. I love one guy, Oh, I love that guy. I love you, I love you. Unless you win kick-off, get your ball back CLIs changed to — you read that This was awesome though, but mainly the enemies have admitted one more thing the camera never happened.otive Yeah, that last rep hit me hard. Alright, been a chaos. Phone calls, I don't want to get phone calls up in the middle of workout. Trying to compartmentalize, push that aside, back to the leg workout. I just said four sets, ten reps, three plates on the Smiths machine. Still pretty good. Surprisingly, really fucking heavy last few reps. I was done, just trying to get like a proper squat motion to have been doing so much machines lately, but keeping it light so I don't fucking my spine up or anything like that. That's why I didn't have you shit on the leg press and everything. Now, we're done the hardship mainly. I'm gonna do some split squats for lungy super set with spot extensions. Adductors, call it a day. Kinda sad, how fucking heavy that could feel was zero weight at the end of a leg workout. Super set with spot extensions, but it feels good to get a nice little stretch, like a lunge motion. If you just move the body in different directions, single leg, all that bullshit, you know? Fuck all that shit. It's trying to get some big legs. All right, last super set, this leg day we're done. Adductors and calves. That's it. We're going into the, trying to get some of these juicy adductors to fill in my quads. So when I open my legs in a post, there's no thigh gap. Just fucking me on the one that's getting a bit stye gaps and calves because calves are life. All right, it's gonna be you up. On today's video, just finished up shooting some merch photos for the Seapom Fitness Drop. Probably the day this video's gone, but I don't really know when they're going up. But in light of like day today, I decided to do cardio later in the day. So typically I wake up with new fastens, this is the first day. I was like, fuck, I'm gonna try doing cardio in the day because I want my legs to be much more fresh. So I just woke up, sent honey, subjections, apricfis, relax a little bit more, came to the gym. I honestly feel like I had a little bit more energy. And in lieu of wearing the GVRS, 1% better shirt, this is one of those things where like, sometimes I get a little bit too crazy on myself. And I feel like like I just got a phone call in there and it takes me to the fucking workout and I'm 1% off or if I can be 1% better by doing this with my sodium earlier in the day or cardio later, earlier in the day and I'm trying to find tune everything. I truly think those little things get like a obsessive throat prep and they're not a bad thing. But if you live like that constantly, I feel like it drives you absolutely insane and people who can live like that every day they're life good for you. But I noticed my obsession of getting 1% better or 0.001% better every single little thing that I can tackle on. I just find tuning little things away. I cook my rice differently the way I do this differently. It's going to make me the best Bible I can be. But it makes me a little bit obsessive and sometimes when something goes wrong, it makes me anxious at like I'm batting 1% worse. And I search up obsessive with that. And that actually trickles out to make me 2% worse because I'm stressing about it. So there's this fine line of being able to manage that pressure of trying to be constantly being better because the harder you're trying to find tune everything, the more worry some and stress that you can make yourself out when they're not getting better. So that's just one of those things that can mentally try to manage and kind of just sharing with you guys stuff that I do. But today I felt pretty good honestly to be doing cardio after legs. So maybe I'll talk to honey and be actually like keep doing that or now I feel a bit like, oh, don't do that. You have to do fast it or I don't know. We'll find out. We're going to let's feel pretty good today for legs. Got through a good workout. I did some squats having no no while they're super light but just really repenant out and felt overall pretty good. So I'm happy. Like I said, weights come in now and now, striking range to make weight and not have to like kill myself with cardio or sorry water and sodium the day of the way in which makes me look better on show day. So yeah, 1% every day trying to get better and better doing everything again to win the fifth title and bring you guys along the journey. So thank you for watching. I'll see you guys in the next video.

=== FILE: LIFE UPDATE ｜ MY CURRENT LEG WORKOUT [N3VqKJZINJM].txt ===

Let's cross. It's gross. It's empty. I already ate it. Just stacked in my pocket from the crowd. I have to eat it. Rough life. Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on, you want it. Still. Oh, total total. Let's go. What's the? Hello, YouTube. Hello, YouTube. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't do it. No, they're going to get mad. Stick with you, original. Just kidding. What is up, YouTube? Welcome back. The post will be living with Chris Bump, say the Courtney King. He's no longer cooking seven different types of potato, Fleming meal, and chicken and salmon every 15 to 20 minutes. And we're back to the real world. Turn it off, get fat. Meal, perfect. My favorite. But came back. We were in Canada for a while. We got sick. I broke a kid's tour. Bicep, I've been fucking chillin'. I'm living in the dream right now. So, I mean, a lot of you guys have been acting up there on my bicep. Taking peptides, BPC 157, TB500, blasting it in there. Great stuff for healing injuries. Also, just did some stem cell injections. I got a video of that. It was pretty graphic of needles going in my arm. But stem cell, tip peptides, trying to heal the process up, having trained in like five weeks. Or so, I'm doing like some legs like once a week. It's not working hard. I'm letting my body recover right now, but in one piece in nine months. Walk every day for 20 minutes. Yeah, I'm 251 right now. Two, so I put on 12 pounds. Ish, it's healing beer. So, not fat yet, but I just feel skinny fat. So, kind of where we're at right now. We're going to go training legs later today because it's all I can train to film. Calvin just made it back yesterday. So, sadly I was hoping he was going to never come home. But it is what it is for us to have with him for now. But that's nice. That's pretty good. Is there anything else going on? We're going to ask for more. I just finished some snowboarding for the next eight days. We're going to leave Friday because we have a new product coming out from raw. Very excited for that. We're filming stuff for that morning. Yeah, that's kind of the life right now. We're going to go to the best place. Get some headphones. Get the cordy puttin in the washing machine. I just didn't ask. I do the wash. You leave your shit like your keys and all of yourself in your pockets. I just throw your stuff in. Clean it. Oh yeah. So we're going to go get some headphones. We're going to try a new pair of headphones. I said there's something better than AirPods. And let's bet what we got going on. I'm also sorry for your chibi can. What? What is it? Yeah, a ghost is trapped in the car. Go. No. Yes. Yes. I'm going to make him recipe. So you can go follow all the recipes on there. You know last night. You should put it in here. Put it in this club. I said in the video, Calvin, yeah, but I come home and it's smell so good in the house. I was like looking around and then she was like somewhere else on the oven with all my cups of gifts. I opened up the oven. Banana bread being baked in there. Smells coming up beautiful. Perfect. For some reason not even close to being done. She just has to come and touch it. You lit it. You grab it and drop it. It falls upside down on the bottom of the oven. Like, let it just fell on the bottom of the oven. I just was just right. And I just took it and kind of like, but like try it. It's fire. It still tastes really good. It's amazing. It's like chewy. It's like a chewy loaf thing. Try a Calvin. Please, babe. Oh, it's amazing, right? I'm happy, bud. gluten free. Not gonna matter. It's a little more good. Yeah, well, it wasn't done yet. So it's a little chewy, but it's just like, blob so bread. It's so good. We're trying it to pudding. Oh, God, don't say that. We said we should cut it up and put it in the oven. Like, you know, fire, so we make it like stuffing. We're never in stuffing. But then we're in stuffing. It's like banana bread, so. Yeah, it's not bad. I definitely, I mean, I dropped it everywhere. Like, yeah, this would be a lot of fun too, so it can't say. I'll remake it for you tonight, babe. Okay, I can bring some to Aspen. Give a loaf to Calvin. Oh, yeah. I have a baby loaf thing, so I can put it in. I'll put it in. I'll put it in. I don't pull a lot of addicted to snacking right now. But yeah, that's another off day. I can't even show. I can't stop eating. I have a favorite thing to do. I can't wait to eat. It's all my treats. What else do you snack? Oh, my. You're buying these low calorie chips and you're in the full bag. And these are going to some of my kind of hurts. I just saw you eat all the bag in five minutes. I don't know if you have cereal every night, because ten boxes have one house. Have you tried the new three wishes flavor? Which one? Or maybe you guys already have. This new, the cinnamon roll one. Oh, my God. Bro, it's been out. Well, we have boxes of boxes. You should go definitely take a box. Well, not send me a minute. Wait, do you guys have boxes of three wishes? Yes. I took three wishes. Thank you guys. But yeah, they're good. That's really good. Yeah. Yeah. So you're going to go get some headphones. Peace. Maybe you had the ones bonnet. It had like a little swirly thing that wanted you. They looked like these jibbers, but they were... Oh, the beats. Yeah. Was one bonnet? Yeah, that would be. I'll beat it in some section. Yeah, it's apple. Fair point. Oh, it came to me wireless in your keys headphones. That's what you call it. Oh, right there. Those two. Yeah, these ones. Yeah, it grows. I got them in white, gray, purple. I think it's a gray one. Just one pair. I'll use this. Downing. All right, so great success. They had both in stock. I always forget a pair in work or at home or in the office. I'm going to leave one of these in my car. And then one of them I'm going to bring around with me all the time. I hope I don't forget it. But you better be better than the airport pros. Because Bon says they are better. So they're going to be my jibmon. It'll be my work and at home headphones and car do you maybe. I don't know. I feel like best fine cannon ever has anything to stop. But if Gem might come here, they have everything. Merko. That's a big ass sign if you can't realize. I think they're like 10 feet tall or 20 feet tall. I don't even know. I was here when I was in the fucking huge place. But back to the rock, where house beautiful, where house back to real life. Our AC broke and was fucking freezing in here. So Ali's been sitting outside. It's freezing here. Well, isn't there? Yeah, if you were literally coming, it was like pants and sweatpants. It's so cold in there. I'm brutal. I'm so bored. I can't get some. I'm not going to go with my gun. Rough life. Rough life. Rough life here at the real life. Your romantic turns out has also been shown to me. Neuroprotective specifically. Four. So, don't let her take your arms in this chair. Do you like the studies? Can you imagine your dopamine? Yeah. Can you imagine my dopamine? Especially if you might give him a state. I mean, everyone's fucking on the edge of here. We're a bit trainer right now. Courtney got me on to him, so she gets credit for it. But post Olympia. He's talking about dopamine crashes and up and down and majoring. It's like you can say motivated and driven and enjoying activities that you typically enjoy. For extended periods and consistent periods of time. Well, when I fucking have three, what have a year? Every year, leading up to one day at Olympia. It's a huge fucking beautiful moment. It's huge dopamine rush. And then immediately after I think blue air. And then I go to the gym and I just like, I don't want to be in the fucking gym. No drive to be there. I have no fucking anything. So I typically just let myself have this time because it is what it is. But it's kind of cool listening to the way your body is like, react to the motivation of drive, give it a literal order more than your brain of dopamine and little things of it. Something I noticed with myself when I stopped having a lot of driving the gym. I started being on my phone a lot more than you. And I started to just like fucking scroll or listen to a podcast in and scroll between sets of the gym. And there's also a kind of workout through just half hours of just trying to move my body right now. But it was also making me not enjoy my time there because it was like relying on the stimulus to dopamine rush. I'm potentially getting from scrolling my phone or whatever. Instead of actual workout. And he says stack you must think like that. It's really optimal to do over the extended periods of time because, well, you're going to lose more of it. Shit drive and your workout is also probably shit. It's probably just going to be up to you and you've said, as mine are lately. So I'm learning. You know, definitely loved Mr. Heoperman. We had a little learn a lot. We haven't heard of him. You're fucking slick. The world just keeps everywhere. He's really smart. So good shit. But anyways, we're headed to gym all the way today. We'll talk about like motivation. I don't even know if he would do it. I like that just either it'll build cookie. Honestly, pretty fire. I literally was scavenging around the warehouse. I could do it for food, but I was starving. I meant to leave earlier on the problem. Meals me today. And I ran into making a fit yesterday and I forgot to reorder. So, you know, just slowly getting tipping my toes in the water. Being a real human again and bodybuilder, but I'm doing all right. So, we were at the gym. As it likes, we'll fly up a decent workout. We'll fly again a ton of quick. I'm not sure if we can be there for two hours. And then go home with that grass. So, I guess we'll see you at the gym. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. Right. We'll be back. Hey, I got that left. Hell, no. My squad at the end. I don't like it. But I genuinely have had two fake workouts and one half real leg. Work out where I rest like four plates. It's one leg and it's one of two plates. But, like, man. I got no drive and I mean lots of pains. And that's just super weak. And I got a torn biceps. So, I was just giving myself to go to ask in. I spin and I get that chip and then I come back and the bicycle will be healed That's the time I was supposed to take off I'm slowly getting back and training and do it But for now At least try not to lose my legs So I'm going to take up the workout Also, try to use some stability stuff And it will be some pistol squats so when I snowboard down For the next week I got some stability in my knees Plains Power clean Thatches All the good chips I have the chip 15 reps a lot of reps I have to do my workout as a blade I've got to do my last two workouts at the end I have super set, clock tension, hand closer to warm up my knees and to blood of my legs Then I come over and I do a single leg leg press Partly because I don't want to put plates on right now Partly because my knees just go on stable right now I don't want to make sure there's a strong strong So I have them kind of rebuilding right now That you each get into the control of tension On the knee that I need And it helps me get a little bit deeper So I'm moving right now When I train less I'm sitting in a desk or a mental church or a sleeping My body gets more locked up So when you train the moving you get to the gym or the mental church You feel a lot better so I'm just going to move my body Not really feeling better It's gross I already ate it Just fucking snacks in my pocket from the flat out right now Rough life Just up to time C בא's week in the 25 points on facade day when Clevver doesn't put my weight on the knee. Whoops. Whoops. Oh, guys. That school lot once or twice a year, not in Smith's machine. Just, so, just keep the people happy. Come on, it's bar, that's new. No? Oh, man, I'm sure mobility is fixed. This is your head, guys. Go in and put it in. There's nothing worse than when you go out and line up with the mirror. You see this? Yeah, it's pretty clear. A lot of the mirror is flat out. And then there's a line in the ground. It's also crooked, so I just feel fucking sideways. The mess with my head right now. She must have put it in. Oh, I talked about lyrics there. What? Oh, singing a song and I talked about lyrics. I really copyrighted it for you. You found just like, like, a little bit. I'm just just got there in the deep place. That was heavy. Really good. To me, they have quicks your body. You can lose fucking a lot of strength on a lot of performance ability. Just from sitting on your ass or for weeks. I do blame the flu for the first two weeks, but the rest is on my fault being late. So, one more week of laziness. And then, we have to start, obviously, in the series of Chris head back in shape this year. Yeah. Normally, I don't see Calvin, we don't film this these. So, when I get fat and lazy and skinny, no one knows because they're going to need to be a fucking little be a cannibalist here, I guess. I think that's a fucking out for the month of January. Good run. Slide pushes. Slide pushes. Hold until he's a set it up, I actually would. Probably great for my knees when I tuck with knee stability. And now I'm gonna do one, just mobility. Okay, fucking range of motion. I come here with that cord, and you know, because she's walking lunge more than me at this point. So, you're not too embarrassed when it's on. Okay. So, what is it? What is it? This is good. Okay. Can't talk though. What can you imagine the horrific area? That's a lot. There you go. What can you imagine the horrific area? That's a lot. There you go. Can you pay me three for you at the cast? Is it that last year? I've just hit up with the last four years. But I think last year was the first year of the cast, but at least my calves have ever shunned through a press. It's progress. Progress. But they could have been better. No, I already did the thumbnail. Oh, of course. Joining in the offer, thumbnail. Alright, let's get me wrap on today's life workout. We want to call it that. T-shirt and stuff. Broken sweat. Without a breath. I'm pushing myself harder than last time. Thanks for accepting that from motivation. But honestly, I'm talking making jokes about how weak and fucking lazy I am right now. But I honestly do think he's reason why I'm able to progress every year. And be at such a high level for the keep getting better and not pushing unhealthy supplements and other shit. And more just like training and food and everything that is because I give my body the rest of the needs. So it's not chronically stressed. And it's able to push itself further every single year. Whatever muscle I lose comes back quickly with muscle maturity. And then when I get back in the training, I can push it to the next level. So kind of the goal. Luckily, only having one year to one year. I get time to rest. I can take at least three months of chilling. I'm leaving my body recovery all the cortisol stress. Atheasions break up muscle tears every few times. Go back to healthy. And then I can kill an oxy. So that's a goal. The advantage it gives me from this gastronomy down to 5. Trying to be a good choice. I can show off. Kind of the person being the champion. So doing that, resting up. And we're back full steam. So those keep rest days. So very important. So how you keep getting better for the long term. That's today's moral of the story. We'll come back to the blog. It's 23. Yeah, I don't know. Come below. We just want to see in the video. Four of your cheats come right here. They're cheating when I'm back from Astin. And when I'm back training from the super fat. And we're going to do some more kind of food vlogs a little bit more travels this year. Whatever else you guys want to see, let me know below. But we're back. Calvin's back. We'll see you later.

A little bit of TV Alice, which is the muscles right in the front of the cab, or the front of the shenish. And... But this is going to do is going to actually help... Almost give it a little bit more depth to your cab, because it creates a little bit of a... A layer of musculature on the outer part of your front of your cab. So, if you have some really good gastro or if you have really good... Which is the upper part of your hair, or even if you have solius, that's really, really wide. And solius part is right in any part. Which you want is you still want to be able to work that TV Alice. And that's really important, especially on the front. And J had a really good TV Alice. You can see that on it, especially really is everything. Cool. See that. The real secret to the quads. To be Alice? The secret to the quads. To be Alice, don't you? Yes. But even a quads.

So that's my go to it. Why can't you just call it banana pie? Banana pie? Yeah. Because there's no such thing as banana pie. It's banana cream pie. Maybe in Canada it's banana pie. Oh, it's a little sus-level, bro. No. But you do have to have a big pie? It's sus-level? You're a banana pie, as sus. Yeah. Comment below if you think of banana pie aside. Yeah, we do do do.

=== FILE: Life Update. [Z9aO6L5dQMg].txt ===

And this has been one of the more challenging beginnings of prep that I have really ever had, but I've always been through some shit every year if something happens. So if this is happening with beginning of prep, then lucky me I got out of the way. It is what it is life sucks some time, but it's beautiful at the same time. So take it if you can, most of the time, enjoy the journey because this is what makes the victories and the accomplishments so much more worth it, the end when you know you want to do some hell in the way. So... Come on, come on Chris! Come on, you're still... or... or... come on, you're still... What's that? We have about 100 grand to have been out of sports nutrition everywhere. And we're always already at number one. You have 130% this year, but this is in about this year, it's about 2022. So by the way, Mitch, I want to make sure that you understand that you are our new brand in the year. We're all ready to go! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're ready? He's like, ready? You're getting the walk and he's like, go! You can't wait! You have to listen and be mindful of the starting of the gut. If you're too tense waiting for the journey, you're going to jump to go. I have to get the thing in my mind. Go. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. What? As you guys saw from our announcement last week, we launched raw and raw market. We talked about it for a long time. We're super excited for it. Today's the fun day because we're filming a fun little, like, skit video. In-maw, we have permissions to film here. So for the first time ever, we're not going to get kicked out of a silver film again. We're doing a fun little video where Matt and Dom are on their tracks on kickers. They're going to be running and biking through the store. I'm going to be listening some weights in the silver and we're going to grab our supplements. Make some shake all the shit. Matt, as you can see over here, got the shorten of the stick. Who dumped a child? Sounds like a fucking kitty, I could really, no. And then Matt's over here wearing tights. Show them over there. He's probably not like, so he's gonna be like, probably. Dom's fucking skew and shit, mocking himself. Play, yeah. So we're fucking around in Valmer right now. I'm a gandell time. And we're not going to get into the forest. So we're having a lot of fun. They just need to be dropping next week. See you soon. And yeah, we're going to show you guys some DTS. So if you guys like it. I think I just brought some. We're going to finish some fucking 40 pound dumbbells in Walmart. And I have to take the work out too, which is full early for me, but in flavor. Took out a Walmart. Looks like I'm somewhere around that area. Get ready for my return. You just need to check, I think. So fine, you got to fit in there. I have passes to the ab Jackson 거야 now. I have nearly everybody open in pa saving me I've simply closed. Do you want a kiss, if you like? But every time I open a Starrer, I feel like I'm doing this really Material. Go on and send, I know, but I don't really remember that. So fine, they say. Okay, man. Let's see. I'll enjoy that. Do you want a person making it or like people adding you like greetings and you just have Maybe have like one person protein one banana and then one of them that's all three of us Yeah I mean we're literally just talking and this is gonna be our best fucking campaign video ever is pretty funny and just the fact you have permission to do it with a fuck you on Walmart makes it funny so the very blending smoothies and the middle people are like stuff fuck you guys doing it in here and we have permission to do it so there was a lot of fun set to the final product so stay tuned you all right what's going on guys it's been a bit of a I've been on a bit of a hiatus mean calmer I really feel them like three weeks because I went to Canada there's a bit of chaos it was supposed to be like a chill chill week where I just got my head together and I was like super at peace and training and enjoying shit and ended up just turning it to hell bunch of some personal stuff happened and it was like stressful I was losing sleep I couldn't sleep or girl this my body got kind of sick my body kind of shut down some other shit ended up happening some stuff that I might be going right now but maybe in a few weeks or in the future I will talk about what happened right now my body was not feeling good my body was not responding and there was some personal shit going on and it just kind of all like fell and on to me at the same time and so I was like calendar and not filming I'm not going to do this I'm going to be training myself for a little bit just kind of keep to myself and I've gone for like 10 days so we're back we're going to start filming now getting back into swimming things and this has been one of the more challenging beginnings of prep that I've really ever had but I've always been through some shit every year there's something happens so this is happening at the beginning of prep then lucky me I got out of the way and luckily the past four Olympias I've done coming on top I've gone through some shit and I've understood that if you get through and it's made me a lot more resilient and it's one of the things we are grateful for the hell you go through because instead of a lighter load you wish for stronger shoulders and it makes you more resilient makes you tougher makes you know when you get into a storm that you're going to find your way out my favorite analogy all of this is like we're going through a forest and you see your goal at the beginning of your journey you see your goal through the forest and then you get into the forest and everything kind of closes in and it turns into like it's like chaos and you have no idea what direction to go where you're going and all you can do take one step forward because that's all you can see right now so I'm doing taking this one step at a time when we're at a time one day at a time I'm taking one step forward and I'm working my way through the forest right now and that's what I'm doing and it's practicing what I preach because it is the name of the game embodied belief to slow drive up and everyone is going to have shit come up especially when you prep for 10 years you do 10 and fucking years of competing it's going to be difficult time your body life gets messy sometimes I know I'm not the only one who goes through some shit so it is what it is super grateful still there's a lot of beautiful things going out of my life and as a whole right now it's really happy and just excited for what's to come in my life right now it's just a little bit of a hiccuping we're going to be going to be working through it I got a good team behind me I got great people and super grateful to have such like a strong support system because when it feels like health sometimes then I can lean in on a good team of family and friends around me it really makes you feel a lot more secure and just like confident in your ability so super pumped for all that but that's just a snippet of not even

=== FILE: Life update. [-9lN4HdXXDY].txt ===

How do you balance that kind of life? What's the honest answer that you don't? Realistic expectations not to have balance. Honestly, I think that's that right there is the number one thing that helped me in the past year and especially recently. Certain people are able to handle that and certain people are not and I know I knew that I wasn't going to have a stable home to come into because I've been moving. I knew I was never going to be able to get into routine because I've traveling every single weekend. I knew especially because I'm in an office all week and then trying to train and then every weekend when I have days off I'm in an airport traveling in a hotel, no good gym, any of the stuff. So beforehand I just expected myself to feel overwhelmed and allowed myself to feel overwhelmed and tried not to feel like I should be feeling as good as I would feel in every routine. Obviously everyone feels better in routine. Just a fact. So not being in it, tell myself it's just the season of life. Twenty-eight years old, the fucking dough pit life I could have ever imagined. Genuinely so grateful that I get the travel and do all this should I do. Let me all the pull out and have that perspective of gratitude rather than just like stress. It really helped me a lot. What is up YouTube? Welcome back to the gym. I'm so happy to be here. We're hoping to expand around to the Brazil super pumped about all that. But I went down to Ramon's supplement company, private gym and trained with Ramon there. He was telling me he had just taken a month or two off training as well and his broken English is what I gathered. I was telling him I just took two months off training as well. And it's hilarious. He can't eat too much and he needs to relax if he gets too big and he's not going to fucking eat. He's going to be an open bodybuilder. I literally took two months off and grew since he Olympia which is like he's huge, massive. I took two months off and just shrink and lose all my fucking strength. So I have some strength but a lot of my size just disappears. So don't have those kind of crazy at your next fucking round and bubbly like that. He's got an Arnold in like six, seven weeks of doing the Arnold. I got the Olympia in like nine months. So like as a maniac I'd be stressing right now if I hadn't started that early out. He knows what he's doing. He's got to make weight so following the plan. But it's good seeing him. Letting a little fire in my ass is up training like a little bit to get back to it. So that being said, another arm day before I leave feel so rewarding. Not going to be super intense. You're going to go heavy intense. Not super high volume. I don't even know what I'm trying to say. I'm going to do minimal exercises. Higher intensity. That's what I'm trying to say. So did a bunch of warmups going to be some biceps curls and get on with the workout. Alright, so the goal here trying to do like a mechanical drop set. So I'm doing close grip. Three seconds, eccentric movement. From the first round and then I switched my grip to go a little bit wider. I'm using the same thing. Three seconds, concentric, eccentric, sorry. And then next time I just fucking wrap it up as much as I can. So I'm doing one, two, three different style of sets. I'm just doing the same set and just trying to bring this shirt on my biceps. Yeah, it's like trying to stress about going to travel to build my business, trying to be a good bodybuilder. Having a fucking little baby girl. It's all things that I've dreamed of or couldn't even have dreamed of. So just kind of being excited for it. When I'm old and there's no more business in bodybuilding and travel in the kids' world, I can relax and try not to be overwhelmed at that time. Right now I'm just grateful that what's overwhelming me is all really fun, exciting things that I've chosen to put into my life. So why can't I complain about it? I know Courtney is much more of a routine home body than myself. So when she starts to feel like out of that whack, she's a little bit more stressed out. And that's what she typically is the home body. She's kind of keeping the home as safe for me as possible to come home too or not to stay grounded as possible. So I can come home and have clean, food cook, laundry, all the little things I don't have to worry about. If another little secret tip that helps me feel grounded is having a partner who supports you. Obviously she wishes I could be home right now, but I'm also like I said, 20 years old working to set up our whole family's life for the entire future and she understands that. So what I need to work on is when I come home. I don't really feel like I'm overwhelmed, but I need to detach enough so that I can reattach to her because it's easy to kind of grow disconnected in a relationship when you're spending so much time apart and you're so much going on in life. And she's trying to focus on the baby and I'm focusing on her and work and business and travel and everything. So I'm seeing a lot more conscientious of planning, little date nights and quality times together and all these little things helps everything come into fruition. And you know, having a grounded home to come back to, a partner to come back to, and the life of chaos is like the biggest cheat code of being able to thrive under chaos. All right, so I did similar thing on the tries to be extensions, like a mechanical drop set, sending far away. Your weaker move closer to your stronger finish out with some cheat reps just to pump it out. Now I'm doing like a cable, hide pulley, bicep curl. And I'm trying to like lock it in, we said move my shoulder at all and it really squeeze my bicep by clutching my shoulder a little bit. Get a tight squeeze, drop setting that with super setting that with some hammer curls with heavy weight and trying to get big arms. So yeah, this goes. Maybe I'll have 23 and germs like Hulk Ogan by the end of the year. All right, last exercise of the day. One set can go to do a good old run the rack bicep curls, enjoy it. Also for you to mention, doing a re-sac with some roshards in new color away, so some of the favorite roshards we dropped in the past, but in new colorways, this is one of them. So I don't know what day that's dropping, but Calvin probably knows that in the meat so it's coming soon, but I'm going to finish up this bicep workout, arm workout, go home and eat some bagels. I said, I mean, it's called the EBT's Maldivine Night and he's like, I feel like this is you bro, the quote of being able to thrive under chaos, being able to be calm within a storm. I think that's something that I've been relatively good at my whole life and with a good amount of experience for the past few years, a bunch of shit so I'm hitting me in the middle of one p.a when it matters most in understanding that stuff is that your control. And yeah, life is a game of odds. There's a few things that aren't up to odds in possibility. Like this one you have, the work you put in your effort, all these things and in so much other stuff that left up the chance, just whatever the universe throws at you, you have no control over. So all you can do is perfect the things that are in your control, the best that you can, and a role with the punches that they come. So it's a little fucking life advice there from Father Seabund, hopefully passes on my kids to learn it even more effectively than me because I've definitely been hell of stressed out throughout the year and at time, but so I'll bring myself back down the ground, back down to earth and get through this shit and now I feel like I'm in a really good spot mentally to handle everything that's coming at me and just excited. You know, I've also been planning this year to be able to have some off-time in April when my baby's born and I'm just going to stay home in the gym, get fucking jacked, hang out with my baby girl and my wife and have a grand old time. So, I said just for that, said to show you guys that journey of me becoming a father as well with another, it's going to be cool. So, life's up to odds control was not in the odds. The only secret I got right now and have a fucking amazing partner who's got your back and can keep you grounded and your home grounded. It's very important. And enjoy the chaos when you're young because it's beautiful. So, that being said, pizza, pen the ass for tomorrow to go snowboarding. Second, that's my last secret. Find something at least once you that you fucking love to do where you can detach for me that snowboarding on the mountain. So, I'm going to do that tomorrow. I'll see you guys after that. Hopefully, come back, refresh and ready to rock. Maybe I'll do a vlog at there, Kevin wants me to, but you know they suck at that. So, we'll see. But anyway, thank you for watching. See you next time.

=== FILE: MENTAL UPDATE ｜ 2 WEEKS OUT MR. OLYMPIA [Yr-4xVRXChs].txt ===

just how to really rough. Starts with this prep and I didn't know if I was going to get through it. And it just feels good to be in my good spot mentally after something like that and to have so many people who have helped me get here and supported me, including all you guys watching. I've found many friends here. It's just something I'm really grateful for. You know, you don't feel like it brings out a lot of emotion to me. What is up YouTube? Just over two weeks out, walking in the load is getting down to right now. My weight is creeping down. Fatigue is creeping in. Getting leaner and leaner every morning. This is one of the time where it's so cool at the end of a prep because everything you do you notice. If I have like an extra 100 grams of carbs, I look fuller than I do. If I have a little bit of this, I lose half a pound and I look drier. And everything like every little thing that you change, down to sodium, calories, cardio, training, rest days. Your body looks different every single day. So it's pretty cool how like consistently you can manipulate it when you understand all your variables and you're being consistent across the board with everything. So a fun little time at the end of prep when you're exhausted. Time fucking gone, hugged, I go to bed. And I'm like, two tired of depression, I tease that wake up and I'm like, all right, let's do this again, but it's fine. Very enjoyable. Not really enjoyable. They're rewarding. But today's back day. First workout is that axle sadly. I missed it. I'm kick my ass with these workouts, but two weeks out. It don't really need to be killing it with four thrusts right now. So it was good. I got that out of the way three weeks out. Now we're just going to be pushing hard. Still a little bit less force reps. So I'm going to failure. I don't want to again. So I'm going on. The machine is fucking so nice. You can just push the failure, close your eye, think just fucking pull your lats. Please, folks, on your lats, go completely failure. Even when you tired, don't worry about forearm hurting yourself. Feels great. They don't make him like they used to. Yeah. Oh, cool. Come on. No. Okay. J Balini here is the role of dumbbell recovery yet. But just did a reverse grip, rose. I've been feeling those really good my back lately. I don't know if my wrist mobility. I've got a little bit better this year. I don't know why it would have, but feels better. There's two working sets there. I felt really strong. I actually got 12 plus reps, 275. So I can't complain about that. Do some heavy dumbbells and then move on to machines for the rest of the workout. Because why the fuck not? I'm gonna go up to 140. I feel pretty good right now. I'll drop down to 120s for my back offset. Call it a day for these bad boys. So I want to do both of these machines today. I've tried to forget which one I want to do. I don't know. So I just felt it. Sometimes there's no signs to it. It's all bro. Especially when your body will do what feels right. But that, because it's a little bit more of an angled neutral grip, not quite overhand or underhand. It's kind of more neutral similar to that dumbbell row. So I felt it a little bit more. My lower lap where I would have felt it in the last few exercises I did. So I'm going to do a straight overhead chest supported T-bar row right here. I'm pulling a little bit higher because I want to get more of my upper back mid-chop different from what I've just done. And then I'm going to move on to this one. So sometimes you can't always stick to the plane. You've got to feel it. You do what feels right. Oh, so sketchy led in that way. It's stretch right now. It's still good to squeeze it, but that's the end there. Can't let that drop too fast. Wow, why am I so weak? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I tried it. I ended up with really high as being in the workout and it just fucking plummeted. But the workout is not over, so I'm going to pretend like it did not. And we'll go fuck up some pull downs and have a great day. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah. This is one of the exercises where the way you move your head completely changes how you hit it. I'm going to check my head back and I think like I'm getting into a back double by step on stage. I feel way better, but subconsciously I'll be lean forward. So I'm trying to keep myself healthy and I try to remember to bring it back. So experiment how you want, but I'm trying to squeeze a little bit higher. My full back right here instead of just my last. So I'm going to have to arch you my whole head and back. Tell me about it from my neck, but just trying to get used back. Now how would you get back? Why not finish it back with a little bit of reverse curls? People are telling me my breaky-outs are starting to look like a little bitch. So those people, I say my breaky-outs always look like a little bitch. So it is what it is. I felt that back workout honestly was a really good workout. I felt strong, felt good, just about two weeks out and pumping out good weight right now. My body is feeling pretty good so I'm enjoying it. Just kind of keeping it on pace right now. It's been an interesting year. Gosh, man, I need an out of the Olympia. I figured it would have been a little mental up there. They break my knee on the countering here. Yeah, I just up there you guys were a matman. I felt like I always do this at some point in my prep. And this year has been a little bit different. Every year I go through something that in the moment feels like extremely over a while making and like challenging and I've learned over the years that it's something that I met. It's like a lesson in front of me that I met to learn. And this year it hit me. Like I haven't exactly said what was going on, but it hit me a lot earlier this year. That like 10 weeks out or whenever that was. So I've had a lot of time to like self reflect and like interest back and go and think about what it meant. And this is something I do a lot of my life. I'm a definitely a big thicker and anxious person, but it also leads to a lot of good self reflection. And a sort of life had up and down throughout the years is finding the motivation to like keep going. There's something that's just easier about being an underdog with no expectation, chasing after somebody or something. Being like, I'm going to be that guy. I'm second place. I want to be that guy. I'm a new pro. Nothing's expected me. Let me prove myself. And there's something just a little bit easier about fucking finding a little fire in your ass like that. As opposed to when you've been winning for four years and there's no one to look at. There's no goal to look at. There's no thing that exists in front of you to chase after you have to create it. And in searching for that you can almost become lost and overwhelmed. And this year I've kind of realized that there isn't really anything I'm chasing. And I shouldn't be looking for anything because what I'm chasing doesn't even exist yet. I'm creating the path for someone else to chase right now. And that's pretty fucking exciting. If you ask me, it's an opportunity to kind of just know expectation on myself because there's nothing else there to do or nothing to be. I just get to come in and do whatever the fuck I want to do and take it day by day and be the best version of myself. So instead of like trying to find the motivation or the goal to chase after and kind of like dissolving the idea that there even needs to be something like that to chase after. And going back to just what I love to do because initially I started bodybuilding without really creating the end goal and say, And I was kicking my ass in the gym fucking starving myself down and doing all the things that I just because fucking bodybuilders, what we do. And this year it's kind of like fell I fallen back into that in the last few weeks and it's been honestly a little bit more a lot more fun than a lot of years. And I think it's due to a few things, you know, a lot of personal growth and just relinquishing the expectation and pressure of things that I'm just constantly working on and the more I realize that there's nothing to really relinquish. And the pressure is built up in my own head as what like pressure I'm trying to get rid of doesn't even exist. So I'm not trying to get rid of the pressure I'm trying to dissolve the concept that they're even in it is any pressure. And then when I'm thinking about that you're like, oh fuck like what are you worrying about? And I mean this year it's been me putting a lot of time focus into the Olympia pulling away from all the other things that have to go on. I mentioned this about focusing on one external thing that I'm chasing after which is the Olympia. I mean the best I can at that and not having too many things on my plate when I wake up in the day it's like, no, I just got to be what Mr. Olympias. And I miss her Olympia so I decide what Mr. Olympias so I'm going to decide what I'm going to be today. And with that being said I push a lot of things out, but this year I've kept in a lot of more emotional mental internal things. So I have one big external goal but I've kept in I haven't suppressed my anxieties and my fears and my emotions. I've been a lot more accepting of them as they come and I have the moments of stress when they come and I've like you've been through this so many times and you never let these stop you. They're going to be here. So just sit with it for a moment. Allow yourself to be anxious. Don't be like, oh fuck this is going to happen. And then get through it and I do. And some other problem that I've had in the past is foreboding joy and when I'm like a really good streak like recently I've been feeling good. My body's been responding, I've been looking really good and just like feeling good. I said, oh fuck, something's going to happen. This is feeling too easy right now. Everything's going good. Something's going to fall apart. And this year I had those that thought succums in my mind every now and then but I thought myself now and I'm like, Why, like, you have no idea what's going to come. Something might come. I can't, I'm not going to tell myself it's not going to come. The only fact that I do know that I don't know what's going to come. So I've been focusing on when those of moments come up. Ask yourself, do you know it's going to happen? You know what's going to happen? You know what's going to happen? No, it might happen to me not, but right now I feel good. So take this moment in. Like I talked about broad in your sight of you. Look around you. I'm like, fuck, I'm here right now and I'm good right now. I'm happy. You said it motivated. I'm going to do good right now. Let's just enjoy this moment because tomorrow I'm going to have a shitty day and I might not feel like this. And I'm going to wish I did. So in this moment I'm going to enjoy that. And in tomorrow if I feel like shit, I'm going to sit in that. And then a, you know, life just comes in waves. And once you realize that is never going to be like Chris's fucking motivated and good or Chris is bad. Chris is just a process of up and down. And you're just kind of along for the ride and life. You can't really control it all the time. But in the moment you can control your perception of everything. So whatever I'm experiencing in the moment, I can sit in that experience because that's the only reality I know. What's happened in the past will happen in the future is completely out of my control. It's already happened. I can only control my perception in the current moment. And the more focus I've done on that and just kind of pulling myself back into that moment of either just focusing on practicing gratitude in the moment for being like doing cardio. And I'm saying there and I'm like, I'm, you know, I energy to keep going after 45 minutes. Like fuck yeah, this feels good. Like I feel good right now. And the moment through my, oh my god, I can't even do 20 minutes or I'm like, well, you know, you feel like shit today, but you're still going to do it. So get through it. And it's just taking a day by day. And I don't even really know if I'm making sense right now. But it's just something that's been on the process of my mind of kind of dissolving expectations of what needs to be and just kind of experiencing everything a moment of the comes. And like I said, understanding that there's nothing I'm chasing. I'm the goal that I'm chasing death and exists yet. And that's something that's just exciting and stepping into that unknown is kind of scary, but it's exciting. And it's what separates fucking longstanding repeat champions. And the people who just kind of fire up and then says, hello. And I want to be the person who comes up here and fucking holds it. Because every single year I realize I have this like level of more potential in me. And I realize it's probably a limitless bound of potential in me. And I just got to keep unlocking more and more and more and more and more and more and more. And just doing it I think. And so it's honestly a super exciting thing. And it's really fun kind of unlocking new levels of your mind, I guess. And it's one of the things people ask me what you love so much about bodybuilding. Last literally, the number one thing I love about bodybuilding is a mental growth. It gives you the opportunity for self reflection and challenge that it gives me. And that how much that spreads into every other aspect of my life. So I've been a lot of fun pushing myself in kind of becoming more resilient, stronger and aware over the past few years. And as I was saying this year focusing a little bit more on that emotional side, like this year instead of suppressing my emotion, I've allowed it to come up. And that's honestly enabled my relationship to be a lot more connected through a prep rather than in the past week. This connected at the end of prep, I'm super locked in suppressing on my emotion. Corking in a sense what I got you was like, well, reconnect after the Olympia. This year I'm really trying to put an effort into like sharing with her as my emotions come up and talking with her and she's there for me. She's forced me and then she's able to give more to me because she understands more of what's going on. And it's honestly made us a lot closer together and we're far from perfect. And it's still difficult going through prep. But I've realized that not only am I becoming a better bodybuilder, but I believe I'm becoming a better partner in my relationship. Hopefully a better man along the way. And that's fucking the trophy I need right there. That's something I'm extremely proud of. So yeah, all that being said, I'm gonna get you so far. I don't know. Just how to really rough. Starts to this prep. And I didn't know if I was going to get through it. And it just feels good to be in my good spot mentally after something like that. And to have so many people who have helped me get here and supported me, including all you guys watching. I'm family and friends here. It's just something I'm really grateful for. You know, you don't feel like it brings out a lot of emotion to me. I don't even know why I'm crying. But at least I have crying positive, feeling gratitude that I'm able to feel now rather than like suppression and anxiety and overwhelming pressure. That has caused me to kind of break down in the past. It's just different this year. And I think it's just a testament of what I've been through in the past and learning from it and growing from it. Because it's really all we can do. Oh yeah, this is fucking long ramp. I didn't meet the cry on this. Yeah. Anyways. Appreciate you guys for watching. As always. Appreciate the support. As always. It means a lot to me. Chasing after number five this year is going to be special. This journey alone has just been special and I'm just excited to get back up on stage and just. Fucking tie-in-out on this one. So. Yeah. Peace out. Thanks for watching.

=== FILE: MORNING ROUTINE IN PREP ｜ SHREDDED SHOULDER WORKOUT [MVDNrLnPmi8].txt ===

Do I have abs? J-H-Got. Fucking DB. That's J-H-Got? Yeah. I'm at Natties, liver king, bro. Gotcha. Come on! Come on, Chris! Come on! Come on! Recombo, 11th and 10th! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Come on! What? What? This up. You too. I shouldn't be saying good morning, you too. We're gonna give you guys a morning routine video right now. We did last year. We've always been doing that stuff. So I'm gonna be telling you guys everything you do from when I wake up to, I had a little bit of health breakfast, I guess. But pretty much wake up. I try and get a leader of water in the morning that piss like a race horse through the night. Usually it's like six pounds, so I try and drink this in the morning. Push my teeth clean my retainer, but that all the way. And then I try and know where myself but make it. So I'm consistent because my clothes will all weigh a little bit different. I know 250, so we're good to go. Next step, I will come in here. I'll put this light on. This is a garage where you guys have seen some dope pictures from Calvin. I have a box set up right here. This is a shoe, and this is my tripod, and it's a bit of there. Step like a little bit under the light. It's like it's so harsh, and then I do my posing right here. Not gonna pose for you guys. You can be able to hold clothes like this. I'll get it. But for now, the pose is a secret. Do that. Then I send the video to Hauni with my weight. Pretty much every morning, at least every morning I actually pose. And then I'm gonna make a little lot of breath and like I'm down. Hopefully we'll get out of here when I get to the patio. Come back in here, and a little bit of a cafe. I'll let it just change this up. I was having throw burn. This should get you lit up, it has you hemmedine. Only the 150mg of the caffeine, which I love, because I don't want to have too much caffeine. But still make you sweat and get this dimmed up. But I'm kind of cutting that stuff out like 2.5 weeks ago, for the assuffer, I'm so timid and slowly picking away. Sweet news, that I like intense. I'll still have like a tiny bit in the coffee if I want it. But nothing quite that strong, I guess you could say. So I had there, it's grown up where I live before me. So I'm like, Hauni sometimes, but cold brew's also good because I'm going to slower it. And after I post in that garage, I'm normally already a little bit sweaty. And then to this, I had when you have these electrolytes samples. Again, I piss through so much through the night. That like, I'm dehydrated in the morning. Obviously, in these things, they're packed like a little grain of sodium in here. But I don't have nearly the whole thing. I've fallen these whole last few, like, in court, and you like, two or three drinks each. I'll let you sprinkle a little bit on like that. And chocolate flavor, just like you're wondering why the fuck is being electrolytes in there. It's chocolate flavored. And then I take a little froth there. Been in that. But you're right, it's better. You can't have said. Just stuff the way to the easy and the way that they're probably just there. It's very, very good to go. It's normal. I love to have some nut pods. Some like dairy-free, sugar-free creamer than sugar in there, but obviously, I'm not having that right now. So drink this. Super light chocolate taste, but it just gives a little flavor. Electrulates. And I refill my water back up to the top. Grab my headphones. And go start cutting off. So I'm just going to sip out my coffee and then I'll see you on the treadmill. Alright, so these are my ugly ass cardio shoes. It's not like the training socks. These are like the socks we call them to a shoe almost. There's like nothing to them. They're the support. Super wide toe-based right there. So I feel like my feet are cramed into a shoe. And I have tried every wood shoe. And according to this modern new pair of A6, you try a new balance on the shoe. You might be able to buy the barefoot shoes in your cardio. Your feet are not meant to be wrapped up in a tight, squished, like cushion shoe. So this is what I rocked for cardio. I honestly tell my knees to tell my feet to help my shins. When I do a lot of cardio and I'm someone who's really bad at feet, that's how it's like. This is the treadmill and the good old garage. I got a lot of buttons to serve, which is very annoying. I feel like I'll be taking a happy face to stare on the one pictures. That's it. We started in clans 3% speed 3 miles per hour. And take a t-shirt. And the screen is like an iPad large. It's full brightness. So I've got a t-shirt over top. Two reasons. Great of shit on my eyes in the morning. Second reason. I don't want to see the time on it. I've gone back in. So it's typically to just set it. People always have these treadmill setting. I think we do this and I'll go up to a 6% inkline. Slowly, the ramp might speed up to 3.4. It's about 5 miles per hour. And sometimes you do the end. I'll put up like 8% inkline in a really kind of push through my glutes. I'm walking and trying to squeeze my butt just to make sure I'm getting the good old glutes shredded. Also turn it fan on the fruit. This is just freaking hot in four of some days. And it gets brutal out here. And then just walk my house down for the, not about 45 minutes. I'm going to get the fuck up. Just thinking for 45 minutes. I'm not perfect. But I typically start head-on then. I put on like a relaxing music. Trying to like chill with like sometimes I like. Of course, why I'm trying to play with that. In vision. Whatever the rest of my prep. You go through peak weeks. We back stage. We getting on stage. We doing this stuff. And I like putting myself through the motion. Like that. And I kind of feel it on. It's green so I want to get myself like meant to prepare for it. How do you feel? I think that is the time of the week. Sometimes I just shake here. I think it's like. I'm going on in my life. It's like you like a gratitude reflection. We're in the shit like that. And then I'll go in. Check my emails. I'll play a text. Oh, blah, blah. I also forgot to mention when I go to sleep. I put my phone on airplane mode. I like not a fucking night. So nothing can even come through. I wake up. Nothing comes through. No notification. And it just stops when I'm driving. I think about anything until I'm on the treadmill. And I choose to take it off airplane mode and check if I have anything going. It feels like that's stressful thing for me. Work or email or whatever. I don't have to focus on it. I'm not telling where you're to focus on it. And then I go through all that shit. You go up to show. I'll show off for you too. Kill time. And then we'll see you have a death to that. So I'm going to crush this shit and enjoy it. Have you seconds? I could do this in my cardio. I'm going to do that. All right. I can do that. My absolute array. I've helped someone to do something to take. I'm probably going to ask what I'm taking to my gym to say as I'm running. But I've got K2D3, kidney, turmeric, vitamin C, a whole bunch of fish oils. I know there's counter-gene fish oils, but I can have it in every single day. So my body is used to it. Take lipid. It's been healthy cholesterol. I'm sodium bicarbonate. This is actually supposed to be anti-cancer. But it's also helps for kidneys. And so it's kind of a progressive medical thing. Get it for your kidneys. And then liver and heart. What's going on? This is breakfast. Ah, so it'll be like 10 calories at least. More than 10 calories. There's like 10 on meggers in there. I'll do it every year. If I had just added that in like a week out, I had in like 100 calories from fish oils. Maybe it wouldn't be the best. But my body is used to it. I'm the one doing it. So we're doing it. Anyways, just finished cardio. 45 minutes, wrapped it up. Honey, it's called me. I send a video and then he wanted to call me to go over a game plan. That was like 2.5 weeks out of stuff. It's changing very consistently. He likes to more cardio. He likes cardio. Post today instead of cardio. He does if it's chest state. So fine tuning everything can change almost every day. And luckily he talks a lot. He can just rant on the phone. So it's good when I'm on the treadmill because then I just can get through it. And next thing I know, I'll take off. I've been walking for 45 minutes and we got a game plan. And I'm ready to go. And sometimes on my counter, I rush out the door. I gotta go, man. What is it? But he's very technical. And I mean, we're 2.5 weeks out. So I want to take a lot of what I want everything locked in. And even if sometimes coaches tell you to change stuff consistently, they're really hot. Just to make you feel like you're doing more than you are. Then that helps. Like if I'm like, okay, well, if you're going to do this today and change that tomorrow, like some different every day just to kind of break up the monotony of the bodybuilding fucking groundhog day. Sometimes it helps. Anyways, just made my pancakes this morning. I've been going back and forth in my morning routines between either making oats and eggs or bunning, either to pancakes. I don't know why. I just like switching it up. So I've got to on it. You like two separate things. Let's taste a little bit different. Sometimes I just want to eat a plate of thin watery, a way to pancakes. So today's one of those days. I'm going to put you up. And enjoy. I am freaking hungry right now. You taste better than a hamburger in the assies. I like to do this. You start yourself for 16 weeks to eat these. It's really good. You start yourself for 16 to eat. It's really dirt. Exactly. But you get more enjoyment from it because you're deprived. Quite deprivation. It's a beautiful thing. You get more joy from small things. When you're out of a burger in the tent? No. I know they're earned. Something through deprivation. I want it more. Yeah. I have a studio in the ass today. This is probably the epitome of how you don't want to live in press. Cameras and light sunions. But you're lucky to live you guys. Anyways, final part. Yeah, my morning routine sometimes I call it to briefly morning. But lately I've been doing a son and call it to later in the day. So I'm going to lean more on your routine. I've been stretching and rolling it a little bit. I just want to roll it a little bit at the start. Just like move some stuff through in the night stretch. My hips hip flexors. Cool. It's a little bit just to get some moving. I feel like there's been like a trend lately. People being like, foam roll doesn't do anything. Stretching doesn't do anything. And there's been this trend of people like debunking everything that everyone ever done in the mid. It's like nothing works. Oh, she's having some fun. But you know what? And it totally. I have never stretched in the past. And this year I've been stretching like five times a week in the morning. My hips feel better. My quads feel better. My knees feel better. I've been less pain than I've been. I can squat right now at two weeks. I was no knee pain. My stretch and cuts everything in my legs are a little bit more fuller, a little bit deeper. And when I get really like tight in my hip from doing it with so much cardio. I actually start to feel like tired and exhausted. It can even affect my digestion just like blood flow everything. I'm about to drain my dreaded bed. Yeah. All that good stuff. And it's helped me and anecdotally I feel better doing it. So I'm going to continue to do it. But I typically just roll through my quads a little bit. Like I said, get stuff going. And then I go over a couple of carpets stretcher over the stretcher. It's a stretcher, it's all showing in a minute. All right. We're on through this a little quick. I'll show you guys in a second. So tell them that there's a watch me stretch for 20 minutes. But huge thing hip flexors. I don't know if everyone's definitely tell me. I like to find something that's like yay high. Put my son on it. And then you forward like this. And I'll like thrust my hip forward, just flex my glute of the foot that's up. And kind of push through with my hip like a pelvic toe pushing forward. And you really feel like a tight stretch in your. And I'll just kind of like move around like that and then let me back. And then I said put my arm behind me and I'll feel like all the way up here. Like this. And then they sit into a little bit deeper. Just let it pull in there. You just kind of find whatever spots it really tight. And when it hits, I just hold back. I mean sometimes I'll literally get to that part. I'm watching show. Do some of my phone. I'll just sit there in that position for like a minute or something. Just really let it open up. And then I don't do this right before I train and do it like early in the morning. And then I'm like four hours later, working out. So if I'm doing like that, it's not like overly loose. And I also do my hip sluts. Just sit like this. Cross me like underneath me. And this is when I always crack through my hips. I'm just going to get some good, so good through at least. If I let it sit, kind of thing, just push. So you feel where you want to feel. This is where I get my hip up in the hip chops. Sock it, joint in there. Loosen up a lot. I feel like it's too, especially if I lean forward like that. It really gets that shit out like that. After that, you do a little bit of hamstring and stuff. Just like open my legs wide. This is kind of like a doctor growing into it. That you're just like, curl myself forward. Like reach a few times. And I push my feet out like this. So that my toes are pointing out where it's in. And you feel that pull a little bit deeper in your groin here. And you pull it in there. Next. We're going to read them. The million ways to stretch everybody. Let her just put her out. That's for you. I like just sitting on a knee. And I cannot have a slight bend in my knee right here. And this is for my hamstring. And I can like rotate a little bit. Pull my other hamstring. If you come in a little bit and get on my inner there. And just feel like you always just got to feel your body. Wherever you need it. Pull from that position. Sitting at. When your body gets comfortable in there. Push a little bit deeper into it. Breathe through your stretches. And roll with it. These are the main ones that I do sometimes. I'll like find my back. Put my knees to my chest. Roll it to the side. How that kind of gets tough. But these are the main litter for that I do because my hips. Hamstring, glutes and flots. The places that I try to think of my body. Some days I'll stretch my lats. Just simply by like setting on something like this. And pulling one at a time. And just rolling through whatever I feel like I need to. Tip by the podcast on or even show I'll set up over there and watch it. And I do this for like 20 minutes. It's my super easy. And honestly some days from like really tired. And I feel exhausted. Bees up. I'm just like, fuck this day. After this, I actually have more energy. Just like blood flow. I'm going through your body. Let the energy kind of flow through your body. And greatly to start with the day. So you don't feel like I've completely asked. Even though I still do I need to be very not going to. So that's pretty much it for my morning routine. I'll probably take a cold shower after cold. Not really cold water. The shower is in Florida, sadly. But it is what it is that it makes it cold. I can't. Sometimes I dip in the cold tub. Like I said, if I do in the morning till like two or three minutes. Tip would do it longer later in the day. With a sauna, special on rest days. And about it. Probably not going to show you me getting in the shower. Because Kelvin's sitting there for me. They give more training. They won't be able to kind of sus. And you got the very sus. So I don't want to show you that. So thank you for watching. And I don't know what we're training after this. But see you at the gym. All right. What's going on guys? Should we do that? How many of us should we do in a minute? But I'm like 50 grams of carbs to be right now. And I'm feeling it. Warm it up. It's just literally trying to get energy moving through my body. So I can actually feel my muscles and functioning. Pretty much refraining from 90% of free weight at least with like combat movements. So I warm up the shit. I'm actually like four sets of fire. 10 reps on this machine here about the SRD on working sets. Then we're going to move through some machine presses. Maybe some dumbbell raises. And get through these beautiful shoulder workouts. Also one of the days where I have the worst fucking protein fights. So I tried to get them all up before I came here because no one wants that as a gym. I'll hold it in, but it's part of the prep sadly. You need a private gym for that sole purpose. I'll be holding it in because I don't want to fucking embarrass myself for front of anyone here. Luckily, it's a dead gym. Calvin might be the one suffering. If you institution that I stand on the ground you're.) I beg my knee. And they just tear into the Hamilton. It's too hard to if they make my legs up. But warm ups. Playful. We've been doing a little bit more. While you know what I'm about to 3-4 to 3 minutes editing. But right now I'm really trying to make my blood moving and flow in. I'm not hitting any PR that you're really happy set 3 now. So I'm trying to burn calories, blood flow, warm up properly, not hurt myself. If you do that yourself, the gyros need to get too slow. I think it's low. It's trying not to lose all my size. 2. I KF-Are Trucks. I play no Chicken fullest. Take your phone and make you work out. Honey texted me. He says how many Colorfullvia left do I? 1.踭 with your cut, it's all! I'm just sick! I guess I'm having zucchini and fish both workout. The dream come true. No more carbs for the rest of the day. I'm telling you a fucking shredded boy, this is two weeks at and time to suffer. Time to deplete the suffer. And just nap and workout and survive. So, it's game time. A little bit more. Check my water on the glitter water bottles. I just shake the strike on them. But it makes me drink more water, till I'm checking for whatever reason. I have to piss all the time. I'm nearly back there. The opposite corner of the gym, the machine, and just a two-leaf walk over there. The whole my face has to work out. He's pissed myself. She's our own diaper. Yeah. Bum diaper. It came out new line of bum pull-ups that you were at the gyms you don't have to go pee. The one thing about being good or good, she's speaking weaker now. His hanging is his machine. I fucking love his machine, but just wait too late. There's flex fitness. Troubles are pressing to have her. It's like loaded. It's when the pin loaded. And it's full stacker there. I just controlled the way I push. Took my asses and I can't use it. But when we're going out, I don't feel like loading up. I want your plates. Such an infotainter truck out there. I don't know the good the fuck. Yeah. That's it. Nice to be with you for this one reason. I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. Freeways. All in the unit access. It's really right now. So I did three sets. Three sets pin loaded shoulder press. Now I'm gonna do two set laterals. Two sets front raises. We've honored the rear delts. Probably going to be it for shoulders. But I want to give it a shout out to Flex too for the t-shirt. He's randomly set me a box with some dragons there. T-shirts. And then this one, which is like a custom cut and so shirt. And it's like a little bit longer. No head off Flex. This would be an absolute stress on you. But I like it. Because I love long kind of overset t-shirts. So I don't know if you're building a brand or not. But if he is, if he's soon just, I gotta shirt in the mail. It doesn't say if Jack is there or Flex is on his side. Thanks Flex. Love you. See you in a week. Thank you. Don't be skinny bitch or have sake skinny bitch. Take difference in your verbiage. But I'm skinny bitch. You do what I call funny pills. The bitch flat. Redel Flas. Do it with a, the best with a metal cable. Our metal handles will lock through wrist and position. Instead of pulling like this, we're going to do the neck exercise. You can do like a bitch flat motion. And I like to high point down a little bit. I feel it more into my like mid rear del, rather than into my trap for it all. Feels good. I don't know. Whatever you hear in the best amount of most connections, Re del is one of those finicky things you gotta play with. I feel it's good to me. So give it a shot. So there are too many head lesson to they Magazine. I'll tell you this, Jim will have one pack there. So much waiting to do. Reverse flies on there. But I was gonna wrap up to you with a little bit chiceps. And then I'll feel like waiting. Doing nothing, so finish them, not finishing. Replacing my finisher, but whatever, I don't know what I'm saying. Do these cable cars or everything from doing these this prep feel very good on my chiceps. I slated movement. I had my chiceps a little bit through shoulder so I just kinda polish them off over here. So I'm not gonna be turning arms for three days. So I figured, might as well get a little extra in there and then think whenever I think it's getting down, the fact that when you see all that finish there, I'll come and help you and take it for me. Well, abs, little cardio, go home, easier carbs, make the honey, do it all again tomorrow. The part of those work out where I'm just dying. But I'm gonna make Calvin film this, because people say I don't do abs. So, Calvin, no. Every time I go to train out, they just leave the gym. I don't know. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to train out, they just leave the gym. And everyone's a dual train out because I'm like, no Calvin just doesn't like filming with you abs. You don't do abs. Okay. But I don't do abs very intense, but this is the first year I've actually trained abs. I know I have proof that I'm cramp. I used three, four, five reps and just cramps up out. I can do any more. Now I can do three, four, five sets and not die. So, the plus for me, I don't know if it's going to train, stay still and look at that different right now, have a little bit better abdominal control. But I don't do any like weighted crunches, heavy machinery, none of that bullshit. I was doing more like bodyweight crunches and like leg lifts and different variations throughout my prep. But now that I'm at the end and I'm on it's just dead at the miracle, I just do straight leg raises into knee-tocks and do like four, five sets, nothing crazy. Almost failure is not quite and then call it a day. Salt takes. One set, one there. No, I do that. I try to get 10 straight leg, 10 knee-tocks, my first set or so and then the rest slowly dwindled down. I don't get any body pump right now. Now I'm going to pump anywhere and so depleted when my abs get pumped. I don't know why. It's not like it's doing, it's not what you want. But hopefully have a better midsection on stage to see. Have you ever bent over and just like your top ab gramps? Bro, I fucking have to stand like this, I just lean backwards so I lean, or the other side of the aircraft. It looks like a lock, it looks like a herniac. It sticks out of the hole, it's packed like contracting six out of a miserable lock. Do I have abs? Dude, being literally like a Back on the stairs. Can we wrap on the tour? I hope you guys enjoyed my morning routine, my morning ritual. My shoulder day, my actually training at the, the living or not, you see me here first. First, might have a sick back on the stages here. Maybe even a five and a half pack if you feel like he. But that's gonna be wrap on today's workout two weeks out. Like I just fucking told you guys how to pull my food out in the cardio. Time's suffer. Only really. 12 days until I weigh in, 11 days until I weigh in. So I gotta be sub two-four, he has so some weight to lose and weigh in. This is good to remove them. But typically in the morning on Thursday they're actually at late at night. Now I won't say. Let me back to the way under two-four, he had like 8 p.m. night which is a fucking hard to eat. So. I better be fucking shredded. So I'll go say. That's all I'll say. That's all I'll say. Thank you for watching. Love you guys. Thank you for joining me on the beautiful journey of getting shredded. Join the journey and join the process. Have fun with it. And it's almost all over. So, it's still next time. Goodbye.

=== FILE: MORNING ROUTINE ｜ ARM WORKOUT 5 WEEKS OUT [alXL7ODyEX4].txt ===

How do you think he looks for it? How he looks? Yeah. Big, looks good. I was saying this yesterday. I was like, I don't either, you look bigger than last time you saw it. I saw you where I got smaller so you look bigger. You just get smaller. I'm just getting smaller so everyone else that was big is looking bigger than me. I don't think I've got the open big. You got to do a bunch of like bullying shit, Chris. The bigger than Rami. I don't do shit. What is up YouTube? First thing in the morning, I don't do shit. I just feel like my water wake up and do you actually the only weird thing I do in the morning sound is a bit of breath work. I literally thought like meditation or spiritual I just do it because mad lungs. I slow down your breathing so much when you sleep. When I'm like brushing my teeth I do like breath work like a 20 deep breath. Hold the exhale. Hold it in the inhale to repeat and it just like wakes me up. I have no caffeine before I do cardio or anything. I just literally come out from my water and get on the treadmill. So obviously it kind of helps me if you get other people to throw a wake up in the morning while you're brushing your teeth. All right after whatever in the bathroom just do like a brown breath work and it wakes your head up. Then that'd be some spiritual meditation. People relate breath work too much. It's literally wakes you up at 50 full energy oxygen. It's how the body makes energy flooding your body to the oxygen. We'll give you energy anyways. I gotta get on the treadmill and you do some cardio. Okay, a place to be. But these shoes I'm just gonna mention you really quick. You guys know me I'm gonna see your head. I love nice shoes but they fuck my feet up. It comes pain with the fucking fog up here. But these are called zeroes or ex-EROs. These lambs and people bear further. Trouss, mullies are my favorite. They're like a bear foot shoe with a wide toe base and because I walk around and shoot their shoes off from me a lot of the time, I can train socks, walk around socks and much possible. I do my cardio and bear foot shoes just to help my feet and toes like spread a little bit. But yeah, they're like not very expensive. She just lasts forever, especially for the cardio. So, it's early gone and you get started. Okay, shit. Let me get right. All right, I know where to put the camera so you can get a little bit shaky. But any lot of people ask me what my typical goal to try to do with the routine is. I had to be getting a preference a little bit more gentle. I used to walk around my block. And suddenly, kind of wake up the outside and just kind of a different change of pace to me on a treadmill. But obviously my heart rate's on the beat is I do not even have to walk on an incline to that, etc. So I cut that out and now I'm just stuck on this fucking hands-through wheel for 45 minutes straight and I typically first-hand minutes I do it at like a forward incline. 3.2 speed. Just get moving and then after that I bump it up to like 3.5. 6 incline and at the end I'll go up to like keep it at 3.5 and go up to like an 18 incline and the 18 incline is really kind of like getting the heart going. So typically just trying to keep my heart rate from like 105-120. It doesn't really get to 120 until the end. But really all I need some low intensity city take I do. My neighbor's walked by here all the time and probably thinking, I'm fucking in that trouble. Just wet my ass off in this garage walking on a treadmill. It's beautiful outside of it. But there's what it is. You've got this treadmill with like tracks instead of fuel flow my head. It's used. It's thingin' beat up but it's really good for my knees. It's got a little more give. It's like a specific athletic running treadmill. So it's been helping my knees to get them out. I'm a barefoot shoes. Spread my toes when I walk. Do know all the things. I'm pushing through my glutes to make it on a high incline. Oh yeah, super simple. I should wake up every morning like I said just water. A little bit of breath of work. I've got 40 pounds of cardio and I've got my cardio right now. I totally all am doing it. I do a little bit of warm up for some like days. You should like that. But it's not so crazy to eat it. We're about five and a half weeks out. Last year got up to about an hour and a half total one a day. So I'm assuming it'll be about the same. Let's carry the better for me because sometimes we'll all one sane on here. I don't like just sitting on here. The first 10 minutes or so. I shouldn't close my eyes. I have the visualized prep. We're on stage. When the fifth title, I do like a little bit of a gratitude prayer. It's just saying like thing, things in great for four. I realize I think things in my life that I'm really quest to have. There are a lot of those. I'm very grateful. So I just kind of like remind myself of that. How I started my day. I'm not going with longer than the cameras that are looking at my phone. Then I get bored. I check my phone. Email's eyes and comments. Maybe whatever bullshit to go time. And then I just started new anime. So I've been watching bleach. I've got my actual got me on to Naruto back in the day. Finish that. Watch 100 finish that and start bleach now. The great show. The end of the night. I can slow rebirth. Fucking shit up. But it's a good little thing to kill time. Endless episodes in anime. And they're not too hard to watch. They'll get the paid attention every day. I can sometimes have it on. Background still see what's going on. I still have to enjoy that. So yeah, I've got like 20 minutes less. I know you're not supposed to do our things before reward. Whatever that interview mentioned is. I can't lie when I'm on the thing. Sometimes I'm excited to get off. I think I'll eat my pancakes. So that's what's getting through the last 15 minutes. But yeah, so we're gonna put this camera down. Because I have it's fuck holding it like this. I'm excited. I'm gonna thank you. Get a stay service. Okay. All right, so finished cardio. I had it call it like 9 a.m. And then the one I'm gonna have thought so I did like an hour of cardio. But I just lowered it down so I could actually talk. But it takes me this long to, I get up at like 7 30 in the morning and then do fucking whatever. My cardio everything. I don't even get my breakfast ready till 9.50 in the morning. Just a little bit of it. I'm going to do it myself. I'm camera. I'm fishing straight ahead. Look at this. Look at this close my feet. Chill. I'm gonna see that. I'm supposed to get my free feet shit. I'm sorry. See you're looking. I feel like trying to look at me. I didn't know it would stay. Okay, there you go. There you go. 252 pounds right now. That is exactly 10 pounds off of my weight limit. With five and a half weeks to go. So it's about two pounds a week. But really square is like four pounds a last week. Water and everything. So in a pretty good spot right now. I'm ready to rock. But I finally made my pancakes. I can't hold you guys this since we get through the morning. I'm gonna pancake the way in front of me. I kind of butt your the last few ones. But it's all taste good. I don't have any of my mum fruit syrup. Which kind of sad. So I'm literally just gonna be using real salt. As my strain is there. Spicy, whatever. Salt, the spice of the ice. Holy shi- I need to do it now. So yeah, this is breakfast. That's cardio. Rollin' out. Now I got to get like three meals ready because I've been trying to eat just early in the morning's possible. Get my meals in quick spots. We get my metabolism, fire and fruit. The day I make sure I have carbs in me before I train. I'm gonna train like two o'clock today. But if a contract comes to the warehouse in the fucking 40 minutes. So I'm gonna have to really speed this up. If my meal's ready, you've gotta go Walmart and fill up something for that. And then I gotta train. So kind of a bit of a stacked big. I'm gonna get the pancakes down. And I'll see you guys in a bit. It's a may or may not be able to hear me because I realized Calvett and gave me his camera was a microphone with no court plugged in. But I was just running at the door there. You guys like literally saw me look at the clock. But fuck I got to do X Y and C and I went into like fucking stress rush mode. Which is something that I've been stuck in a lot. This year and it really helped me back so a lot. And Courtney told me I need to read this book called The One Thing. And it's just like about I haven't read it. But I was assuming it's about focusing on one thing because even my therapist was telling me she's like, You can be the best in the world. But it's gonna take away from other things. It's gonna take away from the optimal business. The optimal relationship if your kids would take away from kids like you can't be the best and perfect at everything. There's something that's got to give some more. And for a while it was everything and it was my mental stress. So I've been really working on when I get myself into the state of like stress of panic of like being late for something. I'm like fuck okay I like stuck in that mode and I literally noticed my like plain of sight. My side of view whatever gets really narrow and I'll put my head down or stare at something and just like I like. It's like I'm looking through a tunnel like this and I've noticed something that helps me get out of that. It's physically opening up my side of view and being like. Slow down taking a breath and like looking around me literally like taking my peripheral vision into account and seeing the whole of everything. And being like okay life is so much bigger than this one little piece of stress right now. Slow down as fast as you eat shower, speed down the highway, whatever the fucking you need to do. You're probably gonna save a minute 30 seconds fucking of time. The pressure doesn't really speed things up that much. You might as well slow down and relax the state of stress because if you constantly live like that, your body genuinely in a constant state of stress which one of my favorite guys ever Peter Grown calls that being a state of this ease. And that's what creates disease. That's why people so many people in our world right now fucking sick disease. All the shit going on is the ridden's constant state of stress. And your body cannot heal or to the state of stress of the body builder. I can't recover and perform the way I need to recover and perform either professional bodybuilder. So, me living like that all year was traveling business, you know personal shit, fucking content here, trips there. Over the businesses prioritizing over here all these different things going on. Put me in this like constant go-go go-mode. And I didn't really stop and slow down and I'm very introverted and perspective person. So if I don't have time where I'm like by myself and alone, it would be like reflect me with my thoughts and like process where I'm out with my life. I tend to like build up a sense of anxiety and disease. And I started to notice that I wake up every morning like 4 or 5 a.m. and all the thoughts of like like I'm moving, I move to America. My taxes are going to all fucked up and I work as three different accounts in different countries in the business of the new business. And I remember while my GC this shit is content I got to do behind on this. I haven't replied to these people even. All these things that like for him and I can't sleep. And then I don't sleep, I wake up and I'm exhausted the next day. My training is shit, my recovery shit. And now the thing that's most important in my life that should be prioritizing bodybuilding, of some of my relationship of course, is suffocating from that. So I've been just working on slowing down and not being like I need to do X, Y and Z. Because a lot of things they don't. I have the most fucking amazing team at my back. I have Calvin who's got my back for all content. Dom Matt Forever, he went to the business court. He's got me set with food and everything at home. I got fucking mad at all the C-bumped and did this everything. We got to have a team on army people. I'll be able to... Sometimes he just slowed out and fucking let them and let myself take it easy. And all that has to do right now is prioritizing winning the Olympic. So that's what I've been doing. I've been taking time to meditate. I've been using this app waking up from Sam Harris. I don't really know if I love the guy but I don't listen to him. I just live into the app. And I've logged like 40 days in our own that thing. It's not even like anything special or crazy. It's just taking some time to be present and mindful of the present moment. Taking in like where you're at, your surroundings. It means slow things down a little bit. Not being this constantly distracted by thought, stress, and thinking what you have to do and where you have to be. So that's genuinely been helping me a lot. And I think a lot of people live like that in that state of stress, like I said. So working on that, it's definitely helped me. I'm sleeping way better now. I've noticed my workouts have been getting better. Even though I'm eating less than I'm getting leaner and stuff. It's just starting to like flow a lot easier in my life because I'm able to prioritize what I need. And not take out too much shit at once. And then saying no to a lot. So this fucking camera's going over. Sorry, Calvin. I'm trying not to break your camera. But yeah, that's, a mini update. Literally just did that this morning. I was like in a rush and then I was like, I like slow down. Take a look around you. It's going all right now. How fast are you going to rush right now? And are you going to be five minutes earlier late? Like with the fuck here, just show up whenever you show up and the life will go on. People will wait for you. So that's the C-Bum lesson of the day. Flushing down. Don't live in the state of this knees. Get out of that stress in your head. And enjoy life because meant to be enjoyed. Being mindful and taking just random periods of the day to realize like to be present and just look around you. Where you are in a crazy world is and how beautiful everything is. It really helps your perspective and overall like being in this world. So yeah, with that being said, I am only set up in the state. And I'm going to break out of the cameras when I'm going to shut this off. Because yeah, I lied to Lisa, but break that. I'm not going to break out of the camera. But if someone's late at playing with the wear, I'm right now. So I will see you guys with the next clip. And it's a marms day. Pump for that workout arm, be as in front of her the best. So I will see you guys later. Someone called Chris the toilet. There's no problem here. You're kidding. Yeah. I let her told that I will not take a shit in here. You're like, if you're a bathroom in your place, I'm like, yeah, if you're a shit in there, you're late for that. I'm like, shit here. Literally fucking shit here. And then you go and clogged my fucking toilet. Oh, there we go. Where's all this? In the way one. It went down. Fuck it. It is. I have to film this confrontation. I don't know if I can get it. The girls are over there too, so hopefully they're the best. I'm gonna just yell at them. Nathan, I told you not to take a shit here. You plump the toilet. You're the smart. Bro, you plump the toilet. I'm not joking. I told you. It's fun. It's fun. It's fun. You just said it's like, dude, it does. I told you, shit at the warehouse. You know what's in the mail? It's got back. What? Very serious. It was, yeah. You said it was a small, a principal. I told you, shit in the warehouse. A public restroom. You put on my, that's my bag. It's small, as I asked it. It's been a long time. I've never traded here. Kick though. Kids these days. Never spend. I don't know. Why don't you guys come here? One guy clocked the toilet. You guys still should have moved. So it's private too. All right, what's going on guys? Finally me into the gym. A little late again today, but it's okay because the arm day, so it's gonna be a good day. But we are, I don't know what I'm saying. Training ass was Mr. Lady Blair again today. So today, he's got his sprinting training after this. Yeah. Form arm pump warm up and then he's gonna go run. Yeah. So the arms and sprinting arms and sprinting. I think that is actually a good day. I give you that every day. But I thought about it all. But um, not by design. I'm wearing this shirt of something fun that we're doing next month. Calvin honestly spearheaded a lot of this project. So it was a lot of his idea in planning setting up together. But we're doing this really cool partnership with this. I'm not even sure what you call them is group. It's called GBRS group. They're ex-military Navy SEALs and they do like some tactical training. They say optics and stuff. I do a lot of cool stuff and they give a lot of their proceeds to some charities and some foundations that they've founded themselves. So we decided to partner with some creative hydration product. They do a lot of like physical like exertion training like whether tactical but also running and like I don't want to say crossfit but more intense stuff. So we wanted to partner with them for a hydration product. Where are they shirts right now? I'll be a pros one of the things. We made them like a really cool custom label. This is our only tub of hydration pattern right now. I wasn't that really thick. Let's flavor his red way and blue. So it's like, I don't know. Fucking delicious. It's really good. It's really good. It's like a, what's that called? I'm rocking. Rock it. Yeah. That's good. Really good. Just drop it. This one is really good. It's strawberry lemonade. Yeah. Yeah. And it actually takes a list of stuff. I got two scoops of the hydration and one scoop of the A's and it takes really good. So. But yeah. So something we've calmed us been planning a lot of it. And it's finally come in fruition around our memories. It's kind of the plan for it. We're going to be donating all the proceeds to the Danny D. Foundation right. That's what it's called. So one that DJ started to over at GBRS. So we're going to be giving all the money that we make from this over to them. We got two t-shirts coming to you. So we'll come out a lot more information when it starts to come up. Rows are going to be posting better GBRS is going to be posting better. So for now, just go check out GBRS. I'm in three or more whatever. And then we're going to be posting what's come. You guys can get this very exclusive product. It's exclusive t-shirts and everything coming soon. But it's all going to be for a really good cause donating all the proceeds to charity. So excited to be doing something like this definitely something that we're all stands for. And we want to start doing a lot more of. So excited to be doing this for the first time with this group. Yeah. So that's a team. But until then, I'm going to drink this down because we need the hydration this hot ass gym and I'm going to put those marks. And then we're going to do the last three hour workouts. And then we're going to start doing a lot of work. So we're going to do a lot of work. I've been starting with a rope just because the warm up of the elbows to really contract with your child. And then because it's fine gym now and it's going to be on the other table. I can take it two cables. So I've been using the straight bar. I've had an easy bar. For the overhand dress addiction and it really gets bigger really deep stretch. Not as head of the contraction the rope but pairing them to the super set. Really good way to start it. I've tried that already full of butter right now. Later rock, it's like warm up like this. I'm gonna be watching a press afterwards And yeah, it's just what I've been doing to start every hour more gillily and it's really good Stop What is How do you think he looks for it? How he looks? Yeah. Big. Looks good. I was saying this yesterday. I was like, I don't either. You look bigger than last time you smoked. I saw you or I've got smaller so you look bigger. You just get smaller. I'm just getting smaller so everyone else that was big is looking bigger to me. I think it won't be the open day. You got a few months back. I'm going to eat shit first. It's bigger than Rami. I'll try. I think I'm going to do one and a half but I'll try to do one and a half. Sure. You got a couple. You got a couple. Come on. I'll just do one and a half. I'm going to do one and a half. I'll just do one and a half. You're gonna go on. You got a couple. You got a couple. How long are you going to eat? I'm gonna eat. I'm gonna eat. I'm gonna eat. You got a couple. You got a couple. I'm gonna eat. Yeah You could feel like a one-gauge That one goes like right I think I'm going to get a knife, the nurse is always like making joke I get a knife and I just want to see it on that It's so easy to do But do I have to do that while your blood pressure is always looking to I have a doctor's and so I'm looking They continue quan Going all out of the steam you pick. different range of emotion so at some point trying to get a deep stretch from my tricep to two started with and another point I'm trying to get a deep stretch of my bicep which we're finishing with here. It just looks like a good way to really like thin everything especially so like myself I've really short bicep head. We'll get a lot of tension purely in like the lower head of my bicep to be able to stretch it back and it pulls it out. It allows me to contract with full bicep back here. I'm supposed to curl where I'm up here so just kind of hit the mothamol angles. This machine is like the best machine for like hitting shift and dipping angle to the dmg of the thing so more tension. My answers. I'll see you guys later. Beauty offices like functional trainer like 30 minutes of something. So I think about so yeah back then this guy's getting into track and field four weeks post retirement and retirement being fucking in the Latvia practice while for me but it's just thing to see. Long live the learners up. Roadshow. Again after like this my time's already got over my time. I only do this for five minutes and it's been like seven. I had to get an explode. This is the secret I'm going to make six foot four this year. Shit. How do we enter this? Oh. You guys are just captured my secret. Damn it's all related. But yeah the wrap on today's workout I've been doing these. Inversion tables for like five to seven minutes today. Doing two minutes before but I'm just keep working my way up. Just kind of release some tension in my spine if I get taller great but I just have my spine always so locked up. I'm just trying to stretch it out especially doing it after abs it feels good to crunch your abs and then elongate your spine. It just feels really good. It's also healthy to have your feet over your head for a while for your circulation and everything like that. Like for short periods of time but anyways that's a wrap on at the day. I'll show you a little bit of what I get up to in the morning with my cardio. I got to train arms with Ian and had a grand old day. So let me get some food in now. Chill go to bed early, bike up and do it all again tomorrow. Guys I'm blood work tomorrow so I'm going to be checking out some shit and make sure I'm healthy, thyroid working, fucking estrogen is not flied through the roof and just where I need to be and I feel really healthy this year so I'm just checking out some markers to make sure everything's where I want it to be and that's all that's really going right now. So yeah if you're watching, peace out, catch you next video.

Best of me I've ever had in my life with Courtney at catch in Aspen. The chef knew who we were and he was a super nice dude. I can't remember the names sadly. They gave us like everything on the menu. Like an assampler. So we weren't too full but we got to try it all. So good. Sometimes. There you go. Stop me. What's going on? Oh you. I'm getting told, huh? You can't show it. Did you tell her? You can't tell her? You can't show it. Sorry. She's saying it's good. She's saying it's good. She's saying it's good. She's saying it's good. She's saying it's good. Me, me, me and Zayn was one. Yeah. How many times back in Canada? We had before my show. Oh, show those. We did show those. And back. We did two days. Okay. And they did me a new train. One night, but we walked all over fucking Canada. Look at her gym. Yeah. What do we say now? What do you think? That one. That's the worst one right. I just remember walking around. We did it on our day one. That was pretty true. Yeah. That was so good. You and I were trying to find this gym. We went up to set of stairs. That was so good. That was good. Who's the lead? That's a number. Yeah. I was going on guys. We're here in the Dragon's Lair. With the champ himself. Mr. Flex Lewis. So, been a long time to do the change together. I think it last time might have been in Canada. I think it was. Like years ago. Yeah. Obviously for the viewers watching that. Chris has supported me tremendously over the years. Before he was the champ and do run. We've trained in various different places. And we've just seen off camera now that I think out of all the percentages, back is always the one we end up going with. I don't know what. I train a lot about. People think I train every day. It's probably the most important in poor body parts. Yeah. That's why. That's why. But, uh, I didn't. Yeah, gone. Maybe last time I ever guess posed that as show. I have it with your show. I never did it again. I was a good tank. Yeah, I was in zinc. Yeah. I have to get some footage for. But what I didn't realize is this is his first time at the Dragon's Lair. So we just walk in an, an I'm a suit. Maybe he's been here before. And he's like, oh, this is cool. Oh my god. He's got me, Chris. Yeah, this is like Dragon's deal. Yeah, we we we custom hands that we do. I think he has customized, uh, you know, obviously being a, uh, a part of their own other national strength, which is predominantly what the gym is. We've got some cool, uh, unique pieces that are not anywhere else. And then the ones that we, we don't create a make, we've brought in cinnigestically to make the better and again, you know, all these small, the way I see things is like, like, like, portable, right? You can see somebody's in condition. But then when you really kind of, you know, react things that we can see the intricate details and ask what the gym is. Yeah. There's a lot of people have come back second through times and they've gone like, what did shit? I didn't realize you'd see that. Yeah. I'm going to turn the music on a bit. Another way to kind of get on kind of copyright commerce. As soon as I walk away, touch shit. Because calves are small, it's fuck right now too. Really small. Makes me feel good about my calves when I stand beside them. And then you know when you come over a time like that. What is that cut off me? What is that cut off me? How tall are you? 5-6. 5-6. Can I make myself six foot? No. Maybe you did work seven feet. No! There's no fucking way. One cent. One cent? Actually, no. I don't know actually. I'm pretty sure we all played with like 180 or 90, but actually, So I was going to do like a transformation to classic. I just get some fun hype around it. And then I realized then he would never make way. He was under 190. Yeah. And there's no way. I mean, I don't know what that is. Well, when I found out he was lower than 190. No, no, no. You could probably do 190, maybe. What would the name for me, shall we? What'd you go in now? I don't know. I have to be classic. Wait, limits. Don't fuck the phone. There's no fucking way. Just seen it. I clicked on it. I'm getting flex to move over the classic, physique. Mevers him in the 2024, I'll see you. Can I shoot my leg up? No, it's not legs left. It's not legs left. It's not legs left. It's not legs left. And people will see the NPC. 5, 6, 5, 7, 5, 7. That's NPC. So the tempels over there. 2015. I could do 180, fine. I could do 180, fine. Okay. I got the wrong one. Oh, no, we won't get too far ahead. I'll keep the hands close. Did they run badly? What, how do you post? What? You don't talk to classic shots? I have to do a few of that. I think you were hitting the DLB post. I thought it was your post, but. It's a good job. You're not coming here. Fine. I thought about it. I'm recording. You know, it's my heart. Because every now knows me. There'll be my same score for us. But all the... No, the D is one, no. I think that's a dream. What other score do you? It says I know. Yeah. It seems like I'm not. Two or three. I'll still have anything to be. I'll try to throw a tight flat. One, two, three. Good, good. Yes. Yes. You done. It's heavy. Yeah. Oh. Aw, yes sir.. Oh. Yeah, straight. Alright little one. stewardship.infection. Break. You touched your grip straight, if you please. I don't like that one, I don't know. I'm expecting this to come when you're grip, when you're going to. No, no. It looked a little bit. They look cool. Not a convenient. Whatever they know is kind of like, you know. When this happens, that's a pinch. Oh, pick it up. Yeah. So you're going to... Show it up, though. We're going to make it into a meme. Well, you're just watching, but you got so light, right now. Yeah. Yes. On bonds... No. Give me the scissors, I will listen now once more. Uh. Oh my God. Itpan- Make that. Use your own knife. Say. Okay. Go, take away your heads. I think all these are from rugby. You lost them all? Yeah, these are from these are my badges of honor. Well, scrappy. Well, scrappy. Well, scrappy. Scrappy. Who's more scrappy? Ireland's Welsh, it's got all of us. Oh, yeah. I should get a heavier one. I had a Wales win. Well, I don't know about that. But it's cool that it's the least drunkest when they have the fights. There. Because then you can remember who won. Welsh got, like, too much when you go on play rugby. It's a part of the game. The UNI will fight on the field. You knock my T-thed or tooth. I'm buying your fight. Kind of like the thing to do. And then, everything is like, you know, gentrified, shake hands. You go out to tell him, act like you're the club uniform on. And then you fight. You'll be fine. Yeah. It's, it's any rugby player that's watching this. Well, I don't think you're fine. Yep. That's what happens. You fight. Are you friends after the fight or no? No, no, no, no. You actually. Like, I might meet a local rival of some day I fought on month ago. And then you're kind of like, I didn't show that up until it's a course shoot. And then there's a big play on. And then, then days I enjoy the rugby days. Imagine bodybuilding was like that. Just get out today as well. Just keep the shit back to. So this is the problem. A lot of bodybuilders will talk shit. Fickened there's zero consequence. Yeah. And I can talk to society, not bodybuilders. Yeah. That's society. Society is well, but I think there's a lot of guys who will talk talk talk, talk shit online. But then, and this is the thing also, which I think you know this. There's a lot of people who have done a lot of shit talking. I picked up the call. I keep by having an away from social media. There's no drama. And all like, you know, this guy versus this guy or me versus that guy. I put more of my shit to back because I'm like, must these guys just go on a, don't want to do anything by talk. Yeah. And that doesn't say no. I'm fucking tough. It's just, that's my mentality. You know, there's only a couple of guys who, and said, stood in their soapbox and said, yeah, I did say that. And that's why I've got that respect. Yeah. And they got my respect for calling them out because again, it's not only the people that's fucking stupid, but I created a narrative. Fuck, I got you to be the way it is. Yeah. Fightin' is fun when you're young, but in your old, you got no capacity for stress like that. You gotta be as in, we don't know. Speak for yourself, Chris. This is, pedalless wiggle. Yep. Sorry, but I, oh, two. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You're just going to, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Slow stretch through the foot. Right. I can pull it. Yeah. Yeah. Put this in. Try to bite tight. Good. Good. Beautiful. Nice. Good job. I like dropping the machines, but... I think they got shit. You can no longer do it that shit unless you see a owner. All the owners guessed. Have you fit in the example for the onions? I'll be so fucking fucked, and I can do it. Nobody's looking. Okay. Good job. Good job. What's up, Anna? Good job. Good job, good job. Good. Where are we going? Good. Good job. Easy. You're going to take off because you want to show it. No, I wear tank tops anyway. Really? Yeah. Go ahead. Just in case. I don't know what it is. I wore. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I wore tank tops for my career. And I never feel off. She takes her film spicy. My wife's top of four to me is a Mac. I thought that. All right. So it's going to be a wrap on who we're getting with Mr. Flex Lewis. I was a good time seeing Flex. Wish I could come out here more. Especially kind of like Vegas. I only ever come out here for the old beer. But we have another day of franchisee, G and C meetings. What not? So we're going to head over there now. I don't think we're going to film the game. I can't even see that stuff. But stay tuned for raw. Being in G and C. Hopefully late July. August kind of time. Late is fall, but it should be by some end of summer. Drop in that super savage. We'll talk a little bit more about the product when it comes out. It's going to be exclusive to G and C. And yeah. If you're other in Vegas, be sure to stop by Dragon's Lair. Do a Nae podcast right now with some men himself. So people are sending out on them. Three of them when it's done. You guys can watch it on. Dragon's Lair. Flex is YouTube. So that's it. Thanks for watching. Peace. Bye.

=== FILE: My New Toilet ｜ Leg Workout [DrxkzWcoxjQ].txt ===

Alright so this is the guys repeat right here. This is the remote control for the toilet. Wow! Watch the toilet. You can see that. You can see that. And this day we have a time for children's show. So you can keep the seat key in for 10 to 10 sit down. You want something to know? It's got a bedding. You have to see sitting so that you can use it. But that little bit I'm working to do. Oh! You do about whole real nice. You have a female option to free between the kind of half. Or if you want to display your balls you can do that. What? What do you think about all? So there's even this is super weird. I was a little obsessed about that one. But they're the massage option. And you know what it did. But it moves the water. It's got up and down and the massage is... Oh! That's what I mean. I have to do that one shot. In this whole room, you just... For the toilet. Then I put a T-D-D-E-L-A-D-R. And I'll just spend half my life in here. For a minute. Where are you going? I'm worried about it. I'll be just shitting for two hours a day. I'll just do that. I'll just do that. I'll just do that. The mic on? What? Is up? YouTube. Welcome to the probably the first leg day in a while. Probably the first leg day I've done the wild too. So, still I'm even back in here. I'm going to push some weight still. So, do a little bit less volume, but we're going to be focusing on some tempo stuff. Like that stuff I did with Justin to give me some tempo stuff to follow up. So, we're going to be following that. Doing some cool shit. Trying to get huge legs. Trying to do all the fun stuff. I tried to run a mile the other day. A couple days. Didn't make it the full mile, but still good to get my heart rate up. I'm going to do like 10, 15 minutes. My ankles now are fucked up. Being 255 pounds trying to jog. It's not fun. So, I got some stability to work on. Who knows, maybe I'll be like Phil Heath in Generation Iron 2 or 1. Or 1. Or you see him running down the fucking Hollywood Hills in California. We all knew he didn't actually do run, but maybe I'll be a bodybuilder in Canron. Or I'll hurt myself in a week and never do it again. We'll see. But, I'm going to get big. Oh, I finally got on. Probably the number one podcast I would ever want to do. Podcast-wise, Joe Rogan. But probably the person I would love to meet the most. Jordan Peterson. That lady didn't get to meet him. But we did a podcast over Zoom, which was really fucking cool. I'm not ashamed to say I've been a huge fan of him for a long time. I read his book, I was going to do a lot of his shit. So, being able to hear his voice, speaking to me after listening to probably hours of his lecture than shit, was super cool. I know he gets to fly on the unit, but fuck those people. I've learned a lot from him. He's helped me a lot on my journey growing through all this bullshit. I'll just love his stuff. I've learned that I try and share with you guys. Some of it's inspired by him. So, to be able to speak with him. Talk about my experience of life and have him like elaborate on his boss on it. Talk about some of my mental stuff and then him just put it into the alcohol words in which he does. But super cool. So, that podcast. Maybe livens come to probably not, I don't know how long he takes him to put him out. But I'll be telling you guys when it's up, I think with the really fucking good podcast. Dude, as smart as hell, just listen to it in sight. Never gets old. So, that was truly an honor. Really awesome to do that. And yeah. So, stay tuned for that one. Pretty fucking pumped that I got to do that. Maybe if I'm cool enough, I'll do it again, not to get to meet him in person. I think it's gross. Good. Cut myself. Why? A little bit. Alright, I think we're warmed up. The year of warming up, I feel it. I don't know what to start with. I gotta check my phone. My arm's been all the way back and down. I let go, but my hands are, I think I'm stuck back there. Alright, I'm more fucking around. What are we supposed to do? Let's plot super set with leg curls. Pretty silly, Matt. We've front foot elevated splits blocks. Some hamstring curls. Start this bad boy off. Three balance right now. I'm not sure if I can get it out of my head. Matt, we're not training legs hard for a long time. You can bodyweight fucking gasses out my legs. That's a hot in here. I'm gonna have to get creative because they only have a fucking smith machine squat and cables. So, I think it might have a free bar too. You're fucking powerless to ready into the two weeks. I need to warm my hamstring more before I do this. The brand new machine theory's got a new squat rack at the last one of the shit. Someone has a little Nordic curl attachment, so trying it out today. Apparently this movement's fucking amazing for your knees. Strengthening the back of your hamstring up in your knee like that. Provent any knee injuries. I've had a lot of fucked up knee pain, so not this area. I don't know if there's other way harder on the ground. If there's ever done them on the ground, but he's a do-of-the-machine. He's been like, hold myself out, move a lot slower. I lost a lot of that, thanks. Oh shit. Like I heard quick. Goal I was doing three-second down, pause for one second, explode up, three-second down. Repeat. Just controlling the eccentric motion a little bit more. Got some bulkproof knees this year. No more crunching knees. You guys want to know the real secret? Well, I'm trying to protect my knees. It's supposed to go to Aspen today, but we've been moving for the last two weeks. I've been months really. I think we'll go by my house later today, and I'll show you the chaos we're in right now. But I'm going to Colorado on Monday now, so let's go today. I'm going to go snowboarding for like 12 days. It was going to be two weeks, but we've shortened the trip. Let me go down there, turning it to Sean White. So we've got to make sure I've both proof me through that. One of my favorite things to do outside of day-to-day life, snowboarding. Just peaceful and free on the mountain. I can't fucking waste the Earth out there, so. Priming my body now. The aesthetic make-y plates. I know how functional they are, but probably it's functional that I am, but they looked the I'm good. So I'm not going to make it post with them. They're drawing from pure metal, like yo, can you get me these? Next thing you know they're in my gym. So any calviner gonna be powerfully 405 by the end of the year. Good times. Whenever I take a lot of time off, how we find it's so interesting how your body's ability to adapt, not only to load, but just to stress, I guess. Change is so much. Like I just did like three sets over there, with some hands. My quads are like fatigue. And then I do like eight reps here and they're just like, lactic acid burning up in the entire floor. Not heavy, not even a load. Just literally moving that much. They're not used to it. So your body nervous system builds on ability to push longer and harder and stronger. How do you train it? Fascinating. I don't know. You just start off like a little bitch in the office and then by the end of it you can do fucking crazy, drop sets through. Super sets and not even feel tired. It's getting a bit of error. There's enough. I have no endurance in my life. Oh. Holy shit. That was really humbling. I'm not gonna lie. I keep joking around knowing how to shape it, but I didn't think I would that bad. I was trying to do a three second negative, three second and a centric, three second content trick. Motion to start. My feet low. Put my feet medium. Do slow down, hold for three seconds up, pull through three seconds up and then put my feet high. And just rep it out. I thought I could do way more weight than this. So it would be a warm up in there. It's been a bit close to getting half the set done. Oh fuck. Show us the belly. It's growing. Big girl. Women's bodybuilder in there. Hopefully not. Let me. I don't know if I'm the only one who remembers being in prep filling this fucking entire machine. Practically, I need a gym pin in this. Now, we're up in it for like 18 reps. Wow. It's that time. Nattie C-bumb though. Fucking full nattie C-bumb. I can beat me a lump of this year, nattie. They can do nattie division. I can't do that. God damn it. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I can probably do 135. I could probably do 135. I was fucking around over there fixing my tripod. I put 135 on the bar and did 25 reps. I was going to throw back with a 3 minute rest. I think I just got like 31 reps. I just got like 50 reps of anything. I don't even think I had the bar. I just didn't do body weight. Then, over 50 times, I lower back would be fried. So, it's going to take me a while to be able to complete the style of workout. But progress, something I move forward to. I like to speak shitty at things. I mean, I got a lot of room for improvement. So, moving on. This is hard to do. Alright, finish it up. I'm going to superset some calves and some abs. I'm trying to do leg raises. Like, toe touches to the bar. Just to really squeeze my whole abs and the fucking suck. I can do like eight reps and I'm tired. So, working on those sets of like 15 to 20 calves. Can I nice pump in the legs? No, we're done this workout. But I got to go eat. Got nine that time. Progress. I'm going to cramp before doing two sets. You ready? Not dropping as much again. Lets get ready. We're done, let's do a little walk. Now speak the kick out of the new home, cover the boxes. But they are very nice. I don't know. I have a home that's our home that we release. If you don't know. We've just been living in suitcase in roommates and now we're just us. Seven months we've been in boxes. It would be a prep, about the travel of Christmas, if Thanksgiving, lots of chaos. So grateful to finally be in a home, and this is the key to... I'll give you the other two or when it's actually clean in the box they're put away. So, you guys can check it out then. The best part of the whole house is a master bathroom. We're at the toilet room. You can show them that. The toilet room? Alright, so I'm sure the bathroom will show you the toilet room. The palace. Alright, so this is the master piece right here. This is the room control for the toilet room. I'm pouring you on here and then you're in the flush, but if you... It's probably blowing your nose in. I'm just going to flush from here. Once you get up, you can see that. And this thing has a temperature control. So you can keep the seat heated. So it can be sit down, nice and heated. It's got a bit of a day in it. And you have to be sitting so that you can use it. That little bathroom can do. You can do about whole real nice. You can control the pressure in the temperature of the water. And then you can turn it a little fan on. You can control the temperature in the pressure of the fan to drive yourself off. So you don't need any toilet paper. Even as a female option, it's freeing to clean the front half. Or if you want to tickle your balls and you can do that too. Or just clean your butt off. So, quite the library thing. You can control temperature pressure. This is the position of everything. Watch it, stop it. There's even this is super weird amount of water. It's a little sensitive about that one. But they're the massage option. And you know what it did. But it moves the water. It's got up and down. The massage is pretty sensitive. But I don't know if it might have to go down with my shot. So this one is a cool part of that. I don't know why you didn't do it or not. I do, but I'm talking about that as this whole room. You just pour the toilet. Then I put a T.D. up here. And I'll just spend half my life in the air. I'm pretty good. Very young. I'm worried about it. I'll be just shit for two hours a day. Probably six hours a day actually. Alright, so that's the beginning of the house. Go on. There was a girl. Fuck, it's got the camera at all the time. They're about to learn. But yeah, like I said, it's been a fucking chaotic getting to this point. This house was supposed to be done in July. And then it was August and it was September. Then it was in Olympia. And then it was pushed back back back back. And we've just been like inboxes in two cases. It's a whole time. So it feels good to finally be here. Still not done in the building. There's still here fine-tuning things. I've always been told if you try and build the house. It's gonna be fucking twice as long as you've ever expected. We didn't even build the house. We were just picking the finishing for someone to already built it. And then left it halfway through. So it is one of those super great things to be here. Super pumped for us to actually be able to unpack and come home. Because I've been traveling so much. I think it was the last two months, plus the first three months of the year. I'll be home like 25% of the time. 75% of the time I'm literally traveling on the road. We're Brazil, Tennessee, Dubai, Turkey, Canada. And we're going everywhere at the future. So I've been chaotic and when I come home. I don't have a home I've been coming to. I've been boxes. I've been barely having time to work out. I've been not even catching up on work stuff. And then be feeling behind and it's like on YouTube. And just lots going on. So China just keep my feet under me. China built the river and the chaos. I've always saw this quote that I connected with. That was like all successful people having the ability to survive in the chaos. Even as just when I'm practicing for right now. I'm giving myself no where to route and ground myself. I'm just learning to operate within all that. So, sometimes, exciting times. But that's really all that's gone in my right now. So I decided to do an aspect. That's going to be my break away. Come back. I'm packed to house. Travel a bunch more and get all this a year because it's not stopped. So, pretty sure you guys are watching. See you next time.

Train with Mr. Bob Walker on the well-verchating maybe arms. Just took the last three days off because we do blood work. I think I just said it's the last one. But if you're training too hard and intense before blood work, you can excuse your results. Like, creatin levels. You're different blood markers and all this different things. So, best to take time off. I did that. So, three days off going to the gym train arms and then later today we're doing a podcast. So, stay tuned. I don't open up till the end.

We're going to do the grand opening. Sure. Two. No. That's rude. That's my block now. Okay. It's not breathing. I just didn't fucking set my T. That's your record. So, low-winded. Alright.

And how long do you have to be on the field? Yeah. Well, let's do it. You better do it. I'll get a fucking shot. I'll dress with the gun on the ground. Bro, you should have one gun. I know. You got to be a mini dress to show up with that. You should do a high, like a high, wasted dress with a crop top. So you can show the belly top. We should give them a mini dress. We should give them a mini dress. We should give them a mini dress. We'll do it. Alright, see. We'll get a nice and made for you. Well, let's just hold that. You guys, I really don't want to look at it. I don't want to look at it. Come on. We're going to follow you now. No, I'm going to do that too. I'm going to wait till after you won't be able to subscribe. Imagine that. You're going to get his studs just blank. That would be so unfortunate. Yeah, jokes on you. Yeah, what's my life? I don't know what's going on. Come on. I'm going to shoot this. I might be the only two people who are working out actually seem to get chore. We're working out seem to get choreo. When you're in your health recovery phase, working out is a chore. Yeah, we're doing a plank. Well, yeah. We're joking or does that actually do a good nose joke? They call me old. Maybe. You proud of all of them. You're right at the terminology to me things. Like when you do a bunch of drugs, when you're tweaking, you should be like you can off free. Like 10 o'clock this morning when I took it and you guys didn't show up so 11 o'clock. You know? You don't know what about our current societies. That people do like, I feel like there's less of like a hardcore drug part in society. Reddance, so tweaking becomes a lot of like cute about taking like pre-workout. Or at the 4 East, if you want to use a bookbender and you need to sleep for a few nights in the tweaking. You have a few though? What? You have a few. That's a magic. Oh, yeah. It's a lot of time. You need to watch out. So like, you need to do something. Something like, you can just add or just like, almost like a peanut or a string or anything. You want to add a string or something? Yeah. So like, you still feel like you're sitting like that. That's so cool. Yeah. Yeah. That's not cool. You just say it. Did you just say it? Yeah. I'm down to do a like that with you, me and Brad, something. Feel like, but we should go to that barn, Jim. No AC. Just fucking devil. I mean, it's getting bad enough in here. Like, I feel like there's no air back there. It's like a fucking sauna. I can't keep. I can't keep. I can't keep. I can't keep. I can't keep. I can't keep. It's just, see, like, I took my shirt and I just were running in. It was like, that's that place, right? Yeah. But like once you get you, you feel fucking yours. I'm sure you have a great cocktail. That'd be a good video. This time, I got a little bit of that. You don't throw a lot of it on, man. Who's got it? You got it, Dad. You got it, Dad. You got it, Dad. You got it, Dad. You got it with destiny. Who's destiny? For a total of 20 rubbers. It's like a coin. So the date is destiny. Alright, you know what we do? Alright, so we made them to Fort Laudale, the Duna Podcasts. I don't know why I always pretend in these videos like you guys aren't going to know what I'm doing based off the thumbnail that I clearly can't know what I'm doing. But we're Duna Podcasts with another voice. And I'm honestly pretty fired up better. I watched them for a long time when I was young. I got their beauties, fellow Canadians, and they are killing the game, funny, work hard, play hard, and they kill them on the content game. So super pumped to do this, all of they want to be on the podcast. We're going to get out there and see how it goes. So, let's do it. I'm going to try a little bit more. Let's go around. Okay. Oh yeah, for misogging. This is a saga. So, don't we get them off from? Me, Kyle, Stanislaw. I won't try to draw them off from here. Misogging. Yeah, yeah. It's not that kind of thing. It's slow. Yeah, it's slow. What about me? Let's go on. Let's see. What do you want? Why this one? Don't tell me. I have to go on you. They meet you in this way too though. Tell me. You look like a man from the park. What about that part like I don't have? Oh shit. Yeah. See, are you a park? Yeah. It's like, what you want to do? It's the way you draw. That's cool. A lot of work in the water. Yeah. You think it's from Sawyer? Yeah. That's great. Yeah, we catch them from Sawyer. What was that part we were doing called? In the college. A lot of work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I was going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. What do you want to do? Right. I'll do it. Yeah. Let's go. I'm going to do it. Oh, I get a straight way. Wait, wait. You know, yeah. That's how we start this. Yeah. I'm going to do full-circuit. Yeah. Nice little shot. What do you want me? My jam. Can you see? I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. You're that side chest. Oh, yeah. Pretty little. Yeah. Down, like, people's like, how? What? What? What? What? What? Are you taking one? No. What? What? What about it? You're taking one? What about it? You're taking one? What about it? I'm in the origin. It was mainly business. I got it. But it was, yeah. It was like three years of your foolish shutdown. The Jim was the Jim with that. Yeah. And then you went to those extra. We were in the basement. I was having a problem. It would be a working on some kind of basement. It was like cable rat machine. So, like in some number of one. That's actually a crazy thing. Yeah. So, what? Yeah. Tell us about that. Like co-pets. And then, sure. For the students first, what do you have to do? That's for a little while I'm holding it. Oh, proper. I've got to be a swimmer. It's a bit of a... My fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking. Don't cut to the watch, I'm going to do this. My call to the sea fums for a couple of days. Jesus. We're a trash crack. est What are you doing? What are you doing? You've been listening to me for a while. Why do I let those things out of the picture? What does Brad have you? I do. What did you do when I like the Jim Pro-Secret? Brad have you anything? It's totally. You can't. But I mean, like the lifting thing? Like everything like that? I honestly think it's a beer, but probably all over the place. Why are you doing it on the streets? What? It's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very. How do you guys find that? I'm not here. It's like, probably the guy in the street. I don't like all the more things out of the way here. Bro, what are you talking about? I'm not going to say another. Just a second shit with Brad here. I thought I'd talk a lot about it. Wait, hold on. What about the old strong stand with the adrenaline, like Dick Holder, or something? Yes. He did talk about it. What's that? What's that? What do you think he did in fucking good? Alright, let's give me a wrap on today's video. Healthy blood work, check your blood work, be healthy, good work out with Vaughn. Arms are getting huge and a podcast with another voice. My first kind of podcast outside of the typical stream, or even content done with something outside of the fitness industry. And like I said, it was super cool and like an honor for me to do something like that because some of their people I've watched for a while from what I was young. And they're obviously super big, killing the game, doing a really cool shit in their space in the industry. Yeah, they're killing the game in all aspects. So it was an honor to be on the podcast thinking what's super well. Whenever it comes, that'll be posting on my Instagram, talking to me to whatever and giving you guys a link. So you guys can check it out. If I'm good conversation up there, so it was fun. But shout out to the North Boys, appreciate them having me on. And that's it. Thank you for watching. Catch you guys from next one.

=== FILE: OFF-SEASON BACK GROWTH ｜ COMING SOON [HVEF9eZGsk4].txt ===

We moved to the North Carolina today. Oh yeah, for us, so you guys have the menorah scale liner right now. I actually just got on a flight after the gym and flew to North Carolina. If you want to find me, come to the North Carolina. I know that. Old gym. North Carolina. To check me out. Come on. Come on, Chris. Hey, come on. You're on your way in. Two, four, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. What's that? Have some drinks or anything. Don't try it. Think you're going to find me. This is and now there's no less matter. Some fucking things, don't be so badly hurt. I think we might be locked up in the garage. Yeah, that's why I like the first song. Yeah, that's why I like the first song. Yeah, I think it was very good. Yeah, I fucking bad. I think they definitely, the first round we did with higher. Yeah, but it was better. So we should not even let it be. What is up? YouTube. I'm really happy I have to say that in my last video. I don't remember saying that. But today's the good old day. Just testing the new flavor of Bum Energy is being run soon. Secret out, it's Lebanon Live. Sprite fucking delicious, perfect little summer joint. It's like a refreshing, lemon lime, what more can you ask for? But we're testing the combination to the when you make it. You can go do whatever combination you want essentially. But certain flavors like citrus flavors actually taste better with higher carbonation. So we were testing different levels and I like the really high one. But everyone kind of agreed to almost fomped up in your mouth because it was too high. So we went to the middle ground. But they were all high options that was just the middle of the high options. So that's going to be running later this week. So hopefully in a few weeks you guys will have access to buy that new flavor. We're trying to come out with a new flavor every couple of months right now because we're new and everybody likes variety. So just kind of perfecting the game, fine tuning everything, correcting the combination of previous runs and the past that we are understanding better now as we learn. Because we always learn along the way because we just jump in head first. But that's what we're doing this morning. Also very excited. You got a first delivery of equipment into the gym. So with my head over there and show you guys what's going on there. Your muscle fitness is coming out and setting it up for me today. But help them me out. There's some sick pieces that are hard to find that we're building. Oh yeah, that's what's going on. We've got a little shoot going on today. The guys are going to be shooting everything. So busy day as usual. Sadly Calvin is going to be leaving us for four or five days. I'll be back Sunday. We'll be back Sunday. So like four days. But yeah. We're going to film when I back day today actually. I don't know if I'm going to back day today. Train gym, energy chains, life is good, chill and so yeah. Sit you for the video. See you guys soon. Alright. So here we are. First delivery. Guys, this came by with a truckload today. And already you want to build a good stuff that I'm very excited to use. This specific machine right here. What's about it is a lot of the basement. It's a lot of stuff. Fucking love. This is a roller of wire machine. It like forces you to actually like contract from your elbows. Rather than like a pectick where you hold it with your arm and you can cheat a bit. I got the OG during this. Not as below. And then you can try it. In addition, I'll change it to everything. I'm going to put a shirt from Actbox. A few punata pieces. My lantess. It'll be the old shit. New shit. All the above. So literally just building the fucking dream in here. And I am very, very fucking excited for this. Everyone's like dream to have their own gym. And I didn't think I'd get one because I didn't think I would ever want to run a gym. Because I knew a lot of hell went into it. You don't really make a lot of money for it. But I'm super grateful right now to be in the opportunity to build it for myself. And literally just like use it for content and prepping for it in Olympia. So I think this is going to be something that really like fucking puts me on a straight focus. Drive this here in Olympia. Someone here in have a good workout. The other day, we're 5, the power went out. Lighted throughout. And I went on their dream by myself in the dark. And I just had such a good workout. Because sometimes they just hate being around a lot of people. And super pumped for this. Also content can be a lot better because I'm just better at talking when they're not fucking 50 people around me. And a gym or a word about music, copyright and all that shit. So yeah, this is going to be a home of a lot of YouTube videos to come a lot of content to come. We're going to paint the wall, paint the roof, but flooring down, peer muscles, literally helping you all that. So I'll kind of like bring you guys along the journey of building at the gym. Should be done in a few weeks. Honestly, they're super quick. So super pumped, excited. Dream to come true. There's a lot of things I've wanted in my life, but fucking a gym is just one of those things where you come here. You shut off, you put everything away and just kill yourself in the gym. Have a mouth space now. Super pumped. The only thing I'm worried about is my neighbors getting mad at me when I'm blasting music. But it is what it is. Hopefully I'll be here 5 pm and I'll be gone. Or it's all just get mad at me. I'll be back. What? Can you hear you? And then I'll tune them out. This is the place. So yeah, when you go along building it, hopefully it doesn't seem. Maybe you need some fans in here because there's no fucking AC. It's going to be dripping sweat, hot, workouts, grandjeeze, fuck. That's what we do. So see you guys later. Gotta go work out. I'll see you guys in the gym. Alright, back day it is here at the old revive gym. How too busy right now? So hopefully it doesn't pick up and get crazy. Back day, let's be secret going on. I'm going to set off and say, I warmed up, Calvin showed up perfect timing. So I'm setting him out. You know. So okay. I teach him... Don't smear that. Come on. Just16, let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go. Come on. Go. Go. Come on. Go. don't. Go. Go. Go. Go. Don't. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. I want really heavy on the first set. Just show how to rip it down on the other side of the good and then control the negative as much as I could. Second set, drop the weight. I tried to make it so difficult. I get the same amount of reps so I pause the first like 5 reps from the squeeze and control it up and then rip the second half of the set. So I started to feel in pumps. My eyes already twitching. I don't know if you guys can ever see that but it's twitching every day. Probably telling the thing I fucking tanger the bait out and you never work out. But it's okay. I fucking hate this movement so much. Well you gotta get better at it. This movement took me too used to get good at it. Like really good. I took me like four months to get good enough at it. But, here we go. This is the biggest. Small, it's very valuable. I think it's exercise selection and growth. It was more so like training effectively my most connection in everything else. But 2018, 2020, the only set that really changed my back training, my back will up. So I've been loving it ever since. My theory is that if you're doing bento row, you put one play on each side at a time to two play. Have you set the warming up of the two sets of time on this? I can't believe it. Oh my god. I'm doing that much. If I hit two by way 205 pounds this year, I'm moved to open. Alright, finish it up as a workout. I'm going to put my hand grip, pull down the machine because sometimes I'm going to pull down bar breaks my wrists, work on the mobility. So I'm doing 10 times of superset. I've set up curls, flat pullovers, just going back and forth. 10 reps of it, so I die. Hopefully getting a hundred reps of each and then that's it. So, I'll go over by step to the inner back there. Call it a day. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. You know, health was, was it been the� decisions? I've been out of town for almost ten days. I'm starting to travel away every day. This is how I felt good. I see it in a very well. It was a perfect job. Good luck. Good luck. I've caught up in the town. I've been having a cut for myself. I've had a bunch of make a fit and I'm going to put one of them on me. I'm going to put them right now. I'm going to put them on the back. The lid is to the top of where. I had to put them on the foil on. I can't lose my mind. I put potatoes to the fucking the dream I have. Of course, I put them on the plate. Put potatoes in a bunch of biceps. About 240 grams of bice. About 250 grams of potatoes in there. It's in fish for late at night. I've also been eating tuna. I've got every other day. I'm going to have to give you a good day. I'm going to be eating a kelvin of back because actually eating a little different than I don't know what to do. I'm going to cut back and chicken a little bit. I'll get into that method a little bit. But making this kelvin of the ones you love are going to be. But I only have bice in the right thing now. I'm going to have a steak. What? That's right. I'm going to have steak. You could have steak. I'm going to eat this up in the evening. You moved to North Carolina today. We moved to the North Carolina today. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you guys that the North Carolina right now. I actually just got on flight after the gym and flew to North Carolina. So here we are. But they have any sketch up in North Carolina too, so I'll get done with it. If you want to find me come to the North Carolina mat. Hold the gym, North Carolina. Let's check me out. Oh hi. I don't know. There's my office. It's not that bad. But who did it to? Alright, that's going to be wrap on today's video. I think I'm going to start doing this thing. I didn't tell Calvinists, but I'm going to... I don't want to request. I really don't want all my calmness to be questioned. But I'm going to start going through comments and questions on YouTube or whatever. And I'm going to try and gather three questions. People ask me that and a lot of questions. And I'm going to answer them at the beginning of my YouTube videos just to involve the comments section and everything going forward. And when I don't know how to answer that, it's going to be how I'm going to answer it. So that's what I'm going to do from now on. That doesn't mean bombard me with questions. I'm just going to look for random ones and pull them up. I'm going to do three of the videos. I'm going to do Q&A every now and then. But I'm just going to add the little twist of somebody to video because I saw someone else do it. I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I did it, but it's a long demo. When I ran, I'm going to do it. But yeah, that's what's going on. Fucking strange. It's a fair fair. I cannot wait. But you know, that's the glorious days of a bodybuilder. I love eating with fish. I actually am enjoying my fish. Manifest that I enjoy it forever. Because once I eat something for a while, I stop liking it. But that being said, I got a shower. I'm fucking sweaty. Come to eating some fucking garlic film. I can't just put on a good spot. It's about the heavy that I can just. Yeah, I already stopped eating. I just had the chicken and the five bar. I've not escaped. Yeah, that was some creamy shit. According to the fact tomorrow, I'm pedcing it back tomorrow and I can't believe it tomorrow. So I've got like five days of freedom of videos. And then we're coming back through on afterwards. So stay tuned. Thank you for watching. Peace out.

I can feel like muscle fibers moving a little bit more than I would really want to. And when I like I know my body pretty well these are time in the past where I've like torn muscles. Deep in the prep some longer be a bitch and do lightweight. But I'm going to feel it. And I'm going to know. I'm not going to fucking drop it fire up these movements or I'm going to go really controlled and just fail like that and that's what I'm doing. So I'm still keeping the heavy weight controlling the weight. Some movement heavy ship but also understanding my body is more fragile right now because of the hydrated leaner.

Oh, that was like it. No, no, it's said he says it's all about the reps and sets. You never have the reps. Yeah, but he likes to do like eight ten reps even with a warm up set. Yeah, I'm like three.

This is the point of prep where I'm like, so I'm going to have you wait, but I'm trying not to kill myself. I'm a honey, honey, really trying to stress not to kill myself here.

Thats what we call a racing<|bn|> lamppuccero kidney. I am going to start the不le gotusil. Silence. Then. Thats the move. What's clean? Listen and set your breath by jumping out Pretty cool. We almost jumped with five plates. How's the gym remind you of? It has to be a bottle. 6-3 left. 7-5 finished combined with what Calvin said. So sure that's nick de Neda. 6-1-3 not a bottle. I think a hotty training. It's good. So that no high train my whole life at the end. So I always train like an open body for there. I'm training for the open as always. But it's training with someone like Hottie, mind's of training at the end. Someone who's strong isn't me. So they're actually doing the same way to stop more. We're the same way in front of us while I do that. So I really push it to you to be stronger. And not just be like a skinny bitch. Like, you know, it's like some people like to be. So it's been good training for some of the things. I know it really is how hard you push it. Oh, each train is fucking hard. You don't follow it, man. Or for the attention, he's strong. This is a big win. You know? Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. So you didn't understand what you said. Angle of this machine. This is an older, leg-trespassing. It has a very steep angle. So it's naturally much easier. It's like the same. It's like the same. The same. It's like the same. It's like the same. So you didn't understand what you said. The angle of this machine. This is an older leg-trespassing. It has a very steep angle. It's naturally much heavier than a regular leg-trespassing that has not such a steep angle. So therefore, when you start to fatigue, it ends up becoming just absolutely much much heavier than normal. Because you have a very steep angle. It's just a bit more gravity. There's more weight pushing down instead of on the machines. Yeah. Go just like crushing through. So it's the skinny bit's character. The anti-s skinny bit. That's right. That's right. That's good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Where's Andre? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Good to get Andre trading and how to. That's it. Yeah? That's it. You get nothing to say anything. First you make a bottoming of the legage again, I'm just saying now, just physically just call me a little baby. Kinding the cheeks. That's right. Just seeing, I don't even know the word. I'm not a skill-editoring this word yet. There it up. Yeah, about for sure, honey. Say, can you one more way? No. No. No, it's good. No, it's just making fun of you. That's good. Not so. Fine games. I need to go back to trading with other classic pretty competitors. Here you go. This is the last time I did just eat it, right? Was that the last time? Was that the last time I did just try to turn it up someone? Was there a risk? What's your head? Oh, it's in, yeah. What you're gonna say? What was the last time you trained with an open guy besides eating it? Besides eating? Yeah. Nick Walker in 2021. What was that? Right? Yeah, I chose Brett Wilkins. Go ahead. How was that? He was like, coming off of show. So it wasn't, he was like, he wasn't that full intensity, but he was so good. Turning it was in his leghawty, he's just fucking strong in the belly. He keeps going. So how did he just demoralize his leghawty? Yeah. I mean, he does that do sometimes. That's why I'm strong, I should like, be eating, training from like, party or whole life. You know, like, he was always talking like, he's strong. Yeah, so you hadn't tried to keep you. Yeah, I did, but keep up. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Woo. Good job. Good job. Good job. Yeah, look a lot. He sometimes. Guys on his shoulder come back. Get that? Look at that, let's go. Yeah, I think that listen, in job, mark my class. You know, I've got a shoe. I've got a shoe there. You know? Yeah, I've got a little book. She book? Book. Kickboxing. I want to see that, can you? I want you guys to want to make a bet that he's going to put two in your pounds on the fire and curl it. Shoulder pets sit on the back and walk across the gym. Yeah, I want to take that back. Dumb up. What do you dumb up? Get that, let's go. Ruff. RIP. I've literally put two to 25 and just put it over so I'm going to leave. You can do that to all five, I think.

=== FILE: OLYMPIA PREP BACK WORKOUT ｜ MENTAL UPDATE [H6lcZIW2UIA].txt ===

I don't want to do this in kelvin knows I don't want to film these videos and everything but I do think that maybe I'm like you know it I could be dead again, you know and then I'm gonna go beat that guy again and again until I don't want to and I just hope I have it in myself to know when it's time to hang it up in color quits Come on come on Chris come on you are You Those the Go to shoes. Yeah, you know you have 20 gradas shoes and we're at the same three every day because I'm in decisive and I like neutral colors. Oh You're driving sure You're going to What is up YouTube welcome to I guess our first real official episode of the prep series Should get real five and a half week out month and a half until the Olympia getting shredded get lean Get skinny try not to be skinny bitch but get skinny in the process. I'm not moving down here So I was back day today can be running you through a workout having run you through like a full all-abbit workout in a minute So we do that I mean you get a little update kind of my mindset going into Olympia afterwards It's the first kind of episode I guess the prep series where I'm at my motivation my lack of motivation With driving me right now that shall get it to the app of the workout But so then back day so trying to get a huge back certain lot pull downs I started these two sets over hand to set the under hand get my back warm ready to go and I Is Oh All right so same exercise just as we were with grip now. I try to push the width of the fire pulling down but I start over hand two sets like that and they'll do one feel set just to make sure I have the weight right under hand and the two more pull down and then we're going to move on to under hand grip rows. We're trying to focus on building that lower lorry now that we've been like done the year by back. It's a pop-on stage and I'm heading back to the little guy so do that after this but first two more sets here and that's it. All right first heavy row movement for the first grip row. This is only you over hand grip rows and I kind of have big rear delts area like that but my back lower back lower lat thickness so I'm trying to really lean forward and pull through that like Christmas tree so that when you see when you hit a back post and I like kind of Christmas tree first and then pull up to show that density back there. There's something honey told me to do right at the beginning. I'm trying to work the other in my august which my rows over to this and I also feel it's really good my feeling at this part of my back I don't normally feel even with like machines and everything. So I'll insert that like two plates once a 275 and then I got up to three plates that peeked strength so along with it I'm not going to weaker yet from cardio and dieting and everything it's like five weeks up so I'm going to try three plates if I still got it and try and get that back huge because why the fuck not. Almost miss the raster and diet. But in my at that point in prep I still have my strength when I'm in the set leading up to it and all day I'm so tired. This is literally worth all the mental getting back in head and even if you're feel tired no like out of it whatever fatigue I still have all that muscle and all that strength left like pushed through mentally. I'm sure that hard when you do just have to know if you're back at it now before the gym but I'm also just as strong as I would be going to get out of the right now so I can let it go to waste. All right next exercise another bed cover we're all going to do chest support of this time to get my lower back a little bit of break and make sure I'm really isolating my upper back this time so instead of elbows in tight under my grip pulling down low over hand grip chest support is pulling a little higher than my chest hit my kind of upper chat mid back just a different thing with my lower back fatigue right now so two main row move is it began to work out make sure I get like something strong how for row end and then once the more machines and keep doing it at The fire stretch. All right, next movement. The hammer strength machine that the lot like this. We don't have it. We're Jim's probably more likely to have that in this project. Bro, but I like doing this one arm at a time and I put my the same arm, the same leg that I'm really going to put that back. So I can get my hip out of the way and pull my elbow and low and tight. Again, hitting that full lot lower that. Very similar to if we do it in a dumbbell row. But in the machine, you can throw a little more weight on it. I'll talk it a little bit more. Protect your core. Waste a little bit when you're lazy like me. So wrapping up with this. Only sort of with the machine needs to put like fucking seven plates on towards the heavy. So I'm going to get to that. My cardio is the day to put plates on here and then see when you're else being hit. That's ripping my sore out of my body. That bench is just holding me back from fucking. It's being torn into the depths of hell. Worth it. So I'm going to show you another hero. But when you feel like when you're waiting for a machine, people take a fucking forever. But when you're using the machine, you're probably taking just a long. So my impatient ass is at the do the low row, which I normally finish with. And then simply do that switch over there, switch the higher up, do not pull over. And then call it a day. We'll be right on to the exact day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a success. That's how to do it with a bar instead of a rope today. The bar was already there and it was angled perfectly from my wrist to be set in neutral. So I thought, why the fuck not? I've been focusing a lot more on the cable pushing out and down. If you're pushing the hole time down and you're left, I'm pulling the bar into. You feel a lot deeper contraction in your last hole. I'm doing this. So finishing off with some deep black contractions and then hit some abs. Go home. Knees up the tail of the fish. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

=== FILE: OLYMPIA Q&A ｜ BUILDING A STRONG MINDSET [pvr947_fOmY].txt ===

Money for you, buddy. $50,000. Great success. Pulling up. Come on, come on, Chris! Come on, you're one in steel. Oh, total, total, total. Let's go, finish it off. What's that? What is up, guys? What is up, YouTube? I am going to be doing a Q&A today, focus solely on the work that I put up. I found a trick to if I put up with question boxes. They've just all over the place, but if I give you specified questions, you give me such a lumpy of focus. I get a lot better questions. At least kind of got a question, but you guys are still set up. But anyways, I'm going to get into this Q&A, I'm going to run through the questions I think are interesting, and they're all folks on the NAPSO. First question, did you change your sleep habit? I am very big on sleep, especially in practice. Sleep is so important for body-belinks, especially in practice. It's very important for all of us to be sure your body fat is still dropping. Also recovery, everything. I just am obsessed with it, especially in practice. My sleep habits change a lot. I started wearing these blue, light blocking glasses at night for a while. I try not to be on my phone at night, but my phone on airplane mode an hour before bed. I try to go to bed every night like 10 p.m., which is really early for me. I try to make sure that I'm at the same time every day, and I'm on the same stage. My schedule gets my circadian rhythm in a rhythm, and it makes my energy level more consistent, more reliable, so that I can do what I need to do all day. But sleep is fucking huge, and I think everyone should be able to get strict schedule to be consistent. When did you start to implement more cardio? I'm new week's out and duration. So ultimately you should do cardio all year, and I do a flight off some time to do it at least 20, 30 minutes or so a week, and then I'll start my prep out of about 16 weeks out, and slowly just ramps up as I eat it, so it started there, and then the longest is sat out with 45 minutes for like eight weeks, I just had 45 minutes at the morning, and I honeyed and wanted me to do one more than one session of 45 minutes, so we added another session later on, which was 30 minutes, so the most cardio you'd all prep, although it was last four weeks, was an hour and 15 minutes total, split up into 45 minutes the morning, 30 minutes it pulls work out. How do you say motivating knowing that you're already miles ahead? First of all, I don't know, or feel like I'm out of the head, and I'll try not to look myself to leave that. Second of all, I'm truly not focusing anymore on trying to be someone the last person I tried to be genuinely with Breon when he beat me, and I was like, okay, fuck, if I want anyone to be at the one when you look at me, I felt like I had to be Breon, but even then I should be focusing on beating myself. But now at the top, I have this probably impossible vision of my mind for physique that I want to see in pictures and on stage when I have that, then I'll be happy, but I probably want to forget that, but it's more of like a legacy than I really want to build right now, and an internal satisfaction of my previous self that I want to be, so better over myself every single year, something that I'm excited to be, so being miles ahead of people doesn't affect my motivation in any way, nothing to do with it, my goal there a lot more in Trittizik, of being my best self, and knowing how hard I worked in years past and being able to work harder than that this year. And you just grabbed what you felt right before going on stage. So, every year's a little bit different, and this was the first year where I was actually pretty just like calm, getting on stage. I was like backstage, it was in the morning, there was honey was there, and also there, Calvin was there, everyone was backstage, recording with their role, like chillin, so super like laid back and relaxed. And it was a bit of a battle in my mind with my torn bicep channel, like not focused on that, but also be there. But I felt this, like, last year I did too, but I just felt like the champs at the long stage of, like, you know, I've been here, I'm a veteran, bit on this one, be a stage, just go there and fuck shit up, and I just felt confident, and like I was ready to rock in the role. So, it was fun this year not having, like, kind of misdenerves a little bit, so it would be more nervous, I've still got them to do my routine until I ate through routine. But, you know, I was confident this year and it was just fun to get up there. I heard before the show, bodyability hydrates themselves, and when do they start? So, what I've learned in getting in better conditioning over the year and working harder in my prep is that the leaner and better shape you are, the less you need to dehydrate yourself, so to speak. So, you typically cut water and don't get to that, but you don't need to, like, a lot of people like, oh, I want to take a diet ready to come in and look better. If I cut water, then I'm going to look like I'm in shape. Like, if you're in shape, even drinking water all day, you're going to look like, and you're going to wake up every morning, just naturally dry because you pee throughout the night and you're not drinking water. The less body fat you have, the less water you go down to. But, with that being said, I cut water Friday afternoon. I reduced it. I think I had, like, a leader Friday afternoon for the rest of the day, so I wasn't, like, that thing. And then I had, like, a leader probably all Saturday before the, until after the night show. So, not like I have zero water, but I'm just, like, restricting it a little bit, but you only do it for, that was 36 hours. I was restricting it, but you're not cutting it fully. If you're in shape. So, nothing drastic at all. Children's question just a lie for you, but, said, do you think about competing in the 212 category one day? I don't think people understand that 240 pounds on stage. And 212 means you're 212 pounds or less. So, I would have to lose 28 pounds just to make it in that class. I would not look good in the 20 minutes. My first show ever, I was, like, 211. I don't think I'm going to be 212. So, no, not good to talk. What did you do the night before the show? The night before the show, typically, he ends competing and Melissa and Courtney will go watch the night show. And with he competing the night before. So, I'll be alone in the hotel room, just like, children. Last year, I made up my whole routine in an hour alone in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, and that's, I was just like, listening to my music playing that. But honestly, this year, I would just watch, I think watching Wolverine on this, I would just watch you. So, Max Ben, and I just try to be super late back. I'm not on Instagram. I'm not that mean to anything. I'm not even really trying to think too deeply about the show. I was trying to relax. You know, the work is done. I've enjoyed it. And I'm just kind of trying to get my mind out of things. I go to bed super early because I wake up at 5 a.m. every day. I'll be showed it. And I'm just trying to go to bed. But I also used to have like a burger and fries and I before shows. I'm like really few love. But it's really inconsistent with everybody that, typically, I just have a decent size meal this year. I think I just had like 400 grams of rice and 100 grams of steak, full of meat milk, with delicious. But eat that with the better early and have a good bat. But that's a great day for the show. How did you handle it when things weren't going exactly how you wanted to? I think this is that thing that we're going to get to my bicep. And this is something I spoke about in the video my history. And but it was just a battle that I had to go through. And I had to kind of, I've been through a lot of shit going into a little bit. And I just had to kind of remember like the mindset of established how many times I've done this before and how capable I am to take things that are coming into my life and build that focus on what's my control. What's on my control. I was not in my control of what I could do my bicep. I couldn't heal it. I couldn't bring the information down. I can fix it. I didn't even know what was wrong. So I got the point. But what was in my control? But to keep doing, follow in the plan. Get on stage with confidence. Give us some champion mindset and just be the best I could be out there. And that's all my focus with my focus with them. Join the moment and control what I can control. And that's all you can do in life. And when you can kind of take a step back, you feel like anxious, stress, whatever you can just sit in that. Don't try and deny it. Don't try and bury it. Just feel it for a moment if you have a tail. I've just anxious, stress, but what's going on right now? Why am I stressing, but I can even do anything about it. I've torn by a separate now. So like, what can you do right now and do that? And I just kind of have to walk myself through that. Feel the stress, not deny it, just move forward. Approximately how many hours you trained per day. So peak time in the gym, high-end amount of time out of the gym was 45 minutes of cardio, plus 30 minutes of cardio and hour and 15 minutes, but it's too loud. We'll work out. So three hours and 15 minutes of cardio plus training was the most I probably ever did. In the past I've trained for like three hours, but I was bullshitting talking with my friends, the back and the college. But high-est prep was three hours, 15 minutes in the gym. Or do you know? You have self-doubt before stage day, mentally how do you deal with negative thoughts? So I don't really have self-doubt in my ability to win. I think I just put a really high amount of pressure on myself and it increases everything that you're. You can almost see my demeanaged shift of like a little tense because I'm like fuck, this is like pressure on me and then immediately after it would be like, I'm like my shoulder's dropped a little bit. I'm a little bit relax. And that's more stuff like that that I have in myself, like I said, it's just like that pressure of like just like, like fuck ass and perfect fuck ass to do this. I have to be expecting this. And the only way I can deal with that is to try and remove myself from that and take a step back and be like, what are you fucking stressed about right now? Like this isn't helping where you're trying to go right now. And like in my heart I believe that I can win. I have the ability to be, I will never say I'm going to win. I've already won. I won't speak like that because I know that I have no control with the future. I just know I have control in what I know I can do. And I believe in myself to win. So when I kind of remember that that's already inside me and I already done this four times now. I kind of can tell myself relax a little bit. But usually when you get caught up in those feelings of doubt if you're having them or pressure or stress, all it, you just need to do is just like, look at them as like you're like an outside perspective looking down yourself or moving yourself from a little bit and just like realize that's just fucking thoughts in your brain. So it should look good. Should there be a limit on competitors at the Olympia? 1590 in classic was a lot dot dot dot. I agree with it. I think there should be a cap amount of people 15 to 20 people that you wouldn't be a max. And the Macym Harsh, the cutting 40 people out, but I also think the 40 people will eventually make it to the Olympia and when they do, it'll be a lot more rewarding. The harder it is to achieve something, the more rewarding the more prestigious it is. And you'll look at the most prestigious show in the world. So I think the less people that go to it, the even more procedural attitude. Now I still have to pay for the people coming out. So I'm visiting why I think it would help the Olympia and it would add to the prestigious show. And it would be a lot easier time-wise, so rather. If they were going on, so I'm midnight one a.m. a few for a few parts of the show. And that's because there's so many people on the stage. So there's a lot of things that they'll help them out with most people. But there's a lot of shows in the year, so I don't really know how they'd manage that. It's your favorite pose. This is a dab to down. My favorite pose, when I was young, I had a tight waist. And big ass lats with the front-lats, scrims. So one of my favorite poses sadly is not a mandatory pose. But I always hit it my free posing. My favorite pose is here with the F1 side chest, which is cool because I used to be kind of thin from the side, but as I've got more muscle mass, from the side, I have a ham-through job and a little bit thicker chest. And it's hard to look big from the side and your tall. But now that I do, side chest and I do the pose. During prep, you set short term goals in conjunction to the Olympia, or do you see some more narrow focus? I definitely do both. I have a narrow focus where I know at the end of the day, my ultimate driving factor is winning the Olympia, like a huge, intrinsic motivation in terms of what I'm having in bad day or shitty day. Overall, I know I'm still fucking good at doing whatever I have to do. But with that being said, I also do have short term goals within the literal day, where I wake up and am I only thought is to wake up and get the breakfast sometimes. So it's a car right, what do I do? I gotta get through a car to your right now, and then I get to your breakfast. And then that's my only focus. I'm not like fuck ass, I do cardio for six, seven, eight, nine more weeks. I'm not thinking about how much we know we think I do cardio, I'm thinking about my one cardio session, and that's it. I'm thinking about getting my next meal, eating this meal, getting this workout done. At the end when I'm exhausted and I have to just do legs later in the day, I'm like, okay, just do legs later in the day. My only focus, and the short term goals kind of keep me going. I also have some goals, like, oh, I want to get under 250 by like four weeks at it, and they want to be under 250 pounds. And then I'm kind of pushing towards that, and I get there and it's like, all right, now I want to make weight by a weekend. And there's little things, but definitely think those help you keep on track, and kind of stay driven and focus on something when, like a six-week prep, you kind of see matter each other, so you can. In prep, how important is it to surround yourself with positive people? I think the higher you get higher level, you get anything in life, the people around you are fucking so important, and it's so hard to even notice because they sit pace at your side of the crucial role. But this year, especially, I think one of the things I appreciate and value to most of was the circle of people I had around me. It literally felt like a fucking army of people came to help support me, and it was just like, I can't expect how much it helped. It took my mind off having to think of things. Calvin's got the camera, carries his content, and just like kind of sat in me there. Honies fucking taking on all the stress telling me if they do. According to the signal, I was stressed kicking everything. Maddie's been my body, you know what I'm fucking getting everyone's tickets. I'm taking a plane, I'm taking a picture, we gotta go everywhere. It's security at the Olympia, walking me through, so I can get through to the tactic. And there were just so many little things that people that came together that helped me, just like, not have to even think about anything other than competing. And just that helped so much. And also just a thought of not having someone bitching about it. I was a fucking child, I was a little baby, everyone's in care of me, and no one bitch about it, and normally, and I do feel guilty about that stuff, but no one made me feel more guilty than I needed to for it. So people surrounding yourself as a person, people as a fucking everything. If you're trying to be the best in the world, there's something, you have some negative people in your fucking faith. You're going to cut them the fuck out, because they're only going to bring you down, and you can't have that kind of energy. Unless you want to be second. Or fourth or fifth, but, you know, I have my third look trying to wait, so people will get me. What did you do in off days before the Olympia? So at the beginning of prep, off days I would always try to come into the office, come in and work, and just like, distract myself for the longest part of the day. And then I'd go home, now it's sauna, hold up, go to bed, separately, and just distract myself. By the end, I was usually at the even drive all the way out here, for the warehouse, so I was gaming for a little bit. I certainly got a war ragnar off, which I didn't finish, and now I probably never will, because I'm not a prep at the end of the game. But I was gaming a little bit. I would sauna, hold up every single day off. I used to do that a lot more, but then I started over doing it. In my off day, it's drinking, it'll be a prep. I would do cardio, go grocery store if I had to, and even the kill time really, but this year, I was at a peaceful state, but I was also really fucking tired. And I think I could have literally laid down on my couch and stared at the wall for like two hours, and been like good, because my brain was so dead. And I almost put you in a meditative state, because you're so little, tellin' tired, so just kinda chill out. You get called automatically every year at the Olympia, or you have to take tests. This is a qualifying question. So those that don't know, when you win the Olympia, your swallfight for life. So I never have to do a show ever. I could at 80 years old come back and do the Olympia, if I really wanted to, grant the C-bomb and the Olympia. But others in that, you have to win a show to qualify, or be top three, yeah, I think. So I think top three, recall all of the fights for one year, and then everyone else has to go win a show. So say you go to the New York crowd, Arnold Pro, whatever you win that, you get to go there, that year. So everybody about me, I guess, has to recall of that. Was it a difficult adjustment transitioning into FSD7 training? So I don't think people understand, but honey does FSD7 created FSD7, but he's not all he does. I don't think barely even used it. He used it a little bit at the beginning, and I think in my last season, we'll utilize a little bit more volume, so I don't have to do it in a shy way. You can't enter myself, especially now that I have enough muscle mass. But throughout prep, we use it a few times when I had an unslued in me, but for the most part, he was training adapted, or just a very similar to how I trained. It was keeping things heavy, kind of volume at a consistent pace, and just kind of moving weight and good form really. So the biggest thing he changed was that it's pieces of my form and my tempo, so I can kind of rush things a little bit, and so I'm going to have my tempo really helped me a lot this year. Other than that, we weren't really doing a whole lot of FSD7, so it wasn't a big transition, and when I added it in, I'm used to doing a lot of volume in 10 to 5 years. So for me, it was nothing. Money to you. 50,000 dollars for winning, well yeah. What I got. Which was the most important part to you. Diet mindset for training. So I think this is interesting because when I started competing, I think diet, I thought diet was the most important part. I would like diet, the the only change I made that I made all the change. And then when diet was down, I realized that there was so much more untapped potential into my training, and when I really understood how to train effectively, rest properly, train to failure, and balance full intensity with resting, and actually proper training, like people don't understand what the fuck that is, and how intense it can be. I've my physical skyrocketed once again in a one-two new level, and then when I won the Olympia, and the diet in training was kind of down, the hardest part in the most important part that I had to learn with my mindset. I had to learn how to keep myself motivated, I learned how to handle the pressure, and how to avoid the critics, even the ball the positive bullshit that I hear, not letting that get to my head. I took kind of a doubt my mindset to keep myself motivated and just to put into the other champion and kind of come back back. People don't understand the pressure it takes to win back to back to back to back to back to title. Normally people climb up, reach a critical success, and then follow up because it's hard to hold it. So I would say throughout my career, they've been important, but as it's the most recently because of diet and training, they've already been very good, and I'm still working on it, but mindset has been a huge focus of mine. You kind of a priority on increasing. Whether you're training affected while you were a couple days out from the show, fuck yes. My training starting at like three weeks out started to kind of really decline, and by a week out, I was so depleted, so hungry, so tired. I was literally just dragging ass against the gym. I literally didn't want to work out. I look forward to rest days, which is so rare for me, and literally just wanted to rest because I don't know the gym was so difficult. And of course it was affected then. My body just doesn't have the energy, I don't have the glycogen source, I don't have the strength, or anything to really push the girl work out. So the last week was very affected very weak. You guys saw the show, they video with her peak week videos. I was just like, dieting in the gym, so, just one of this. Why don't you participate in the Arnold Classic? So, as I said, because I won the Olympic, I qualify for life, and I think that puts me in a huge advantage, because I can then take three months off to really give my body a break, recover and relax, and then I can get into my ass, even slowly, ease into it, and make the changes and growth that I need to, and then I can set prep, and I don't have to worry about other shows in between. And that allows me to give me an advantage, because I get more time in the year and between shows. Arnold Classic is always six months, until the Olympic is six months, post Olympia, you show it every six months, so that would literally give me a month to recover, a month off season, and then I'd be into a three month prep, and I would just be like, kind of in that cycle super quick, with no downtime, and I really want my body to stay young, rested and youthful, because I don't want to start to look old, and tired, and beat up, and injured on stage. All I want to do is win Olympia, so that's the legacy of the show in the middle of the year. So, Arnold is not my priority. How does it feel when it's only you and the other person standing in your way of being four times Mr Olympia? That's funny, I never, I read in that question, never thought of someone standing in my way of winning Olympia. When we're in that top two, I'm just thinking about, I'm just thinking about getting the metal around my neck and home that trophy. But in the moment of waiting there, some of my fucking favorite moments of my entire life is standing. All the Olympia stage here in Bob Chickerrell is always kind of leading up to that point. I can see, often see my family this year, it was a stage I can see them, but I could see honey down there just looking at me, like, you've been talking about this man. And just like, the world just kind of blocks out, go silent, and you're in this like calm, extremely focused, just like present moment, and just very present with the best way to explain it. And it's just, it's hard to explain what it feels like unless you're there, but it's just like a peaceful, blessed. If you can imagine what it feels like to have been for a second, that's kind of what I would say it feels like. So it's definitely a beautiful moment to moment they cherish forever. And it's just feeling I have even before they have been announced so whenever, just like, all this work you put in, everything you did it you brought here, you're fucking did it. We'll take that pressure and that stress off you for a moment and just like enjoy this moment right here. So it's a very peaceful state and something that I love and experience every year. So yeah, the good time. How do you explain it, words of? Alright, that's gonna be wrap on this Olympia Focus Q&A. If you'd like to video, please like the video, remember to subscribe.

=== FILE: OLYMPIA SHOWDAY FINALE ｜ WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A CHAMPION [Y8dbYvxPmv4].txt ===

He's got a piece of it. It comes off. There's your cover boards. Have won their six NBA championship and it's their second three-peep. I hope you have won this award before but somehow I have the feeling that this one is more special than all of them. There were a lot of times during the course of the season that people doubted the Chicago Bulls. The world's doubted that you'd be able to come back and pull this off. Even during this final series here, people doubted you. How did you guys stay so confident? This team is one and we never let anybody gave it. You know, we believe that and we kept coming forward. All right, I've asked everybody if they're all going to come around and try to do this again. One more time? I would love for that to happen. I think that something's going to have to be determined over summer. I've been in the $75,000 check and presented to these second place finisher in the 2003 Olympia. Jay-Color! I mean, some people don't like doubted me and then think I'd come back. But I get my faith in God. This is not an individual for you. You take the team, the team I got, the best team in the world. And that's why I'm the best in the world. And y'all know that I couldn't do this without y'all. And hey, we're going to do this until God's in the same place as the move on. They do something else for him. So, thank y'all. I'm just so thankful because when I started polybuilding, I had no idea that I would be standing on this stage one day. When an semester limp is, then alone, being seven-time champion. And my ability taught me how to be strong mentally, physically, and emotionally through all my challenges. And I would just tell myself, what was that or more round? Just give it everything you got so you could put yourself in the best position to win. And that's all we can do in life, people. Sometimes life's been a serving of some curved walls, but I challenge you. Just never want to be the step in that matters box and take a damn swing. Just take a swing. And check once again, second place for the check for $10,000. The Olivia Silver Mallow, to our right of the season. Real handsley. Wow! Wow! All right, here we go. New! I was gonna solve the problem.

And it was when him and Corey were in the bathroom. He was crying and lost hope himself and felt like he was lost. And I could just recall. I could just recall. I could not go back. I could do that. When the bathroom cried all by myself. Crying myself to sleep. Like in this very old bed. It's just going the fact that like how I've lost hope. I've felt like I wanted to give up and just never quit that he explained. Never quit with my explanation. Just kind of touch bases together. Just kind of like, do you got to meet this guy?

All right. Thank you, president. Yeah. Guys, don't go too far. We're gonna get some pictures, please. But it's really cool to see each other gradually. One another. On this. Years worth of hard work. Sacrifice. Yep. That's totally all right. Thank you, gentlemen. And they just want to see that. They want to see you consistently as your best. Sometimes. All right. Thank you guys. You're pretty sure. But Chris really brought it in and shout out to Honey Rambod as new coach. Wow. Right. I just got quite a group here at this point. Yeah. He's got a busy, he had a busy weekend. We actually ate last night together. He was giving me the run down on the game plan. Can't share that all with you yet. But yeah, he wasn't getting any sleep last night. He did not sleep last night because he had to make sure that Chris gets up at five A.M. every morning to get this routine. It's just gentleman in the front row would say. Yeah, but I can't. Can't understand. Four time Olympia champion Chris. Four times. How's it feel? Feels damn good. He's again hard to explain to me completely honest. It feels really beautiful being up here again. And I mean, I felt so good to be pushed by these guys. There was 59 of us on stage. So around of a plush, really amazing competitors and class with each. This division is so exciting to be a part of. And I'm so grateful to be here and be at the top of it this year. They really push me to be my best. And I'm really grateful for that. And you know, it's been a beautiful year for me to say the least. There's been a lot of talk of my retirement for whatever reason. Not retiring. Don't worry, guys. I'm not going away. I'm here. I fuck love what I'm doing. But I think it's really kind of beautiful that people thought that because I think it shows that I'm learning to really enjoy the moment in the journey of your president. It's because a lot of people don't have the opportunity to kind of enjoy the moments that they look back and realize what they just went through. And they were like, wow, that was like, I wish I'd been a little more present and enjoyed that a little bit more. And I think the fact people think I'm done is because I'm actually here enjoying it now. And it's a beautiful thing. I met a friend of mine that comes in here. This summer in June. And he had a cancer and he was 18 years old. He was a battling for the third time. And he told me something that you don't have to be dying to start living. And he was 19 years old to cancer the third time. And the most present, grateful man I had ever met in my life. And I wore his bracelet up until I got my tan every single day. He wrote this prepped and I think he had him. And while he taught me and it was one of those beautiful things. And he sadly passed a month after that we had taught me that lessons. But he listened to it with me forever and that's something that I want to pass on to everyone. And just enjoying the moment being present. Love your family. Just like, see here, soak it all in. And I had a moment this morning, two hours on stage and honey comes up to me. He's like, soak this in. These moments come once a year. And I'm so proud. You know what I was like? You're so right. Like he's moments are so grand. They're so beautiful. So I'm just trying to enjoy everything I wanted them. I'm so grateful. There's so many of you guys who love me. That my support team is so big. My fiance now who's here who loved me. I love you. I love you, Courtney. My parents are here. My boy Maddie Calvin was me through absolutely everything. Ian who showed us the road of how to get here. And honey who took me on it. Being in this prep is my new coach. I can't thank you enough. You're crazy. But I love you. You put me through it. And it all paid off. Thank you so much for everything you've done for me. I'm so grateful. And the manians, wine burger, chick wood, the Olympia Dan, everyone. Such a beautiful stage. Such a beautiful show. This weekend. I'm so grateful to be here and be a part of it. Come back next year for number five. I'm ready to rock it. I love you guys. I love you guys so much. I can't wait to be back here next year. We'll do it all again. Chris, you're not the one to class act my friend. Congratulations. Four-time Olympia Champion. Seabomb in the house. Alright, and speaking of great moments, we enjoyed you.

I said a little bit ago. You don't have to know you're dying to start living. And that was a, I would be one take away for like anybody that's listening. And people always tell me like, Would you've always wanted change? Like not having cancer? Like would you restart your life? I was like, no. I never do it because I wouldn't be. Personally without cancer. Like I always tell people to like having cancer is like the best thing that's could have happened to me. Because it made me who I am today. Nope. And it got me to wear a mat today. Every time I've got cancer, I'm always saving somebody else from getting it. That's just who I am. It's crazy. Yeah.

=== FILE: OLYMPIA WEIGH INS ｜ LATE NIGHT HOTEL WORKOUT [Scdh8E0LXkQ].txt ===

This is too. It's crazy. It's good. I'm 30, I'm 30. Can't believe it. You're so good. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not in the press, are I going to do it? Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on. Come on. We come, I'll let you in, Chris. Let's go, Chris. You're done. Sorry, I'll get you. I'll get you one. One. Yeah. Push it, Sharon's going to roll with? Yeah. Yep. These are all the secrets. One potato? It's one potato. Every 27 minutes. Nice. Put a pound of ball over there. There you go. Set. Do you have to tell secrets? I think the potato is 40 different ways. Just to keep up the diversity. So that Mr. Bumsat can stay bougie. Boosie. Anyways, what is up YouTube? Mustache is a full effect. Wings are in... 3 hours. Probably 4 hours. It's been a long time since I've been in interest in day. We woke up under 240. And it's just been about keeping me there all day. So lower my water, lower my sodium, and literally tracking everything that's going in my body from the time to the gram, so the ounces to the water. Everything that's going in me and then every time I eat a drink. I take off all my clothes, I step on the scale. And then we see that I'll give you a little more. Can you drink a little more? Which is balancing that out pretty much. I'm just being a wizard right now. And it's bouncing around. And the corn is been a chef all day. Cookin' steak, salmon, rice, fish, potatoes, anything you can imagine. Right now we saw some different ways. We wasted out when we see which one sucks the most liquid out of it. So we're kind of a bunch of bored to the other part. But the more cars I can hear right now with some minimal amount of liquid, the better, so we're just trying to drive this shit out of it. That an air fryer would be amazing, but I did not get an air fryer during the next time we will get an air fryer because the air fryer is a little bit of a best. But we're three hours away right now. If you don't pretty good, I've literally haven't left the hotel room. I've been like sleeping, shaped my beard, sleeping, eating, kind of stretching, moving around, trying to make sure that I'm not too stagnant with the food in me. So that I can actually move through and have a good poop in everything. So yeah, it's pretty much what's been going on all day. And we're going to keep doing this to the APM. Make way. Eat some food. We're going to have a late night workout. So after in the hotel, I had some biceps, alarms, just whatever I've been finishing up we need to do, and then the more I'll be getting. So, let's see. Alright, that was an underning shit tomorrow. So, right? But you're not doing shit tomorrow. I got a 10 press conference, maybe another 10. Oh, sorry, that's for... I think meat and meat, 10. A lot of you go on the long run. Yeah, tomorrow's a very, very loaded day. A lot of the meat and meat are so difficult. The long day in the meat grid at like 9pm, and you're just like fully depleted. So, luckily you have an extra need to rest. Yeah. I've opened up like swollen after standing there for three out of meeting people. And like, people who are mad at you, if you leave it like 10 o'clock, I'm like, I had a complete year here to watch me look good, you know? But, I'll part of the game. Yeah, it's hard to come up with these because I spent too much time at the main grid. That's why I had a lot of it. Right? Yeah, see you later. See you later. Also, it also is for the appetito. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Sounds good. I'll show you a few little things. You water it after too. Which you're food? Yeah, every bag, like every... Just bring the, you know, where you're going to water. I'm going to bring a bag in a bottle, a smaller bottle. Imagine the water, you know? Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me have you in. Yeah. That was going out yesterday. How do you get that? That was going out yesterday. How do you get that? That was going out yesterday. You felt a lot. It was pretty good to show out at the moment. Yeah. Oh, that was good. What? What? Here. A little lower. There. I'll pick you up. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm ruined that. Good job, Eddie. It's 6-2. It's so hard. It's so hard. It's so hard. You could have found it. My life was pretty scared to do that. You're going to pick me up like, you're going to have done this recently. That was perfect. Now we're going to make an extra 10 pounds. Not actually, but I'll be 6-1. In a half. Alright, so we are officially 30 minutes out. 20 minutes out of weigh-ins. So walking over to play in Hollywood now is going to find the ballroom on the way-ins. I think there's a meeting to 12. I want you to be able to form yourself a while, but I'm currently like pound under 240 on my scale. Hopefully there's a scale that's similar. On you and check their scale earlier just to make sure it was close to ours. And you said it was pretty much right on. Mine was a little bit heavier. So we're going to head over there, weight it out. You've got a beautiful meal in the bag ready to go for a while. And just stay put your potato. Then late night workout. It's good to bed. How do we get that? This is it.

Hello athletes and fans of bodybuilding Terrikel Gindy with the Mr. Olympia. Three-time classic physique, Mr. Olympia champion, Christopher Bumstead, aka Ceebum. Chris. Now, while back you said to me, the most relevant Olympia for me was the second one. I felt like those the most relevant. It had a lot of importance to me. But if you win the fourth one, that's a dynasty. That's you cementing your name saying, hey, I am the one who put a statement on that category. How do you feel? I mean, I'll tell you how I feel after it. Don't tell me that you don't tell me that. But like I said, 2018 was special memory for me because I went through. But each one had its own beautiful moments to it. It'd be great for everything. A lot of me. Now I'm just excited. It's journey so far. It's been so good this year. And I feel great. I'm ready to bring my best luck in it. Maybe it'll be my favorite one yet. I'll never know. So obviously, working with Hany Ramon, he's a great coach. He's got many Mr. Olympus on his camp. Tell me a little bit about this modification. It's a new coach. Did you feel like it was an easy transition? I think it would be easy transition. To be coached for me, Bahá'í, when it's in the street for a year. He's been with champions for years. You know what that takes meant like this. And I think it's what we've done a pretty impressive because you've got like a lot of the name ropes don't fix it. But the champion is a better every single game. We've got to get better and better that I'm going up against. We had to bring my level, might just get to the next level. I believe we did just that so. Should show up. Chris Bumstad, he is one of the greatest competitors we have now days. And every year he continues to get better. My name is Terakil Gendu with the superstar C-Bum. We'll see you on stage. Good job.

And he pushed the thick heart on my head. Like down. All my hair down. Oh my god. I tried to make my hair puffy. Didn't work. He just pushed it down. He said, oh, you're almost sixty. I'm like, my sixty. Or they're like, six, one and a half. I'm like, oh, I need it. So I was 237.8, which means I have two point two pounds to play with. I'm never in the evening drink until I start. I think I could put on four or five pounds. Thanks, too. So make it. But for now, to the ease. Arms. Let's do it. All right. So late. Very late right now to go 11. 20 almost 130. And in the gym, hitting some late minibisep's last minibisep. And it's a great night. So tired. Finish wayins, made way. A little bit of food. A little bit more water. Just kind of re-aduring myself. And it's supposed to be my final workout today. But the way it took way longer because of sixty people in classically serious health. Took a minute to get out of there. It's probably hardly any workout. Tomorrow I rest. Got a bunch of stuff going on today. After I rest on the two days of the rest between. So we're just finishing out this final little workout. The last weight lifting workout. It's a beautiful hotel gym. This is great on me. Awesome great music. I'm trying to just get through this. Go get some food. Put a bed up. I'm going to bed at like 9.30. So it's like 11.30 right now. It's the latest health. I don't want to be here. But we're going to wrap it up. I don't work out of the year. Then it's all food from here. So it's got to get us over with. Awesome. Really good. Awesome. Really good. Really good. Really good. It's good. It's great. You're good looking. Yeah. Yeah. Not that didn't be for this workout. Just trying to get through it. Push it hard. They did a lot. Few workouts. Some of my biceps are being neglected. Just finished this shit off-struck. It's late. I'm tired. Ready for bed. What? I mean barely, but feel it. All right. Yeah. But I'm going to come up soon. Where are you right now? You're going to head in the bathroom right here. All right. So we wrapped that up pretty half as a workout. But I honestly felt it marms a little bit and how hard I've been pushing. It's all I really need. I'm not trying to like fatigue and beat up my muscle right now so that they get hurt. I can't get pumped without too sore. So my mean being tired, it gets helped out. Turned out your shit iron was there. Had to even know they were going to be here. They felt some clips too. If you saw them in the background, another camera. But that was. But the wrap on today, Wednesday tomorrow's the big busy day of running around a whole bunch and making me tired. And it's automatic. They made weight. I get to eat some food. It's beautiful. It's really fucking lit right now. So I'm going to shower, eat, and get my ass to bed. Because I am tired as fuck and I know Calvin is too. So peace out.

Wave has not that time, but we had to cook salmon. So, the fat pieces salmon in the oven right now. We stockpiled with fish. It was like... The world's most expensive whole foods run. Stockpiled the cabinets with all the revised supplements. No pre-workout anymore sadly for the last five days, so I got some caffeine pills. So, you know, although we shouldn't get the eat yet.

You need a little... We are the stage. Good. Watch! Come on! Come on, Chris! Come on! Come on! We come on! Let me in, Chris! Come on! Come on! Come on, Chris! What is up, YouTube? We're in the good elevator today. There's another elevator that has stake on the wall. I would much rather look at this signature peanut butter and bacon bigger. Just drool and watch out for you now. But Monday yesterday of Sunday didn't really vlog yesterday, we counted in at it. I was feeling so hot. When someone was brutally killing me, I was like, no fat, no car. I was just like pushing that like, that's how you get gas. You couldn't go to the bathroom. I just didn't feel good. So, took it down to vlog and we're back out of today. Fireton took a little poop. A whole lot better today. I want to give you some fat soup if I wait dropping and I'm fucking shredded right now. So, feeling good, you love me. You have a little bit more fat in my diet. And that's very beneficial. So, we have to jump right now and see you guys out. You're on. All right, here we are. Back at our old man gym. Final back day. Monday, back workout. Like I was saying on the elevator before people were coming up with us and we talked with a poop. I had some fat and maybe you feel more aware of that or so. I ended up with a little bit higher today. Trying a little bit earlier too, which feels better. So, happy about that. Doing good spirits are up. And weights coming down. So, we're going to make it. We'll make way. We get through that workout and get on with the dinner. We're going to do that. We're going to start the workout. Let's go. We're going. Come on. Good job. Let's go. Let's go. Good. Good. Good. Go. Don't swing. Good. That's it. Perfect. Good. Good. Good. Good. You done this before? Yes. So, we're going to do that. So, we're going to roll. You're mother fucking dog.

Good. Good. Good. Two more. One more. And that's it. Good. The hand position. So, what we can do is we can go ahead and lighten it by one. If you want, or take a 45 off and I recommend it to 25. And then do it over hand. So, let's grab the 45. Take it off. Yeah. We can't. We're going to go high, bro. Yeah, a little bit. It's really awkward for my long arm. Okay. So, let's go ahead. I'll have that problem too with my long arms. Yeah. Yeah. Seven for one. I'm six one. It's the lens on Calvin's camera. Yeah. This is my way limit is 3400. Good. I said one. Yeah. I'm a second one.

Excellent. Not a little bit. Wait. Let's get on the ice right now. I think it's a little bit difficult. I'm exhausted. I'm like, finished it. But I can do this. Typically, I'm used to being so fucking tired. I like to like, like, it's beyond. Then you can make it. Yeah. You feel good to have a little more life in here. Yeah. I mean, you want to have enough energy to do a set. But you should feel tired. In between the sets. Because your body should be depleted. But not so to put you in the ground stand. Put your pants on and like, you put it in my shorts on. But sometimes it's really, it's just like, it's a nice set down on me. When you have to say, babe, come put on my pants for me. It's not cool. Yeah. Sheave my butt. White my butt. Just put my pants on. Yeah. Just sit down. Yeah. Yeah. Two, two, two. One more. Partial. Got it. So let's go over and just finish that off. And then we'll be a straight-run pull down. And then we'll finish up with some kind of extensions and we'll go over the other shot. I think we'll be on the coach. That's not a judge. My sheet of cables only right now. We're just going to contract and make sure that my muscles are like firing. And now they sort of feed myself up. It's going into my muscles. So it's like diving on that eating line now. I had a little extra cards. So just really make sure the muscles stay alive and move in. And that's not going to feed them up. And definitely not trying to injure myself with fucking heavy rows when I'm this dry and lean. My like, you're flush it and you're flue it and fucking all your joints. Like my spine can like hurt sometimes. So nothing really body was part of all cable shifts. We used to piss out of it. We're half of these last few workouts. And you know the drill. You're right that back. Good. Try that back. Good. Good. One more. Good job. How's it going? One second. One more. Good. I'll just get it today. Three, two, one. Try it. One more. I can try that.

No. No. I'm not sure. No. No. No. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. This is a pretty good. No. No. No. No. No. Theras. So any places you love, or you teach people how to make texts? Excuse me. I am. Everyone this weekend or you're signing up, and you're definitely recording all of we back and that's what you meanриating and Skipping on someone every chair. Are we doingские people? Only thing we keep as the soul. We are everything. We Aren't every man. Whatever you create. It's fine. He's more important. Yeah. So like we'll literally just sit down and like brainstorm anything. I haven't seen this movie back on here Try this one I'm having baby feet. Oh no. No. I would say to be fit. To floppy. Has to be to floppy. We're thinking of the warmest. Do you have to pick one sugar kid? What is this? Classic. They're all classic babies. I need to send this to Melissa. She's gonna die. Women's that's the best. They are the 990s. Nevermind. 590s. You would say that. I don't know. I don't mean that. I don't mean that. I don't mean that. I don't mean that. So hurry. We got the law. We have the law. Billy. Bobby. Yeah they do. I'm like brown black. I'm good. I don't care about clothes. I know you love the website. I don't know. I love the website. Wow. Bobby some nice kicks. We got a pair of Jordan Threes. I first ever pair of threes. Got the muggles. Beautiful sugar. Jordan got the muggles. You're not that sure. One of my favorite shoes. So it's like that. It's like that favorite online store. So we're checking out the muggles. But the shadows are the guys that have been accepted. Give them free shirts and free socks. Give them free shoes. I'm sure everyone your shoes. I'm not sure of them. I mean it was too bright in there. It's too bright. All right. So back from the mall. We're in the whole legit calories. My weight was good today. So I got a bunch of food. And I got a bunch of cheese. So we're like. I put them all. My first pair of Jordan Threes. So something more I need to provide. Why would you? Why don't I get one? Does that like a cream? It is cream. And like a light blue. It's very nice. Just a little hint of red. I like it. So maybe we're going to have to jump tomorrow. That would be like all the pancakes and bacon. It's a cool accomplished shopping bag. Putting up the delicious shoes for sure. But. I can't talk about these. Well, that's going to be wrapped on today. What happens today? Turn back to the eat. Some more food. And now we're back to the ground because tomorrow's Tuesday. And then I have to weigh in a PMO. I do like I said. So we're trying to go over a game plan. Of like how are we going to have my weight below 240 at 8 p.m. Because like at night I'm like 246 typically. So it's just a. Renching the game plan. Then we typically do considering weighing in at 10 a.m. A lot easier. So we're figuring out maybe I just drink a lot. Eat a meal throughout the night. Train really early. And then kind of nap all day. And just chill. Lower my sodium a little bit. Then it'll make me flush more water due to less water. And just like monitor it. Be on the scale all day. Making sure I'm not going over or over too much. And then kind of be there by 8 p.m. So we're going to figure that out. But tomorrow's still working out. So I think we are maybe just because my last full workout workout took two say. And then I'll be doing like a lighter upper body. They said one say probably. And roll out all the week. So thank you guys for. Thank you for the part of this journey. Please remember to subscribe. The top of the grinding on the videos. And be loved by our subscriptions. And we'll be vlogging every day for the rest of the week. I may have a lot of days where I don't talk. I may have had a lot of days where I do talk. So you'll see how I feel based off the move of vlog. I guess watching. Peace out.

Just fill it up, say. Just get a hold on. I'm going to try it. I was waiting. Get in there. You want to do it, honey? Probably the work thing I like to do. Great. What is up YouTube? Last night, beautiful night. Kelvin wanted to watch a shitty UFC 5-3 to film a little bit. But honey let me get an in-note burger and some cereal. And what? Yeah, but I didn't really get a date for a brunch. We went in at 11 o'clock at night and Kelvin tapped up by them. So you guys don't get to see any of my cheat meal, but I haven't been in the open. I'm going to get a pretty fire. So I'm enjoying that. And today's like this, I'm trying to put it to work. And get some big ol' legs. So let's go to the exact way he said. Three ways, what? 600 pounds. No. Five many times. Five these times. They're for sure. That's not fair. That's not fair. That's pretty good. Good. Good. Three. Three. You're going to keep going. Good. Good. Good. Here we go. Go, go, go. Good. Partial, partial, three. Two. That's it. That one. That's just like it's like always going out. You have to have the... ...this part's clear. Okay.

That's what? Did that... Did you hurt your leg on that one? Or your knee? Yeah, both of these people in there. It's like maybe I should hear it a little bit more. I know that was the one you hear a lot's during. Yeah. Do not amazing machine. You're going to love so much. I didn't hate the machine until now. It just hates you. Yeah. See that my leg works. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. Good. Put your toe. Put your toe. Can go. Like that. Go. Just go to feel it. Good. Go. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's it. Tell you. Good. Partial. Three. Two. All right. Good. Good. Sunday, late, month. Good. Good. Excellent. Fire. Good. Good. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Go. Okay. You need partial stuff. Partial. Partial. Keep going. Good. Good. Keep going. Good. And you're done. Good. Go. Good. That's who three of those. I feel too is okay. I think we can go into a compound movement now. Let's go into a. You don't have a Smith machine squad. You won't be here to all the later next week. So I think we can avoid it and then do. Smith machine squad. We can do late press. We can do that vertical late press. Have you guys seen something? No. You know a vertical late press is. Oh, we can do 45. We have vertical. We have 45. We also have two different hacks. Actually, this this one right here. This pendulum is pretty bad. It's pendulum. I think the home of the starting was like press. And then moving to either belt or pendulum. But we just did felt. It's been a good look for so. You know, tired me on when the late press is in do this or do this first. I think you're actually this is so smooth. I'd like for you to try out this machine first. And then go over. And then maybe on the late press. If you didn't 45 before, we can do vertical. Because you know, you have to put it on. No. We're going to try that. It's matched the how it is. This is for his only fan's page. Come on. You're straight. Two. Two. Two. Two. Five. Six. Two. Two. Two. Four. Four. Two. Four. Two. One. Four. One. Oh. Oh, good. Good. Good. Good. You're good. Good. Good. Go go go drive. Go you come on go drive. Go go go now. Now I'll start. Go go drive. Are you still go two more go up drive one more one more with me. Come on Chris drive it all the way through. Go go. I got really happy. Chris. Heard so bad. He's got no looney five. It's a hotty. He's six, six, six, we. Okay. What is he seven? I mean I honestly feel like you can probably do that way again but it's up to you. But if you want more volume or less, I want to see him out of volume because I don't think it will do more. Oh, I don't think it will do more. Oh, I'm sure. There you go. Sorry, but. Hey. Oh, good. You going. You going moving. Right. Go. Right. Good. Good drive drive. Good one more one more. Got this. Come on Chris. And drive all the way up. Good job. How's that all man? So bad. You cracks but. Moving. Cracks and creaks. Yeah. So. I was no loosey duty set. Good job. Excellent. Excellent. Good. Come on Chris. Good. Keep moving in. Move away. Right. Drive. Excellent. Good. Right. Right. Right. Good. Right. What? I think that's good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on Chris. Drive it. Come on Chris. Drive it. Drive it. Good. Keep moving. Go. Drive. Good job. Drive. Good. One more. Go. And drive. Go. Go. Good job. Like that. It's not easy. I'm not going. It's not a big smooth push. There's too much touching on the machine rather than weight moving. Like the bench is to come under through pushing the weight up. You're kind of pushing the weight against the metal. Like it's on a track and it's that you're pushing up. What's that? You're pushing into the metal and then up. It's a lot of friction. Yeah. I also think that you're, it's like where you're putting your feet to on this one. It was a sign. It's a sign a little bit for your higher foot position. I mean, this chair is too far back. It's too far back to too open. You need to be like, you need to be a little bit more upright. Or no, this whole thing needs to be more under. So pushing will up instead of out. To me, it feels like it's a little too far back. That's what I mean, this needs to hold between these two and stuff. So you're more underneath. See how it feels. We're going to start with two and then work our way up a little bit. There you go. This definitely provides much more resistance when you're doing single leg. Then do the double. So that's why you went lighter than half. You want to quarter or more about it. But. Okay. Okay. Good. Squeeze. Set your retard. That works. Don't say that word. My coach is retired. I don't know. I thought you're still talking about somebody else. What? Yeah. Did you realize it would be a pain in your life? Jason, 20. Of course I realized it was me dummy. Sure. Couldn't even think of a name that started with endless name. We had a game going for four hours last night. Four hours at the dinner table. What is fairness called the game?

You put his face forward and you're lifting it up. No matter if it's that 50,000 dollars in the title. That's the 50,000 dollars. You're looking at the score, please. Do one more winner. Every year brings new challenges. This year certainly hasn't been short of them. I tossed him turn at night, stuck in my thoughts, staring at the ceiling, asking myself, why am I doing this? Does any of this even worth it? If it feels like every time I get into a good groove, everything falls apart. Every year I've been tested, why did I think this year would be different? I've worked hard over the years to be more present and enjoy this beautiful journey I'm on. But this year is testing me. Extreme life changes, living in fear, health scares, injuries, personal stress, more and more responsibilities. It's funny. The more difficult your goals become, the more challenges life throws at you. When you need focus the most, it's hard as to get. I started my bodybuilding career without a care in the world, just an impossible goal I was chasing. Now that I've achieved that goal, it feels even harder to hold on to. What was once impossible is now expected of me. What was once a dream is now crushing weight on my shoulders. But I lie here wonder, who might have feel sorry for myself? I've been not worked hard every day to earn these pressures. Has life not tested me again and again to prepare me for this? The choice is mine. I'll either get back to work or I quit. I never wanted an easy life. I wanted the strength to earn a life worth living. I've built that strength these past 10 years. The strength to lift his weight of my shoulders. Better yet, I have loved ones who will help me lift that weight. I might doubt myself at times, but I know I have an army behind me of people who believe in me. I've never experienced a job. I will not let them down. It's time I take a look in the mirror, slow the fuck down. I've long surpassed what was just a dream in the years ago. I need to broaden my view. Stop focusing on what's going wrong. Focus on what I can make great. Focus on what matters most to me. Not the expectations of others. Focus on my effort, not the result. My integrity, the people I love. And remember, I love this shit. Enjoy the damn process. One, two, three, four Olympia titles felt hard. Welcome to level five. You're going to earn this shit. Is your choice to enjoy it or drown in it? I hate losing, but I will not become a product of circumstance. I will not let an outcome dictate my happiness. When my time is up, the trophies on my shelves will be but a reminder that I had a goal. And I can honestly tell myself, I did everything in my power to achieve that goal. I worked hard to become a better man than I did. I did everything in my power to achieve that goal. I worked hard to become a better man, like I did. I did everything in my power to achieve that goal. I worked hard to become a better man along the way. I built relationships with Sheriff's Revere. I enjoyed the damn journey. And I never fucking quit.

It's a beautiful mega-fit meals. They got the new green box. Very fancy. We got a bum box too. It's bum some more. So never miss a meal. Okay, for that we're going to check it over. Right now, maybe get some fun, you know? Get some good food. Good Kelvin, that'll trust that we know a good father. We'll get some fun, yeah? Well, yeah. We're going to be traveling out of people. She can hand kiss and date with the lovely dreams. So stay tuned. All right, first order of business. Make sure you door closed. We leave the auto. Second order of business. We went to this amazing Fumple X last year. And like I said, come to the side to go because his mom makes delicious food. The grandma grandma makes a lot of fun. Oh, my God. The grandma makes a lot of fun. She makes a good father. Probably not that good, but it's certainly good. So we're going to go snack. Yeah, because all we like to do when you travel at the get good food, because what better things are to do than throw in that food. Eat them. So you lied to me, so that doesn't get off. This is wrong. Yeah, that's wrong. I forgot. That's why bad. But I like rubbing better food. We're all laughing at me. What's that? What's that? Do you have that Marry To Eat? You're all laughing at me. What's that? What's that? Do you have that Marry To Eat? That's what I'm talking about. You have that. You have that. You have that. You have that. That's what I like. That's what I like. Each Iraqi ramen. Yeah, this is the Naruto dish. That's why I actually really loved it. But you took out the most important part. The mushroom? You say that, but for leaving it, you have a spiritual experience for a bad and to the shiit. You have no Naruto dish. What? You even know this game. Yeah. Roodle. Why? It's like him. Oh, I know that. I was in the last one. It was just a trick. This is something I heard. I'm going to play cover news. Where's he going? Yes. Yes. He's a hero. He's going to... But it's a character that can all... moldy and then he doesn't fall in? No? Please? No. I'm going to go ahead and pursue it. I have to do it. And I'm probably out of here. I thought they'd go away if I left Florida. I thought they'd kick me in. They asked you. I would give it a kiss. You're so high-bro and you're like, how high-bro? Because that high-bro. Yes. I thought they'd go away if I left Florida. They'd go away if I'd get wild. But it was smoked blood. It was a blood. It was a blood. It was a blood. What? What? A weed. Fuck. He's high-drew. I wish him to fill me to him on a cup of also high-tech. Oh, yeah. That's it for today folks. We got some meeting tomorrow. We got a swing, some protein, and some bond trees, and some bomb energy. So we're going to be doing some meeting with distributors. And then I'm going to have a seminar with Harni. I'm going to have a meat grid, and then signature, and then dinner. We're going to be a long-distance day. So I'm going to go to bed soon. We'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll see you guys tomorrow. Do you guys win? No? Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the birthday, guys. Can we transition every clip like this? No. So did you sell it? Yeah. I've never loved everything. They were hooked on literally everything. Dom is a fucking... What's that word? What's the jokes that they always say? So whatever you picture, you know? What? A salesman? No, there's those jokes. People always say, can't remember that they're really funny. They could sell it and they didn't want. But it's like a joke. Someone in the comments could tell me what it is. And I'll remember it. But you could sell it if you don't want. So they really liked it. They were super happy. They didn't even have any energy. It was just because it didn't make it a sin. But they still love the concept of it. The idea of it, the look of it, the love of our treats, everything. So beautiful, good to go. Check off number one on two and another one. What is this? What is this? The cafe means dope. Okay, what is this? It's like a lot of tape it was less milk. A lot of tape is a kind of hat. This is like three quarters of coffee. Corking that. Yeah, yeah. I think that's what I thought. It might be wrong, but it's an envelope. It's like pretty much a black coffee with a little milk. It's a steam remote. So it's not like an equivalent of this steam. So it's not as heavy as a lock. Is it an envelope? No. It's a catapult. But two bigs like others from my. Jesus. Yeah. I don't know which one of those. A little bit of bugs. It's a hybrid. Someone has the order of courty's eye here. Someone has the order of letters. Because they were talking about stable. So I'm eating shit. It's horrible digestion. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What are we going to do? I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to, I should have scared of you. I was going to. I was going to. I was going to go to my course all the spike will be sent last so long. He's going to hold the water if he limp you up. I was going to do that. I'm still worried about that. That's it.

Alright, so we just wrapped up. Seven hours of honey. Foot-of-off with people and autographs. I'm losing my mind right now. There's a lot of people. They're super organized here at the Arnold. It's really nice. We're going to VIP treatment. Bring me in the back room. We have security walk me from place to place. Which is really nice. And I can't walk through the Expo anymore. So it was very convenient and organized. Not for a lot of pictures. Everyone was super nice. I got to meet. Yeah, so thank you guys for coming out. We'll listen to seven of our kids before we'll offer a piece of your gift. We did make it in. Try new lot of events so I can get to meet you guys in much of a possible. Very tiring for me. But it's definitely fun to actually meet you guys. Put a face to some of the numbers on social media and all that stuff. I'm a more of a personal guy in person. So that's a wrap on day one. We are here at the place called Natta's Mexican food. It's Mexican food. It makes him feel probably my favorite food group. Absolutely delicious. Chip, welcome, boy. Plantage, chip, fajita tacos. We can eat it all day. So we're going to chat down right now. She'll hopefully get to bed early and pretty much repeat tomorrow. So we'll wrap on the day. We're going to see what we're doing here. Just kidding. I think I like how many people eat for coffee this morning. We're going. It's really good. See you. We're going. It's really good. See you. You know what we're doing here? No. See you. We're trying to figure out how many sexes we've had. It's a wonderful event. Yeah. But therefore, it doesn't matter what you do. Because we have to think of something. You speak with us. No, my own. No, no, no. Exactly. But it's a journey that we're going to work on. We're going to work on the early and the early and the early and the early. See. We're going to try and go again. We're going again. We're going again. I think we're going to go. I think we're going to go. Very clear. I think we're going to go. Let's go. Wait. I want to see you. I'm sorry. Thank you. I think we're going to... I think we're going to be... But we're going to have a chance. We're going to be... Go, maybe. Go. Okay. We'll be going. Okay. We'll be going. We'll be going. Let's make it all tonight. Talk to Pettler. Let me do this off. Can you imagine what I don't send? He competed in Europe. One of the universe. Got on a plane. He came all the way here. Can you US. It's not that on stage really. 40-hour later. And it should want the Mr. World. Can you even imagine doing such a thing? I can't help. I like to fly in two weeks before I show up. I have to fly in some of the 48 hours. It's no time. Not enough time. So, credit is too guys. It's super crazy. And I mean, I want to take a quick home setting up here. Can you give me a few sticks of gym or a bird? I want to give a few stick to our own. For making this sport such an amazing... I don't know where I should look today. The biggest popular thing in some of my family. And I can go home. He grateful to be in the United States too. I'm making a whole lot of things myself. Thank you, Arnold. Since they're all, they've got a two-week free shit to you. And everyone lives day. Thank you for all of you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much. I'm a big and power of this. We've become very good friends. Because I think this is what the world is looking for when they look at the ideal body. They don't want to be as monsters as some of those guys. They want to have the real beautiful proportions. The symmetry, the muscle separations. They're great pose and routine that you have. I mean, you know, I've seen pictures of you from far away. And the silhouette is so fantastic. And that's really the quality of the face. It's the silhouette. When you're far away, you know, the beach. You can see someone that you see the deltudes popping out. You see the abs. You see the calves. You see all this great proportion. Rather than you see someone wiling down. And the beach right right. And over 300 pounds. That's the bad actionist. This is bad actionist. And this is why you're still making millions of people in Maori and New York. And following you and all this stuff. That's why you're as successful. So how we should all do greatest of the luck. You deserve it because you're fantastic. You see. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Thank you. All right. So Saturday morning woke up. It's morning and apparently I had to do this thing at 8 am. And we had no idea what it was. Show up. And it's something with Arnold. I guess I'm like, okay. I mean, I'm not going to complain. But it gets to see Arnold Schwarzenegger. And he comes in and he's like, I look at him. I'm like, you know what I'm doing here? He's like, I have no idea. I know what we had no idea what we were doing. They're out half asleep. And he no coffee in me. And then they threw us out there. And just had to, I guess, talk to Kill Time to kind of start the show and give the VIP ticket holders like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't experience the listen to Arnold talk. And yeah, it was pretty cool. I honestly being up there with him. And honestly, very honored that they showed me to put up there. Bob Chick-Low, Chick-A-Rell was kind of like, I'm seeing it. And then being Arnold channe up there for a bit. Mainly just Arnold talking because he's a girl to show. We were just listening to him. But it's cool to be all sand up there with him. So not about where to start Saturday morning. But back here, we go high at Otao through the Arnold. Exactly where I'm at right now. We have another meeting at 10 a.m. today. I think that's it for meeting today. And then I have the meet grief, signatures again. And then that's it for today and for a few tomorrow. So that's the Arnold class for you. We're in the dressing. What? You trained? If we had time today, I won't work out. I probably have time after this to work out for two and ten and three. 10, 33 or whatever. So maybe try and get a workout in this new gym here, build American Barbell. I don't put up in the apparently really close. I heard training there so we might try and check that out. But yeah, it's better when we chill in the day. We're going to get some Starbucks. Maddie's going to get it. We're hiding upstairs. And yeah, also I've plastic with the graph that last day. I remember one look pretty fucking nutty. I'm not gonna lie. Definitely more shred than he was at the LMP last year. So last year this year, whatever fuck you want. He looked really good. Happy for him. He seemed like he watched his acceptance speech. He was like in shock. He was like, you know, he was like, you know, he was like he was like, you're supposed to be in person when I story like shit crazy man, shit crazy. He was speaking. He was very well. He was so excited to be out there with Arnold. So it was really cool to watch. Happy for him. Errskim second. No surprise there. He looked really good too. It was a little bit off. I think something going to happen before the show. But still to the fact that him being a little off comes second at the Arnold super impressive. So it was cool. And make the badass. Like some are feel, I knew I knew what it was. He came third I believe. So hats top five and you don't be on third of the Arnold. You got to stay play. He's placed in the top five classes. He's right now. He looks really good. And then I think Alex Caminaro was in fourth. So you know, really good lineup. And it was cool to see it and get the watch to show. Sadly, but they look really good. So happy for them. Love me some classic. Now we're going to get some food going about today. So I'll see you guys later. Crack open the cold one brother in light of our meeting this morning that was revolved around energy. When a crack open in a bummer energy, have I show this on YouTube? Yeah, actually officially. The first YouTube appearance of bummer energy. We'll look at this beautiful can. It's actually a really beautiful. Take us a fucking minute to make it. But it looks really good. This is our new energy room coming. We're doing a beer style can. So look cool. We're going to maybe put it like beer boxes in the future. Got like that little vintage retro look to it. Got much exact caffeine in the happening. I would say 112. 112. 112. 112. I'm going to have the caffeine. So it's a couple of like a large 12 ounce cup of coffee. But it's not one of those things we can blast your face off with three hundred milligrams of caffeine. That's what pre-workout is for. But this is more of a casual sipping energy drink that you can have multiple day. Not feel bad about yourself. And it tastes literally like cornstoda. Like out of a fountain. That McDonald's more soda. We also have cherry flush flavor, which tastes like. Wait. Red cherry flush. Frost thing. But it tastes delicious. So we're going to have a caffeine ourselves. Get to the gym. Get a quick workout because we're going to be back here in like two hours. So let's be on the room. I hate public germs. So we're here at this random esports class at the convenience. I don't know what you mean is. I'm going to try and bang with some shoulders. So I'm probably not going to talk much through it. But you guys know the typical drill. I'm going to try and bang on a lot of real delts. Because how do you tell me to focus on that this offseason. It's a bunch of real delts. A little bit shoulders. It's a quick 45 minute workout. We've got to get to the expo. So I'm hoping that I don't get bothered too much. And I can finish the workout quick. Wish me luck. I'm going to do it. I want to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Alright, so I'm not venturing over the dumbbell section. So it's going to be a machine cable kind of workout. It's a root out cable flies. People, lateral rates, that might say we're all going to do anyway. We're just machine only because the other machine's faking finished with a play load of machine. And then we'll see what time it is. And if I have to sample one more root out, it'll be that. And then, get that a lot on out of here back to the F. Like not getting happy when it's a more weight loss. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. That's true. That's true. That one's good. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the rap on day two of six. Calvin throws the camera on me. I hope he says it doesn't often work. So we're going to try and try and cross the street. Talk to the camera until time. Let's rap on day two of six. That was a longer day. But it was a beautiful day. They're very organized. So I'm sorry we thought we're going to get some steak. She's taking this. She's taking this. We're almost running to it. But yeah, so we're going to eat. And I'll see you guys later tomorrow. I don't know. But it's day and error. It's in your reach out. Is it for me anymore? That's all he gave us. Has he? That's what he did. No, that's because we've worked in the past. No, because he's just... But we said he just snapped it all the boys in line with me. But I guess he was just rest on them. I don't know. Can you just like home? It was day all along. It's like... Yeah. We're all right, we're going to do that. I didn't think it through. I was like, oh shit. You know, he's not going to be able to touch the box. You're like, you're going to use it now. I don't know. There's no good. You're telling me to have a baker in the back of that one.

It's definitely done with the style. Oh, cool. It'll be fine. You'll be fine. The end result is going to come out of your roof. Oh, dude. The end result is trying to get out of me last night. I thought I'd be like an alien in me. I was driving home and I was like, something was going to come out of my chest. You? I'm out. I get, but I get to tell you this man, I still have heart-aid about it. I gotta tell you. Heart-aid looked way better than that. Yeah. Heart-aid? What I heard? That was kind of a disappointment last night. There's a little bit I was like, oh. I was waiting back because she was like, I wasn't good at it again. You hyped it up so much though. You're still my favorite. I didn't press it better. Am I a pin? Ooh, I don't know, me on. I don't know. I'm literally still like this. It looks way better. Because I had this brand that far. Yeah, well, like, if I take you to walk up and pull it off the barbeque, rather than, like, if you do, it was at their hands. Yeah. I was just confused as to what you were touching. Yeah. The next place we have to take is like, no, it's not for the last time. It's both on the road. It goes on the road. Pearl I like it. No, it's like you want to be a fan. No, you're cool. Maybe it's like your favorite? that went on for not a three-a-a little stretch on that one on the other. I can't remember there's one of them that was a little bit short and it might be the last hold down there. I think it was a converging one, right? What is up YouTube? We're back at Hubslerry Comjun. During the back today, honey said this is where I was trying to put on a few pounds on my back and on my arm so it's what we're doing here. It's a little bit stressful in the gym because a lot of people and I love you guys, but if you think of a gym and you're staring at me, just imagine if you were at a gym and every one at the gym you walked in the Alsteria, you pulled the front end so it's zooming in and filming. You know a little bit uncomfortable, so I'm pushing you guys in the front and finish my workout, come up after. I'm still here at my video, Tim is holding up and I'm very awkward. I'm making a comfortable. So yeah, back there, joining the huge. Soon you'll get all the back on, honey. Oh that's honey. This is a price of fame. Good. Good. Squeeze. Good. Good.

One more. Pull. Good job. I'm still getting shit on my Instagram about calling this two-mode deadlift shooting. You think it's shooting? Yeah, because I had camera was doing it. And I said, why do you have camera doing that? I said, you don't have a monitor. That's what shooting. I said, because you're shooting. You don't have a screen shoot. This is screen shoot.

More people come. More people. More people. More people. More people. Oh, staring at me. Woo. Woo. I'm hoping to press his upper blitz. That's right. Yeah, only for one day or two. No. It's because he's just getting back. He's getting a C legs back. It's true. He's a big deal for two of them. Yeah. We've got to go to places where they don't recognize unlike in the snow. The barn. We've got some good workouts in that barn. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm talking about during the off season. Since after the Olympia snowboarding going out to Canada, Mom and Pop, this house, eating and Kentucky, make it with meals that the luxury gourmet basement with cinnamon rolls.

A little bit of a little bit of a feeling of a lot. A little bit of a feeling of a lot. And a little bit of a stretch. Good. Just get a little bit of that one bar. No. Is that her back? I don't know. I don't know. Heard it. It's like, I don't know why it's just all low back. Because the angle doesn't allow me to get over it. It's like pulling me down. Oh, it's one of the four. It's like things that have been offered. Like. Okay. It's just trying to arch your back slightly. And then just get a good stretch and then pull. But don't go so far that it throws you off. I'm going to, I don't like your ergonomics with this one. It's okay. So that one we last time was better. Yeah, the other one was last time. You know what I mean? Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. You can't do that. I know what you're doing more than once. In the 225. For a little while.

We just got to fill our way up in the next month. 225 is a max. We just can't believe they've got sets covered. Calvin, make sure you call me. He'll just be face to me. I'll get a call from honeymen to work. Calvin is the back of the snitching on me. He's going to be holding the camera on live. You're going to do a face time. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. One more. Good. Good. The bodywork. See that barbecue put in the work. Brisk it in my veins. I can't even talk about it. You just say you don't like it. So it's not good. It's a hater. Very out of shape. I believe my sleep. Spring training is like. It is. It is like when I first like pushed myself like hard. Like I was doing like sets of like 15 and 20. And I was like literally hovering the garbage. It's like corny's like stopping dramatic. I'm like no, I'm literally throw up. Was that before after party weekend? I was like 170. 170. Fuck is wrong with me. I have no idea how much it wrong with me. I'm going to turn into a book. The list of things wrong with me. That's a very big book. That's the next. Yeah, the book. There's a book. There's a book. Yeah. The book is like right. The book is too bad. Yep. Yes. It's a full of machine and they're all over the world. It's really my reason to pull over machine is because we're trying to keep the way I'm elbow, keep the way off my bike side so we can't be fatigued in my arms. I guess I can't hear but I'm just trying to repeat what he's saying over there. It's not like I'm smart but I'm not. Let me see the whole goes back, right here. Let me get my motorcycle. Yeah, this is always mission needed for me to pull the little coach here. We're made for shorter people. It's not perfectly ergonomically good for my body. It's just one of these average strikes that you can find for a bigger ride. That one not a list. Jimmy Chin and Florida, in my favorite pool. That was the thing that came. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. One, two, three. Two, three, four, four, five. Two, three, four, five. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.

=== FILE: RAW CHEST WORKOUT ｜ 4 WEEKS OUT [9asGlMyFJyk].txt ===

I Branch Made & motion I tried to train a bit early and belly feels full which honestly is kinda nice, because it's normally fucking empty all the time. I've been going a bit hungry, we get up in the late hungry, but it's a good thing because getting shredded, slowly moving forward every day. And yeah, feeling good. So I've been in a good structure lately if I actually sleeping, we've been bedded at nine o'clock last night and I woke up at like eight, which is fucking absurd. I was up a lot during the night, but it's still a long time for me in bed. Thanks guys, turn it down. But yeah, it's just a day. So it's a good day, Calvin's back in town. We had a cool little outing with GBRS which a bunch of contents gonna come out on our YouTube podcast and everything I'm talking to you guys about already. So that's coming as soon. But we're back in action now. Axel's also coming to town this week, which I'm pumped about. If you ever remember, Axel from 2020, one of the go-to Olympias that I did. The COVID Olympia, my training partner, one of my best friends from back in Ottawa. So he's coming down the chair with me for a bit and visit Florida. So he should be your Thursday, four days, so we're seeing a bit of him. But until then, it's just day. I've been using this multi-function, that camera was called machine cable, but I'm switching it up to the good old life that is packed that great. Now this is the exact same thing as from Canada that was in good life. Growing up my whole life. So throwing that on there, I've maxed it out. So I'm gonna be busted out of the gym pin. I just found it male gym bag, luckily I didn't even know I had it. So I'm gonna pull like a 25, maybe on it. It's starting to really warm up my pack get a good contraction and then move on to some pressing. So, for a start with. The shit I do for you. The shitty music I listen to for you guys. You guys can listen to the fans. I know you all are complaining about the fans. I have to listen to bullshit music, so we all losing. I'm still pretty lay, I'll see if I can put another 25 on the gym pin without breaking the machine. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that actually fell heavy. So for a several long time, a pack deck felt that heavy, so God bless the gym pin. Oh, I got it, it's still heavy. Damn, motherfucker. Oh, shit, that's 25 weight a lot less than I thought. That's a real job, sir. Oh, maybe I'm just tired. Yeah. Yeah. Go off. Good enough for that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, shit. I'm starting to feel that just like, it's this transition, right? I'm just like, full right now because I'm eating okay enough. And I've been eating so much more sodium than I normally do, but I feel like empty, like, physically. Trying to lift heavy weight right now. It takes me like, like before calms down, it's filming. I was doing fucking band-shit rude doubts, pull down, fucking push-ups, everything just like, it did some stairs. Just get my heart going, can I have so tired? My body, my heart rate drops down like 55-60 and it's just so hard to get it up to get my energy going. So fucking picking up weights right now, just like part of the battle, just waking myself up empty already for a heavy set, like each fucking temp on increment feels like it's getting 40 pounds heavier, but I still got some strength in me, so this is the time where you've got to go. This is more mentally, you feel like you're stuck dry and you should be weaker. And everyone's like, I should be weaker, I'm depleted. So they start cutting back their weight, do a more volume, and that's when you start to lose size. And this is where mentally you have to battle through that bullshit. And still actually lift heavy weight, so force yourself to get up to the heavier weights. So you keep that muscle math even throughout your prep. Too many people cut it down just because they feel tired. None of that bullshit here. You know the prime example, when I did the one tense, it literally felt heavier than you in the 140s. And if I let that get my head about, fuck, I'm weak today, I'm going to do the 120s. Make sure I get enough breath, but I'm like fuck that. I'm going to keep going until I get the 140s. By then, suck it up a little bit, put your whole bit, think you're got 10 reps there. So perfect. You're going to break my foot there. Damn. I'm going to break my foot there. Whew. It feels really good. It's a brand new machine. Literally, this is one of the pure muscle and helped me build this gym and they're starting to line with the metal fabricator and the machine fabricator. And this is one of the pure iron pieces. We got the swing squat, a new hip press, and now this incline converging press. Like I told you the reason I like this one, and the problem with a lot of the new machines is they like press out or straight. When the point of the pack that's come across the body, bring the elbow across the body. And it's actually like the pressing movement is like incline and in a little bit. I feel really good. I know I just didn't clean, but incline is the goat. So I'm going to try this new machine out. This thing is fucking heavy, but beauty thing is I completely forgot. They were telling me about this when they made it. This little lever right here makes it unilateral or bilateral. So if you have like a stronger shoulder, stronger pecked in the other little lopsided it. And it forces you to push on something with a barbell. And it takes over. On this one you can make it unilateral, just like a fucking dumbbell. And that way you actually have full control in each arm. So you're not favoring one over the other with the weight. So probably we'll all week or like that, but I'm going to try it like that because symmetry, you know. I really like that machine. One of the best inclines I've ever used. It forces you to up and in. I really feel that squeeze in my upper inner pecked. Feels good. Alright, get him move on. Some flies start. Let's fly, do flies in the middle. Do lots of flies. But I'm going to superset these machines. Why the fuck not? I don't know what weight I'm going to do. I think I'm going to start with this one because it's one's really hard to get into without a partner. You need to like wedge yourself in. And then this one you can pop in easier. So typically do 110 on here. So I'm going to put it to like 90. And then I don't know what to fuck to do on this one. There's no numbers on the set of the machine. So I can never remember. Or a bat. Probably right there. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Oh shit. Okay, that was too heavy. First set was good. Fifth one is too heavy. So I'm going to drop it down a bit. I want to be able to actually like contract on the superset of this on the second set here. Like focus on really squeezing my chest tight. That's so heavy. I'll really just get in the stretch part of the motion. So I'm going to drop it. Try that again. I'm going to drop it. Fuck you microphone. Ah. Ecline. The lot of incline today. It didn't clean his life. Like I'm using decline. I use that. I do dips. Like body weight dips at the very end. Or this specific decline machine could mostly climb the machine hurt my shoulder, but this one doesn't. So I'm moving a neutral grip. Just to kind of hit the peck from a different angle. Keep my elbows locked and close to my body. Slightly flared just from my last squeeze down. And it's probably going to last pressing movement. Probably last main chest movement. I'll do like a little stretch. I'm going to try to lift the hips down. Maybe open it my chest and then probably call it a day. Maybe use the abs. Oh wow Think I only normally do three plates without fucking heavy, but it's like eight so I'm gonna do a top set drop set down ah Alright, this is the chance to finish here today. The flies are meant to be like a perfect fly. Obviously, I'm kind of like just trying to finish the wrap. There's no tension on a dumbbell at the top of our wraps where you want the most queues you lose it on a dumbbell, but that's why I'm just doing them at the end just to focus on the stretch. Just trying to open my pecks up and get like a awaited contraction in a stretch. She can be better posture, stand up straight, the shoulders back. And yeah, and then I'm just going to burn out with some push-ups at the end here, just to kind of really fatigue the chest and call it a day. So finish it up with this. OK. Take yourania back up your assignment. My rap? Back at the trigger game. I think last time, I said just like that, about looking forward the chagrin, not in prep and here we are deeper in prep, chagrin. So I still have to just ration myself about what I can eat. But still nice to enjoy your food, because my last meal is nothing but salmon or steak. So myes will have a taste of the dishes. So Calvin's back in action and fucking busting out the chagrin. We leave it at my back here because I don't know. I get to torture this mouth. And now the benefit of eating much of them won't. So we're going down some sticks. We need some tea going, some feles and some salmon. Fuck it up. All right, can I? I don't know how that actually is for you. But I got hit with a wall and I'm tired now. 9, 23, 7 minutes away from my bedtime. So for that being said, I still love you stir, bun-n-we, hair-dement. We still have many things like labor. Thank you for coming to see me to someAM.

=== FILE: SHARING MY SECRETS ｜ ARM DAY W. VAUGHN [dAsXZyfjnd4].txt ===

Armday was just getting a little bit and fun. I said and fun. I said and yeah, it's so quick to react to your life, everybody. I said this getting a little bit and fun. I'm gonna say that's like two rows in that line in a minute. What is up? You're welcome to Armday with Seabun. Seabun. Seabun. Seabun. Beech ring. Bahn. Walker. A case. Getting a little bitch. I can only say that because I'm a skinny little bitch. But anyways, we have a fun little thing that I'm gonna share with you guys finally after a lot of work. A lot of hiccups. I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you what went wrong with it yet. So I'll tell you that maybe that story to later time. But you guys want to hear about the insights and outs of my perhaps and all the secrets and everything. So we compiled all of them into this beautiful bottle of pre-workout. I think you fucked up before the gym. This is gonna be what's getting me through prep this year. Give me to my work and I thought, I just lay down and fell asleep and on the fuck I'm tired. And we moved, we removed our office and we just grabbed my couch, I'm rug and some chair and shit and I was like, be tired. I'm a cool little bitch. So today we're gonna be putting Christmas secrets stuff, Come on, we'll all together and of course, six and two scoops. As all pre-workouts are meant to be taken. And obviously, after you take this, you just only have a little bit samples. But this is something I think we've had this in the books for four months. Mainly able to have to change it. Like I said, I don't know if I'm not telling you why we had to change the yet, but it looks beautiful now. It is like a soft little touch, little chalkboard. And we got some like hidden little messages in there. That you'll have to read if you get it. But it takes a lot of shit so it takes just like winning. It's your favorite one. It's so hard for me to everyone though with a quarter of your favorite flavor. And when we checked this every day, we see how many new ones all the time. So my favorite one's usually always the newest one. But three peaked came back, but this better than three peaked right now. So, apparently my favorite, but like I said, if I take this for the next eight weeks, I probably want something new. And it's very limited edition. This is not ever coming back again. We made one run of this. This is Christopher's secret stuff to winning four hell in a pit. And it will not be coming back ever again. So it's very exclusive. The one run in the weird. Completely done with it. And you won't see it again. And we will not be coming out with the flavor in a different label either. It's just RIP to Christopher's secret stuff. So get it what he can. What is the drop? One day. One day. That's 12. What day is that? What month is it? So October. October says November 2nd. Yeah. November 2nd. Also got a bombaw since mainly for Calvin. Because I can't eat all the meals in it. The monitor's so specific for perhaps. But, I'm curious to eat the whole thing. And the duration. Come, Vulking Ray now. We're getting fucking jacked up. This is how we do it. You took the ice out. What are you doing, man? I melted it. Oh really? Yeah, it was about ice packs in it. It's fine. It's still going to put it in the fridge. There you go. But anyways, we did a big update to the bumbox. Turkey, rice, vegetables, simple thing. But we have a chicken stir fry, which Calvin ate. Everything will want to go. We've got the fucking delicious. And we have bombana, nap muffins in here. Let me just look at some of the ingredients for you guys. Banana, organic, o-flour, maple syrup, walnuts, egg, extra virgin olive oil. I want to know if it's cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, vanilla extract, sea salt. Not make natural ingredients. And they taste delicious. You don't know how much I wish I could have some muslim before the gym. Honey, please give me a muffin. I would love some. hungry and very hungry. But yeah, so there's that. There's the bum bowl, which is the past of meal. But you have to customize it now to what meals you want to be in it. So, however, make it for meals.com. You can use co-team for a little discount and be sure to check it out. But others in that, we got to get some gym because as always, I'm laid as fucking buns. I'm going to be able to cook when you're always laid. Everywhere I go, people will have to cook your own sleep. I ran on my own time in prep. Sorry, I'm sorry. So, that's all we got going on. I got you guys to gym. Yeah. I know my bad, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to leave. I'm like, $25. $40. $40.25 minutes. Yeah, I'm a little bit. I'm basic and boring. There were some tables in the middle of the day. I should have worn my male men out of us. I'm back for training or you're a little pussy. I've been kind of a big step young. I'm like, starting to get back to my meal plan. Actually, I'm trying to eat food again. Yeah. Back for later. Back to my back. I was just fucking around. I'm eating less.

I made bond weight like 25 minutes for me because I got it. Get him a little lancy. You know, get him nervous for the day. Just slow on his old age. That's just long. Yeah. That's pretty much. You guys know how I'm late and blowing and getting old. I forgot what time it even was because of my gymmanship. So life's rough. But we're going to start working the first work you set. And get new.

To get that last like durefs, that's a little extra squeeze. It's like everything. So we start with preacher, mooner spider curls. I'm saying I like doing this, but he got a crazy pop. He's getting. He's got this getting what? He got a crazy pop and it's hard to curl. It's done. There are too much blood in it. So the spider curl makes your arms hang a little bit. I'm just gonna do this. I'm just gonna do this. I'm just gonna do this. He got a crazy pop and it's hard to curl. It's done. I've just got a little bit of blood in it. So the spider curl makes your arms hang a little farther away from your body. They're below your heart. Before whatever reason, whenever I do these, not a lot of people, you would kind of almost lose a pump. But it's a good contraction. So we're getting a little blood out of the arms. And we have a training part and they can help you squeeze a little bit. It's good. Plus, it's a very different curl motion from the preacher curl here. So we're doing these secondary and then half of this. These are dumbbell curls and then we'll superset it all over the day. There. Fall down. Give this a show. Ooh. Your knees. you oah ah Wh By oh another high That's the C7 back and forth. Talking to go for them. You like to fly to McQueen? I'm not. Can it be end? Yeah. But, could it be two of us?

=== FILE: SHOULDER WORKOUT ｜ AM I TOO DISTRACTED？？ [FYUgpmzMcaA].txt ===

How to be confident, see you on a great question, horrible wording. But I'm going to speak once, specifically, that I was like, witness to hear that was very different. And it's kind of obvious, but doing things that scare you, build confidence in every aspect of your life, not just to think that's here with you. If you're someone nervous, pick something small, this here is you and do it. It's just like fixing the help, keep doing, keep doing it, and you're going to build confidence. The possible not to. Come on, come on Chris! Come on, you're one, two, Oh, come on, come on, you're one for you guys! Come on, come on! What's that? Sorry, last Friday. You told me what you're doing. Two scanning. Yeah. Scan your bed. I want the middle�. Oh my god! I think it's actually really good though. You don't count. Apparently I don't count because I don't eat this stuff. Yeah. What's the milk from cookies when it was really good? This is better, my opinion. That's right. Ready, go, Chris likes it. What's up, YouTube? I'm tired today. I'm very tired. I'm sick and fucking tired. I'm driving for an hour to this goddamn gym. I'm serving at the office. So I need my gym to be open. But today was really good. I got blood work that's what I'm trying to say. Perhaps starting soon, some of the blood work makes sure I'm healthy. Body's ready to rock. Create a fuck-shick, fuck-shit. Up this one, be up to 13 speed grain now. But good blood work. Get back to five days, Hunter are going to review. And then lock him low and fully into this prep. And get spying right now after he came down. So feeling good. I'd take two days off before. First thing like three days off for blood work through your results aren't too good. But I took two days off and want to take them to shem off. And then... Here I am. I don't know if you're fucking going to go on this. So yeah, the shoulders and by a set of stay-framing, I'm catching up for a missed day. So to mining, we're getting a hat. Doing this this week, oh my foot. Five steps a week in my delts. So putting vices at the beginning of this workout, mixing themselves, finished with delts. But I'm actually pushing my vices up there that they need to be. But this isn't normal program, it just has to take you through days off and I don't want to not change arms for like nine days or one, eight days or whatever. It would be a smooth sweat. So hi, tell me now. Put them in the beginning of the workout. Warm up delts and shoulders. And then finish with like three delts and normal. So your number one foot's weight is Alright. I don't really recommend warming up the biceps for shoulder best. Probably should done this first, but it's still feel good. Doing that little pives, curls with one arm, pives curls the other for biceps, like my cheek curls for getting like a crazy bicep pump. And like pounding some mind-must connection at the beginning of the bicep workout. It's been helping me a lot. It's too much. The man is a hell of pump that turns your shoulder press, but we'll take what I do. This is a good machine. What? That's a good machine. That's a pure delved tree overhead. I mean, you know a brand new thing you could have used this. Some of the things are like thirst for, so I don't have that brand. Well, there's a few others like this, but they don't have a brand like that. I have the max book. I don't like that one. That's too short man. That's short you're it. Are you the short king? Alright, so just a percent cross lateral raise with front raises. Just trying to pump the hell out of my shoulders. It sounds a lot of volume like 10 reps of each super set. What about good to do like a. Kill your front delved, your side delved, and then move into a front delved. And because my lateral delved with fatigue, force me to use my whole hand-sharier delved, and it really may be burn out weight quicker, such as the way I played that, and make sure you have a round shoulders, rather than off-lighter ones. So, finish with the re-delveds of the same reason. The vice steps, we're gonna go home and follow it today. Alright, so let's get me around on today's shoulder by Seperke at a random workout that I don't normally do, but yeah. Hopefully we have enough footage right now, but Calvin's gonna be heading out of the vicinity of the Ming for a while, so we're gonna be back in about 12 days. I don't have my camera. But I'm gonna vlog a bit maybe, and if my gym's at him, I'll definitely be vlogging. I also want to vlog more of this crap. So I'm gonna be stealing Calvin's camera, I'm gonna commit to the YouTube Grand and buy another one of his cameras, and then vlogging the morning, film a Super Junior Day workout, and make a little bit more entertaining content. But, kill I said I was gonna answer some of the big questions in the last few videos, and I didn't, I have some save now, I'm gonna quickly run through them, wrap up the video, and just gonna run into it. This is from YouTube. So if you have leave questions in YouTube, I'll try and screen-chop them and save the man to the money where I feel like it. First question is, says, do you have a protein with that sucre loss? So the raw protein that actually speeds in the stevia? The sea bump proteins are sweet, it was super low. So if you look at the raw ones, they are grass fed, New Zealand way, with stevia. Sea bump is not, that's why the flavors are a little bit more like me and chocolate chip and stuff like that, and similar to a cereal, they're a little bit more playful. I guess you could say in the sea bump line because there's a question, do you ever feel that traveling, cuts into your workout time? And also that others are hungry, and then the gym every minute of the day, that is concerning you. So I guess it's saying it's my life to track me too much into the worry me. I'm not sure if now, I think I've found pretty well to travel up the beginning of the year, and when you compete once a year, I'm like others, so that's my advantage. And I honestly wouldn't feel fulfilled living a life at 28 now, which I did this for a few years, that you're sleeping, training, eating and sleeping, eating and training, doing nothing else. I really love the fit, this is rebuilding everything I get to do during the day. The travel I get to do for the business is, and then everything like that, it really feels me gets me excited, and if I ever feel like I'm like behind or something, you just kind of give me a little chip of my shoulder to kick myself in the ass when I got home. And training even harder. So I don't feel like it's putting me back at all. Regardless, it's making me a lot happier and setting me up long term for my future, so I'm just enjoying life and doing the best I can with what I got. Thanks, Juan. I'm always at the gym training for three hours. Is that too long? So the pump I get, then it's amazing. I mean, if you're feeling fully energized and sick of it, three hours, I mean, it's not horrible. And I don't tell people to do what I do now, because when I was younger, and I could train for three hours, I used to do it with different three hours every single day, almost, probably six days a week, one day I was too hung over. And I felt great. I was getting strong, I was progressing about 20 years old, and nothing to beat me up. So I was just enjoying the talent with my friend, you're a gym, you can still show, I could have sped it out better. But if it's not taking away from the rest of your life and you're truly training hard, and you're making progress, you're getting stronger, getting bigger, whatever your goals are. Who's this luck here? But I promise you both time you're like 28 miles or even younger, you're about to catch up to and you're not going to train that long. So enjoy it while I last. And if you have a busy life and you feel like taking out of it, we're going to be more efficient with your work. All right, last question. How to be confident, see you, Bob. Great question. Corporal wording. But I'm going to speak once, specifically, saying that I was like, witnessed this here, that was very different, and it's kind of obvious, but doing things that scare you, build confidence in every aspect of your life, not just the thing that scares you. I learned this this year when I was doing a bunch of public TV events. If you're keen to, they either keep steps, you're seven hours, and a bunch of stuff that I would never do. And every time they were coming up, I was trying to find a thesis about government, because I did want to do them because I was scared to me. Every time I did them, I would anxious my heart was racing, and felt like I was going to suck them up. And I went through with it, I did okay, and after I'd settled a little bit more confident. And I kept doing it, and I realized after a while, my day-to-day life and other decisions that I was making stuff I was doing, I just felt more confident. Because something that once scared me, where I thought I was going to fail, and I'm not being about it, I thought, not mine. I got through it, proved to myself that I'm more resilient, and I thought, and then I'm that's not an aspect that your body is more, or your mind is more resilient in every aspect, not just public speaking, but just full, like, aptitude of life. So I think that's one of the best ways. If you're fucking someone nervous, pick some of the smallest gears you and do it. It's just something that you can keep doing, keep doing it, and you're going to build confident, the possible not to. This is a help for me and it's useful. But yeah, that's it. So like, as watching, we will see you guys soon. Hopefully, the gym will be ready, and next video I'll be going to try and up again. Up, thank you guys for where my gym is at, so this should be done in that like, 10 days I am fingers crossed, a hate drive. Yeah, see you soon. Love you guys, catch you later.

All right, so here today, in Tampa Bay, we sent stuff by daily each first, a beautiful breakfast. And I'm not sure how to build by it yet, but if you'd always for all those, we got a sandwich.

Alright, so Saturday morning with a bit of a shit show. Um, pretty much every night. Let me have a little bit of a 6 to 7 to 8 pounds of water and what he and put me really dry and really good. And then near Friday night Saturday morning, I just stopped flushing water. My body was just like, oh, we're going to hold on to it now. And then I had also a lighter two hours already. But he had to do a good cup water to be lower by Friday morning. We started. So I had less water to flush. And then I'm eating a lot and I woke up on that Saturday morning, showed it all days to look my worst. I had locked in a morning in a very long time and I normally wake up like peel, shredded dry and like ready to rock. Build my confidence, get off stage. I didn't mind doing my thing. This time I wake up and I'm like, oh boy, like, I lost like a pound and a half, two pound, maybe not five or six or seven. And I didn't look like I should have. And then honey, like, technically, that you up, I'm like, yeah, I'm up now. And he was already hick waiting outside my door just sitting there. He knocks. I'm like, oh boy, here we go. And then he comes in and has me hit some poses and we're in a hotel room at like, five thirty in the morning. No sun can be in so the lighting is horrible. And the old hotel rooms are just like a little orange like coming down on me. I have no mirror. I don't know what I look like fully, but I can just stress in it. I see like, what the fuck? He literally is like, what the fuck happened? I have like, but I don't know what do you mean? And I could tell that I was not where I need to be at that point. So that's when it was kind of like, little stress, little panic. You know, it didn't really good peak peak. You know, everything was going really smooth. So, you know, you never gonna have a time where everything perfect. Obviously, this was like, a little moment of like, yeah, good. He's a little bit less stress just to throw out you. And it was one of the moments where I was like, you know, I had set a fighting to like, it shouldn't be stress. It shouldn't be the shouldn't be that big. This is just part of this journey right now as president's fans. But I was stressed. I was worried. I like, fuck my heart sank. I went shut down on. I was just like sitting down like, what do we need to do? And he kind of is pacing thinking like, what does the body need right now? What's missing right now? And he eventually, the wizard honey just like, what can I be thinking? This is why like a good coach can help so much because, you know, to problem solve like that. And understand after his years of experience, what like causes the body to look like this and need this, you might think it's too much water to little, too much food to this, who knows? You know, but he was like, you know what, you look at his flat, your body's been burning through food like absolutely crazy. I think he need more food. Maddie had bought me a burger the night before, which it didn't eat today. We didn't think I needed to have a super clean up until this point. He's like, eat that burger right now. Hey, it's that burger. He's like, have some rice cakes with almond butter and jam. The corn you made before, rice cakes covered it on the butter and jam like a shit ton of almond butter to get more fat to me. And then I started posing and I started to look a little bit that and he's like, all right, human rights actually need more food. So then I had like three whole like 200 grams of sweet potato, 200 grams of y'all of potato, 250 grams of rice, 150 grams of steak like fillet and covering ketchup and some salt. And just mash that down and it was so much food and this is like 530 in the morning to like 630 in the morning. It's 635, I had eaten like a 3, 4,000 calories. I don't know how much food, but a lot of food now. It's like, which is so waking up, still stressed. It'll be like, it might body just like, that just like lose everything over. And I used to have to panic when it showed it and you don't look like you should look. It's like, what's going on right now? But honey's been here before. We've been through it. You know, we've been competing a tilin' peer for me seven years. I don't even know how many years. My fifth one on a pitaid off. You got to keep calm. It's just gonna happen. And it's not gonna be perfect. Don't expect perfection. Expect chaos. Expect whatever happens happened and when it happens, it just take it as it is. So that's what we were doing. And then after eating all that food, I started eating some poses and I slowly started to look better. And I was like, I could see just a little relief in them. And then all of a sudden, it's like, you're pretty motherfucker, you get, you're gonna pull this together like we're good. And I didn't look like shit at the beginning, but I mean, we're trying to win a fifth one pitaid off who would be the best in the world that we're looking for, a very high caliber of look. I still would have looked good, but we're looking for a very specific, very high level look. So once I started to come back, when I sit with poses, the salt, sodium, food, all started coming to my muscle. Water started coming out of the skin into the muscle, looking a little bit better. And my physique started to come together and I started to look jire. Cuts were getting deeper in my glutes, my abs were starting to jire. And again, whenever I have like soft lower abs, that's just why I'm not looking good. And yeah, so it all started to come together and he looked at me and he laughed at her. Yeah, we're gonna be able to just gain that confident look. You like, all right, we got this like, we're pulling it together, you got this like you look good. We're gonna do it. And I would like I started crying. It's like there. We should have that a little bit of stress. You know, I've been, I put so much like subtle expectation and pressure on myself to like be so fucking perfect. Sometimes, and then when something goes wrong, that's when it shows me how much pressure and I expect to show how my self, and I'm like, it's not going the way it needs to be right now and then I'm just like locked up and tense. And then when it started to come together again, it was like a little tear relief, I was like, all right. You know what, let's laugh at that now. You know, I literally laughed, I was like fuck, all right. It's just part of this experience. This is gonna be part of what's gonna make it so sweet again when I step on stage. And I look good and I feel good. This is gonna be one of those little stressors. It's low moment, like the high feels so much better. It's spoken about my main little and peace beaches. But the lower parts make through better. The lower parts make the higher parts feel better. So this is just one of those moments set of fighting it, not wanting to be there, not wanting to have happened, accepting it for what it is, moving through it, and taking it as it is. So that's what we did, got it together and let it a little bit of relief. I had a little laugh, I have stress we were for about an hour and a half. I had a laugh about how much fucking food I ate in an hour and a half, just like whatever I could fit in my belly was so much food. And then yeah, that's what happened on Saturday morning when the cameras were shot because it was a bit of a chaos. Even that it's just a, it's hard to put chaos into hard to put words into the chaos I was experiencing that morning. But it's all part of the fun of body building, going part of the fun is repeating that you never know. It's gonna happen. The body does not seriously change and it doesn't list its science or biology. It just does whatever happens in that moment. Then you have to take it for what it is. Thankfully, honey's experience, you know what to do. We pulled it together and that's where we're at now. So remember all of the rest of the videos we want to give you guys a update on what happened on that Saturday morning. So hopefully you guys enjoy the rest of this video.

=== FILE: SHREDDED CHEST WORKOUT ｜ OLYMPIA PREP [P8AF8DFy1a4].txt ===

Well, Bums in the my cabin this morning, I was like walking along and I went like right in whatever the fuck this little thing is I'm comparing it now it's a bruised I'm injured This is the kind of shit I'm talking about right I'm doing it in the right now and I'm injured people make fun of me that I made it in glass I literally broke my toe with the fucking blanket on the ground I chipped over and stepped on my toe and it went black and purple I can step on it for a week It's just my life so I got to grab myself and bubble around What am I protective helmet? Can I kill myself and then I can fucking five weeks? What is up YouTube? I'm a training partner Puts in the doggo here today At the bringing over here having a panic attack on the car because she thinks she's going to the vet But just bringing her to the good old gym She loves it here, but as you get so fucking hot we have to lock her up in the air conditioned spot But they throw it to get over her. She got a fucked up little arm She's going to walk on my tail and shit so she likes the rubber flooring Yeah, it's a nice little getaway for the wet but on tour we're doing here today training chats today Good old bum lifting club Um, that's all it's going on It's Saturday it's early in the normal training a little bit but I've been having a trainer earlier in the day because Post like three four PM I got fucking no energy talk to not here by like one or two I'm fucked so If he hits a chest today, I'm not going to create a heavy Shandar really control everything so move good weight A focusy on controlling the traction so turn off some cables warm up and get going You Just to give that instead up these cables however the fucker won't hide with whatever I've ever really joined putting them in the middle of like Cross fly and then I start with the press Hit my shoulder so it will fucked up if I go like heavy to failure on a fly so I like to some depth of earth So I'll go right before failure and then I break it in a bull super close to body and I press I'm gonna finish up my pack there and it's got like no tension on my shoulders so Good way to get a stretch and I should finish this set so I You They're lucky I like you are normally in here fucking blasting old school M&M or something better than Epidemic sounds for this copyright bullshit YouTube music but it is what it is You guys were like called me a psychopath training with no music and I'm like I can't play music on YouTube So Comey psychopath but you guys would have different YouTube videos without it But I'm gonna move on to some dumbbell press. I went up to the one 50s last week So good. I got like either nine or something I'm not gonna go that heavy today because like I said I'm really trying to have really good My most connection right now and I'm getting leaner a little bit drier I bought it's getting tighter Especially my chest really tight. I just had Dr. Marlin Works for my whole chest yesterday so I don't want to like fucking the apps. I'm gonna do like 140s You're trolling a bit more still trying to get like eight to nine reps and then Go back up to that so You Bums into my fucking Cabin this morning. I was like walking along and when like right in Whatever the fuck this little thing is under my tricep Fucking hurt now. It's a bruise I'm injured This is the kind of shit I'm talking about where I fucking do anything right now And I'm injured people make fun of me that I made a fucking glass I literally broke my toe with the fucking blanket on the ground. I chipped over Sceptone my toe and it went black and purple like in step on it for a week. It's just my life so I got a fucking wrap myself and bubble around Put in my protective helmet And now I'll kill myself and next fucking five weeks You You You Either I guess really correctly that I was gonna need a nine reps Or put itself limiting belief on myself my body limit me a nine reps, but I got a nine rep Good, I was still super controlled I never wrap even the last one Locked it in just like I wanted It's not really good my Chess was taking over everything arm the chicep stuck it not too activated Exactly what I wanted we try to get the exact same amount of reps with 10 pounds later now My muscular endurance Strength endurance, but it was fucking one call it The start of the decline solve a good amount of strength right now My ability to sustain it's really what yeah was fucking dropping so I'm just gonna keep pushing what I can Trying new things 130 next I do drop that and watch it You You I don't think I've shown this piece on my youtube yet. I'm only a powerful chest out here But we just got this piece in like a few weeks ago I love it because a lot of the new pieces don't have converging They're honestly like self-sip converging non converging But the point of the Tach is to bring the elbow across the body so the direction drive you're gonna a little bit closer My favorite machine is a flex leverage played low to machine. I'd never even heard of this one I think it's not a list which is like the same ship pretty much, but it feels amazing so I'm super happy we got this For crap because the one that we're buying is very similar but it feels weird to Hear muscle literally just but like we gotta find you something today to use a flat press That was a good hurt my shoulder So I'm gonna be moving on to this That's pretty fucking heavy to a mic just replace drop it down just more volume but this is even number three Kid Like Oil She's hard to get in, narrow, but I feel so damn good. This is like the cheat code tech fly. So we didn't do any blind one and this one I think we should do if you set them the flat. It feels like it's sitting a little bit more full. But my chest a little bit less front doubt. Maybe it's going to tighten or whatever. So I'm going to pump out three or four sets of these, get some nice volume in and move on. Also, I never wear fucking this shit anymore, but we have no my boy David laid. I love me some David laid some magic tricks together. Remember the OG YouTube days. You should be magic tricks and she set me so with this club with Jim Shark so try it on. We love and these tight tank tops in this Florida heat just feeling like there's not like sweaty, but moving on you. So we're giving shot. It feels good. It's good to be polite. So we should have David hopefully get him out to the Jim soon and we can get it working. We should have taken a beer and some show me some more magic tricks. He's taking it now, he's taking some here. This shop is so cool. He's having a drink. We can put his drink easily on the grill. So did the deep butter full of spice. He didn't stretch after his Cola Beer. He lifted someone out of the bowl and started the boxing camp. After two Mini Stars for Vietnamese living performances. I gave him a massage. Because they get tired and lazy and I have that much of a beginner. I got a long neck of the long spine. I've been long neck over here like the late before time. So I always get stuck like this and make chest and really tight. I sleep on my side, I'll just fuck. So now I'm gonna finish off my chest. Workouts with some of the last few sets holding in a stretch. So I'm gonna do like dips now, like two sets, body weight. There's one more thing and at the end of each set like that I'm gonna hold it in the stretch. I'm really just trying to make sure at the end of my chest, we'll get my stretch by the chest that's open and wide. It's stretched out rather than a hunched over and tight. So let me try to do that more, stretching more, all the bullshit that. We all know we need to do that we don't do it. So maybe I'll actually do it five weeks and then never do it again till next prep. So I was Calvin pointed out I'm not an idiot doing dips in the middle of the machine. It's just the newer version of the dip attachment with the older squat. I can't talk cage. I was fucked up in the style that you can see by 10 feet tall too. Sadly the bars don't fit the other way so I have to move everything, put them in the middle, trying to smash my face on the middle of the bar. But we're now doing decline pass with the put on a machine over there. We're just at the end of everything with chest work, get a little chryse up a little bit of peck minor and scoop that up there. So this is gonna be probably second life thing. Do a fly stretch and then call it a day, probably with dips and abs, hopefully. I'm not trying to actually do a working set there in just Marlin with Caprax with some struggles to like stretch my peck. A lot of times like I just have muscle that's fucking tight and it's pulling my biceps up where my daltre something. So he said she's going to a really deep stretch with a lighter weight than you normally do like a fly and then just like move through that with a deep stretch and normally you do it because normally if I'm doing flies with like 60 plus or whatever I'm a lot more cautious of how low I'm going because I don't want to hurt myself but if I take 30s, 40s just let it stretch as far as I can and you can track the muscle in that stretch position. I'm actually training that muscle to work in that stretch position rather than just sitting in stretch therefore also helping your mobility even better. Trying to give me a fucking open up a little bit more so we're trying it out. Ryan Terry told me that his best ab exercise hanging leg raises in knee raises. So all I do is hanging leg raises in knee raises maybe my abs will look like Ryan Terry. That's how it works. Very true. I mean ship when you see like all the guys from the 90s that have like the sick abs it would just be hanging to fucking hang leg raises like all the time. Yeah yeah. Mealow swears by him like I think that's the thing. A big lot of him did is because he just looked sick. Yes, he didn't pull her she's like, he's like, yeah like that. Yeah, he's such a good photo. Yeah they look good or it works. Either way you're winning. It's funny like from doing a lot of those I thought my like abs strength was good like doing lots of like rope crunches like machine crunches. The cable rope crunches like like racing stuff. Now I'm trying to do like bodyweight shit. It's like my bodyweight which is lighter but it's like impossible. You know the friend. Yeah like mechanic for everything just blown a lot of the lower work shit that's like on the floor like you just use my bodyweight and so much harder fucking completely different. You go and you like, but men's with you guys who like when they're on stage fucking fully like yeah that's hard for that long. All right it's gonna be wrap on the today's chest day. The little abs did a little stretching on my inversion table and we had to run over to the warehouse which is so far away from my gym it's like in a different city so it sucks. But we had to come over here because Ian had a package ship too. He's even Mario this one chip challenge shift over here because he's a fucking psycho pass and he's gonna eat the world's hottest chip on the weekend and he's not doing it here because I'm not fucking even you know breathe that shit in. This Calvin looked one when we were in Dallas and he should have passed the next day and it was fucking burning but so that's that. But I also had to come over here because we were launching this is kind of the small thing but so school updated Bumbox for mega-fit meals. It's going to make a signature on there switch it up a little bit, a little bit cleaner. I like simplicity so we get the simple. But we're gonna be running a little bit of a promo. They're gonna be launching some new meals. It's gonna be salmon and rice of Apache steak meal which is fucking fire and a new peanut butter and jelly in the Bumbox. So you guys can add some different types of meals there if you want. But when we launched the new box and the new meals and shit inside there we're gonna be giving away the first 150 orders they're gonna get signed signature of a signature thing. Post there whatever the fuck you want to call anything. So I gotta sign fucking all of these. That'll be fun. This is where I signature become the C.B. instead of a C-bomb. Say half the time. Well yeah so that's gonna be wrap on today's video. Oh yeah. I don't know. That's all that's going on. I just checked down a shake. Get it going home. Some food and I'll see you guys in the next video. So peace.

What the fuck man? I didn't have it in me. So you were tiring? Yes. You throw over him. Come on, Chris! Come on, you moron! We come on, let me in, Jim. Come on. Let's go, Jim. You're so sick! It's not really bad. Really? Really? It smells like... You know like that smell? Like there's sweat on like a rubber like mat? Like that's what you smell like. I mean, I think the fuck did Chad move too. You fucking asshole. I could tell a lot of things are here feeling too, but I can hold those in to be nice. I'm trying to make people know what it's like right now. What is up YouTube? They've one of those days where I missed a month or two months of time to have too many appointments and I slept like shit and people are meeting me in the parking line. I'm talking about business when I come to the gym and it's just like, I'm tired of this bullshit today. I kind of like that, so I'm trying to fucking tune it out. If you're who you're like, I'm building my energy back up. Because I was fucking about to fall asleep, but now we go back up. I'm like, I don't have five left, five quad days left until the last day. So I know time the bitch out, I've got to gather my shit. Not be skinny bitch. Don't be so skinny. Put that in my mind. But it's like day four and a half, if I have five and a half weeks, I don't even know anymore, but it's getting close. It's great. I'm turning off the Clarkson Shins, I was on the treadmill walking backwards. Four of them and warm up my knees. That helps me so much. When I start exercising, it just hurt way less. So, if any of you do do that for like five minutes, a little warm up, if you're a blood flow and high-resistant, I'm going to run up the knees and then I come on here. Creek's off a little bit on the quad extension. And then we'll do a few presses. Call it a day. And let's see. I took a lot of bruer ke with a lot of bait out in today. And itching, sweaty. I was cold now, I'm hot. I'm hot. I'm going to take the hoodie off. I'll be a merch coming soon. What was a very subtle ray on black, this paint fit is pretty. I really like subtle monochromatic shit right now. So, that's a pity. Got a good pick that off. This is a shirt, champion mentality, a lot of bigas on the back. Pressure the pretty much. Can't even tell me. She put the mindset together for the final drop before they won't be up. This is a good final drop for a while of things. It's a pretty much a lot after. So, we're doing a cool one hoodie for the crew neck. Here are the t-shirts. Another piece that we've never dropped before. So, I'm pumped about that. We're finally getting it all in today and tomorrow. I'm going to shoot it. So, you guys, I don't know what I'm taking. But the merch shop we were saying. We're shooting it tonight. Shooting it tonight. Yeah. Shooting it tonight. This is a day to the, so you guys will see everything soon. But, yeah. So. I'm here with the people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you have to say about all the people I think you're going to retire now? I've figured it out. I've figured it out. I've figured it out. I've got a lot to say about that. But I don't know if I can get into it already now. I'm going to start as a random video with that. But it's like, I thought I'd have to. I don't really want to get into it. I couldn't even let the leg work out. So. I don't know what I think actually. I'm saying it's going to be the yellow in the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. s I started doing these in a much different light position. You threw higher, narrow of wide and move around. But now I've brought my feet a lot lower on the pad. And pretty wide. And it's kind of forces my full back to stay on the pad here before you get a bit of a bit of a bit of a big none here. Fuck my little back when I pushed you hard. That left me keep my back on the pad. And it dropped me onto like a hip press. So I can push from like my upper quad and upper quad here. So I'm kind of building that quad sweep, rather than like getting glue very easily. So I don't know, works for my quad. I'm trying to slow down a little bit at the bottom of the wrap. I've got a bouncing, but I still like the bounces, like jumps. So that's the both worlds. I'm going to get a lot harder. I'm not sure if we're going to be really moving today. Like seven a.m. or just seven a.m. work. I'm going to keep my balance. I'm going to get a lot harder. I'm going to start working out early in the day. Like seven a.m. work. Just. I'm going to keep my balance. I can't keep going. I can't keep going. You're fine. Three go. Two go. I'm going to really like this. I think it's like it's like it's a different thing right now, but they love me to really like, open my hips and go deep. I don't like how I'm trying to do that, but I'm going to keep it a little bit lower on the. Hacks why? I'm going to get it from like, the a great emotion right now. So I'm not like getting tight to spot, especially then like getting leaner and tighter. I'm going to keep like stretching and contracting my muscles fully. Especially my legs keep that like size and you start to get that like separation. Up into my hips and everything. Keep kind of pressed like this, help with that a little bit. So we're doing that. It's a bit too much machine putting plates on and off. Especially when it's not around that's what. It's all part of the game. Burning calories. So probably feel like templates on here and then give her a whirl. We're having a fucking plate there. But I don't think. Oh, I thought it'd be worth it. Committed now. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to go with 10 reps right now. I think my head's been, I got 10 reps. I think he's counting the weights. I thought I got a score. Who did that then? Five. I thought I'd do this one. I'm not going to lie. I've been stretching. And foam rolling. Six out of every day of the week. Six out of seven days a week. I feel so much better. This is the first prep I've done that consistently at this point. And doing shit like this right now. I'm fucking exhausted. But normally I stick my fucking quad. They're still tight. They're going to rip off the bone. So if you're good right now. And I'm getting deeper separation. Earlier out then I normally get my quad. So who would have done that? I've only cut it a thousand times on my channel and heard it a million times. They're stretching it beneficial. And you train hard, but who would have thought it actually can't help? It's really not iron. What the fuck man? I didn't have it in me. I thought you'd have good hip mobility. Otherwise I would have hurt myself. And you have to have a little big lift to camera man who's quick on his feet to come help. Oh, almost a deficit above my dead gas. I don't have to retire yet. Don't worry. I was recording a whole clip too. Did you? Fuck. I just shot that with no clue. This is not happening. My life flash before my eyes. I'm feeling a little bit sadistic. That's the right word. What you're doing when you like to hurt yourself? To just stick or massage messages. It doesn't matter. I felt like getting myself some little gerions now. I thought you just didn't feel like loading anything up with any more questions. I just wanted to say that. But I was just a little bit sadistic. I thought you were just a little bit sadistic. I just wanted to say that. I just wanted to say that. I just wanted to say that. I felt like getting myself some little gerions now. I thought you just didn't feel like loading anything up with any more plates. Too much movement. So dumbbells are dead, Bulgarians. Flash press moving it like that. Then move on to some doctorate. Get some good girls. Get some good girls. All right. Bulgarians completely. Three sets there. Everything else I did to two sets. They were a little bit heavier and more like intense. Bulgarians, because of that, the end of my workout. I can definitely do 140, 115y. It's 120. Three sets, a little bit more volume. And that's it for the heart heavy shit. I'm finishing off a little bit of calves. And the doctor is ringing. I'm going to do a little bit of workout. I'm going to do a little bit more volume. And that's it for the heart heavy shit. I'm finishing off a little bit of calves. And the doctor is ringing out. So they just both make my doctor like pop. How they get leaner. So, you know, I'll bring it over to find details of my legs. I think I should have done a triple away. Special with all the cardio and everything I'm doing. He's like these are very important. That my legs don't just turn into like little quick. They've got to make a weight too. So balancing all that out of the leg. I think they're coming along. My legs look better than they've looked in a few years. So they're excited to see the final product from my stage. So they're excited to see the final product from my stage. You don't have to get that angle. Yep. So. So you're retiring? Yes. You're so over here. I'm done. I'm done. I find it actually very funny. I'm resting now on calves. So how is that? We're flutting on everything in my life forever. Everyone's like, because my mindset is different than most people of my stage. I'm not going to get into what they think it means to win. People think I'm like done. Our last message. I don't care anymore. I've all the other interests and I don't have it in me anymore. But like the true secret to winning. That the all you have to do is win. Doesn't matter if you're fucking Michael Jordan and you. You're covering heads off and think you're better than everyone else. I think people hate that I don't have that mindset of like the typical like a aggressive fucking cocky arrogant winner. And I'm very realistic. And I think I don't like losing the word, but I think in a spiritual way. Not many people in my level are like kind of spiritual in the sense of being like, I truly understand that I have no control. I have any help from. Can't even hear myself in the gym. But I have no control of any outcome. I can control what I work. But you know what I really hard to have no control put in my mind. Probably I'm going to put a muscle, but it's not. It's no matter how hard I do that and die and everything. I have a chance of winning me. If you're not guaranteed to win, I have all of those. I don't really have bodybuilding. I never have a bodybuilding. I don't need anything in my life except fucking like the basic accessories. Doesn't mean I don't love it. Doesn't mean I don't have a fire inside and you'll give it back to me in the world. And the fucking continued to be the best in the world. But because I don't talk like that people are like, oh, he blocks his head. He doesn't want to run away from me anymore. Mother fuck, I guess what I've done three would get mindset. And I used to think I had to act like this tough guy who fucking, I'm depressed, but I want to channel up here. I mean, if everyone's asking all this shit, they wouldn't do I am. Now I just know who I am. I know what drives me. I know what I want. And I'm going to make them more at peace with life. It's funny that now I'm going to compete for a hell of a longer. Because I'm authentically being myself in the way I act. And thinking my own brains grow. And you'll go for ten. Maybe you'll retire before this year's one. Maybe you wouldn't even get on stage. Who the fuck knows? But today's leg day, and I'm going to get some huge caps today. So I mean, I don't know that. And the train heart might not even get big cause probably not. I don't know. Alright, come on, go to go. Because he's a busy man. And he's got a run of shit that we're going to do. So I'm going to meet him there a little bit. I'm going to finish a few more sets of the calves. And I actually have to do stairs now. So RIP to my legs. You do a little bit on the step mill. Stair separate of fucking one call it. I'm going to let him eat and me tell him for the shoot. Are we filming that at all? Yep. That's a bit. So I guess I'll see you guys in like, take watch or clock in an hour. Check for ten things. You're like, not trying to do this like. Oh, oh. So maybe I put your spell on the ground and then you turn it over. Like that thing. So you're going to start. You're finally learning how to use the canvas of action. Yes, I do. Can we get a live physique update? Yeah, for sure. I'll do it in the pool and spread everyone. Exactly what I'm going to do. How's it look? It looks like you're the looks that you're holding a light saber. It's not like a blind date. Like the coach yelling from the sidelines. Angry dad who failed. That's a sport high school quarterback who's yelling at his. Used to bench for a five. Used to back in the day. Back in the day. Back in the day. No. Now I'm nothing. So we are at the official Steven Fitton shoot. Calvin went a little bit overboard and brought like 20 people. I just let him take over. I'm seven or eight. Calvin's a director of a vision now for a photo shoot. So we have a lot of people here. But we actually have like a full crew of men and women. I was the last time. She'll have a woman. I want to see guys in the picture. The right final. Poor guys in the picture. So we have all different types of men and women. And I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. Because they're shooting here. Two in the back yard of Dom's beautiful home. They get a nice whole aesthetic. Sadly, one of the most crucial parts didn't come in. We had pants. We had sweatpants. I don't know why I'm looking at. We had sweatpants coming in. And they got delayed in the UPS. But everyone was here and the shoot was planned. So we went ahead and we're going to have to add those in a little bit after. But we're going to get all this stuff out. And show you guys everything that's coming. I'm wearing the go to church right now. Let me see that. Yeah. This is going to be the best shirt I've ever. Make this to a stick here in a bottle. No hat. Everything. The model to live by don't be a skinny bitch. So stay tuned. We'll show you guys everything in the upcoming.

=== FILE: THE BEST SHOULDER PUMP ｜ 2 WEEKS OUT [cxO9ghpl4FE].txt ===

What is up YouTube? We are just about almost two weeks out the Olympia which is crazy. Time is flying by right now actually kind of scary but yeah it's like it's kind of hamstring back date not really quad day but it's gonna be a good day and I've been making this delicious pre-workout concoction so I'm gonna share that and give you guys a little update what's going on. I'm gonna hit the gym axle still here so we're gonna hit that workout I think he's leaving me in a few days but I told him if he wants to say longer and keep training he's been helping me push a lot so I'm always welcome to push and the positive energy so yeah I got a corny cleaned up this house a little bit and moved everything so I'm gonna have to search for this pre-workout and once that's I'll be right back. Alright so here we go I got a meal ready with me ready to rock and roll putting it eat a whole throw kill but pre-workout this has been what I've been combining lately I've been doing essential pre-blue raspberry with raw pump lemonade flavor and then some pumpscores to just bless her all but this combo makes I mean prep-rated yes I know but this combo makes like a blue raspberry lemonade flavor and it tastes unbelievable and two would make the caffeine right now it's good enough to get me going and then it gives me like fucking tanker and the citrillion good old bunch of bit out and you need to get my face scratching off and some nice focus and everything so great pump good energy good focus and I've been loving the flavor but that's what's going on yeah I also had a high carb day yes today and then it was funny I just was like reflecting on like the way my mind processed and changes so much when I'm really tired I'm like carb depleted my brain like doesn't function and I don't think I don't check my phone just like not doing anything and then yesterday I had a bunch of carbs I had a bunch of energy I went into the office and there are a bunch of like changes were doing but stuff went off a Ross new employee we were interviewing that was coming through out of him down on Sarah at the same time when we were talking to her and just a bunch of stuff going on and then night comes and I'm like my brain is just spinning of everything now I'm like I used to go to bed just so tired so brain dead now my brain just spinning and it just made me think of like processes of my mind how it changes and how at the beginning of my practice here I was stressing about all these like tiny little things that everything was gonna be like fucking falling apart and it was just like a difficult beginning of prep and then it went to like kind of brain dead shut everything out to this and now all the stuff sparring back in and it's like good stuff it's business and it's busy but it's just so fascinating how we get caught in these waves of thoughts and feelings and thinking that there are everything and it's like our reality but it's just our current perception of where we're at in that part of our life or that's whatever it's going on and how quickly they change and the more you can be aware of this change and understand that it comes and then it goes and these thoughts and these feelings that come and they go the ups and downs that come and they go and not getting stuck in it and letting yourself make rash big decisions are just living in that kind of mode is something that's like super helpful and I saw this quote that was a wrote down a while ago and it pulled up on my phone I saw it today it kind of related to that and it says you are going to suffer if you believe that the way things are shouldn't be that the way holy shit my brain cut that Calvin restart you are going to suffer if you believe that the way things are shouldn't be the way that they are and it's essentially just being like things are it things happen as they happen that can't happen either way except it as they are and as they come except it and as they go except it when I was in the mode of like shit was feeling really tough and I was like he was the one to be a prop is like taking too much other than me and now I'm in a great play and I was kind of fighting and I was like he's meant to be shall be doing this ballad on all this like stuff kind of in my head like just kind of doubt and force me to bust out the no equipmentality because I needed it then and now I've been in a really good groove I've been putting my energy and focus on this and I'm like I could do this I feel good right now I could keep going I could go for 10 of these probably not 10 but it's just fascinating how you kind of fight things when they're bad and then when they're good you almost don't remember but they're like when they're bad and you just think it's expected to be good all the time but it will never be good all the time you kind of got to ride through those tough spots understand that one last forever and when you are in a good groove like I am right now choosing to consciously be present and be grateful for where I am at right now because these good streaks don't last forever it's just really important otherwise you just get stuck hopefully on the negative all the time and you feel like life is miserable so that would make cardio or flushing this morning and then party I try not to go on my phone the morning and I just like think and reflect and that's kind of what was going through my head just I felt good when I woke up before I taste the meat as you guys can see I've brought more energy right now too herbs are an amazing thing but I want to show you this good it's actually funny I don't know how much you guys give a shit about my life outside of I don't know what I'm doing but this is some funny shit like I got in the mail I was trying to find like a dope black day boutique surgery and I ordered this and I realized it with a fake account it was like shop MLB.com's of MLB shop.com and I panic like cancel my credit cards that I was gonna get at and this is just like the cheapest like that's what was being embroidered patch and it's just printed on like that and it's just the cheapest shittyest thing from China and at least I didn't get my credit card hack but I ordered this like dope chemo one two and it just came in like gray and just so fake so that was pretty comical in my opinion don't order a shit off fucking fake website that's a cancel like credit card two and you'll be brutal but I also got this back to June from good old Johnny Mac and impossible kicks these guys always make me up a shoes and the one piece coming up so he needs to get a price pair of kicks to get it now big old sneaker headed almost shoes are in surgery now because we are in our rental so already gets up there he's already last low Travis Scott turned one that I did not have so huge tanks who impossible kicks for seven knees up they're an old shoe but they're beautiful and I just loved the lows because I have small ankles and when we're high socks just part of the way my style is and I love the color blue cream blue can't be beat so huge tanks who possible kicks for that maybe rock the hits to the gym today don't know how many color my outfits so I can wear blue shoes but yeah that's what's going on if you guys can hear I got some Assassin's Creed in the background I told you I said it my PS5 is a gym but it wouldn't connect to the internet and I heard that the new Assassin's Creed was apparently like the old one I haven't gained it a really long time so I brought it here and I've been gaming a little bit of Assassin's Creed on the PS5 here and I fell in love with this game for Assassin's Creed 2 in like 2008 or when I was at that came out and since then the game's got kind of two intense and two long and they're like this huge open world games that take like I don't know it would take me 10 years to finish and I just don't have 10 years to play with your game to have three weeks of prep left so I downloaded this one and it's been fun so far and it does great to kill time in between meals so that's a little update on my life with going on right now it is already one o'clock so I'm gonna head to the gym meet Axel, crush him legs and yeah I thought it's going on so peace for my shoulders I actually have to hammer strength press you know what that means one o'clock he said eight 10 reps in reserve zero the joy to fail I just guess exactly that I remember I googled it all right so I introed this video yesterday but then we didn't film so kept the what is up YouTube and played the intro that Calvin already had but uh yesterday was hamstrings it was a nice little workout like it's a nice and sorted a little bit of back too honestly just super fucking grateful that's weathered been so nice it's like 57 60 degrees in the morning and then like 80 during the day and beautiful here instead of like 110 so definitely helping me train a lot but sadly this is Axel's last day here so we're finishing with the good old shoulder workout some of the heat needs to work on his coach says apparently so yeah we're gonna try and get some new shoulders and have a good old day these guys must love the weather again imagine

It's hard to walk. Plastic. We went one set of this. It's one of the Tom Plats guests. I mean, you're close. All right. I mean, my fancy little share right now. I feel so elegant with my legs crossing this chair. But me and Calvin are just filming some YouTube shorts. A little bit of a Q&A. Those are going to be going up on YouTube. Sorry. I'm going to be going up on YouTube in the YouTube shorts section. Maybe they'd like 19 questions or something. Enough to get us every day up to the one. If you have to leave us a plan, maybe one after. But yeah, that's what's going on. We just finished up a back workout. Eat some fish and rice. Kim rate over here. And film that. And then sadly, oxles heading in a town tonight. So maybe we're going to have some steak and a spare guess for something tonight. Take a bite. But it's been really good having him working out with him. It reminds me of like the good old bullshit days of just fucking getting the gym fucking shit up. You know, he's not. He's just a good positive dude and one of my best friends and Transired strong and he's not really involved in any of the business stuff we have going on. So I can like separate the two and go into bodybuilder mode and it's just really nice to have that. Like I talked about before, just like this simple bodybuilding sometimes is just going in. Fucking up a workout eating your chicken rice. Taking an app. It's just definitely to get too complicated. You just got to fuck shit up and enjoy it. So it was really good to train with them. It kind of put me in a great mindset and at three weeks out was kind of my last week of pushing heavy weight and heavy workouts. So I started to delete really hard and just trying to get through it. So it's perfect timing. And yeah, that's all it's going on. So peace out. We'll catch you guys later. Thanks for watching.

=== FILE: THE END IS HERE ｜ SHOW DAY FINALE [vXB3IS3i5Dk].txt ===

All right here with the new classic LLB team, who is two times lancing to the B and champ Chris Bumstein. Here by three times I'll let the champion Chris Bumstein Chris get into the end buddy. Four times I'll let the champion Chris. Four times here we are Chris. Talk about it last year we talked about it this year we've done many many interviews throughout the entire series of the striker five is finally done by Fred five time on the B and champ you folks. I was gonna sell brother. Yeah, I think we'll die if we. It's hard to say sweeter than their old special but this one really really special there. Anyone close to me knows how special this one is. You know, I'll get that out of the way. The lot they went into the last few years we completely honest. Some physical girls but it's been a lot of mental emotional girls. I know not only one who faces some trial and tribulation, nobody believes given me so much. It's a road full of ups and downs as of the every single life. I was learning to really enjoy the moment and the journey you guys have been into. A lot of people don't have the opportunity to enjoy the moments so they look back and be like they're going to go through and they're like, that was like I wish I'd been a little more present and draw that over. I think this year I wanted to add to my champion mentality concept and it told myself that I wasn't going to nominate my emotions, suppress everything I felt you still wouldn't know. I'd rather experience this whole process and do that. Life really tested me when I said that. I just share this because I want people to know that life's up and down. It's going to have you know quit but not giving up on yourself. I feel leaning on the people you love enjoying the goddamn journey. 3. We'll get a little closer. We'll be the burger. I just need to try to find out what time they get on stage. Andrew. And... Salt calculation. On the crack scale. That's good. Yeah. And just burger or whatever. Here comes the burger. Okay, so 7.45. That's a pretty bad one. A lot of things. You can do that. You know, backstage. Great. Don't keep it. Can you lift it? What? Great. This is different. It's very quiet. I just can't go to turn off the food. Everything's pillow. You don't get it. Perfect. Sweet. Okay. Nice. You got me. There's one in here. I have it. Just like watching a drink these things. Yeah. It's right. Refresh. You're going to be showing it. Hold on. There you go. Ready to go. Ready to go. You're going to bring out the spin. I'm going to bring all the food burgers. You're going to push it. Yep. You good? You're not going to. Yeah. And your suit. Good. Good. Excuse me. Please. I'm over in the page. Good. To all figure out what's up. Yeah. Good. Just put a check in here. Check out the places. John, off. Yeah. Check out the gear. Okay, guys. I'm going to do it up. Love you. Bye. I'll see you tonight. Okay. I'm going to look at you. You're going to be driving out. I can hear a bit of thank you. I'm just going to put that on. You're going to go in pretty good again. You're going to go in. Go in. Go out. Go out. Go out. Go in. Go. Go out. Go. Go out. Go out. Go out. Go. Go. Go. Come on, get in there. There you go. Everything. Good. Nice. You know there's a lot of change from the aspect. When you first met him to now. Yeah, his mindset completely changed. You saw that he became more mature in terms of knowing that he is the champ and that he has to do what the champ has to do. So everything changed at this point. The second, he won the Olympia. Then people who are unsure that he was actually the winner. So he had something to prove and then he understood that he is the champ. Chris at its best. He's the best in the world and he understood that the mindset has to come with that and he started grow mentally. His physique just went along and that was really inspiring to watch us somebody going from you know Ottawa little place going from being just a normal guy to Mr. Olympia. Still being a normal guy just has humble as it gets. Have a lot of humility and just rose with that and without changing who he actually is in the circle. Beautiful. Every time we get on prep or training together the goal is to be mindful. You have to be present with me or I don't want to train with you. So Chris had to be present in every workout. And if you're present we are only in a gym, only you and me and the weights. If he's good we're here we're now so life is amazing. Just focus on me, focus on your set. And that's what everything just happened. Every time we trained together it was just locked in. It's not in his mind, he's in the present state and that's what really changed. And you know now he's just he's doing that without the gym and you can see that he's growing as a person and 24 seven now. Really bad. See you tonight. Another battle. Are you? What's your intimate step? I don't know where I am. I'm going to keep that to your ground. That's fine. I'm going to do it. See you tonight. What? I'm going to do it. What? I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Which is better. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Oh, I wrote this whole fucking thing and you put some new touch on the back. I can't even do it. Maybe get in your hand? Got it. Go get the best ones you have. I want to help you. Don't иде yourself. Maybe get behind the door. From Tuesday. Going to hell. Ive thought that the woman went. There's it. I have deeper point of view,points and roads are all in between. I almost want to work with honey just to find out what to talk to itself with the potatoes. I don't know what to do with the potatoes. I don't know. Is it one day maybe when we're all the type of secret about them? I got sure of it. There's literally a problem. I mean, there's a secret now. I'll make that maybe. I'll make it up by the way. This is just my grave as you may know. There's not. There's not. Sorry, cold murder it is. There was no water. Oh, we got ice chips. All he wants is water. He said fucking food. Yeah, like so hungry, I'll prep. And all cravings are deleted from eating 15 pounds of potatoes. And like, well, I enjoy burger. I'm like, okay, we'll eat a cold, hard burger. But nothing on it. I'm like, sorry. You can't miss my steams. I think over the years, the biggest thing I've ever eaten. I think over the years, the biggest thing I've seen him do is the ability to stay really present and really grounded throughout hardship. Because it seems like every year there has been something that's happened, whether he's torn his hamstring, torn his bicep, torn his lat, family, you know, personal relationship shit. Just a bunch of things. And this year, even like, ah, she was a 10 weeks out, nine, even when he tore his lat, of course he's human. He had his moment of being like, fuck, what am I going to do? I tore my lat, like, how I came and trained with a torn lat. And he was able to not not focus on that and keep pushing forward and persevering. And it was, it wasn't like fake. It wasn't like, oh, fake until you make it. I'm just going to keep trying to put a smile on and enjoy this. Like, he felt, he felt his pain physically emotionally, but he was still able to be like, I'm going to do this head down. So he was very present, even during the pain. It made it like, it made his journey, I feel so much more special and being able to soak up all the good, all the bad, everything. Oh, yeah, oh my god, you look like those faggabs are so hard. She's this. Yeah. Your chest looks full, I too. Yeah. Yeah, hold that, just don't drink water. It looks like you're not drinkin' water. Okay. I just want to sit down. I'm going to go. I'm going down. Now the cookie, the rest. Oh God, that was good. let's go I don't know what the weather is. I'm just... Yeah. I just had to pass the road. I don't know what to do. I know a lot. I have plenty to do. I can't hold the weather. Yeah. When you make songs, like, you're walking, like, you're walking, like, you're walking, like, shutting your mouth, all in the water. I can't hold the weather. I can't hold the weather. I'm just going to go to the park. So, I'm just going to go to the park. I'm just going to go to the park. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. No. My dreams. Just stop it, don't go out. I haven't felt this excited since the first Olympia that I ever competed at, you know? When I qualified the first time for myself in 2018, I was like, it's that big shiny new fucking Olympia, it's like, man, I'm so excited to be there. That's that feeling I'm having again, and I'm just like, it feels like a whole new show. When you're competing there, it's one thing, it's exciting to be there, especially when you're really competing at the top of the sport, there's an excitement to it. But over time, your priorities change. Your priorities of what, and I kept using this war room during the podcast, I've filled changes over time. And right now, that shift is more into being there as a fan, as a friend and a supporter, a supporter for Chris, like for family like that, or for other friends that I have in the show. And like you said, I haven't seen Chris on stage, it's 2019. It's either I've been watching him on the live stream, which I could be the same as I was at a 6,000 miles away, even on the five last of the road. So with the conflicting schedules, I never really got to see that. So I'm really excited to see him kill out up there, and just to be there in a different capacity this year. Because the years that we were working together is when I was coaching him, obviously this is a different dynamic, in different levels of pressure, and different levels of how it affects you from a personal impact, and then you're trying to compete yourself. And then this few last year he was with Hawny, and I was there myself, and I never even saw him. So just to be there and just to like enjoy that full process and watch him and Hawny do their thing and just to be there in any way that I can to help or support and just watch him on stage. And it's very, very exciting for me for sure. It was a bit like watching him kind of like prep with Hawny and stuff like that. It's been awesome. I mean, you know, you can tell when something's like two people jailed. You can see it anyone who has watched their videos together, see their little fucking banter back and forth. And like you can see there's a good rapport, a good relationship built there. You know, and me being someone that's been in the sport as long as I have, even not having work with them, like I have an immense trust in Hawny for sure. Like I don't think Chris could be in any better hands. You know, so obviously just caring about him as family, you know, you obviously want to make sure that there's someone that's like doing them the best and I never doubt that for a second with it being Hawny. You know, and obviously last year, you know, was indicative even just from not even the best hand standpoint, but best hand standpoint from like just a peak in physique look, you know, was definitely as one of his best or definitely as best look, you know, conditioning fullness, like just Christmas, like, you know, so to see that, it's like it was honestly like a not a sigh of relief because I had no doubts in Hawny, but it's like, fuck, we, I made, like we both made the right call and that, you know, one in terms of, you know, the impact that it could potentially have on our relationship with then also knowing that he keys in the best hands possible and he's up there fucking killing it at a whole new level, which, you know, look, I'm confident my coaching to a point, but when you're trying to like win multiple Olympias and not even just win multiple Olympias, be better every Olympia. You know, there's one thing to just show up every year the exact fucking same and win Olympias, but when you get to that point, like when you're already winning, what's next up to be better, to be better, to be better in your competing against yourself, you're chasing your own self, you know. So, to see that he was able to achieve that with Hawny last year was very gratifying feeling for me for sure. That's one. Yeah, there we go. No, no, I was telling him to get out of your way, brother. Tell me up here. Yes, sir. One, two, three, six, twenty, two, twenty-seven, play eight and thirty-one. Hold a turn to the right. Hold a turn to the right. And face through. Side check. Back double mindset. That's it, Chris. Hold it. That's it. There you go, Chris. Thank you, gentlemen. Back in line. Back to you, Bob. All right, take a big spin. Yeah, boy, I was saying that. Here we are, Chris. We talked about it last year. We talked about it this year. We've done many, many interviews throughout the entire season. The strive for five is finally done by friend. I'm really special. I've had a mantra every prep I've gone through. I wanted to add to my champion mentality concept. I was going to know my emotions. I was going through some shifts and I started to shut down. I was going to feel it. I was going to lean on the people I love. I felt honey. I was like, I don't know if I can do this. I will love you no matter what you do, what we believe in you. I felt me up as courage to keep going. I remember it was probably four weeks after that. I had a good work. I'm going to cry again in this time of the gratitude. I had quit, but I had none. I don't share this for pity or to make it seem like a hard prep. I just share this because I want people to know that. Life's up and down. I'm going to have you know quit, but not giving up on yourself. I'm leaning on the people you love and enjoying the goddamn journey. I'm just being long for the experience. Thank you guys so much for six years. The past five years of my life has taken years of the community. I've been so integrated. It made some of the greatest ways. It's just like an imagine in this sport. You guys have been loving the league. It's my life and there. Jim, Debbie, everyone's dance all in there here. I just thank you guys so much for this beautiful thing. My team, honey. I couldn't do this. I'm currently my fiance. I love you so much. You're the strength behind me. My mom, my dad, Matti, Calvin, boys, everybody. I think love you guys so much. And I'm so grateful to be up here. So thank you guys so much for everything. Let's enjoy the night. Have a fun weekend. So thank you. Chris, I got nothing to add. That's one of the two champion ones. I gave you no strangers in a winter circle. No signs of slowing down. Anytime soon, people keep basting. If you hit one more year and you're Chris, you're going to keep going. If you want you to go to the open. Probably isn't a bad idea. Maybe it's some point. 400 thousand good reasons to do that, right? Jake's thumbs up. That's all for it. But I'm just going to let you enjoy this moment, my friend. So no questions about the future. No questions about the C-pop standard. Just enjoy being in your fine time. I'll let you a champion by the front. I'll pop your hair on the plate and post it. I'm so glad you're late. C-pop, fine time champion. We're going to get first interviews right here. Thank you. I got to know you said you know. I love you. I love you. I love you. No questions. Thank you. You're a great one. You're a great one. I'm just going to go. You're a lot to mind. I think you're going to be okay. You're a great one. You're a great one. Thanks. You said I might have said you speak to a foreigner? Brospeed? Fine, fine. We're both in this funny battle, I think. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? I don't know. What? What? There you go. What? What? What? God's name. God's name. Yeah. Where's the station? Oh, there's something. I didn't know that angle you. You probably did. I probably looked like I'm short of the... Yeah. There's so many photos of me out there. I'm just like stepping in. And I'm always on the map. Yeah. Yeah. That's where I learned it up there. But edging up there. Yeah. Like my arms. Like lean in like that. Looks so skinny. I can't imagine that. I got to get one. I got to get one. I'm just going to be there every set of the way. Whatever you want to do, I'll be there. Because like that was that. That's what I like. I like that. Maybe so much. I'm not sure. This is the... I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It's blue. Oh, what are you guys doing? Wow. You need a train. Oh, he is the... Honestly. That is the classiest thing I've ever heard of in my life. I don't have. There you go. I'm looking for a 24-minute. I'm looking for a 24-minute. I'm looking for a 24-minute. I'm looking for a 24-minute. I'm looking for a 24-minute. I'm looking for a 24-minute. Oh, where you going? Oh, my gosh. He's heavy, don't tear it. That's heavy. He's big about it. He's a mega fat. Oh, my gosh. I'm just feeling it, babe. The plus is pregnant, the bind is dead. Mine is not pregnant, but I feel it. I'm just feeling it, babe. The plus is pregnant, the bind is dead. Mine is not pregnant, but I feel it. Mine is not pregnant, but I feel it. There's a plus sign through it, but it's really faint, babe. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, what do you think? Oh, my gosh. Oh, what do you think? Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. You're pregnant. Are you kidding me? What? What? Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I'm already getting up to work, so. Did you just hold a hold time? This is where I was pretty sure. I was really quick. I don't know. I'm going to keep you. Being able to watch Chris become a dad is really something I'm so forever looking forward to, and I'm so grateful for, and just something that I'm also so excited to witness, like our life together, and him becoming the father to our child, and watching him take that role on, because I know he's just going to be so amazing at it, and it's just like a part of his DNA, and who he is as a person. That's who Chris is just his essence, his heart. Minus, what you guys see on the external is truly the best thing about Chris, and watching him like be that person to a little baby, and to a little human is like the coolest thing ever. The coolest thing ever. Courtney, where's your phone? Yeah, she really is. Okay, three, one, one, two, three! All right, so here we are. Back in the gym where it all began, I guess. We wrapped up the Olympic Olympic end, and we're experiencing it. So doing the Ocho now and surprised having a baby. Baby bum is along the way. It was the most beautiful blessing I've ever received, and the midst of this prep when a lot of shit was going down. I mentioned in my acceptance speech, I tore my lap at about 10 weeks out. My body wasn't responding at that point. My mental state wasn't there. I was going through all this shit I was traveling too much. I had lost 12 pounds in a week randomly. I literally went from like 262 to 250, and 10 weeks that I've never been that light. I didn't know what was going on with my body. I was stressed out, there was some personal stuff going on on the back end, and then I found out Courtney was pregnant, and it was like the best news I could have ever gotten. I was so happy, and then there was all this other shit pulling me in other directions and stressing me out. Then that's when I tore my lap. I went to the gym one day, and I was doing dead lifts 405, and I just was letting the bar down and just hop. And my lap just like yanked, and this throbbing pain went through me. And it's how I tore my hamstring back in 2019, doing dead lifts and it was the same feeling. I was in the gym, and I was just so defeated at this point. I felt like this prop wasn't going to get the week prior, the two weeks prior, the year prior, and I was already feeling so defeated. And that really took the window to me. That took everything out of me. I'm never being at the gym, I was in Canada, I walked outside, and I just heard fucking bawling my zip on myself. I called Courtney, and she's like, hey, man, what's going on? I just was sobbing, she's like, what's wrong? I'm like, I can't fucking do this. Like, I just everything falling apart, my body's not here. My mind's out in the right place, I just tore my lap. Like everything's literally crumbling. Then I called, honey after that, and if somebody else is going, and I start crying, you think, what the fuck's going on then? Then I went home, tried to my sister and E in my parents, and I was just fulfilling so defeated. It was all I could really say, and that's when I kind of went in my A for a little bit of social and YouTube. We didn't really film anything. Blue back home, and I couldn't train back for like three weeks. Couldn't train my body for about 10 days. Luckily in Canada, I was got to see Dr. Kahn, I had an appointment with some prior, which was super lucky, and then I went in, and he was able to do some stuff for me. So shout out to him that was very helpful, and there's lucky that I already had that appointment set up, while I was in Canada. But it was a mental battle, and as I said, this year was a huge focus on not just having no quit, so I know I could not quit that ship, but sometimes what it takes to be the best champion, you can be, if you want to take to be the best man you can be, that's partner you can be best. Has been dad, soon to be dad, that person you can be, and I didn't want to shut out all my emotion and become a more lesser version of myself, because I'm not just bodybuilding to be a big jack to do, I want to be a better version of myself. So, didn't want to just not quit, I wanted to experience all this, and that was the theme I wanted to feel the good and the bad this year, because when in the past when I've had the numbness, the press all the shit I was going through, and fear and anxiety and doubt and everything, all the positive things are to dim the light too, because when you numb the good, when you numb the bad, you numb the good. And so, I leaned into it, I knew my therapist Jordan helped me a lot through this process, I had a session with her a week after, and I was like the feeds and telling, she was just part of your story. You know, I said in my speech again to my family, they're all like, look, you don't have to do this, you can't quit, you do it every one, what love you either way, but we know you can do this if you want to, and that really put a lot of strength in me, I guess, you know, time when you doubt yourself if you have a team of people who love you who support you, you can lift you up and carry the load that feels too heavy for you to burden. It really helps a lot, so I can't express how grateful I am for the people in my life. And I just started getting through it, you know, I was stressed out, and instead of trying to not be stressed about it, I just was like, no shit, you're going to be stressed out right now, you know, you're now going to be a dad, huge deal, super important, your health is also very important, even more important of you now. And there's all this other shit going on, so just try and feel whatever is going on, you're not meant to feel just excited and perfect all the time, so accept that where you are right now, just where you are meant to be, because as soon as you start fighting, you start to think where you are and how you feel is and how you're meant to feel, and where you're meant to be, everything feels way worse than it should be. So I accepted it, and I felt it, and I leaned into it, and I got back to the gym, and I did what little I could, what could I do, I could train legs, I could train some light arms, I could do specific movements that weren't engaging my lat, very minimal things for a while, and I got through it day by day, and then I think it was four weeks after all this, I was in the gym, it was a, I believe it was a back workout. I remember flying on the ground after a workout and being like, just not, didn't even realize I had just gone through day by day by day by day, I just did what I needed to do, not quitting, trying to feel the ups and the downs of it all, and then I also said one day I had a fucking great workout, I just crushed my workout, and I was still like six weeks out, and I was like, fuck, I can do this, like I started to build that belief back in myself, sitting here, this is like where I was sitting, when it happened to, and I was like, fuck, like you can do this, and I started crying in the gym, and this time, instead of those tears I had had weeks before of crying about feeling defeated, it was feeling the belief arising back up with myself, and like I could win another Olympian, or even get to the end of it and be proud of how I look. So that was pretty beautiful moment of gratitude and experience of life, of the feeling the ups and the downs, the feeling of being alive as a human is really why we're here, you know, we're not meant to win titles and be rich and do all these things, we're just meant to have a human experience of love and highs and lows, and feelings and emotions, and be there for it also, it was pretty cool to have experienced such a fucking low, and then back up into a high, and then it was game time, you know, I was like, fuck it, we're locking it in now. Corny and Tomi and I were the book called The One Thing, and it's just talking about how like if you want to be, the belief that something you need to focus on one thing and the time and that spread your thoughts too far across too many things, and I was like, fuck it. If I'm going to win this Olympia, this is all I had to focus on, this is all I can put my attention on to. And so that's what I did. It's up to one of the office, it's up to you, and but we're up to one email, text, I'll do anything. I just showed up and I did the fucking work in the gym every single day, and I was in bed at 9 o'clock every day, I was up at 7, every single day, and I did the same meals at the same time, every single day. I crush every workout every single day, and I did the damn work, and it pulled together, and I was a fucking robot. Not emotionally, physically, and it was fun. You know, I was able to experience it, and the axle came down, and eating came down. There was all these fun things going on, and one of the doctors was Courtney, and Ultra Sound, checking out her new baby on the way, and I started to build more and more excitement for that, and this just became this beautiful journey within a journey, and it was amazing. And one of the probably one of my favorite preps today, great movie, I have to finish with this splash. And that was kind of, I know it's isn't out of show to show to you, but that was all the emotion that was going through me, while I was competing. When I had a few moments on stage where one of the things I built, worked on very hard as last few years, is my mental ability to be present and enjoy the damn journey, and that's the experience I have at the five-time, Mr. Olympia now. You know, I was on stage instead of thinking of getting poses, they're doing this, and I'm like, I'm standing there looking around looking for my family in the crowd, hitting my poses, thinking to myself, like, fuck, you just tore a lot. You're having a baby, you're praying to life as if they're watching you, there's a truck outside right now, very loud. And I was able to just like think of this on stage and enjoy all that, and have all these moments, which is so beautiful, and that's what I've worked on to be able to be present, and not be stuck in my head and stuck in stress and stuck in chaos, while in this huge moment of... I could potential stress on stage, so I was up there enjoying it, and you guys could see it from a lot of the pictures this year. My smile was brighter, I felt like I was enjoying it a lot more, and that's all I've ever wanted, so it was a really good experience on stage. You know, I did everything I could, and I was able to just enjoy it on there. And at the night show, I remember being backstage and just like, closing my eyes and thinking of all that stuff that had gone through, and all the pressure I put on myself, all the stress that I feel, all the time, and a lot of the work I've been doing there, B2 was kind of like, talking to a healing like a past self, and I remember being backstage and both the picture of a young version of myself, and this is something I've been doing there B, and being like, fuck man, we were doing it, like you did it, like, I love you for, I was like talking to myself, and I remember like crying again, and being like, on stage again, they were calling your name to have the same thought, I looked up at the Olympia where it's felt on stage, I looked up in the crowd, the lights, and I'm just like, fuck you're here. This is the moment, like you're in it right now. These are what you're gonna look back on, and you're just experiencing it right now, and you're here. And I can't really put into words the kind of feelings I have. I went near up there, but it was amazing. And you know, I was pretty confident, and I had won this Olympia after pre-judging. I knew the package I had brought, and the work I had done, and saw the pictures, and I was like, I got this. And I was just chilling, I was enjoying it. So when they call my name, and I have five years of just clothing, my eyes in listening for Bob Chickel, of the voice being like, and new, and still, and still, and still, and still, you're a five-time Mr. Olympia champion, and just hearing him say that, and me just waiting for it, and being like, you should enjoy this moment, never forget this moment. It was cool. It was a lot of fun, and something I will never forget. And then I get to go backstage, see my pregnant wife, fiance, whatever, close enough, and my family and friends were all back there, and we were able to hug and enjoy. Celebrations and everything, and it was a lot of fun. So it was a beautiful journey. Lots of lessons learned, you know, pretty cool how I'd been a person who surprises everything, and now, at this peak moment of my life, I was like, no, I'm gonna fucking feel it all, and it was the best experience I've ever had, and the biggest lesson I learned is just when you're in those low moments, and you're having those hard times, and you feel so stressful, you can't keep going, or it's this shit, instead of trying to feel like you shouldn't be in that moment embrace that moment, because all of the moments, all that hell of a moment, so you want to quit the moment you want to shut down, those moments that you're at the beginning, or anywhere in your journey, those are the moments that make the victories, or the workouts where you're just like, wow, I feel good today, those are what makes us so sweet, and I wouldn't have experienced those moments of gratitude and joy if it weren't for those lows. So don't fight those moments, so try and get rid of them, just sit in there and feel them, and accept them for what they are in the moment, because it's just part of the human experience. Yeah, that's a wrap on this, 2023, 5P journey. It was a fun one, for sure. I focused on not putting it on social media, kept a lot of the stuff to myself, because I was just enjoying the processing and going through the journey in my own mind, into my own ways. So it was a lot of fun, you know, I have the greatest support team. Juan, he got me through a lot of shit, Courtney got me through a lot of shit, Calvals got my back through it on Maddie. Domin Mad, making sure it don't have to go to the fucking office or any roster for a week, set a time, and you know, it takes an army to pull it all together, and we did it. And it was super cool, at a few moments posing with honey and Ian doing check-ins with them. That was cool to see them kind of come together and collaborate, and kind of create a game plan for myself, with a lot of fun to experience that. And yeah, that's what's, it's what happened I guess. So thank you guys, that's always for joining me along this journey, chasing after something I love, and trying to share with you guys every little bit of it. That's as I can, because I might do it in a cool, on PS Stage, but everyone's going through their ups and downs in life, and it's all just part of what we're doing here. So I'm just grateful that you guys care to watch, care to support me, means a lot. When I talk about support, I have for my family and friends that help me be stronger, you guys are the same, you know, you get a lot of love, and there's this like folk, like the longer successful people up to watch you fall, and I haven't really experienced that, and I'm super honored and grateful for the support I have for people, because you know, it's rare sometimes people like to start to hate and want to bring people down, when they're doing well, but, you know, I haven't really received a lot of that, so I'm very grateful and honored that people want to support me on this journey. And now, we're going to be fucking dead. No more dead, he's evil, it's father's evil now. Dad mode, so super excited about that, being Courtney will discuss more of what's coming along with the baby, but you guys have heard me talk about before it's the thing I've looked forward to the most of my life. I did know what happened, but I'm so excited. So we're going to get into that a little bit deeper with Courtney. Talk about what's coming with the baby bump, but, until then, it's a wrap on this one, so I thank you guys for watching. And until next time.

Chris Mumsman. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. You are here to do what you have done before. Is it just another day at the office? I see that you have gentlemen next day that you train or services over there, you are allowed. Those moments in the gym, someone is like you are lowering your man. Young lions and all that stuff. What I want to know is, are you here to just win this thing or you here to actually dominate this thing? Because there is a lot of people that believe that you can do it. Of course there is people next to you that think you can't. I'm here for a few reasons. I've said, I'm absolutely welcome home. Was I trophy? But that's not the only reason why I'm here this year. This is my fifth time chasing after title. I've been on the on the stage. I'm competing for 10 years. If I've learned anything, it's that in the past. I felt I'd have to just shut down a lot. I've pressed a lot and just go into this performance mode to win. I'm just pushing everything aside. And this year what I want, I will be with you. I want to be different. I want to feel the whole journey. I want to have fun training. I want to enjoy the process. Feel the outspiel the downs. Not just not the wallet. I'm not the one who's going to be here. I'm excited to be here. I'm smiling. I'm showing my family and they're all here. I'm just having a good time. I'm putting the work. I know these guys are fighting for second place. And I'm just here to win. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. No, yeah. What's the week? I don't want you to get better there's zero. I don't want to be. I want to be no. Great good brother. I'm going to give Chris a good run for his buddy. And he's going to have a success week. We got a great competition every time he's back. But I mean, just take with Chris. Chris. Sean Ray says, you're in the wrong division. You should be in the open. Your eyes should be on that stand out. You should be in that open. He thinks you got a legitimate shot. Sean's there, right? Chris knows. I told him two or three years ago. He's in the wrong division. But he's always got to do. I'm right wherever. I'm going to get back to the end. Now, you're where you're going right now. But let's just say, technically say, you do win five. And you said, many times, you're about any years. You got a lot, but you still got some gas. But then, would you consider, if you were to win five, would you consider hand in a month? I need to let me a stage. But only temporarily, you're going to grab it for a pair of trunks and get that sand out of shot. Sorry, can't point out. Like, some tons of air. Do you want to do it? No, no, no. I'm not going to say, read your Chris. I'll do it this weekend. I mean, listen, I know you're an over-ish. So if I could be a little bit much, I'll be cool, though. But no, I'm not going to, like, just say, you say, okay, five's enough. I'm returning from class. I'll be back next year. And I'll go over that. I don't know if you're trying to exit the crowd or get these gas hopes up. I don't like Joe. Well, the first tell us it's key. So as if you're eating in a good five, you're going to put it in to that right here right now. This year, the junior four, I know you want you to like it, brother. But it's time to move on. The Earth is a miracle, bearer. Can it happen? Will it happen? We all know everything can happen in this world, especially nowadays. But we're going to find an hour, set it a evening, man. You got to get to the speed, no, before you get to the ship up. I know he's not understanding when I say the English, so I said it in Puerto Mish, Cuitado, Dosicando. Who are you? Who are you? You got a whole bunch of followups. You're dead head right now. No, I say you guys, the question I can ask is, Earth said that he put on 15 hours since his last attempt at beating Chris. Chris says it's going to kind of be a sound like a saying it's going to be a walk in the park. So I don't know. You train with him to see anything when you were training with him that gave me an idea that you could surpass him this year. Yeah, so definitely that he's getting old of. So I knew I invested a lot last year, I trained my ass off over there and coldest journey in the bunker. And he has a great journey, sunny winter, so I knew I won my ass off. No, but decide that. It's always good to always go to training and with those others, to come out of competitors, it's always the reason why flying the US, literally on the, yeah, I'm into those guys. I also came all the way to Brazil and trained with Ramon. So I think it's good to push each other in a certain way and also don't forget the fun. Yeah, and it's also fun at this level of bodybuilding, trust me. So it's a great spot of a great time, everybody should join in and follow it. All right, thank you, Eric Bell, you can't stop flying anybody from Brazil. Ramon is a superstar in Brazil. I'm going to ask this question real quick and Portuguese and then I'll translate when you respond to the audience. Ramon, you're in the middle of Brazil, but you're a Brazilian. So you're not going to be able to do that. So I'm going to ask you to come out of your preparation. So what's the question? I asked him, he's in here in Brazil, but a lot of people are being critical that he didn't show any pictures and that he maybe doesn't pose as aggressively. Wouldn't he have to say about this? So, if you're going to, don't you just come out of your strategy? I think that's a good thing that I'm going to do the same. Most of all, I'm going to do a different thing that I can do because I'm not going to do anything. And that's what I'm going to do, and that's what I'm going to do. I think that's a good thing. He said, it doesn't matter when the picture show, it's not a strategy. I'm only concerned about what I'm going to show on stage. How about that? Thank you very much. Well, I have a question because a lot of these guys, they seem to be fans of the Chris Bumstedt. They make hard signs to Chris Bumstedt. They invite Chris Bumstedt to dinner. But, pre-on is the kind that actually challenges Chris Bumstedt. Pre-on is this year that you're going to do some of these young guys to finally challenge Chris Bumstedt. Chris, you trained for your first floor, Linda Bowins. I want to say the most popular by the law in Instagram, 1920, million-bought, 20, wait, it's 21 now, 21 now. But you have so many people coming up to you in the gym, when you're trying to drink for the Linda, it's a picture, it's a talk. And you're a nice guy and you've always accommodated everyone. But this year, you built your own gym. You've trained in private, you've noticed directions. What difference did that make in your training and your focus for this year? I'm focused for this one. Me and it was the very selfish and you're focusing. I had this year to have that private gym and it was a lot of fun. I got to teach a trans-my friend and focus and do what I do. And I think for guys who are aware of that, I could be able to gym with the barbell or receipts with some dumbbells. I'm going to get the work done and do what I do. But I mean every age I could get, I'm going to take it. I built that type of gym, I got to work. I didn't really help me focus my mind. I was going to say before, just enjoy the journey. I could go in there. I could be quiet, I could play my music. I could be present. I could enjoy every single workout. I remember getting into the barbell squatting, doing this and being like, I got two more things, just like, feel this and enjoy this. This is so fine right now. It'd be this strong with lean to be working so much such a difficult, beautiful goal. I just, they both allowed me to ski more in my presence and everything I was doing. I trained my ass off and go off and I'm going to provide so hopefully it helps. I just need it, but then we'll have one final. All right, I'm going to work. I have to do it. You're going to get so happy to play out. I'm going to do those. Let's go up and go up. Do you want to go up? Yes. I'm going to do that. I'm going to go up and go up and go up. I'm going to go up and go up and go up. Right. Right. I know. Just like, I never thought. You know, like, these old guy. No, no. That wasn't that. He's got his food. You ready? Yeah. It's a skyrocket. Is this like, you know, that's different? No, but it also doesn't look like it. Yeah, hi, anyway. No, no. No, no. No, no. He's wearing up for it when he can. We have. No, no. He's wearing up for it when he can. We have. All right. So. Williams. Check. First conference. Check. Thursday. Chaos is half over. We are home. We're going to eat some food now. We need two meals today. This is November 3. The press conference sometimes. I mean, people like it. I get it sitting there when I'm this tired and the chair. My next Saturday at headache and just every two hours. Just beaming lights on you. And I'm like, all right. I got to go eat. I got to go to the trip's water and chill. So finish that up.

Why do I guess? The sense you don't view from me this year. But no, honestly, it's sometimes I get stressed out to note me and I understand how much people appreciate it. And hearing the effect that I can have on people was. I don't really understand it, so I see it in here. I just love my life. Trying to get through my own life and seeing that it helps people with a lot to be. I appreciate everyone who followed my journey. I love you guys. Am I something similar? What? Am I something similar? Different but similar. Yeah. I have to get the Bible, but it should It's on mind, both things, comments and you see it. But when do you meet someone in person? But I write you a long letter like that with a cold, it's fucked, you know? It just shows you too that everybody's in the same boat sometimes. And we all think we're alone. Everyone's going through their own shit. That's the only reason I share it. I don't share it to my shit, to complain or to think I'm in the bad spot. I just share it so people know that they're not alone either. And so that they know that you can't fucking quit. The champions don't quit. We follow, we stumble, we cry, but we don't quit. So yeah, this is what it is. I'm sweating now, now I'm crying, sweating. I gotta go to the town, so we're going to wipe these tears down here. What? I'm in 400. Yeah. It was supposed to be light and reasonable. But yeah, thank you guys for all the love you guys gave me all the support. Didn't go and notice. And I might not get back to everybody, but I read a lot of these notes and I read a lot of these notes. I read every note. I get, I read a lot of the comments. Some DMs, I can't get it back to a lot, but they mean a lot to me. So thank you guys for all the love and support along my journey. You guys have helped me probably a lot more than anything. You guys have to be a lot more than anything. All the trees here are over 350 mage plants themselves crowned by the Workers' Republic ofzukman, where they have made this. The majority of this building has already featured around 3 Mountains per400, so far. Oh, this building is still almost a45 now. Thank you very much. I don't know if you'd like to make a series for you. I don't think they did no touch. That's apples. I'm doing 80 fish. And I'll be right there. All right, thanks, honey. All right, so we're up on Thursday. We made it through the Hectic Day of Meetings and Meeting People of Presconferences and Waiians and Tans and all that good stuff. And tomorrow, we'll have fun today. It's a chill day. Friday, I have nothing to do with September. So we'll just send the hang out. Eat a lot of carbs. We're just going to show you guys. And sleep, I think they already said that. I don't even know my brain's hearing anymore. It's running brain dead after meeting a few hundred people and in healing. I'm going to go to bed after I eat this. And yeah, I've said about this video. So I appreciate you guys. See you on La Manga and Yanda.

=== FILE: THE LAST LEG WORKOUT ｜ 1 WEEK OUT [W_JqEj3nga4].txt ===

I know I have someone. The only one I got was one. I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I got a... I... I... I'm... I... I... What? What's up YouTube? Welcome to the final leg day. Twenty twenty three minutes to our lunch meal prep. The last time we're doing leg. I might use a vlog session throughout the week. The party thinks my legs look small and flat. I'm carbon-oppersum, but this is probably it realistically. So... I'm gonna enjoy it. Feel pretty good today. So, I thought it was a beautiful thing when you were one week getting off the Outlook deck. The better my workouts can be right now. The better I'm gonna look on stage. The more full of my muscles can stay rather just flattening out. We can get tired like in your fast. When I'm super depleted. So... Yeah, just kind of... soaking in the day. Enjoying the final leg day. Much of these sucks sometimes when it's last one you're like fuck. They can be fun too. So... We're gonna do the best we can. Nothing crazy. Just trying to really like squeeze the muscle. Get everything out of it. No PRs. No hurting myself. And we leave all the end of tomorrow. So... Fun fun. Okay. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. What's that? Mmm. There it goes. Mmm. I like they're so lean that they actually contract so hard. Fuck it. It hurts so good. Oh my God. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Ah. Yeah. You know that, yeah. Yeah. Mmm. Yeah. Mmm. Mmm. Alright, move it on to my favorite machine this prep for whatever reason. The squat press just feels fucking amazing. Old side of the machine. So we're sick with what works. No freeweight shit. This is the first year where I like built my foundation. Do squats that I was like, I'm gonna protect my knees. I'm gonna protect my spine. Do a little safer. Everything heavy on machines. And it's honestly felt really good. This is one of those things where it's due as I. Done not as I'm doing. But I built my physique doing what I did. So you have a different way you need to build. And then when you're at a point where I'm not trying to put on 10 pounds of muscle of years kind of more fine tuning what I already have. So I'm not hurting myself since I was doing squats. Do more machines. So not saying what you do when you start. For you got to learn your body. And I know I've been feeling a lot better. I've got that in my joints. Everything of best they felt in a prep ever. So take what you will from that. I'm still felt pretty strong on that. Less it. The machine maxed out at 11 plates. Now I was doing 11 plates for like, I think 18 was the most I've gotten. I still felt pretty strong in there. But you feel different when I'm like my weight drop. I'm this lean and I'm this dry. You're going to feel a little achy and you're using muscle. They're just like they're kind of like picture like you're hugging your grandma and you're just like gentle. That's like my knees. So didn't want to push it. The 12 reps could have done a little bit more. But like I said before, my head and the PR dropped the weight. Bit more volume. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. They're lighter, one higher than I thought. This is one of the greatest machines that we've ever made for your lower back. All right, so, belts quite. Another fucking favorite machine in my in this prep. I'm going to have to do some lighter. Close grip. Trying to keep my feet really underneath me. Really focus on a lot of the quad. I'm going to upper quad in here. Squeezing through there the whole way. Everything I've been doing right now has been a little bit wider. I'm going to have to be able to do some more. So we're going to final press movement here. This machine makes some bodyweight lunches. I have volume flush the blood to the quads. And then I got six days. Let them recover and relax. Hopefully look at on stage. Woo! Yeah. I couldn't even explain that. I could just tell there was no contraction energy left. Just like nope. I lost for words. But you're finished. You have these workouts. These squattings in your machine. Fucking great squattings. It's really late. But it squeezes the piss of your quads. And bodyweight lunches. And at this point, the workout, the bodyweight lunches. I feel like I have a hundred pounds on my back. I have to worry. Just a shot of the blood into the muscle. I don't know what else I'm going to say. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.

=== FILE: THIS CRUSHED MY DREAMS ｜ FULL SHOULDER WORKOUT [TdgfGMYwLzg].txt ===

Can't forget my leg under it. Oh no. There we go. Yeah. I don't ever feel it. Oh no. Well, there's some crushed dreams. Leave a little hundred pounds. Saving yourself some money though. That's a very true. Come on! Come on Chris! Come on John! Still! Oh, total code! Oh, yeah, let's go for this one! What's the... What? It's a very cool location. I'm just about to go and close the bar. I'm very excited to be on Photoshop. It didn't. Selfish is just one to bring myself here. So, I'm just going to do my best. I'm going to do my best. I'm going to do my best. I'm going to do my best. I'm going to do my best. I'm going to be on Photoshop. Then, selfishly, I just wanted to bring myself here to check out Charizard. But in this shop, I'll be our curated. It's down here in Miami. Right away. And they have just vintage supercar. It's very flambles. They got some photos taken here. Everything you can imagine. So, we got Stephen here. It's gone guys. It's been a tour. A little history of some really cool things. I'm going to be doing a Vomitrish Photoshop here because I had a vintage vibes of it all. And what better place to do with them is for our reason. I'm also going to walk around the shop. It's telling us that Charizard is a good thing. I haven't even seen them yet, but my dreams have won one day. So, this is a pleasant one of the vibes I do. Alright, so starting off, we have one of our most significant cars in our showroom. This is the Bugatti EB110 SS Super Sport. But it was not only just a super sport, but it's a car number six of the prototypes. This was actually the USA Development Cars. It has a couple of one-off features. That is a single fuel tank. So it's important. So it drains evenly. It also has a unit carbon fiber. So you can actually see the weave in the carbon from here. This was the first time a car has been fitted with four turbos. So a car makes about 607 horsepower and a reduction of about 300 pounds of weight off of the production cars. And this one has the engine and driveline that set the landscape record for this car. So, there's a lot of that. How's it going? How are you? Good nice meeting. How's everything? Good, good. Yeah, nice meeting. You got to do a great job. Thank you. Yeah, whatever you need. While you're here, how are we going to help? I know the team won't have enough water moves on here, but I've got a huge fan. Oh, so I appreciate it. What you've done. Thank you. You as well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So yeah, whatever you need. Oh, yeah. Appreciate it. Great to meet you. Yeah. You're a fitness. Oh, this one with the buckets probably. It's like, it's always a tight like this. I started on the bed. I'll get my custom seats when I go. Yeah. It's a new one seat. That's a. This is the second. I'll see. So behind is actually another Bugatti. This is a Bugatti 16.4 Varon. So one of the early cars, but what makes this car notable is it's one of three in black black. Most of the cars had a two-tone color. This one, most notably used to belong to Little Wayne originally. Really? So it was the first car which you had. We just got it back in service with $62,000 for tires. Yeah. Yeah. Bit of a bit of a process where they had to actually take the wheels off. Some glue the tires have them shipped to California to be mounted to the car as a re-glude and shipped back. So it's a bit of a procedure to service. Sure none of these car that just like swap the so. Yeah, exactly. Just as not just that simple. Yeah. These cars are like a lot smaller in person. Yeah. Like a waste smaller. So we've got the Merchillago RGT product. This is actually the Gini Auto Show Show Car where Lamborghini was announcing that they were going racing in the RGT. It was designed by a radio engineering and it was for the ALMS and WEC in Dura's Cross Series where they did compete for I think one or two seasons. Behind it. Well, 5,000 original miles. So one of the lowest mileage best examples that we'd ever had come to our show. That's the same color we had in Wolf Wolf. We have a white one. So funny story. We actually, we did racing the car that car. Really. It was a car that I knew personally for 13 years. Yeah. And I went on to be notably in the movie. Belfer had never actually had a Kuntosh, but his car was a white white anniversary. So a slightly later car than that. Yeah. But it was a white white car in the movie. There you guys do a bug getting these cars. It's everything. It's literally everything. It's Dornocking. Like, hey, this guy's neighbor has this car. So Dornocking. To brand itself, help to wear. Hey, this is what we're looking for. So people come to us with stuff. You got built it now. Yes. Yes. And then the technicians, where they've been around the cars, hey, remember this car. Other relationship with other dealers and other friends like, oh, I know this guy. I mean, just letting people know that we're looking for as well as being involved in the relationships that are built because of the cars. Yeah. Once you start, I think once you start building a relationship and you realize the community smaller than you think everyone likes. I know this. I know this. I know this. Exactly. And it's, you would track what you put out. It should be good. So. And one of my now favorite cars that we have in here. This is the Conexic CCXR. So the CCXR they made it, believe 49 cars for the world. But the CCXR they made 9. And this car is mostly one of three with a manual transmission. Features, one of three made with a manual of the CCXR package was the 85 conversion. So it features around a thousand horsepower. And also this car was fitted with a Ghost Package, which was 100. $1000 carbon fiber upgrade kit. And this car was also featured in Fast 5, the end of Fast 5, where they say now there's two in the Western Hemisphere and they were all together. So 3000 miles and a $20,000 custom floating house titanium exhaust. It isn't absolutely right to drive one of my own. So amazing too. In the same one of my favorite features is the doors, which are one of the most unique features upon this car. So you can actually get in. Yes. And the roof comes off too, which is also smaller and there. That one over there. That shift gears on there. I don't even know how you drive that manual. It's quite so hard to drive that manual. That one's not that bad. There's other cars that are a little more tricky. There's a lot of feedback and it's actually pretty communicative. So that one's actually really communicative. So it's not that bad. This is the orange car with the doors up is the Geopold GT2. This is the only factory competition car. It was Lamborghini's goal was to race at Lamar. It featured two races and it raced at the 24 hours of spa. It never actually made it to Lamar. But it was the only Diablo that ever featured in competition wheel to wheel racing. That one also lived in the Lamborghini Museum up until 2015. Couple cars that are mid-progress here. We've got two mercy logo, 40th cars. So there's another one over there, which I'll feature is the press car. And over there's a Gallardo press for Montague, which is three cars. I'm hitting with five remaining transmission. Yellow F-50, one of 31 yellow cars. And under here, I can give you guys a sneak peek of what we've got coming up for. The car world, one of the biggest events is Pable Beach. It's kind of a super ball, the World Cup, everything roll into one. This is a near-MS. We've spent three years in restoration. So this will be making its public debut for the first time. Pable Beach is here. Yes, thanks. Thanks for the one. One other car I've got to give a shout out to is this Maricilago of the front. So not only a curated one, just by a significant examples, but all the cars have an interesting story with them. So this is also car number 24. And that's important because this is the global press car. So this was the car that was featured in all the magazines and all the shows and all the brochures. And when the car was announced to the world, so this was the car that was actually in that so. The cool piece to find. The two AMG Mercedes over there, one is a one-car lift in Japan. And that was a 1990. The SLL is white and blue tier and features six-liter engine upgrade from these two to the wire. And the LH-SEC, AMG is six-way-out. Some people like to call them cameras, but that's kind of one of my things is the hammer was a little bit more involved in the conversion. So this car was technically the 560 SCC wide body of six-way-out. There are never things that are really cool cars. These are like what I am going for. Yeah, this is a child of soap. These are the cars I got some of the most seen time in. There are a lot of functional aerodynamics with the cars. They just all the engineering that went into the rear of the Mercedes feel of it. And you get effectively doubling the horsepower in a very capable platform. Just because the little is a good one. Well this is the actual competition. This is the real thing. It's still nothing. It's like a rocket ship. Yeah. What's VCU? What stands out to you? I've got a lot of good contashers. I'm at the Able because they're the NHL player in my city who I orange DL. Oh, I drove her out. We've got a blue roadster. And then this can touch was I can't be able to so we can sit in that one. Do you want to try that? Hold on a minute. You can't get a fair play. Doesn't fit a camp by? Yes, you're a student. What would it be? Okay, if you're by leg under it. Oh no. There you go. Yeah. I don't know if I can. Yeah. My dreams are getting crushed. And this is probably one of the most room. Really? Wow. You know, this one's way. Imagine me coming in to a nice restaurant. I can't get out of that. Do you have to like, I'm in now. Okay, would you try that black card? Wait, does this have back seats? No. No. I thought I don't know. You probably found the car. I didn't do that. It was an easy one. So this one actually has comfort seats. Where you could off. This card you could get the technical package, which featured carbon seats and carbon ceramics. But this one was option with the steel breaks and the comfort seats. This is one of my favorite land violence cars. Yeah, no. No. Yeah. You can see my muscle over there. That's muscle bar. Yeah, exactly. You have to sit in the back of the engine to put the jet though. Yeah. Well, there's some crushed dreams. Leave it a little hundred pounds. Saving yourself some money to offer. That's a very true. There we go. So this is probably going to be our best bet in terms of the set. It has the cars done. No, you know, where they made a little bit more room for people. Unfortunately, you know, I'm Italian car sized. They tried to say. There you go. Kind of. Right? I think a drive it because it's automatic. Any of the manuals I wouldn't know. You know, I should buy this. Look at this. I can drive this. But the roof would be like. Yeah. It's such a short. Yeah. It takes like 15 to 20 minutes of what the lawn is. If you know what you're doing. Really? The roadsters are easier to use. The lawn is a lot. But this one's a lot. He doesn't spend any of the cars. All right. Well, he doesn't even have a fire. He's a good one. Good luck. Very cool though. Last but not least, if you wanted to pop your head into the shop, you can see it also goes into the process here. And I did want to show you John's car. This white clundosh is very similar to the car that was featured in the Wolf and Wall Street. This one is a European example with a 4,000-y original miles on it. Really? We're going to read a color to see. It's called Bianco Pralotto. It's like a pearl. Yes. This is like the bill though and more. Yeah. That red. And you? The anniversary car is a little bit more of a disease. The personal car. This is a Diablo SE30. These are the cars that John the others must pass on. This is featured in the iconic Violua 30 Purple. And this one is, I think it's Car number 90. Yes. Car number 97. But most notably, this was the car that was actually designed by Rachel Codani. Really? This is first car before he left the form of something. Yeah. So I'm not going to let him know that he has seen 30. This is a little bit of our shop. A little bit of what's going on here. I'm going to leave a couple of cars getting ready to go in. Very cool. It's a very cool, first day ready to go to the public beach right now. A few cars in the middle of restoration. But it takes a village to make these cars. I was wanting to give a shout out to the shop. Oh, that's not competitive. What are you with? That's at 5000 hours. So that's in 85. That's actually the engine that's getting ready to go back in. I'm going to go back in. I'll go back in. I'll go back in. I'll go back in. I'll go back in. What's that orange one right there? Well, that's a whole, four more seawater. So slightly older than the roadster. So similar to the blue cars. But it's mostly 6,000 miles in its factory manual car. So O2 to O3s. They were all manuals. But no 4 to O6. They were options. We got a couple of little updates from back there. So we're going to go to the surface. So the silver car is actually what's called the low-tech seawater 1000. It was a custom commission car. If you put that was commissioned. And it took them about four years to build. It was the goal of being the number one car. It had a 1000 horsepower Mercedes-Benz turbo engine. With, I think, a theoretical top speed of 268 miles. And it's essentially a sawper C9 LeBoc car underneath. What do you call this? Kind of drifted off and do obscurity for many years. That's fully tough to them. Yeah. One of one carbon chassis, 1000 horsepower. Just absolutely insane. I don't feel it. I barely set the neck already, too. Not even, but all those are, you know. Yeah. Me for lose 50 pounds. Yeah. I have no idea. You're getting somewhere down there. Yeah, they got something. Good? Yep. Yeah. All right, so we just wrapped up the shoot here. We are curated. I am very inspired to go to this car this one day. So hopefully we'll modify me to fit in it, but you never know. We'll find out. Anyways, wrap on the shoot right now. We gotta get some food to be hungry. We're sweating to the water. So we catered to something. And I'm gonna go work out.

Mega fit and four shots of patrol. Thanks, Calvin. No. How many of you have Calvin? I have a six. That was like, by his games. I kind of, Holden, so you can tell me he stopped talking. You're like, I'm a, he's locked up. You know, Calvin stops talking. He's like, it's, like, you're focusing on just like the table here. I mean, I was like, I was just fucking wrestle him once he got so drunk. Really? I think, like, put him in a fucking choke. Yeah. He didn't know he didn't remember. He was like, I've never had a fucking kick. I don't think he was going to remember. He was like, I've never had a kick. Wow. He was like, he's in sync or what? Like he's like a fan? I just said, like, just talking. Try it out. Look at for the knees. Dude, he's fucking constant chaos, eh? Huh? He's like, always in a rush. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Also always have like 30 things in his hands. Yeah. Yeah. Also always have like 30 things in his hands. Just literally, right down. Yeah. You like a little hurt or like a poke bag. I know you just have a probably trying to charge him so much and hit him. Put the pump in the free. Well, you supposed to pick one of the other. You've already pumped in the free. Is there a caffeine in this one? There's one has no caffeine. It says pump and caffeine. Caffeine is better. You can't even, why do you? You can't even get with that. I'm gonna give you a minute. I'm gonna try this one. This is the same as the powder or no? Same formula. Okay. Taste the same or no? No. Well, they're all different. They're different. The powder is just one. No, they're different. We actually made a V2 a load though. We don't sell those anymore. You want to sell this? Yeah, we'll be too. They look like that now. And they taste better. This is like a baby bottle. Yeah. Exactly. Why are we doing this? It looks like milk. Yeah. I mean, I'd tell you that when you show me the fruit. You show me the fruit. Yeah, another god now. I think they have corporations. Good bit. So I have to rate it. Who's where you're saying it? All right. We did it. Oh, you want me to just judge him to them. Okay. Broken. No, I'm broke. I can't explain that to the right. Just fucked up. Stress. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna handle it. Okay. I'm gonna handle it. So literally was like, I almost pulled them off of the fucking Google. I was like, like a wolf-ball. What? You had such ones? Yeah. Oh, they haven't ever owned up this. But yeah, you can't. Well, I got a wolf throw with three slashes. That's true. They make more than that. We don't have a wolf. We just have a lot of things. I'm just going to see you later. I don't know. We have four of those. Okay. Why four? Four. Oh, shit. Well, that's going to change a rear so come on. It's the boring. You can just like, you can just, like, I can't even change the music. I'm like, take for a little bit of a way. Yeah, really. That's where they go. I'm not joking. So you're self-sufficient. Yeah, I don't think there's no one going to change the music. Well, you have, like, fucking DJs. You want in there for a desk? Yeah, I think, I think, being gone. But I don't even think, Tom, that would be more easy for you out here. How do you do it? I don't think me in the front desk. But I bet you got it. You're like, this. No, I don't do this. The other is a clinic. They had to put on, like, soft rock out there. Oh, okay. And you kept it. Right. I got my blood drawn tomorrow. You got it.

Is that midnight? I did not know if you were asking me to come to him. Could I just post it about my event jersey and a new message? So I thought you were gonna need that jersey and I'll come to you. I'll do both and then you can see that up the top. See this is how you do it. I've been putting myself in conditions to grow by speaking more. He's doing the same thing. It literally won't be in every, every time I can get any speaking thing. I need to get better out of bro. I'm getting better. The only way is brebs. Yeah. And like, I feel like I get to, like, that's was a great, honestly. We did a good job. Yeah. Thank you. Who is chill and I feel we were given high levels of life. But yeah, I'm thinking of Ben with a big success so I like very much about that. But hit legs today. You're what? 53 days. How do you treat these? It's moving? Right, almost eight. Eight weeks though. That's prep and for a show. I'm like 22 weeks though, so not very close. Talk and talk a lot, so. Yeah, so I'm still trying to get huge and you're trying to get skinny, so like good. Really? What is this? This is what I've ordered, so pretty. We're going to go all men. Wanna keep some! So that was all my energy numbers that fucked the rest of the world up. That was a point. It's good. Are you ready, questa? No, not凨der! That, you know, stutters been stuck in the case? I'm in the game, I've already killed a gun. All right, this is actually it. This is me. No more international travel for the rest of the year. I have two trips. One of them isn't in me and agreed so it won't kill me. The other one that was haunting so I'll get a good work out of them and we're locking it in to finally grow and get huge and be consistent because I've been fucking all over the place and legs have been taking a huge detriment of my legs and shrinking. I'm going to weaker and it's just not how I want to be. So time's up to myself. I did legs four days ago and doing it again today. I'm trying to get them huge so this is it. It's been too long. Finally not fucking traveling for a bit so it's had to be consistent.geons, going to my Davis. I'm going. Work longer left Xbox아요. I don't like it a lot, can you see this one? My boy.

You only do it. You didn't get that many reps in the first set or the action. What? Did you do it? The drop sets more when you only eat like six or seven, like five to seven reps in the first set. Then he drops, right? You just feel like you can be doing the nine or ten when you drop. Do the drop set. You want me to do it? Right? Sure. I think that's one. I can't even hear it from over there. You do a drop set if you only hit five or six, like if you did his hand or the leg in the first one, like it without dropping it, you wouldn't do the drop. It's more like the rep range. I intentionally went heavier to that drop. But sometimes I'll just do six and stuff. Yeah. I'll try and find out on six and drop. I'm doing it. Come on. Come on. Two. Another one. Oh, bro. You want me to go? No, no drop set. Do it. But it's just shot. I should shot a kick. Do it. Oh, this is your spot bro. Oh, this is your spot bro. Oh, this is your spot bro. Look.

A little bit moving the baguess. I've got a question. You don't need to push this guy. I think push. Katie. I was probably going to bring this to the... Oh, yeah. No one's scared to be doing this on camera. If people would be like, oh my god, she'd been pleased in the mud brum. This is supposed to go over not under. He's not pulling it right this way. Guess what? I don't fucking care. My little fuckers. These are Michael Jordan's motherfucking shoes. And I'm gonna wear them like I'm Michael Jordan. So there's a week for chasing after a four-piece. Just retired off my baseball season. Came back at the end of the year. You know, had a little rough finish last year, but that didn't happen because I wasn't actually in the NBA until about... When did you go in like the final quarter of the season? The final few games of the season. And you know what this is the one that counts. It's the four-piece baby. So, chainling my inner MJ. I have to tell you guys, if you missed it, he used to lace his own shoes, every single game. How to do it. This is me. We need him to pick week. Friday. Day before pick week begins. And I'm lacing up the Chicagos. I'm gonna be wearing them. Like I'm sitting my closet till they deteriorate. I'm gonna wear them. And I'm gonna love them because... This is my favorite Jordan shoe. Maybe the Chicago lows are my favorite because I like lows better. But these remind me of Spider-Man. Because Spider-Man, I will wear these too. And all the movies. He just like fucking ran through the city in $2,000 shoes. I'm not a very cool. But yeah, we're lacing these up. I'm gonna wear these at the gym today, I think. So, you know, each... She's had a nice little nap. I tried to stay awake and watch much of Wolverine, Kelvin, three-five. Watch it. Look at the Logan after. That's one. Wolverine. Like the original. Wolverine. Like 2013. Like the one, Jack. Like the other. Yeah, that one's good. That's a little uncomfortable, right? And then I'm gonna watch Logan after. Because Hugh Jack and the G and he's coming back was dead pool. So, yeah. I couldn't say awake though, I fell asleep. I don't even know what I'm talking about right now. I'm gonna make a meal right now. We're gonna go to the gym. I got fucking Dr. Marlin coming into massage tonight. Coming from Florida. Best massage at the therapist I've ever had. He's coming into the gym tonight. I'm gonna get massage tonight tomorrow. Maybe Sunday. And then wrap those up. And, Vegas, baby. You guys don't know. 2017, 2018, 2019. Stayed in a similar hotel to this. That will not be named. And then in 2019, me, Matt Calvin, stayed here with Courtney. And it was like the first year at one. Calvin was vlogging with her first prep series. Maddie was here fucking just grinding. Helping dude. Fucking God's work. Calvin's annoyingness shit at me. Corti's doing God's work. He's got a lot of time for me. So it feels good to have the team here. And very grateful to have the boys back in the hotel. That was a show that we named. And the gym and do what we do. So good vibes here. Calvin literally found the same picture in the same room that they were in. So it feels good to be back in Vegas. And I gotta tell Sam and eat. And we're going to go with Jim and knock it apart. There's a lot of terrible stuff like I rather live. I think it protects like a fine foot for a little bit. Alright guys, just here in Vegas. First working on Vegas last official chest Vegas. You're all going to be the week of the last workout. I'll probably do a little chest mix. We get some points just kind of like burning out a little bit. Like in our body day, chest back arm show. Like making stuff up. Right now this is mainly chest much a little bit of delts at the end. These workouts. There's no PR as we know nothing about the carbs are even lower right now. So over what I mean a little bit later. So I gotta make wait. Time to bring down my weight. So over 240. Well over 240. So we've got to come down a bit by next Wednesday. But you know how to be a job done. Some wake masks up. Getting my chest pump or lack thereof. And push what I got left in me because this is grand time. Less than five workouts left I guess. So we're going to do rocks. So nothing glorious to be workout. It's fun to normally have to feel a weight. By the first three reps I'm like, oh just late I can go up. And how late that felt in the first three reps I could typically add like another. I'm going to five to a plate on top of that.

Basically, it's very similar to a Smith machine. But it's ISO. So you get the benefits of using a machine. But also the freedom of a dumbbell. It's a very similar to a Smith machine. But it's ISO. So you get the benefits of using a machine. But also the freedom of a dumbbell all in one machine. And you can use this as a shoulder press or an incline press. So we're using it as shoulder press and going up to two place, which is a good amount of weight. How's the feel? It's good. Nice that it's converging. So it feels natural. It's very heavy. It feels like free weight. Yeah. So those of you know don't know what converging means. It means that as the dumbbells come together. And that's naturally the range of motion you use. You use dumbbells. But you have the safety of being able to walk in if you end up going further. What is up YouTube? So I had a three videos and finished out of them. So I was on the day three.

See positive things. But now. I think we should go a little bit lighter. And then let's go ahead and change up the grip a little bit. I'm using a neutral grip. And from there, go a little deeper. Get a faster delts. Get a nice range of motion. And then we're great. Like an argument like converging just like if we had one of the not-of-process but being that we don't have it we're just going to simulate it here. Give it that a little more. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's two sets with neutral grip. More weight. Probably like 60. Start off with 60 and then it's got to see a few. I think you got time to warm up. Okay, well. So at least. Yeah, same as mine. There you go. Like this. Good. Side lower than one. I don't know if that. Second. Right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Partial. Partial. Partial. That's it. Good job. One of my axis. Good job over here. All right. So what we're doing is we're using the Penata Multi-Flight Machine. It can be used for ladder raises and as well as front raises as well as cable. Almost similarly a cable fly. The great thing about it is it's got this joint center points. You'll see some of the machines now with different manufacturers that are used. The joint center point X. You want to do is the moving point in the joint in your shoulders. We lined up with that. You'll be a little bit higher, a little bit lower. Of course, you're trying to fit right in if you had a pull or a some kind of middle rod that go right through your shoulder. You'd want to be able to hit that point. But if you're somewhat in that vicinity, you're going to have a really good contraction. But if you're too high or too low, the biomechanics are going to be a good. The biomechanics are going to feel off. So always try to line up whenever you can with the center point to can. I'll do it all out. Is that feel better on that? And or do you like to use that hand? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Good. There you go. Squeeze up. Good control. I've got that slow up. Slow up. Again. Up. Good. Slow down. Slow down. Good. One more. Up. Slow down. Follow. Woo. Good.

Where do you have lunch on? Holy fuck. That's a bit of a relief. All those ones. Yeah, we're just... I thought it was the one that you found. Dude, it's a big chair. It's a big chair. I think it's bad. I didn't know it was that one. The fact that you got enough. The jokes thing is someone probably saw that, eh? Like, they're like, look at up a chair just flying. They're just flying. They're like, where are you? So, not even there. They were done. Yeah, they were. So heavy. To move, we'll get it like... You think? It's not a light chair. I will say that. I thought I was the one that was on. I was like... You know the one where you put the cushioning... You just pick it up. No. That's not the one that's on. No, dude. It's like all over. That's fucked. Yeah, I didn't know that. Yeah. So, you should have my... No, wait. Wait. I need to go for a bit of a walk. It's a scratch. No, no. Olympia 2025, eh? I don't know. I don't know.

So, look at that on the top of the car. I look good, man. I'm very proud. What? That's so pretty. I was gay. I was gay. We have a month in like six days before we're no boys bodybuilding show. Three of the studies down to pull up and judge potentially. We're going to let the fans vote. We're going to let the fans vote. All right, well let's go. All right, well let's go. I'll win. I'll win that in your neck a little bit. Can you do some of the ease? The J-pop? Yeah, I'm so excited. I'm going to go the metal, eh? Yeah. Are you manifesting? Yeah. More in this breakfast, like, we're now. Next Mr. O. Yes, man, that photo. You're not like fried, dude. There's no rage. Where's the rage at? To them up to 60. That's true. Well, to 60 it up to the rage. Yeah. Look to 58. Yeah, folks. All right, so we are here in Atlanta. I've been traveling a lot and not really talking about even what we're traveling for. But the difference was raw and bomb managing growing them is that we have to use a lot more to serve it as for energy because they go into a lot more stores, sea stores, which convenience stores, gas stations on that stuff rather than raw, which goes in like white and macho, but we sell it by the macho and then they're all across the country or G and C's the same thing. So we have to partner with the tubulars in each state each county that have a good connection with them. They'll sell for us. They'll go to the store and make sure everything looks good. Looks pretty. Everything's in stock on the shelf. Everything that we need. So we need to sell the brand to them and then sell the brand to places like QT, raise tracks, seven loving, all that stuff and they help us get it in all those stores. Sell to them. They already have relationships with them. But it's a much different business. It's not just selling to the end consumer like you guys. We have to convince multiple levels of the business to take it, sell it and promote it for us. And it helps us kind of grow. So that's what we've been doing in traveling to states, different companies, help us go through it. We're going to land right now trying to get into those gas stations here. The first one we're going into is going to be a Dallas Texas. So we're going to be going down there meeting with them again next week. So a huge part of this year is going to be a lot of travel. A lot of meeting with distributors, DSD, what we call and just trying to get the brand out there. So this is the breakout year for Bum Energy and raw. We got some protein RTDs, lots of cool stuff. So that's what we're doing down here in Atlanta trying to push it out here for lunch. I think it's the same with shop. I really hope that the dumps that it is. We're going to eat head back home in and out Atlanta in the same day. So be home tonight. Physi times. Got a love it.
