Guys, you ever have a special dish? Yeah, we have a special dish. And then if you want anything else? Honey, what's your take on a similar deadlift thing? Sumo deadlift? Yeah. We're a sumo and deadlift thing should not be the same. Sumo is for sumo and deadlift thing is deadlift. You shouldn't be using that in the same sentence. Oh, here we go. Come on, come on, Chris. Come on, come on. We go. We go. Come on, let me in check. Come on, let's go, let's go. Always there. We're going to take a look at the camera. What is up YouTube? Welcome to our final day here in Texas, our final look at what came back there. One of my most crucial, important test days of the week, building a thick juicy back. This is technically the fourth day of the year, we're all training and never do that. I'm only three on one, I'll three on one off. But, not missing the opportunity to turn on the economy in the holidays here, a whole more time. So, we'll rest tomorrow. And, how many things? Only post you picked up many reps a day when the week is here. So, just getting to moralize your whole week, but you know, it's tough on me, I prepared. So, doing some back-to-day full-back work here, right? Everything we did by the tip, today, so we're going to do a good one. I'm going to crush it, have one final day of your in Texas, so we're going to make it worth it. It's going to be a good one. Worts of wisdom for the people. Yes, it's going to be an epic back day. We're going to be a good one. We're going to do some back-to-day work here. We're going to do some back-to-day work here. We're going to do some back-to-day work here.

I'm still longer, getting it and bringing my elbows down. Hold your shoulder arms. Any shoulder arms. Maybe I can just cut a few inches of my arms and then they'll grow out. and they'll grow up. Take some of these. We'll try it out. Yeah. One thing Dehani did tell me to do this box. So I made it this way. I always have a tendency of tucking my chin and looking down, looking forward. You told me to keep my vision looking up when we're doing these pull-downs. Just so you really like elongate the lats, get that full stretch. And you're squeezing from your back right and clunking your abs forward. It also keeps your muscles up. And you're lifting up helps. And you're less likely to pull with your arms. You want to use your arms as hooks and contract lats. That pull from the elbows. That's right. You don't even have no elbows or no knees. So just straight arms or straight legs. No elbows. And I go walk at least. Four arms are killing me. Just make sure you keep your pants in. Keep your pants in. Keep your tension, brother. Stay stiff, brothers. Keep your tension so you don't have water retention. Hello, work? I got some of those, Ryan. Tension, water retention. Get a week. Could be better. It could be turning into it. Because normally you're at 275-15, right? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I do. Well, I'm going to work this way. Make it a working set then. Because I think you're going to be right there. Alright? All right?win. Fine Oh, okay. I was at the... I was probably close to the other way. I think the ones with the stone I'm not going to get rid of them. Okay. I think it's a three-fifth team last week. We got it. You know, the pleated there, buddy. Yeah? Love the pleated. Also day four and row. Yeah, I'm saying. Just do the pleated training. I think a little day off tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Down for a bit. That's four nuggets. No. Right. Don't worry about getting extra rest on this. Just the money fail, fail. Just stop. Oh, you know, don't let me pass on the board. Just keep it tight. And then just try to... No need to try to control it to very fast. And get a really good contraction. Perfect. Perfect. Good. Good. You just open back. Excellent. Excellent. Good job, Chris. Good job, Chris. Good. When you back. Good. Good. Good job. Good job. Hey. Because you're going to start lifting too much. That heavy weight you're going to start getting up and sitting. That becoming like a variation of a stradden. Don't you get throws when you pull high? Put over it on. No, he hates his action under it. I don't know. Oops. You can't do this again. Good. Stretch. Good. Good. Good stretch. Good stretch. Squeeze. Squeeze. Grab it. Hold it. Good. Hold it. Good. Good. Squeeze. Good. Squeeze. Squeeze. Last one. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job.

Good. Good. Good. You know what? You can do it. You know what? This machine, though, is converging pull down machine. I'm too tall for it. My arms are too long so I can't pull the extend. But I love doing this with a lightweight. Because it really makes you trick your head in the back. It will bite. So it's a little lighter way. I come in and squeeze and imagine it's on the back. And it's that exact same motion. I guess you put it into it. Perfect for bodybuilding. You feel the position. But I'm sadly my long ass arms. I'll immediately use the machine properly. I'm going to try it. What's your take on a similar deadlift thing? Sumo deadlift? Yeah. There's Sumo and deadlift thing should not be used together. I don't know. Is that what you're building that? I'll see what deadlift thing is to do. Sumo is for Sumo and deadlift thing is deadlift. You shouldn't be using that in same sentence. Here we go. Sumo got to come in after you. Sumo. Come on.
