I have no idea who you are, but I think you're a bit, but you're like, beautiful. Thank you so much. Of course, yeah. Come on, come on, Chris. Come on, you're one in two, four, come on. Come on, Chris. Come on, Chris. What's up? What's up? What? You two officially made it to Columbus, Ohio, Ohio, for the Arnold Classic. It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood. And we arrived. It's a beautiful mega-fit meals. They got the new green box. Very fancy. We got a bum box too. It's bum some more. So never miss a meal. Okay, for that we're going to check it over. Right now, maybe get some fun, you know? Get some good food. Good Kelvin, that'll trust that we know a good father. We'll get some fun, yeah? Well, yeah. We're going to be traveling out of people. She can hand kiss and date with the lovely dreams. So stay tuned. All right, first order of business. Make sure you door closed. We leave the auto. Second order of business. We went to this amazing Fumple X last year. And like I said, come to the side to go because his mom makes delicious food. The grandma grandma makes a lot of fun. Oh, my God. The grandma makes a lot of fun. She makes a good father. Probably not that good, but it's certainly good. So we're going to go snack. Yeah, because all we like to do when you travel at the get good food, because what better things are to do than throw in that food. Eat them. So you lied to me, so that doesn't get off. This is wrong. Yeah, that's wrong. I forgot. That's why bad. But I like rubbing better food. We're all laughing at me. What's that? What's that? Do you have that Marry To Eat? You're all laughing at me. What's that? What's that? Do you have that Marry To Eat? That's what I'm talking about. You have that. You have that. You have that. You have that. That's what I like. That's what I like. Each Iraqi ramen. Yeah, this is the Naruto dish. That's why I actually really loved it. But you took out the most important part. The mushroom? You say that, but for leaving it, you have a spiritual experience for a bad and to the shiit. You have no Naruto dish. What? You even know this game. Yeah. Roodle. Why? It's like him. Oh, I know that. I was in the last one. It was just a trick. This is something I heard. I'm going to play cover news. Where's he going? Yes. Yes. He's a hero. He's going to... But it's a character that can all... moldy and then he doesn't fall in? No? Please? No. I'm going to go ahead and pursue it. I have to do it. And I'm probably out of here. I thought they'd go away if I left Florida. I thought they'd kick me in. They asked you. I would give it a kiss. You're so high-bro and you're like, how high-bro? Because that high-bro. Yes. I thought they'd go away if I left Florida. They'd go away if I'd get wild. But it was smoked blood. It was a blood. It was a blood. It was a blood. What? What? A weed. Fuck. He's high-drew. I wish him to fill me to him on a cup of also high-tech. Oh, yeah. That's it for today folks. We got some meeting tomorrow. We got a swing, some protein, and some bond trees, and some bomb energy. So we're going to be doing some meeting with distributors. And then I'm going to have a seminar with Harni. I'm going to have a meat grid, and then signature, and then dinner. We're going to be a long-distance day. So I'm going to go to bed soon. We'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll see you guys tomorrow. Do you guys win? No? Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the birthday, guys. Can we transition every clip like this? No. So did you sell it? Yeah. I've never loved everything. They were hooked on literally everything. Dom is a fucking... What's that word? What's the jokes that they always say? So whatever you picture, you know? What? A salesman? No, there's those jokes. People always say, can't remember that they're really funny. They could sell it and they didn't want. But it's like a joke. Someone in the comments could tell me what it is. And I'll remember it. But you could sell it if you don't want. So they really liked it. They were super happy. They didn't even have any energy. It was just because it didn't make it a sin. But they still love the concept of it. The idea of it, the look of it, the love of our treats, everything. So beautiful, good to go. Check off number one on two and another one. What is this? What is this? The cafe means dope. Okay, what is this? It's like a lot of tape it was less milk. A lot of tape is a kind of hat. This is like three quarters of coffee. Corking that. Yeah, yeah. I think that's what I thought. It might be wrong, but it's an envelope. It's like pretty much a black coffee with a little milk. It's a steam remote. So it's not like an equivalent of this steam. So it's not as heavy as a lock. Is it an envelope? No. It's a catapult. But two bigs like others from my. Jesus. Yeah. I don't know which one of those. A little bit of bugs. It's a hybrid. Someone has the order of courty's eye here. Someone has the order of letters. Because they were talking about stable. So I'm eating shit. It's horrible digestion. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What are we going to do? I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to, I should have scared of you. I was going to. I was going to. I was going to go to my course all the spike will be sent last so long. He's going to hold the water if he limp you up. I was going to do that. I'm still worried about that. That's it. You know what I mean? That's it. There we go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. I'm going to do this. I think that's nice. Nice. And there's something. And there's something you don't look at. You use my bags to get around. I'm going to go over there. Yeah. How you doing? Yeah. It's the one set. Now I was going to be there. Oh, there you go. I got to go back. I just need to let you know.

Alright, so we just wrapped up. Seven hours of honey. Foot-of-off with people and autographs. I'm losing my mind right now. There's a lot of people. They're super organized here at the Arnold. It's really nice. We're going to VIP treatment. Bring me in the back room. We have security walk me from place to place. Which is really nice. And I can't walk through the Expo anymore. So it was very convenient and organized. Not for a lot of pictures. Everyone was super nice. I got to meet. Yeah, so thank you guys for coming out. We'll listen to seven of our kids before we'll offer a piece of your gift. We did make it in. Try new lot of events so I can get to meet you guys in much of a possible. Very tiring for me. But it's definitely fun to actually meet you guys. Put a face to some of the numbers on social media and all that stuff. I'm a more of a personal guy in person. So that's a wrap on day one. We are here at the place called Natta's Mexican food. It's Mexican food. It makes him feel probably my favorite food group. Absolutely delicious. Chip, welcome, boy. Plantage, chip, fajita tacos. We can eat it all day. So we're going to chat down right now. She'll hopefully get to bed early and pretty much repeat tomorrow. So we'll wrap on the day. We're going to see what we're doing here. Just kidding. I think I like how many people eat for coffee this morning. We're going. It's really good. See you. We're going. It's really good. See you. You know what we're doing here? No. See you. We're trying to figure out how many sexes we've had. It's a wonderful event. Yeah. But therefore, it doesn't matter what you do. Because we have to think of something. You speak with us. No, my own. No, no, no. Exactly. But it's a journey that we're going to work on. We're going to work on the early and the early and the early and the early. See. We're going to try and go again. We're going again. We're going again. I think we're going to go. I think we're going to go. Very clear. I think we're going to go. Let's go. Wait. I want to see you. I'm sorry. Thank you. I think we're going to... I think we're going to be... But we're going to have a chance. We're going to be... Go, maybe. Go. Okay. We'll be going. Okay. We'll be going. We'll be going. Let's make it all tonight. Talk to Pettler. Let me do this off. Can you imagine what I don't send? He competed in Europe. One of the universe. Got on a plane. He came all the way here. Can you US. It's not that on stage really. 40-hour later. And it should want the Mr. World. Can you even imagine doing such a thing? I can't help. I like to fly in two weeks before I show up. I have to fly in some of the 48 hours. It's no time. Not enough time. So, credit is too guys. It's super crazy. And I mean, I want to take a quick home setting up here. Can you give me a few sticks of gym or a bird? I want to give a few stick to our own. For making this sport such an amazing... I don't know where I should look today. The biggest popular thing in some of my family. And I can go home. He grateful to be in the United States too. I'm making a whole lot of things myself. Thank you, Arnold. Since they're all, they've got a two-week free shit to you. And everyone lives day. Thank you for all of you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much. I'm a big and power of this. We've become very good friends. Because I think this is what the world is looking for when they look at the ideal body. They don't want to be as monsters as some of those guys. They want to have the real beautiful proportions. The symmetry, the muscle separations. They're great pose and routine that you have. I mean, you know, I've seen pictures of you from far away. And the silhouette is so fantastic. And that's really the quality of the face. It's the silhouette. When you're far away, you know, the beach. You can see someone that you see the deltudes popping out. You see the abs. You see the calves. You see all this great proportion. Rather than you see someone wiling down. And the beach right right. And over 300 pounds. That's the bad actionist. This is bad actionist. And this is why you're still making millions of people in Maori and New York. And following you and all this stuff. That's why you're as successful. So how we should all do greatest of the luck. You deserve it because you're fantastic. You see. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Thank you. All right. So Saturday morning woke up. It's morning and apparently I had to do this thing at 8 am. And we had no idea what it was. Show up. And it's something with Arnold. I guess I'm like, okay. I mean, I'm not going to complain. But it gets to see Arnold Schwarzenegger. And he comes in and he's like, I look at him. I'm like, you know what I'm doing here? He's like, I have no idea. I know what we had no idea what we were doing. They're out half asleep. And he no coffee in me. And then they threw us out there. And just had to, I guess, talk to Kill Time to kind of start the show and give the VIP ticket holders like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't experience the listen to Arnold talk. And yeah, it was pretty cool. I honestly being up there with him. And honestly, very honored that they showed me to put up there. Bob Chick-Low, Chick-A-Rell was kind of like, I'm seeing it. And then being Arnold channe up there for a bit. Mainly just Arnold talking because he's a girl to show. We were just listening to him. But it's cool to be all sand up there with him. So not about where to start Saturday morning. But back here, we go high at Otao through the Arnold. Exactly where I'm at right now. We have another meeting at 10 a.m. today. I think that's it for meeting today. And then I have the meet grief, signatures again. And then that's it for today and for a few tomorrow. So that's the Arnold class for you. We're in the dressing. What? You trained? If we had time today, I won't work out. I probably have time after this to work out for two and ten and three. 10, 33 or whatever. So maybe try and get a workout in this new gym here, build American Barbell. I don't put up in the apparently really close. I heard training there so we might try and check that out. But yeah, it's better when we chill in the day. We're going to get some Starbucks. Maddie's going to get it. We're hiding upstairs. And yeah, also I've plastic with the graph that last day. I remember one look pretty fucking nutty. I'm not gonna lie. Definitely more shred than he was at the LMP last year. So last year this year, whatever fuck you want. He looked really good. Happy for him. He seemed like he watched his acceptance speech. He was like in shock. He was like, you know, he was like, you know, he was like he was like, you're supposed to be in person when I story like shit crazy man, shit crazy. He was speaking. He was very well. He was so excited to be out there with Arnold. So it was really cool to watch. Happy for him. Errskim second. No surprise there. He looked really good too. It was a little bit off. I think something going to happen before the show. But still to the fact that him being a little off comes second at the Arnold super impressive. So it was cool. And make the badass. Like some are feel, I knew I knew what it was. He came third I believe. So hats top five and you don't be on third of the Arnold. You got to stay play. He's placed in the top five classes. He's right now. He looks really good. And then I think Alex Caminaro was in fourth. So you know, really good lineup. And it was cool to see it and get the watch to show. Sadly, but they look really good. So happy for them. Love me some classic. Now we're going to get some food going about today. So I'll see you guys later. Crack open the cold one brother in light of our meeting this morning that was revolved around energy. When a crack open in a bummer energy, have I show this on YouTube? Yeah, actually officially. The first YouTube appearance of bummer energy. We'll look at this beautiful can. It's actually a really beautiful. Take us a fucking minute to make it. But it looks really good. This is our new energy room coming. We're doing a beer style can. So look cool. We're going to maybe put it like beer boxes in the future. Got like that little vintage retro look to it. Got much exact caffeine in the happening. I would say 112. 112. 112. 112. I'm going to have the caffeine. So it's a couple of like a large 12 ounce cup of coffee. But it's not one of those things we can blast your face off with three hundred milligrams of caffeine. That's what pre-workout is for. But this is more of a casual sipping energy drink that you can have multiple day. Not feel bad about yourself. And it tastes literally like cornstoda. Like out of a fountain. That McDonald's more soda. We also have cherry flush flavor, which tastes like. Wait. Red cherry flush. Frost thing. But it tastes delicious. So we're going to have a caffeine ourselves. Get to the gym. Get a quick workout because we're going to be back here in like two hours. So let's be on the room. I hate public germs. So we're here at this random esports class at the convenience. I don't know what you mean is. I'm going to try and bang with some shoulders. So I'm probably not going to talk much through it. But you guys know the typical drill. I'm going to try and bang on a lot of real delts. Because how do you tell me to focus on that this offseason. It's a bunch of real delts. A little bit shoulders. It's a quick 45 minute workout. We've got to get to the expo. So I'm hoping that I don't get bothered too much. And I can finish the workout quick. Wish me luck. I'm going to do it. I want to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Alright, so I'm not venturing over the dumbbell section. So it's going to be a machine cable kind of workout. It's a root out cable flies. People, lateral rates, that might say we're all going to do anyway. We're just machine only because the other machine's faking finished with a play load of machine. And then we'll see what time it is. And if I have to sample one more root out, it'll be that. And then, get that a lot on out of here back to the F. Like not getting happy when it's a more weight loss. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. That's true. That's true. That one's good. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the rap on day two of six. Calvin throws the camera on me. I hope he says it doesn't often work. So we're going to try and try and cross the street. Talk to the camera until time. Let's rap on day two of six. That was a longer day. But it was a beautiful day. They're very organized. So I'm sorry we thought we're going to get some steak. She's taking this. She's taking this. We're almost running to it. But yeah, so we're going to eat. And I'll see you guys later tomorrow. I don't know. But it's day and error. It's in your reach out. Is it for me anymore? That's all he gave us. Has he? That's what he did. No, that's because we've worked in the past. No, because he's just... But we said he just snapped it all the boys in line with me. But I guess he was just rest on them. I don't know. Can you just like home? It was day all along. It's like... Yeah. We're all right, we're going to do that. I didn't think it through. I was like, oh shit. You know, he's not going to be able to touch the box. You're like, you're going to use it now. I don't know. There's no good. You're telling me to have a baker in the back of that one.
