Rude. Give me the salad. I'm just finger at all the kids. Did she not call them the children? Man babies. You just finger at them. The man babies. What? I can't wait for them. I literally cannot. I cannot. Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on, you're one. Two. Two. Two. Come on, you're one for you. Come on. What's there? What's up, YouTube? It's been a long time. What is up, YouTube? It's been a long time. I don't normally talk about vehicles or anything like that, but you know what? I'm going to wrap my car today and we're going to log in the day. So this is my new vehicle, my daily beautiful little driver. It's a nice little truck. Also known as the Raptor R. It's a beautiful 700 horsepower off-road Baja. Jump in truck. Absolutely unnecessary horsepower and tech for someone who doesn't take it off-roading. But beautiful and it drives great and it sounds good. So, you think it's better? Not bad. When I told you to get this and you said no. Well, I didn't think I'd be able to get with these things that are really hard to get. So, you've showed it to my boy that bar toe forward, bar toe forward after your in Florida. Go for dealership. But yeah, I don't love the color. The only color I can get is the only color I can get. The only color I can get with the anti-matter blue. So, it's kind of like a dark blueish black. And it's cool, but I really like, I had a white truck my whole life and I really like light-colored trucks. So, I'm actually going, I got it like four days going up going to get a wrap. So, I'm going to get a wrap. This is like really cool chalk gray. Like the same color as the chalk Porsche. They make the dom has it, you know, it is Porsche. And I really like just light white color. So, we're going to get a wrap, one of one color, the wrap there are. And yeah, that's all it's going on. And we're going to head to the warehouse. So, we're going to drive there and come to get a cup. We're going to talk about how we're going to wrap it and then pick it up in a week. And I'm sure you got the final product. So, see you guys over there. We'll take this off and I can be traces with the black. So, we can do it to black, please, right here. And we can actually keep quantity. Yeah, yeah, sure. I think I want to be set. Yeah, if you're going to have it on the R and then on the side, just let that stuff go. Yeah, that's up in the back. Right here. Yeah, up here. And this is going to be a powder coat, too. It's kind of thing, it's plump, plump. It's easy to do. I'm just going to come right off, so we won't see here. And we're going to head back. I'll see how much we've painted this and get it off. I'm sure it's going to cost, I'll be on our box. Better go to the will. Or I don't. They just going to pick it up. So, go straight up. I'm like a charging thing. So, as I take off, it's out of the way. I'll see you all some of the picture of the first, good measurement, see if the more charging. But whatever they want to charge me off, charge straight to you, I need to make my own out of that. But if you're sure, of course, yeah, so I'll pull this. We'll keep the orange on there. Do you want to do black right here instead? Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. So, it's like, it's all black. I know, do like a black, you're matching. You can't even do black, you're matching. You can't even do black, you can't even do black, you can't even do black. You can even do black, you can even do black, you can even do black, you can even do black. So, you keep the gray. Like, with this, it'll be all be gray. Yeah, that'll be gray right there. All across. Yeah, the middle will be black. Yeah. I do black. Kind of like the nearest inside. Yeah. But, I'm going to get some of that. Almost looks like panoramic. You're going to be like, I'm going to see it as our Audi. Yeah. I'm like, okay. Yeah. Yeah, like that. Yeah. Yeah. You can look at that a lot. Yeah. We're back in something to redraw that. Do you want to hold that? Yeah, man. You know, it's kind of nice to be with us. Are you from here? Yeah, from here. Not from Canada. Not. Or not. This is what we have. I love this totally. There's things, pretty. Baged off in the door. Really? Don't open the door. It's from a same PDH, pre-delivering� inspection. all the time. It's the only goes to 25 miles an hour. What is the first one? When the guys were in the dealership, they scuffed their stuff to there. Susie came and took a picture. She's a client. I'm gonna ask you J and have her contact with Mondays. Yeah. And I was a youngster. I saw this all night. I was like, thank you for showing me. Yeah. Take a close look at the chocolate. Yeah, it's perfect. Take a little blue hue and set a sandwich here. Yeah. I think I had a white wrap at the before. It was just like the light color. But you wanted to go generic. I wrapped it in a circle. Yeah, it's like the perfect couple. Yeah, this was it. Yeah. So you... All right. Sad times. I got a new vehicle. I'm really sick about it. Very quickly. Just dropped it off at Palm Beach Raps. Like 30 minutes from my house, but Dom got a lot of his cars here. And whenever you go to a rap place, if you see a Lamborghini or a sitting there, I think they're pretty good at rapping. So, trust them with a lambo, trust them with the truck. But I'm gonna leave you here for five days. He said, they're gonna rap it. I'm gonna look like a brand new beautiful truck when we get back. So, that's that. We're gonna head back home now. For the warehouse. We've got our shipping above energy. So, I think I'm gonna have show you guys all the beautiful palette above energy. Let you guys know why exactly it's gonna be launching. Because you're very excited about that. So, stay tuned. Oh, I guess this. That's the worst feeling ever. All right. Given update, what's my going on? Yes, right up there right now. I can't breathe. All right. Update, what happened last week? Last week we had Carly down to you guys saw that we shot for about energy. Those pictures are looking fucking sick. Coming up soon. I'll talk more about that one, the whereas we see it. But we also had a really interesting few meetings. What's that guy that we hired to be our chief brand officer? So, we have a lot of creative this in our brand. A lot of branding we put out. But a lot of structure to the lacky. So, we hired someone to kind of come in and really forward. We have a lot of companies coming up next year. So, we're trying to like, streamline and organizing them. And building proper brand, voice and message for all of them. There's something that we've been missing and to really take our actual brand. To the next one for others. It's like product. We needed somebody to help us. So, we hired to have me camped out. Using Terry getting us hanging out with everyone for the last week. Kind of putting systems in play and talking about shit. And then took all our information, talked with somebody company for a few hours. And then he went to go home and he works with a team and they put it together like a deck. And he works with that going forward and created like brand campaigns, creative campaigns. Just like suffocating forward to create like one of our vision of the brand. So, we are very excited about that. Big main focus on that is for a really. Because that's our kind of baby right now that we're focusing on the drugs. So, I'm really excited about that. Do it's pricey. But, you know, we're pushing putting our body back into the company right now. Just to like elevate it as much as we can. So, it's really fun to kind of see different levels of the business that it's coming to. And, which way do we need to take it? Obviously, like it's cool like promoting supplements and stuff all the time. But, like, you see brands like Nike and fucking the theaters even, whatever the bread bowl, these huge companies that are more of a brand than even our product. They're not known for one product. So, it's really cool, even Jordan. It's like different than Nike, but it's own brand. Both of us are in the same umbrella. The plastic is really cool how they built that long lasting like life to the brand. So, that's what we're working on right now. So, that's going to be coming out next year or so, and forever on. So, come to about that. But, not just chilling, but the dream. Not jumping for a while, so, can't you play in? That's mainly what we had a party this week, too. And you will rob, rob, free-live party. Like, uh, what you call those? A work hour? A gala? Dom has so many businesses outside of just us, and then brought them all together with rob, and to like 160% gala. And we did it, and we gave it a war, it's kind of rewarding our team members and employees who were putting in that first stuff. And it's something you've done for the last like four or five years, which is really cool. Because I was at one of the first ones, but we did it in a restaurant, in a corner of a restaurant. And there was like 15, 20 people there. And that was like athletes and employees, and all the shit now, there's 160 people. Like, 80 people they couldn't make it, so it's pretty crazy how much there's an hour team of grown. Very exciting. Dr. Fucking Beast, he's taken it over the world, so she said to me out for the red, but that's actually like I don't know. So, we'll see you get the door and stuff. I should have your face too. Jesus, I'm caught off. Leave me in a fuck alone. And you've stuck on your face, sir. Okay, well, like, don't film me that. Why do you need it? You don't film me, you babe. Please. I'm done being roasted. Did you see the story yesterday, Calvin? Yeah, I know. I thought I was softer too. Oh, all those ones, yeah. This is how you become a viral. By being a viral sensation. Yeah, by being a gross, double meme. That's how Chris got up to his popularity. Babe, I'm going to follow your footsteps. By the way, I won't be by well. I'm kidding. Not filming me, and then everyone makes fun of me on YouTube. I'm not really knowing. Yes, I do. I'm really not one person. I'm really not one person. I'm going to fuck you down. Everybody just follow me. Oh, I'm just going to fuck you down. It's so... It's so... The best I could do. I'm walking away in shame. Alright, so that is the morning. A little bit late today, but it's okay. I got blocked in my job. I'm going to be a little bit too busy my car. But it's our day. It's a really more than our day. I'm actually going to be taking the next three days off the gym. So obviously, I have to hit our before I take them off. But I'm doing blood work on Friday. It's the most accurate way to not have like high formation from her eating. Not too high. I had it in a bunch of other blood markers. It's taken a few days off the gym before. So that's what I'm going to be doing. I'm trying to make sure I'm all healthy. Before you have this Aussie to go on. So we blasted our workout early morning. She ate this morning. I had like a bunch of oats. The morning kind of starving when I woke up. And I went there ready to do a fast workout. So a little bit of food in me. And my brain's not fully awake yet. So pretty good job to do it. Alright, so I like to start with this long-ass rope. If you don't have it, you can take two ropes and pull the attachment to the side and make each rope long. And attach two ropes on it. And I'm just trying to make sure my shoulders aren't locked in. But not able to pull it then. I'm going to make sure it's back into the fully contracted position. The tightest spot you can get your triceps behind your back. So I'm looking like pushing. And almost like pulling back a little bit. Almost like a lot pull over. But I'm just pulling for my triceps and you really feel tight. So it's a good way to warm them up. Then we're going to do some like close grip. So this machine I think. So I'm just trying to make sure that there's a lot of blood on my triceps. And I know her myself in the morning. She's going to do that. She's going to do that. Who would you? Paul Press? Yeah. Or freeweight. Floor. Would you like to? Jenga. And you crossed the gym. So floor prosthetics. Yeah. Does it give me a paddle? I don't know how to get up. Oh my god. My athletic. I'm going to do that. What floor press? It probably been three years. What's that done this? Actually feels good. Kind of the purpose of floor breast is working your lock out. If your paddle is doing your lock out is essentially your tricep movement at the end. So focusing on triceps right now in the press. Getting less stretcher my pecs. Marvellous coming as far back. I'm just trying to keep it all right on my tricep. My tricep touches the floor. Contract and lock it out. It feels so bad. I'm just going to get you off the ground. Sorry to have you. I thought she felt really good. I'm not going to lie. Floor plus. Floor plus. Floor script. Go to. Floor. Floor. Floor. Floor. Floor. Floor. What else can I do? Finish tricep before doing biceps? I can't handle my biceps. I can't handle my triceps. I can't handle my triceps. This is my go to the favorite machine in the gym. A classic staple. I can't handle my go to warm up and I'm not doing heavy. At least you have to mean. Actually it's a train back in the day we go back and forth. Trying to get really heavy. It's good. At the time, I'm really trying to build my arm. I feel like I'm doing a little higher volume. I'm going to drop it and see how many I can get. One 25 on the rack. This is the warm up. Don't just go. I can't be on the fucking YouTube. I can't be on the fucking YouTube. Huh? You just finger it all the kids. What? You just finger it all the kids. Just you're not called them the children. Mad babies. You just finger it on. The mad babies. What? I can't wait for them. I literally cannot. I cannot. You guys are still in pain. I'm not in the mood. See? Still. Oh. Sorry for the trouble. It's something I wanted to do. I'm setting on the machine. I have to hold the bar up. Here, on the bottom of my hand I have to go over here. I feel my body is pulling along this way. I have big ass hands and skinny wrists. I'll talk the wrong way. All the motion you put on my delir, my four minute film, I'll buy a set. So, play round with it. Move her into the room. All right, taking bicep and my girls, I'm letting the bar fall a little bit down my hands. I'm holding it at the top of the demo, rather than middle of the bottom. And I'm coming up and pulling like this. I'm really focusing on pulling in my bicep here. I'm actually taking that rather than just letting your wrist touch and pulling shoulder up and shit. And feeling a little bit more inside of my bicep. I'm trying to get those fucking fillets for arms. My clothes. Should we get him blends? No. I'm feeling it. Fucking huge bro. No more skinny bitch. But if it's a little bit too weak, it's out. So, be with him. Left and here. Left, вариант. Mmm. Alright, last try set thing, we're gonna do is behind the head cable kick back strap extension, name that myself, but just a little bit of a nice way of doing school crusher here is over the head something so that you get that really deep stretch of your tripod with a little bit less stress of a dumbbell or bar ball going over your head and literally crushing your skull. So, I'm gonna do this and then try to find out the bicep I accept to do. I wanted a little of cables but they're taken so I'll just stare at those ladies until they lead you. What's going on? Big man, nine torn one looks smaller. Is that your torn one? It's working work. This is bigger. I know. Oh. It's still all the protein I've been taking. What? Can I have that? Yeah, just let me have a sit. What is it? I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't. What? It's a packet candy. This is a rocket candy. Alright, so, so we're gonna do this up there yesterday but we forgot I'm gonna left up. So, we're doing it today but I wrapped up that our morky one home had breakfast made it into the warehouse and I wanted to show you guys the amount of bun menager we have lying around here. We have about 4,500,000 cans of energy drinks. So it's a lot of energy we have to drink it all by the weekend. Yeah, we have a lot of time to tell you. It's fucking good. So, what were they getting in the talk about? This is really good. It's a lot of me trying to talk. It's gonna be launching April 16th in my membership. Approximately around that day that's the goal. First of all, we tell you that really bought an environment shop because of our history with rough. It's gonna be there but we're also gonna be on Amazon. So, we're gonna be announcing on the bottom energy Instagram where it's gonna be available on Amazon. It's gonna be selling by the case and in the fridge and somebody have been shopping by the case on Amazon. It was 12 packs and yeah, I don't know if I could fully discuss what it is. But it's 112 milligrams of caffeine. I know it's 2.5, but I just don't look right here. Can you read this? What? We don't look for it. Just come here. He's already motherfuckers keep sealing from it. I'm fucking still anything. So don't blame me. I bought mine. I buy mine. For our losing my turn of thought. Anyways, 112 milligrams of caffeine. The goal on the back is says here. One can, you can go to the 12 ounce cup of coffee, approximately. But this is because we all like to drink energy drinks like multiple throughout the day. And I'm not trying to have like 200, 400, 300 whatever milligrams of caffeine and one drink. We can enjoy it, sip on it. Like a light orange flavor and then a cherry frost flavor, the other flavor. Super delicious. It's got 250 milligrams of cognizant in it. It kind of helps with brain clarity focus and it's actually really good for your brain. I think 500 milligrams of cognizant, so it's like help us to mention Alzheimer's and stuff and stuff that we're probably not should going to claim, but I can say whatever I want on YouTube. So that's going to be launching in April. Stay tuned. Follow up on manager room. We do a bunch of giveaways. We're giving away cases. Another shit if you follow the account. So stay tuned for all that. Amazon's worth going to start. We've got new flavors already in the woodworks. This is a rocket candy. We're trying to match one of our pre-workouts. And we had a blackberry lemonade. A rocket candy. It's a fucking delicious. None of them are super strong like CRP. They're actually a good light taste. You like CRP. Cojun can see them. These are just very good tasting. And if you guys have any flavor suggestions coming below, I'm thinking like a nice peach maybe or like rocket candy buck realmated stuff like that, but we're going to be coming up with a bunch of flavors over the next X amount of years. So come and down below. We'll take it into consideration. And yeah, stay tuned. But manager is going to be really singing the next month or so. So don't miss out. Just going to be fired. Hopefully we're going to be all over our gas. My dream is to be in gas stations one day. That'd be fucking cool. So yeah, that's all I have to say about. Can we wrap on this video a little bit all over the place? But that's my life right now. We're a little bit all over the place. So thank you for watching. Please subscribe. And I'll see you in the next one.
