I was only doing 150s for like 12 at the max. I've got the 140s for like 10 and I'm just at the point now where I'm trying to like get kind of like dry. I can feel like muscle fibers moving a little bit more than I would really want to. And when I like I know my body pretty well these are time in the past where I've like torn muscles. Deep in the prep some longer be a bitch and do lightweight. But I'm going to feel it. And I'm going to know. I'm not going to fucking drop it fire up these movements or I'm going to go really controlled and just fail like that and that's what I'm doing. So I'm still keeping the heavy weight controlling the weight. Some movement heavy ship but also understanding my body is more fragile right now because of the hydrated leaner. Tending to ligaments are all who aren't risks. So don't be a bitch. Don't be stupid. Pride the midlife. Some wise words. I'm going to wrap it together last one. I don't really count.
