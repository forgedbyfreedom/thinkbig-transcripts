Best of me I've ever had in my life with Courtney at catch in Aspen. The chef knew who we were and he was a super nice dude. I can't remember the names sadly. They gave us like everything on the menu. Like an assampler. So we weren't too full but we got to try it all. So good. Sometimes. There you go. Stop me. What's going on? Oh you. I'm getting told, huh? You can't show it. Did you tell her? You can't tell her? You can't show it. Sorry. She's saying it's good. She's saying it's good. She's saying it's good. She's saying it's good. She's saying it's good. Me, me, me and Zayn was one. Yeah. How many times back in Canada? We had before my show. Oh, show those. We did show those. And back. We did two days. Okay. And they did me a new train. One night, but we walked all over fucking Canada. Look at her gym. Yeah. What do we say now? What do you think? That one. That's the worst one right. I just remember walking around. We did it on our day one. That was pretty true. Yeah. That was so good. You and I were trying to find this gym. We went up to set of stairs. That was so good. That was good. Who's the lead? That's a number. Yeah. I was going on guys. We're here in the Dragon's Lair. With the champ himself. Mr. Flex Lewis. So, been a long time to do the change together. I think it last time might have been in Canada. I think it was. Like years ago. Yeah. Obviously for the viewers watching that. Chris has supported me tremendously over the years. Before he was the champ and do run. We've trained in various different places. And we've just seen off camera now that I think out of all the percentages, back is always the one we end up going with. I don't know what. I train a lot about. People think I train every day. It's probably the most important in poor body parts. Yeah. That's why. That's why. But, uh, I didn't. Yeah, gone. Maybe last time I ever guess posed that as show. I have it with your show. I never did it again. I was a good tank. Yeah, I was in zinc. Yeah. I have to get some footage for. But what I didn't realize is this is his first time at the Dragon's Lair. So we just walk in an, an I'm a suit. Maybe he's been here before. And he's like, oh, this is cool. Oh my god. He's got me, Chris. Yeah, this is like Dragon's deal. Yeah, we we we custom hands that we do. I think he has customized, uh, you know, obviously being a, uh, a part of their own other national strength, which is predominantly what the gym is. We've got some cool, uh, unique pieces that are not anywhere else. And then the ones that we, we don't create a make, we've brought in cinnigestically to make the better and again, you know, all these small, the way I see things is like, like, like, portable, right? You can see somebody's in condition. But then when you really kind of, you know, react things that we can see the intricate details and ask what the gym is. Yeah. There's a lot of people have come back second through times and they've gone like, what did shit? I didn't realize you'd see that. Yeah. I'm going to turn the music on a bit. Another way to kind of get on kind of copyright commerce. As soon as I walk away, touch shit. Because calves are small, it's fuck right now too. Really small. Makes me feel good about my calves when I stand beside them. And then you know when you come over a time like that. What is that cut off me? What is that cut off me? How tall are you? 5-6. 5-6. Can I make myself six foot? No. Maybe you did work seven feet. No! There's no fucking way. One cent. One cent? Actually, no. I don't know actually. I'm pretty sure we all played with like 180 or 90, but actually, So I was going to do like a transformation to classic. I just get some fun hype around it. And then I realized then he would never make way. He was under 190. Yeah. And there's no way. I mean, I don't know what that is. Well, when I found out he was lower than 190. No, no, no. You could probably do 190, maybe. What would the name for me, shall we? What'd you go in now? I don't know. I have to be classic. Wait, limits. Don't fuck the phone. There's no fucking way. Just seen it. I clicked on it. I'm getting flex to move over the classic, physique. Mevers him in the 2024, I'll see you. Can I shoot my leg up? No, it's not legs left. It's not legs left. It's not legs left. It's not legs left. And people will see the NPC. 5, 6, 5, 7, 5, 7. That's NPC. So the tempels over there. 2015. I could do 180, fine. I could do 180, fine. Okay. I got the wrong one. Oh, no, we won't get too far ahead. I'll keep the hands close. Did they run badly? What, how do you post? What? You don't talk to classic shots? I have to do a few of that. I think you were hitting the DLB post. I thought it was your post, but. It's a good job. You're not coming here. Fine. I thought about it. I'm recording. You know, it's my heart. Because every now knows me. There'll be my same score for us. But all the... No, the D is one, no. I think that's a dream. What other score do you? It says I know. Yeah. It seems like I'm not. Two or three. I'll still have anything to be. I'll try to throw a tight flat. One, two, three. Good, good. Yes. Yes. You done. It's heavy. Yeah. Oh. Aw, yes sir.. Oh. Yeah, straight. Alright little one. stewardship.infection. Break. You touched your grip straight, if you please. I don't like that one, I don't know. I'm expecting this to come when you're grip, when you're going to. No, no. It looked a little bit. They look cool. Not a convenient. Whatever they know is kind of like, you know. When this happens, that's a pinch. Oh, pick it up. Yeah. So you're going to... Show it up, though. We're going to make it into a meme. Well, you're just watching, but you got so light, right now. Yeah. Yes. On bonds... No. Give me the scissors, I will listen now once more. Uh. Oh my God. Itpan- Make that. Use your own knife. Say. Okay. Go, take away your heads. I think all these are from rugby. You lost them all? Yeah, these are from these are my badges of honor. Well, scrappy. Well, scrappy. Well, scrappy. Scrappy. Who's more scrappy? Ireland's Welsh, it's got all of us. Oh, yeah. I should get a heavier one. I had a Wales win. Well, I don't know about that. But it's cool that it's the least drunkest when they have the fights. There. Because then you can remember who won. Welsh got, like, too much when you go on play rugby. It's a part of the game. The UNI will fight on the field. You knock my T-thed or tooth. I'm buying your fight. Kind of like the thing to do. And then, everything is like, you know, gentrified, shake hands. You go out to tell him, act like you're the club uniform on. And then you fight. You'll be fine. Yeah. It's, it's any rugby player that's watching this. Well, I don't think you're fine. Yep. That's what happens. You fight. Are you friends after the fight or no? No, no, no, no. You actually. Like, I might meet a local rival of some day I fought on month ago. And then you're kind of like, I didn't show that up until it's a course shoot. And then there's a big play on. And then, then days I enjoy the rugby days. Imagine bodybuilding was like that. Just get out today as well. Just keep the shit back to. So this is the problem. A lot of bodybuilders will talk shit. Fickened there's zero consequence. Yeah. And I can talk to society, not bodybuilders. Yeah. That's society. Society is well, but I think there's a lot of guys who will talk talk talk, talk shit online. But then, and this is the thing also, which I think you know this. There's a lot of people who have done a lot of shit talking. I picked up the call. I keep by having an away from social media. There's no drama. And all like, you know, this guy versus this guy or me versus that guy. I put more of my shit to back because I'm like, must these guys just go on a, don't want to do anything by talk. Yeah. And that doesn't say no. I'm fucking tough. It's just, that's my mentality. You know, there's only a couple of guys who, and said, stood in their soapbox and said, yeah, I did say that. And that's why I've got that respect. Yeah. And they got my respect for calling them out because again, it's not only the people that's fucking stupid, but I created a narrative. Fuck, I got you to be the way it is. Yeah. Fightin' is fun when you're young, but in your old, you got no capacity for stress like that. You gotta be as in, we don't know. Speak for yourself, Chris. This is, pedalless wiggle. Yep. Sorry, but I, oh, two. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You're just going to, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

You can no longer do it that shit unless you see a owner. All the owners guessed. Have you fit in the example for the onions? I'll be so fucking fucked, and I can do it. Nobody's looking. Okay. Good job. Good job. What's up, Anna? Good job. Good job, good job. Good. Where are we going? Good. Good job. Easy. You're going to take off because you want to show it. No, I wear tank tops anyway.

I wore tank tops for my career. And I never feel off. She takes her film spicy. My wife's top of four to me is a Mac. I thought that. All right. So it's going to be a wrap on who we're getting with Mr. Flex Lewis. I was a good time seeing Flex. Wish I could come out here more. Especially kind of like Vegas. I only ever come out here for the old beer. But we have another day of franchisee, G and C meetings. What not? So we're going to head over there now. I don't think we're going to film the game. I can't even see that stuff. But stay tuned for raw. Being in G and C. Hopefully late July. August kind of time. Late is fall, but it should be by some end of summer. Drop in that super savage. We'll talk a little bit more about the product when it comes out. It's going to be exclusive to G and C. And yeah. If you're other in Vegas, be sure to stop by Dragon's Lair.
