You're gonna think about it It's actually not It's not exactly that It's actually not exactly that It's not cake at all Another bottom is all fake too Ooh, it looks really good inside though It can't be cake It's delicious So the wrapper is not at all Very, it's probably falling It's not at all Who's sugar?

All of those views in all 4,000 walmart's She is all close She is all close She is just press That's scary It's just... I can't even shoot I'm done I'm just kidding She's just... Let's go on Two Meal number two Looks extremely kind of stuff I've got to tell the master It's like a jar of less meal I've got to play with me I have some of my two right now So I can see it My apologies But super-plamed This is actually a meal from Megafit I just put it in here If I want to add beans to it Yes I said beans Cornier disease organic beans That come in glass Not a can I'm not plastic but a glass It's totally organic They're corny cell beans And I'm getting my fiber So from Megafit I have 180 grams of rice And 180 grams of chicken I'm not a big meal And then I added like I don't know A random amount of kidney beans Into there I don't know exactly how many So this meal comes up to only 480 calories And like 45 grams of protein Super-plamed I'm not eating a lot right now I literally wasn't even probably getting my protein goal Like last six weeks or so Since I'm still on beer So I'm just totally ramping my food back up I don't need to go crazy And get fat right now And the bowl is just as I'm getting back And the training Give myself more protein more calories So that as I'm progressing and training And progressing and food Instead of just going all into my food And getting fat So I'm kind of slowly Regressing and watching my body We've watching my body fat I've gone from there Well trying to get some good digestible Fiber So I can go to the bathroom Well I might get this healthy And honey mustard Because honey mustard is delicious So meal number two Very basic Let's get it Let's get it So you also have to clean it Oh yeah, how does it take? Normally I wouldn't do that I honestly kind of made me I stomach feeling a little like Not hungry So I'm eating this at 2 p.m. right now But that's okay Fiber is tasty So I'm gonna have some cake No I'm gonna eat this And I'll see you guys I'm gonna live right here We're basically going to push that core out You know, first relax a little put like a little A little bit of a chocolate So it ain't keep it down the line And then just drop it Everyone like can't skip Sprung it like whatever And then it goes through another cover It coats the whole thing again And then it has a drizzler And you could like drizzle the bar So that was the direction you want to go I missed your meal You're gonna turn it to a pretty good amount I don't breathe Dangerous Fog is chewy Come on, good pot When you think of that pretty cover How long is real good? It's crack It's bad about any race between Every five so that's really good crack Delicious Alright meal number What meal is this? Three Thanks man We've been all over the place today And I very late on my meal right now Normally it's like three or four to five forty But this is the goat meal I'll make it fit in my opinion the bumble Because you see me make it my brown rice pass up And gonna be a fit to pass up And they put some really good seasonings That's how I want to do so I'm not sure if you can change it really good But this is my favorite meal right now Pancakes with chocolate chips are pretty fire But I don't know if my chocolate chips So it's probably my favorite meal today I don't think that's exactly what I'm actually going to have to ask them For it because it cuts the my that make a little bit bigger for me So yeah brown rice pass up and beef this is the goat So we guys want to check out my get through meals like up I don't have every meal for me or you should have two a day Five days a week so I should bring two to work And it's a lot easier than meal prep meal at the time Sometimes I meal prep but it's just so much easier Have anything plugged in my fridge every day So this might go to It's at the bumble it's literally sea bummedable because it's best But when it's all that uses I'm really fucking stuck right now I'll probably fetch from my pillow As we go on And then I got a cram in two meals before bed Because that one is better because I'm turning on my good sea table So see you guys I could go for a meal full Jogging cook Because I'm not allowed to eat the shit I could sell my babies I'll technically buy a travel certain Favorite Alright so here we are with meal New Merrow quadro And I calculated the lot I pulled up the last meal from megaphit Because they have all their stuff Track day and have all the stuff on my fitness belt But I made it a little bit bigger because my meals a little bit bigger The 720 calories and 48 grams of protein that meal So there meals actually have really good amount of protein A lot of other meal companies have like 25 grams And they're no bueno But anyways, moving on to meal number four Have I said I have 350 grams of raw weight yellow potato I'd shake diced it up Throw in the air fryer for like 15 minutes with some olive oil spray on it And it's good to go I got some zucchini in there For a little bit of vegetable and a little bit of extra flavor Why not? And then I have ground turkey And I combine 98 percent lean with 93 percent lean Two packages in one to make it 95 percent leaner whatever And it just tastes better than not a dry And that's 210 grams of that I'm honestly eating so random right now That's I don't know exactly how much protein that I think it's 50 grams of protein in there 51.9 grams of protein But for those that are like starting off season starting in plants And I'm dying for the first time to try and track with the first time Biggest tip to you I can say is just eat consistent for a while Don't even worry about it and when you're on a consistent realm Track it, see what it's going to be at And that's probably your baseline If you're fat or than you want to be, eat less If you're skinny than you want to be, eat more Right now, I'm a little bit skinny and I want to be So I'm going to track this right now, see where I'm at And then I'm going to make sure I'm at least getting enough protein I want like 260 grams of protein I'm 250 right now a little bit more than that And then that's a bare minimum And then I'm going to up my calories from there Probably start with carbs and then add some fats I'm going to just kind of put whatever I want to into the diet plan But it's literally all you have to do And you know, normally I'd be like starting a full day Meaning I bet I need to eat biceps and calories for the full day Meaning just to look like I'm not skinny But that's not how I actually eat So I'm showing you guys the truth I'm not eating a lot right now And I'm still going to slowly put on weight Recovery better and say track it Okay, so to be number four, my weight free patees Cool down for the very hot And I'm going to cover them and catch up the catch up The life and it had been a long time I've had ketchup in my full day of eating So welcome back at you But miss you combining with the throught joke, ketchup's okay By the way, whole foods are getting ketchup But the best ketchup ever, my favorite But yeah, throught you ketchup See you later Really showing on my pills Yeah, so I'm on a huge pill kit right now Because I just finished the Olympia And I'm half an adi-cbum right now Not full an adi and I'm trying to get very healthy at the moment So I am taking lipid From my cholesterol, I'll bring up my healthy HVL And bring down my healthy L Taking liver, I'm also going to have glutathione So I got a prescription for it that I take twice a week Make sure my shit's all good Or make it 3, it takes all the time I have like 15 of those a day I don't think you have to do that But that's what I like to do I'm taking K2D3 Good for your heart, your grip bones, grip for your immune system All I could choose Taking heart is great for overall health Heart function, burn the butt Also let's draw on heart Turn my current inflammation and then Diver it support Honestly, this is actually a life saver Because what I was on prep My thyroid went to shit Much at all But I want to don't want to be on that long term So I came off and started taking thyroid support for my body And it actually helped a lot So yeah, getting my shit healthy right now And then I got to do blood work next week because we can have there See where I'm at And then get healthier, do more blood work And then the oxygen officially So this is what we're kicking my right now Test levels of 10 Test levels of 10 No, there are 300 probably I don't know 5 days in and out and I'll share it But I can throw it in the back Use codec above and provide subs.com I'm hearing you Alright, so according to the here But I'm going to try and make a monkey Without anything ingredients that coordinate me makes for me with it So this is going to be risky But we're going to go for it Also, I'm actually going to do a video talking more about health stuff Through those supplements right now, but that's not all for health And I think it's a very important thing that I would like that I focus on in my life And I would like to talk more about And just like keeping your body healthy, doing blood work, checking out And you know all the stuff that body building isn't healthy Gotta counteract it the best you can In other words, so I'll do a video talking about that in another time For now, you can try and make a monkey I got it And egg in there And tiny bit of egg whites Already in there And then I use vegan protein Because vegan protein is better for baking Actually, if that's good for the milk If it's good for the milk Never bake anything and you want to put protein in it Begin just bake better for whatever reason Other should get kind of dry, so That's a little bit of that, that I'm going to use some baking flour Loosen free, I normally use baked potato Seems weird, but like mashed potato actually works really well with monkey The corn he does, but I don't have any, so I'm going to randomly put 50 grams of this in it I like almond flour too, but I also don't have any almond flour So, you know, happy birthday to me And then pumpkin is a huge key to all baking Because it makes it moist and it's absolutely getting too dry But the only way I make these is I literally just like put the egg in there And you have to save the time out of egg you are And then you put protein and then I just add a few times You have to save the time out of egg you are and then you put protein and then I just add flour Until it's the consistency that I want it to be And then you just run the microwave But easy as it goes We do that texture Are you going to box this Totally give a bunch of that, but if it gets too small Even for egg white and flour You have a little baked Calvin Corn he's kind of the best I've been eating in general Yeah, this isn't actually, this is normally looks like what she's doing It is a sick fucking bread dough I have not given up hope yet, let me get somewhere I go in tonight Okay, it was the last thing that you should be doing in here But if you don't look like a baking your fucking moon or something You know what I do is with potato But like, not baking a potato at 10 o'clock in the morning I'll let it sit She's not that bad, look the life I've never done this before so Pretty cool to be here I've done that What? John Dungeon John Dungeon, come on out to you You sit ripped as fucking disfigured By now I'm a fucking feed for chocolate chips And I'm just living life on the edge right now So you think these are the humans? Yeah, they're cute They're just very tough with these, it's not that cute Throw those in there Mix it up And then we're going to Pray for the bath There's a weird texture Yeah, I don't know It's horrible Could be worse No, no Good minutes and 22 seconds because a p-didn't number their good luck Didn't this take? Yeah, yeah You should ready for the roasting Oh the baked I think I put in there for two long The fuck is that? I don't know, it's really hard I can sourdough I put in there for two long I think it's a little bit of a cake if I had it I'm not cake anymore because it's in a bowl It's like a bowl cake It's not bad It's not bad, oh I don't know, that's us fire Let's go, just kind of finish it off It's really hot though Let's do some topping, don't you? More flour Just, that was a waste of fish on like donuts, right? Just flour You have to do a lazy try I've beenier Oh, what's that? It's like that French donut People say on outside of like that one French restaurant in the new Orleans It's like the four hour queue New Orleans hotel in Las Vegas No, it's the two If we go to New Orleans and we try a banana I'll finally try a frosty with fries No, we're going to get fries We can hold it in a jitter I'll keep like picture according to rolling over in the grave And then she's not there, she's going to die in the roll over in the grave You can see how bad this must be Literally what's going on Yeah, I'll put some of you in my cake It's not my cake anymore It's just a bowl It's a bit my cake It's your bowl Yeah, it'll all rise, please It's not too sweet A little moisture in there, you know Yeah, a little bit of your roll on top Good You'll crunch Well up This is far from a makek now That's a makek Corny doesn't fall, that should fall I literally put all that shit on it, every day I make that up That's creative And it should make some fire, fire, fire Slaps of ice cream on there that it will be literally 10 in a 10 See that? I'm in butter What are you laughing at me man? It's good Yeah I think pretty good I like almond butter Stir my frizzable butter here Yeah I'm pretty limp here There's the wax in the camera's toxins, you shouldn't put it in there It's over there, the little bit of the edge You're going to stick that, it's even higher to take a picture of that That's what the job will done You ready?
