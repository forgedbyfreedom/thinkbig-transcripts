Appreciate you What is up YouTube here my garage aka my gym just moping around because I'm not a tourkout So trying to still do some content for you guys while I'm not allowed to train right now I'm on like week three I'm just about to hit week three of four weeks of no training so close but then it's gonna be Christmas We're gonna be on for a while so we're gonna be doing a Q&A grocery haul this week little stuff like that Just to get back into it and I'm doing it in my gym because this is the only excuse I have to be here and I miss being here. So that being said Q&A first question Well, I'll get a lot of questions about my kids picked a few but maybe I'll do my kids You're not twins. I promise my baby coming soon, but I'm gonna probably do Q&A Maybe some of those Courtney more focus on that so I'll just answer a few and I mean Probably still not getting me as completely, but what do you want to name your child now? I don't want to give this away either because it's probably gonna give away the second and I don't know if we will have it now Sit by the time I'm set but I did want I had a funny idea to hold Courtney. I wanted to name her daughter something that's just like very old like only an old person would have like Bob or Gladys or Cleopatra or something random like that and then make that their middle name or something So if ever their friends were like was your middle name and like oh my middle name is fucking Cleopatra Because I'll be like why the fuck about your middle name and like our kid can roll their eyes and be like oh my god My dad's an idiot and he thought it would be funny to give me a stupid middle name And I just thought it would make a really cool story every time someone asked her middle name So still working on Courtney she's not happy with it so far she's saying absolutely no, but we'll see I got a few more months to convince her who is your inspiration the answers before and still always been my dad My dad's just been the number one person I looked up to my whole life There's never anyone like on the lucid person who I didn't know or how to the concept made up of my mind If it were that I really looked up to my dad was just always like calm cool collected I felt like you knew everything. I felt like you was the strongest guy in the world when I was younger And he just like led the family was exactly what we needed as best as he could be So I was super grateful for him and I always looked up to just the way he handled himself of the father and a husband And I mean recently there'd been more people who have come into my life and I thought got to know them They'd become an inspiration, but they weren't other than that time for me being inspired by somebody don't know If I just have trust issues with people in the internet or something, but you know people like Ian has been an inspiration for me In the bodybuilding career obviously he got me into it like that people like Dom have been huge inspiration to me for business Courtney has been a huge inspiration for me Just wholehearted kindhearted living to suppress that so there's been people have come in my life inspired me in different ways So growing up I guess was my dad. What do you think is the ultimate form of self-inprovement? I'm not even really sure what you mean by form But what the answer that pops into my head is humility and that's just for the Bability to always hear criticism to understand you can be better to be the student rather than the teachers to listen and Just that concept that you can always be better to me That's just constant self-improvement not thinking you're better than anyone not think you're entitled to anything Entitlement all that kind of shit that I think a lot of people have these days You know not wanting to work for something I feel like all that comes back to that lack of humility the more humble you are the more growing the work for something More willing to learn and I just think to one of the best ways to have to continue any form of improvement Especially self-improvement the most important aspect you love about bodybuilding The tough question I would say Accommonate what comes in my mind first is like the challenge that it puts on me the Challenge to like continuously keep getting better find new ways keep getting better find new ways Stay motivated find new ways to be more consistent and just like that goal to keep pushing something better and better It's this like physical goal that I can chase that makes me Internally mentally a better person as well and it's a physical goal where as I keep chasing and keep pushing Keep getting more Olympia's but I'm more muscle build a better physique all this stuff It comes with all these mental challenges that force me into situations that are very difficult and I think putting yourself into difficult situations are like the number one thing to make you stronger Make you better at every aspect in life and life is gonna put life will eventually put you in a difficult position So the more difficult position to put yourself in the more you'll be prepared for the shit that life will throw at you I also what when I think of this now is this more so I guess I don't know It's so bodybuilding but when I hear when I go to like the Olympia's meet and grease and stuff like that I read my DMs or comments and I hear people talk about the inspiration and that I give them I guess from the way I carry myself or What I'm doing my career what I have a compilation stuff like that that really motivates me as well and something that I like really just love I'd make me want to just keep being better and doing better because I know other people are seeing me doing that and want to be better for themselves too which anime are you watching right now? So I just finished jujutsu guys in great show I still told me to get on that one only a few seasons got through pretty quick and then I started watching demon slayer And I know that's a super popular one just getting into it now and I fucking love it huge fan I feel like this is a pretty deep one too He now it's pretty dark fucking not gonna ruin it's a flick the first episode, but his family gets just brutally murdered The very beginning super sad and what I love of all the anime shows is all the main heroes Just have this like pure heart. They're just like such a good people and it shows you all these ways We're to gain power you could like go to the dark side and be bad and do bad things and treat people poorly To try and like self-lash it game more power But when you stick true to like your moral compass and being a good just kind soul It might be a slower route and a harder route, but it ultimately takes you further I think it's just a cool lesson that's in all anime and certainly in demon slayer too, but I'm really liking it so much Real Christmas tree or fake one. I've actually just talking to Courtney about this because she wanted to get a real one And I was like a little busy a little bit lazy right now to be setting up a real tree cutting it cleaning it all the shit That comes out with it when you have to throw it on a pine needle all over your house So my compromise was we have a fake tree already We'll keep using that and when our kids are old enough to even know what Christmas is and what a tree is We'll go with them to a tree farm cut it down ourselves and start making that a tradition But we'll start that tradition once our kids are conscious enough to even appreciate it So right now, fake tree soon to be real tree. What's the thing that makes you so confident every time out? All these questions are worth it very weird, but it's a good question Because I'm not always confident I definitely haven't always been confident And I've had to earn the confidence that I do have like the first I don't know three Olympias and ten shows before that When I very got off stage I was like super nervous didn't feel confident myself didn't really like believe I was going to like win the Olympia and it honestly really wasn't until the last two Olympias were like in my mind I was like I went to win this one beer like this is mine. No one's gonna beat me and it took me four titles So really feel like that and this year was the most this is your first time I ever said it allowed You would never catch me saying it loud. I'm gonna win this lumpy right thing and win the Olympia I was like nope not gonna say anything. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna show you I'm not gonna put anything out there and it was probably a lack of confidence in myself But this year I was like fuck that you know I know what I can do I know what I'm capable of I know how I look right now and I was like I'm gonna win this thing and I think the only reason I was able to get that Common is because I built it over time I've been doing I've been bodybuilding for ten years stepping on stage But it wouldn't be a seven times and after enough repetitions enough proof you can't deny to yourself just how capable I really am now so I just kind of just Disproving any self-doubt of myself and putting myself out there into those situations where I don't feel confident Improving to myself over and over again when I'm capable of and same with public speaking I've talked about this before but I've been super nervous and anxious to public speaking my whole life and the more and more I started to do it the more and more I just started to build confidence in it and the coolest thing I found I've touched on this But when I built more confidence public speaking I have built more confidence everywhere in my life and it just I could feel it transite even the smallest stupid thing So I've touched on I have you said like more social anxiety like thinking people are looking at me judging me Like and I just hated being around a lot of people and when I forgot my hair transplant done and I came back I had scabs in like dry skin following all over and look super fucking weird my head was like swollen from the water They have to inject in you and we're going to the grocery store in corners If you want to come in or do you want to just stay in the car because you don't want people to see your head and I was like fuck it You know what I'm doing going to go in the grocery store and I'm not gonna be able to fuck what people think about They're looking at my head thinking I look weird like what the fuck here No one's even gonna look at me and I noticed like getting past that fucks given I guess you could say in the grocery store I like I felt the subtle air of confidence even more so and normally have I was just walking around I was just like I don't go before and I felt good But I think just putting yourself into situations where you don't feel confident and Showing yourself that you can't feel confident and you can be more than you think your capable love Really just stacks belief into yourself over and over again more you do it more confident You'll be what's your favorite Christmas Christmas wow the list is coming in strong What's your favorite Christmas themed cheat food or meal? I mean kind of a cheat answer just to say Christmas dinner I always have like a Thanksgiving dinner on Christmas We have it twice a year thanks to me and on Christmas like turkey stuff and Thanksgiving all that but just because That's not really fair. I would say these sugar cookies my mom always made these sugar cookies. I think they're called or shortbread. Wow. I don't even know what the fuck Yeah, I think they're shortbread and they like put a little dab on a blob on a cookie sheet And then she puts a fork two different ways that it makes a little Chris cross pattern on them and they're really like they like fault Melted in your mouth like butter super sweet super good the white milk cookies are fire and I think it's just so More so than nostalgia in the memory that my mom's making those every Christmas since before I can remember What is your dream car the cost question because there's a few if They make a nine nine two GT 2 RS. I want that really bad. They haven't made a new GT 2 RS So I would love a GT 3 RS. I wish they made it in manual because bad ass was a fat wing and everything But the GT 3 manual pretty far too. So I've been a huge fan of horses ever since getting one driving them They're just like they just drive like crazy. Dom has an eight 12 super fast Ferrari which I never like loved for I reach for any reason, but when I sat in that thing I fell in love with that thing crazy And V12 and it's comfortable to see through big and I fit in it that's huge bonus for me A lot of cars. They don't fit in other than that also the old school cars 69 Mustang have a 69 Camaro So that used to be one but then a 70 charger as well with a hella fan motor and want like a Fucking thousand horsepower charger one day. So we have to get a barn one day when I'm older and Courtney will not be a fan of that. They're filling it up with all these cars, but chill chill chill chill come It's a come through what's the most influential change you made that's promoted the most growth Funny the first thing that pumps about minor unit is stopping drinking and it was more so just a complete lifestyle Shit that I made at some point in my life where I used to like party and go out and eat bad and X-y and Z and then I also and I switched to just a full bodybuilder mode and the biggest thing I really cut it with drinking And I used to drink quite a bit of a drink through three times a week when I was in college and while I still was able to make gains and progress Obviously drinking you're not eating that whole night You're clogging up your liver so your ability to burn fat through your liver is slowing down You're hung over the next day or the next two days depending on much of drink We're working out to suffering you're recovery suffering everything just off You're eating shitty because you don't feel like eating chicken and rice or egg whites in the morning when you're hungover Everything is just off the one I stopped drinking completely and I may be now I might get like a tipsy once a year or have like two or three drinks every now and then like Once or twice a year old drink, but I really never drink anymore and that really shifted I hold my Z and just being all in on bodybuilding and I made so much progress that year That was really sick of that was going into the 29th year when I won the Olympics so the proud definitely that how can we get a girlfriend like Courtney King It's actually was thinking about this the other day when someone asked him me about like how to get a girl and Bob Law how to fix people like comment joking how to find the Courtney King because she's the best Obviously everyone wants to go for a little bit here wife and fiance But the interesting thing when I was thinking about it is the simple fact of what you put out is what you attract And if you're like trying to be cool trying to be cocky trying to be arrogant trying to be this like tough guy Macho Bob, you're gonna attract a girl who's and if that's fake You're gonna be attracting a girl who is also fake and looking for something fake But if you're being like your true self, you're gonna attract the girl who matches with your true self So when 20 team when we first met the reason she reached out to me She actually saw the idea I'm fully renowned but there was because that was the year I got really sick Going into Olympia and after the Olympia I made a YouTube video talking about what I had gone through and I remember getting emotional And I cried and I remember being like I should delete this video on a fucking cry on YouTube like fuck this And I'll like you know what now? This is this is the broadest is real. This is just me being honest about how I felt and how fucking kind of depressed I had felt at the time and I put it out there and I was crying and I was emotional Super vulnerable and she's somehow saw that video I think it's gonna be her both with Jim Cher and it just kind of popped up and she saw it She's like fuck this cat different like I can just tell you got a great physique He's good looking but he's different. There's something about him like who puts this kind of older bullshit on YouTube was a bodybuilder and it made her interested so she's one of my DMs and I always had a crush on her because she was hot And she was misbeceny won't be in 2016 So I was excited that she was in my DM But that was the only thing that really grabbed her attention rather than just trying to be some like cool Instagram fuckboy online otherwise I would have attracted in three and fuck girls So I say be yourself but you're true self out there and understand what you're gonna put out there But you're gonna attract little lesson from the seabomb This bastard trying to lure me in here with a a list of patients so I will Lighten you I'm gonna try and read this if seven slippery salamanders Flether sideways super silently would you surrender? Wow, I feel like I feel I should read that 10 times every night before going to bed And I'll be better talking if you were little what would you ask for for Christmas damn That's tough. There's a lot of cool shit out there right now I really like stuff that flew when I was younger for some reason and I don't anymore So maybe a drone I think that'd be really cool and even when I was younger I always fucking wanted one of those little cars that drove like the little kid cars that you could get it in javaram You know they're super slow. I just really always wanted one of those and I never got one So now they have that crazy Tesla ATVs that actually go really fast So I would probably say a drone or a little ATVs in that rip their arm. Are you going to do a six-week challenge? Yes, so last year we did a eight-week challenge and we're building in it right now I'm so not entirely sure if I want to do a six-week or eight-week I kind of like the idea of like a six-week sprint starting in the new year and something that I need to do as well It's why I kind of want to do it. I'll be doing it alongside you guys. Same thing is before just small entry fee Sign up for the app. Although workouts and progress and everything will be run through there and then I'm gonna be doing it too Because that's when I can finally start working out again and then we'll have a a few prizes some cash money some pre-supplements Some pre-bumb energy a bunch of cool shit. So I'll kept them more information coming on that soon But it's a few for that challenge. What something you learned attending all saints Catholic high school? There's a friend of mine from high school answering asking this question and because it's a friend of mine I think this question one of the best things I learned from high school was the importance of like brotherhood and friendship We had a great group of guy friends in high school. Some friends that I still talk to today They all came down earlier this year actually like January a bunch of them came down and we were imparting in Miami So hung out every time we go home. We still hang out and talk and I just really Appreciate it having like just broke friends just like to be able to fuck around laugh and joke around about there's not many things in life you need more than that and something I realize in all stages of my life But they're in high school and college Parts when I was broke parts when I've had money even successful when I'm not just hanging it with friends in the fucking basement Playing video games or chilling or drinking or whatever is just always a great time and always lifts his spirits So very important keep your friends close What are some things you've learned from bodybuilding that you will use in fatherhood damn That's a tough one. That is a lot of things on there Something I would just think you about kind of a bodybuilding kind of not thinking about other parents something I want to teach my kid It's just always ask questions and don't ask one word questions like asking positive questions Always be the student I go talking earlier humility. I guess humility is overarching thinking of that But always being willing to ask questions like you know I went on Olympia snap, but I go around and I train people and I'm like really the workout. Why are you doing that like if some I'm like they're like I don't want to overstep until I'm like please give me advice asking questions like always Like training with people like Vernon with GBRS guys He's a a strength training coach. He's more knowledgeable than me So I'm asking questions how can I help my hips? How can I do this and he's like teaching me other things? I'm trying to be a coach. I'm asking all these tips to question and I mean I'm always willing to learn and I want to make sure my challenge is always humble and willing to learn I'd also say a huge thing is just the importance of effort before the result So just knowing that if you are ever going to complain about a result Don't claim to a bit the result, but if you have any remorse about a result You better damn well have worked your ass off and it's hard as you possibly could and if not go back and work harder and then expect hopefully Better result so I feel like I've worked at that very poorly. I'm not the right dish It's down to teach it to my kids better But just in essence focusing more on the effort rather than the result because the things that out of our control and life are as a result But you can always control how hard you work and being better and better every single day Sorry if it's inappropriate, but how did you make your life pregnant and prep? I don't want to answer that question so go ask your father because he might be saying no because he's your father I'm not telling you guys actually on YouTube Best way to maintain discipline and mentality The loaded question best way to maintain discipline. I would say structured routine is something that pops in my mind It's very helpful and this year when I was really struggling at the part where I tore my life and everything and I just have to keep my Discipline to keep locked in I was just okay. Get them and not in the 13 become a robot wake up at the same time every day Do your cardio the same time every day breakfast everything into a complete routine So on those days where you really feel like you don't want to do it or you don't want to fucking cardio You don't want to train you don't want to whatever it doesn't matter because they're just part of your routine You become a robot and just do it without even thinking just run through the days and get get through it as best as you possibly can I think that really helps and honestly is a great trick for any aspect of mental health and anything you're trying to do The more structured and routine you are the better you feel mentally also Having a good support system is really fucking important and I will always push up from the mountain top Treating people around you who are important properly so that day treat you properly and have your back in hard times It's just like such a cheat code for discipline You know if you ever have time for you feel like weaker yourself and you look at someone you love who believes in you Fuck that look at that lifts you up full of fucking motivation and gets you ready to lock it and do what the fucking want So I think that's super important and It's a discipline and mentality that relates to mentality to you know you look at like I said You look at someone who loves you lift your spirits keep you on track and there's a few think more important than that because like I've Talking about brotherhood relationships everything that's like the most important thing in this life is enjoying it with people You love and it's a cheat code to being successful that for damn sure But yeah, I get to the point where I said it rings with the questions and I've answered them all at some point in my life And it's hard for me to keep and it's very nice So I think I'm gonna wrap it up there. I'm a long Yeah, at least 20 minutes. So I feel like it's a good in the video Calvin will be that go long here, but no So thank you guys for watching back back to broadcasting on the floor. I thought it'd be more comfortable here But you back in the gym in a few weeks Thank you guys for watching appreciate you guys six week challenge is coming soon Hope you guys all have a merry Christmas and happy holidays and happy Hanukkah and whatever else you celebrate enjoy
