We moved to the North Carolina today. Oh yeah, for us, so you guys have the menorah scale liner right now. I actually just got on a flight after the gym and flew to North Carolina. If you want to find me, come to the North Carolina. I know that. Old gym. North Carolina. To check me out. Come on. Come on, Chris. Hey, come on. You're on your way in. Two, four, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. What's that? Have some drinks or anything. Don't try it. Think you're going to find me. This is and now there's no less matter. Some fucking things, don't be so badly hurt. I think we might be locked up in the garage. Yeah, that's why I like the first song. Yeah, that's why I like the first song. Yeah, I think it was very good. Yeah, I fucking bad. I think they definitely, the first round we did with higher. Yeah, but it was better. So we should not even let it be. What is up? YouTube. I'm really happy I have to say that in my last video. I don't remember saying that. But today's the good old day. Just testing the new flavor of Bum Energy is being run soon. Secret out, it's Lebanon Live. Sprite fucking delicious, perfect little summer joint. It's like a refreshing, lemon lime, what more can you ask for? But we're testing the combination to the when you make it. You can go do whatever combination you want essentially. But certain flavors like citrus flavors actually taste better with higher carbonation. So we were testing different levels and I like the really high one. But everyone kind of agreed to almost fomped up in your mouth because it was too high. So we went to the middle ground. But they were all high options that was just the middle of the high options. So that's going to be running later this week. So hopefully in a few weeks you guys will have access to buy that new flavor. We're trying to come out with a new flavor every couple of months right now because we're new and everybody likes variety. So just kind of perfecting the game, fine tuning everything, correcting the combination of previous runs and the past that we are understanding better now as we learn. Because we always learn along the way because we just jump in head first. But that's what we're doing this morning. Also very excited. You got a first delivery of equipment into the gym. So with my head over there and show you guys what's going on there. Your muscle fitness is coming out and setting it up for me today. But help them me out. There's some sick pieces that are hard to find that we're building. Oh yeah, that's what's going on. We've got a little shoot going on today. The guys are going to be shooting everything. So busy day as usual. Sadly Calvin is going to be leaving us for four or five days. I'll be back Sunday. We'll be back Sunday. So like four days. But yeah. We're going to film when I back day today actually. I don't know if I'm going to back day today. Train gym, energy chains, life is good, chill and so yeah. Sit you for the video. See you guys soon. Alright. So here we are. First delivery. Guys, this came by with a truckload today. And already you want to build a good stuff that I'm very excited to use. This specific machine right here. What's about it is a lot of the basement. It's a lot of stuff. Fucking love. This is a roller of wire machine. It like forces you to actually like contract from your elbows. Rather than like a pectick where you hold it with your arm and you can cheat a bit. I got the OG during this. Not as below. And then you can try it. In addition, I'll change it to everything. I'm going to put a shirt from Actbox. A few punata pieces. My lantess. It'll be the old shit. New shit. All the above. So literally just building the fucking dream in here. And I am very, very fucking excited for this. Everyone's like dream to have their own gym. And I didn't think I'd get one because I didn't think I would ever want to run a gym. Because I knew a lot of hell went into it. You don't really make a lot of money for it. But I'm super grateful right now to be in the opportunity to build it for myself. And literally just like use it for content and prepping for it in Olympia. So I think this is going to be something that really like fucking puts me on a straight focus. Drive this here in Olympia. Someone here in have a good workout. The other day, we're 5, the power went out. Lighted throughout. And I went on their dream by myself in the dark. And I just had such a good workout. Because sometimes they just hate being around a lot of people. And super pumped for this. Also content can be a lot better because I'm just better at talking when they're not fucking 50 people around me. And a gym or a word about music, copyright and all that shit. So yeah, this is going to be a home of a lot of YouTube videos to come a lot of content to come. We're going to paint the wall, paint the roof, but flooring down, peer muscles, literally helping you all that. So I'll kind of like bring you guys along the journey of building at the gym. Should be done in a few weeks. Honestly, they're super quick. So super pumped, excited. Dream to come true. There's a lot of things I've wanted in my life, but fucking a gym is just one of those things where you come here. You shut off, you put everything away and just kill yourself in the gym. Have a mouth space now. Super pumped. The only thing I'm worried about is my neighbors getting mad at me when I'm blasting music. But it is what it is. Hopefully I'll be here 5 pm and I'll be gone. Or it's all just get mad at me. I'll be back. What? Can you hear you? And then I'll tune them out. This is the place. So yeah, when you go along building it, hopefully it doesn't seem. Maybe you need some fans in here because there's no fucking AC. It's going to be dripping sweat, hot, workouts, grandjeeze, fuck. That's what we do. So see you guys later. Gotta go work out. I'll see you guys in the gym. Alright, back day it is here at the old revive gym. How too busy right now? So hopefully it doesn't pick up and get crazy. Back day, let's be secret going on. I'm going to set off and say, I warmed up, Calvin showed up perfect timing. So I'm setting him out. You know. So okay. I teach him... Don't smear that. Come on. Just16, let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go. Come on. Go. Go. Come on. Go. don't. Go. Go. Go. Go. Don't. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. I want really heavy on the first set. Just show how to rip it down on the other side of the good and then control the negative as much as I could. Second set, drop the weight. I tried to make it so difficult. I get the same amount of reps so I pause the first like 5 reps from the squeeze and control it up and then rip the second half of the set. So I started to feel in pumps. My eyes already twitching. I don't know if you guys can ever see that but it's twitching every day. Probably telling the thing I fucking tanger the bait out and you never work out. But it's okay. I fucking hate this movement so much. Well you gotta get better at it. This movement took me too used to get good at it. Like really good. I took me like four months to get good enough at it. But, here we go. This is the biggest. Small, it's very valuable. I think it's exercise selection and growth. It was more so like training effectively my most connection in everything else. But 2018, 2020, the only set that really changed my back training, my back will up. So I've been loving it ever since. My theory is that if you're doing bento row, you put one play on each side at a time to two play. Have you set the warming up of the two sets of time on this? I can't believe it. Oh my god. I'm doing that much. If I hit two by way 205 pounds this year, I'm moved to open. Alright, finish it up as a workout. I'm going to put my hand grip, pull down the machine because sometimes I'm going to pull down bar breaks my wrists, work on the mobility. So I'm doing 10 times of superset. I've set up curls, flat pullovers, just going back and forth. 10 reps of it, so I die. Hopefully getting a hundred reps of each and then that's it. So, I'll go over by step to the inner back there. Call it a day. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. I'm going to put my hand grip on the back. You know, health was, was it been the� decisions? I've been out of town for almost ten days. I'm starting to travel away every day. This is how I felt good. I see it in a very well. It was a perfect job. Good luck. Good luck. I've caught up in the town. I've been having a cut for myself. I've had a bunch of make a fit and I'm going to put one of them on me. I'm going to put them right now. I'm going to put them on the back. The lid is to the top of where. I had to put them on the foil on. I can't lose my mind. I put potatoes to the fucking the dream I have. Of course, I put them on the plate. Put potatoes in a bunch of biceps. About 240 grams of bice. About 250 grams of potatoes in there. It's in fish for late at night. I've also been eating tuna. I've got every other day. I'm going to have to give you a good day. I'm going to be eating a kelvin of back because actually eating a little different than I don't know what to do. I'm going to cut back and chicken a little bit. I'll get into that method a little bit. But making this kelvin of the ones you love are going to be. But I only have bice in the right thing now. I'm going to have a steak. What? That's right. I'm going to have steak. You could have steak. I'm going to eat this up in the evening. You moved to North Carolina today. We moved to the North Carolina today. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you guys that the North Carolina right now. I actually just got on flight after the gym and flew to North Carolina. So here we are. But they have any sketch up in North Carolina too, so I'll get done with it. If you want to find me come to the North Carolina mat. Hold the gym, North Carolina. Let's check me out. Oh hi. I don't know. There's my office. It's not that bad. But who did it to? Alright, that's going to be wrap on today's video. I think I'm going to start doing this thing. I didn't tell Calvinists, but I'm going to... I don't want to request. I really don't want all my calmness to be questioned. But I'm going to start going through comments and questions on YouTube or whatever. And I'm going to try and gather three questions. People ask me that and a lot of questions. And I'm going to answer them at the beginning of my YouTube videos just to involve the comments section and everything going forward. And when I don't know how to answer that, it's going to be how I'm going to answer it. So that's what I'm going to do from now on. That doesn't mean bombard me with questions. I'm just going to look for random ones and pull them up. I'm going to do three of the videos. I'm going to do Q&A every now and then. But I'm just going to add the little twist of somebody to video because I saw someone else do it. I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I did it, but it's a long demo. When I ran, I'm going to do it. But yeah, that's what's going on. Fucking strange. It's a fair fair. I cannot wait. But you know, that's the glorious days of a bodybuilder. I love eating with fish. I actually am enjoying my fish. Manifest that I enjoy it forever. Because once I eat something for a while, I stop liking it. But that being said, I got a shower. I'm fucking sweaty. Come to eating some fucking garlic film. I can't just put on a good spot. It's about the heavy that I can just. Yeah, I already stopped eating. I just had the chicken and the five bar. I've not escaped. Yeah, that was some creamy shit. According to the fact tomorrow, I'm pedcing it back tomorrow and I can't believe it tomorrow. So I've got like five days of freedom of videos. And then we're coming back through on afterwards. So stay tuned. Thank you for watching. Peace out.
