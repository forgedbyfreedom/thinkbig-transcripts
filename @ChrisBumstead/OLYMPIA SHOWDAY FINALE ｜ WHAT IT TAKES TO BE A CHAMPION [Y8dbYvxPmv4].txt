He's got a piece of it. It comes off. There's your cover boards. Have won their six NBA championship and it's their second three-peep. I hope you have won this award before but somehow I have the feeling that this one is more special than all of them. There were a lot of times during the course of the season that people doubted the Chicago Bulls. The world's doubted that you'd be able to come back and pull this off. Even during this final series here, people doubted you. How did you guys stay so confident? This team is one and we never let anybody gave it. You know, we believe that and we kept coming forward. All right, I've asked everybody if they're all going to come around and try to do this again. One more time? I would love for that to happen. I think that something's going to have to be determined over summer. I've been in the $75,000 check and presented to these second place finisher in the 2003 Olympia. Jay-Color! I mean, some people don't like doubted me and then think I'd come back. But I get my faith in God. This is not an individual for you. You take the team, the team I got, the best team in the world. And that's why I'm the best in the world. And y'all know that I couldn't do this without y'all. And hey, we're going to do this until God's in the same place as the move on. They do something else for him. So, thank y'all. I'm just so thankful because when I started polybuilding, I had no idea that I would be standing on this stage one day. When an semester limp is, then alone, being seven-time champion. And my ability taught me how to be strong mentally, physically, and emotionally through all my challenges. And I would just tell myself, what was that or more round? Just give it everything you got so you could put yourself in the best position to win. And that's all we can do in life, people. Sometimes life's been a serving of some curved walls, but I challenge you. Just never want to be the step in that matters box and take a damn swing. Just take a swing. And check once again, second place for the check for $10,000. The Olivia Silver Mallow, to our right of the season. Real handsley. Wow! Wow! All right, here we go. New! I was gonna solve the problem.

And I'm so grateful to be here and be at the top of it this year. They really push me to be my best. And I'm really grateful for that. And you know, it's been a beautiful year for me to say the least. There's been a lot of talk of my retirement for whatever reason. Not retiring. Don't worry, guys. I'm not going away. I'm here. I fuck love what I'm doing. But I think it's really kind of beautiful that people thought that because I think it shows that I'm learning to really enjoy the moment in the journey of your president. It's because a lot of people don't have the opportunity to kind of enjoy the moments that they look back and realize what they just went through. And they were like, wow, that was like, I wish I'd been a little more present and enjoyed that a little bit more. And I think the fact people think I'm done is because I'm actually here enjoying it now. And it's a beautiful thing. I met a friend of mine that comes in here. This summer in June. And he had a cancer and he was 18 years old. He was a battling for the third time. And he told me something that you don't have to be dying to start living. And he was 19 years old to cancer the third time. And the most present, grateful man I had ever met in my life. And I wore his bracelet up until I got my tan every single day. He wrote this prepped and I think he had him. And while he taught me and it was one of those beautiful things. And he sadly passed a month after that we had taught me that lessons. But he listened to it with me forever and that's something that I want to pass on to everyone. And just enjoying the moment being present. Love your family. Just like, see here, soak it all in. And I had a moment this morning, two hours on stage and honey comes up to me. He's like, soak this in. These moments come once a year. And I'm so proud. You know what I was like? You're so right. Like he's moments are so grand. They're so beautiful. So I'm just trying to enjoy everything I wanted them. I'm so grateful. There's so many of you guys who love me. That my support team is so big. My fiance now who's here who loved me. I love you. I love you, Courtney. My parents are here. My boy Maddie Calvin was me through absolutely everything. Ian who showed us the road of how to get here. And honey who took me on it. Being in this prep is my new coach. I can't thank you enough. You're crazy. But I love you. You put me through it. And it all paid off. Thank you so much for everything you've done for me. I'm so grateful. And the manians, wine burger, chick wood, the Olympia Dan, everyone. Such a beautiful stage. Such a beautiful show. This weekend. I'm so grateful to be here and be a part of it. Come back next year for number five. I'm ready to rock it. I love you guys. I love you guys so much. I can't wait to be back here next year.

I said a little bit ago. You don't have to know you're dying to start living. And that was a, I would be one take away for like anybody that's listening. And people always tell me like, Would you've always wanted change? Like not having cancer? Like would you restart your life? I was like, no. I never do it because I wouldn't be. Personally without cancer. Like I always tell people to like having cancer is like the best thing that's could have happened to me. Because it made me who I am today. Nope. And it got me to wear a mat today. Every time I've got cancer, I'm always saving somebody else from getting it. That's just who I am. It's crazy. Yeah.
