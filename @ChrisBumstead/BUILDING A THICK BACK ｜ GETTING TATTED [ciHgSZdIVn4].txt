He's getting Poppy's paw and he's getting the detail of what you're getting. It's the endless pursuit of our love, right? Come on, come on Chris! Come on, you're still old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old. What's that? I'm later in your village. Good driving. Why did you come here again? Maybe. Wait, who's driving? Why am I driving? Then I have to drive back here. I said, oh, you driving yourself. Yes. This is as old as the time it was and I'm late for everything now. I'll just try that. Why did you park, bud? I like it. What is up YouTube? Maybe doing something to say that you're getting a talk shit about it because you like to talk shit about what I like to do to myself. What? Getting the tattoo. Partly, a lot of because I did a speech, I guess, a talk. This weekend at a seminar, a hybrid health summit, something very of some of my norm. People would really know who I was. Not just a good event for myself, but I spoke at someone else's event. That was about overcoming obstacles and risks when I spoke about it. I made a joke about how 2018 used to be like a fear that brought up stress and anxiety. A year that brought up fear and stress and anxiety in myself. Because of my illness that came on, that's when I got sick. I got diagnosed on a music, a hospital for a while. A lot of shit. But what it also did was it enlightened my mind to kind of go inside and learn how to handle stress. I had to handle obstacles that come up in our life and how to make the best of it. And these are the versions of yourself. So I made a joke. I'm like, I used to my perspective, my friend with mine was at 2018 bad. I did this to me. I was a victim of it. And now I'm grateful for it. You know, flipping the switch on it. I was like, I'm going to get a tattoo on my leg now. I'm so happy about 2018. And I wasn't joking. Two days later, I'm going to get a tattoo on my leg. So, what we're doing? You guys can hate me because you're always like, don't put tattoo on your body. It's dope to it. But I'm going to fuck with me. Good news, you know. What? That's actually close to what I was thinking. Okay. I can show you how I'm right too. Yeah. I think you know what I'm right too. Yeah. I think you know what I'm right too. Yeah. I think you know what I'm right. I think you know what I'm right. We can look at that one online. I don't know what I can guarantee. Okay. Yeah. Absolutely. Ready to get tattoos. Excuse me. He's getting cocky's paw. And he's getting, as you tell them what you're getting. Yeah. It's the endless pursuit of our love. Right? Yeah. That's it. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I just got to play it too. It's actually pretty pretty. You know, hands too pop. You should. Next to your leaf. What I'm dead body. I get it. I might like it here. And her baby paw. So which is that here anymore? You always have an imprint in it. Why you're perfect. Or her face. I'll get her head right here. Watch it. Just a front g-head. With her body. I think that's what we're talking about. With her body. Just put the letters. Like if I were to talk to a like face, it would kind of like let the letters kind of close up in some of the spots. You're a person with that's not a sign. Like you can take that to the face. Yes. Yeah. Like perfect. Cool. All right. So I'm going to go print those out. I was in the right direction. I made this one like has a little bit of space in between them. And then this one has like slightly that more space between those. So everything else. I think that would work out. That could fit. More options better. Yeah. I think that would work out. Yeah. I think that would work out. Yeah. I think that would work out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that would work out. Yeah. What do you want out more space? Not more space? What do you think you did it like in this same spot that this one's going to go. But like on that side. Maybe it's like. Filming them has a thing. So I have this already. It's going to be too bad. It's not very loud. It's not very loud. It's too dry. It'll be much darker when people look. Yeah. I just wish I could be. It's quite. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go wrong. What? Let's go wrong. Brilliant. They're misalty. Profit. You might defecrate the body, is that really something? I'm gonna use this down, I'm just gonna set it down. I'm not gonna lie down, man. Alright, so there you go. Tetsu number seven and eight, or something, completed. Wrap it up. Twenty-eighteen, the most pivotal year in my life, used to suck ended beautiful. Also the year in my cornea, to very end of it, so it's kind of hell up in my cornea, and then I start to get a lot better. So, choosing appreciation for it, but endless pursuit down there, and literally tattooed it right above where I wear my socks, because I wear these socks every day. But I probably will forever, but that's just the concept of the endless pursuit of growth, constantly trying to get to be your best self, and whatever aspect of life it is, getting better and better, and in every instance, it's a beautiful adventure that is life. So, words and methods that I live by, but that's it. So, I don't get to work out today's sadly, because I'm not really trying to sweat into that, so I'm gonna rest today. See you guys tomorrow for, I think it's back there. I don't know, either way, but we're getting here. So, peace out. All right, so in the office today, we're taking testing Choco Peanut butter, protein. Choco Peanut butter, isolate protein. We're going to go to the best flavors ever. But the Chig multiple samples? This is very, first one. Oh, that was a control. But we're trying multiple flavors, a control, and two samples, so the sample is going to be at the nail right now. So, I'm waiting to try them all back to back to back, we have to be able to compare them. How have you been waiting for you? What? Was that Choco Peanut butter? It's great too. That one is good. There's everything this flavor is very different to the way. I think it's because I don't always love Dr. Choco. I think it's because I don't always love Dr. Choco. I think it's because I don't always love Dr. Choco. We're going to be able to play there. We're going to allow Dr. Peanut butter. Let's go. That's good. Give us a ball of ice. I think that's a really good. It doesn't taste the exact same, but it's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. Let me try it now. I try to be good. Yeah. That's really good. This is great. You get the peanut in the trunk, which is like a drum right? It's a much better trunk, but. Do you want to go to the gym? Shut the front now. Who? All PTLs, of course. White cherry. The amount of time they've asked for Dr. Choco, come back with you. It's not bad to like White cherry, but it's a... So, it's super the, like, 2.0. This is super stuff like 2.0. No. Nice and black, series. That's good. Okay. That's really good though. This is the one we're going to do the John Wick ad? Yeah. Did you get up there? Yeah, but he told you about it. What the hell? We'll get it up for. It took you to build. Hit up Mustang. Mustang Instagram. Hey, can I rent a car for a shoe and how old are you guys? Well, I had to do it. I hit up Chrysler to get that div in lady to need reply to me. Dad? That's really good. That's probably one of our best flavors. She can't. That's probably made that form of a suit. That's good too. That's a div in her. Yeah, too. On my, on my. But they're modern? Yeah. This is the one that's like, asshole. Yeah, that's super cool. Yeah. Yeah. This is super rare, by the way. Normally we take this thing and it tastes like asshole. We have to go back ten times. That was the first time that people tried to nail drug appeal about her. And the second version of it, money. And this first one, a white cherry, fire. I don't even know what tastes like a slushier something. It's really good. Or white gatorade mixed with like ice cream. Yeah, it's like the ice. See that has the polar bear on it. We're like airheads even. The white bear has the solution. Yeah, yeah. You know if I eat this a little bit of the whole thing. Maybe we're coming out. That's like it. That's like it. You really roughly met me? Do you have any bummed out of your dreams? They're open. How come the open was that right there? There's like a case in it and I covered it over there. I know that's right. How do they know how many of you are next though? Don't you? Oh, I know. Oh, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Those are samples. So? What's it? Those? Peach? Plain Peach? I don't think I like it. Alright, so. Oh, goodbye dog. Is it dog in there? It's what's back there? One of the big things in the channel bring up. Honey said he's going to send me a game plan for the training schedule going forward. So that's going to be what's going on. I've been traveling a lot so it's time to sit down and lock in training now. I mean, I've actually been training really hard and getting back to it. So looking forward to the process of it all. But this past weekend I was at a speaking event and it's funny because that was you. It's funny because literally trying to get myself out of it. But he asked me to do the speaking event the night after the Olympics. When I had a few drinks in me and I was like, and I could move and I agreed. And then he put me on a post and I was stuck doing it. And I really want to do it. So I tried to get out of it, but I was like, fuck it. Whatever it's to Q and A. And then he gave me like a keynote speech. We're actually at the speak by myself and you guys know, I'm not a public speaker. But I had to flip my mind set. Instead of being like a fuck I don't want to do this being like this is not a opportunity for me to get better. Something I suck at do something I'm afraid of and get better at it. And I actually did really good. I don't think I started at all. I didn't say like I didn't say I'm the whole time. I had like a story I told a bit when I got sick because of the health summit. Now how I had to overcome the anxiety and fear around my health. Kind of my mindset going through and accepting the unknown and taking control of what I did. No, and what I did to take control of my health. And I think I actually did a decent job and it's funny because now I'm not a public speaker. I'm running to now thinking of like a renewed out of someone I was honny soon. Before I was really nervous to do that and I'm already like looking forward to it more because I know I'm better at it. And I know it's another opportunity for me to get better. So people are always like do something every day that scares you and all that bullshit. But like kind of hard do something every day. I really do something every day that's probably not going to be that scary. So my thing that I learned from this, it picks something in the future that you maybe it's not something you want necessarily even. But something that someone else does that you envy. Like I respect people who can public speak very well. You can speak very well and fluently. That's something I want to get better at. And so pick something in the future that you're afraid of and maybe not get that and plan to do that thing. And then progress yourself towards it. Practice your way there and then do it. It doesn't have to be every fucking day but like a few times you're doing something that scares you and put you in a position to grow. You're going to make you better person. It's going to build your confidence. And you're just going to feel really good about yourself. Very proud. The endless pursuit of life of being better and better at tiny little things and becoming whatever version of yourself you want to be. So I do a spirit of motivation for the day. Plants him that scares you and fuck that shit out. But we're going to get you a huge back day. We'll see you guys. Have a good day. All right. So typical warm up with some pull down came a bullshit. Somebody is my favorite pull down spot. Put this in the corner. Someone put this shovel handle on. So I fucked it up. We need to put it up today and do the shovel handle. So I did like four or five working sets or sort of warm up to the end of my last stretch warm up. They're working to come and film in the night drop sets finish up. And never warm. So I'm going to do some kind of heavy row movement. Probably just for a dumbbell roast. Let me take it. So move on to those and get out with the workout. Yeah. I won't put in my life. I did like one ten set this. I don't want my form with trash. I don't want to get really weak. Oh. I don't think I will get the hands off. It's one of those things. We're going to start the breathing section on the pad. So, a four-seeded practice proper breathing techniques. Should do this every exercise, but you're forced to on there. So, we're going to try to get better. Did every breath breathing the same position? Because your might chest is getting switched by the pad. It's like the blow out on the way down. Deep exhale at the bottom. Pulling the bumble there for a second. Now, the air in me, the oxygen. Feel like I'm power. Ripping it up. Let the air out. Suck it in and repeat. And like a rhythm of that. So, you're going to the same breath every time that holding your breath. Remember to breathe. Makes you stronger. Instead of shape from out of breath, we're going to grab this. Just never like this machine. Because it couldn't reach all the way. And then, really, you have to take all the plates off and lower the back end to the reaching all the way. But the one arm row where you can actually get a full stretch. Are beautiful. The way better than a dumbbell row from the floor. Just get a much better stretch in the contraction. Put it in the dream. But little tip on these. The same arm that you're doing. Keep that foot planking forward. A lot of people will put that foot back in that arm forward. You're opening up your hips. And then you're opening your body. Your core is moving the weight. But I think you can put forward. Your hips are forced to stay forward. And you have to pull some of your lathe rather than your core. So, keep it in your back. No one wants to thick. Big legs. Jesus, fuck. Nothing heavy. I'm a fucking, that's what I mean. What that mean where someone gets launched. And then, go that thin. No. No. Then someone like dancing through space in the ocean. No. To me with some overweight dude falling off a bridge. Flies in his space. It's pretty funny. Maybe jumping up to place in the little bit. I think I've got you. Two is casting example. You're doing a job? Yeah. Slow job. I will take a shot. Nice. You want to have one laugh? It won't go that much. The work I have to wait for you to work with me. I'm just going to go. I'm a machine because of the waste in the glass. They get like extra stuff heavier. It makes it really hard to lock it on the contraction. We're at Lock-In. I guess it's a rope. I don't know how you say that. But normally I put on a little more weight in the middle. Put it on the top range and on the machines. There's just where the weight will be heavy. It's putting it up here. It makes it heavier. To begin the middle range of motion. So on the stretch. And then now they pull. I guess a little bit lighter. So I can get the full contraction in my back. We're also having heavy load on it. So kind of fancy machine. I've never smart enough to use them properly. It's the only one I understand. So, give me an shot. It's hot in here. I don't know how many feet much. I can't tell the bad idea. Yeah, horse. Yeah, we're gonna rest my bowies. You'll be shit. You just got off. You got all you have to do? That way you do it for early? I mean, yeah, find out. You have to do it for a while. You have to go on with the bar. What? With the bar. Like this? Yeah, just put 135 in this. But I can't even do this. That's the only up here. This is where it's first constant. This is 2019. When my hair started to hit. My hair looks ready to go back. You're put away. How that work out for you? I think it's getting worse. It's not getting worse. It doesn't look that. I don't understand what's going on. Yeah, from mine's going back. I'm gonna scare you. I'm losing my shit. You can't cover our 6-wheel. Pro-sense Gendi.2. So, right? So, what? So, what? I'm gonna start with Mimdi. It's not going to work out for you. But not going away. For any health to the monkey, do you? For any health to the monkey, do you? For any health to the monkey, do you? For any health to the monkey, do you? For any health to the monkey. You're so good. This drives it out. I'm trying. But bro, I've been working out for a couple of two weeks now. Well, don't work out. That's good. No, I'm pushing it out. I'm not like popping it. I'm like, well, I'm like, well, I'm not going away. Tromma, I've just such bad luck with pimples like this. Like, I get them and they're like, they're so bad and they stay for so long. I'm like, what can you do? Can't I'll be perfect, mom? I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. Bitch reps. Bitch reps? I'm pulling down the curtain. You want this extra? It's a side of your statement. How tall are you? And the... I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. I guess. The tall room and the maid service, tucked at that cheetra and two deep on the outside. So, wake up. Nightingest. I'm just trying to fucking rip them up. That's what you're doing. Show them a rip with that cheetra. Ah, ah. Thanks, man. Yeah. Thanks, man. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Alright, last exercise. I picked a weight that's not too heavy. I'm going to be forced out just like 20 second rest instead of doing a long set. So I'll just decrease the rep range every single time. Going pretty much close to failure and then we're done this work now. How many likes does this video have to get for you to buy me a red rocker? 100,000. Oh, I like it. Okay. Do you think it's a hundred thousand likes? Yeah. Good luck. Why have I given it that too much? No, I've never given up. Maybe you've shown it to me. Fuck that. That's it. Go home. Help me win a red rocker, guys. What? Help me win a red rocker. Help Calvin win a red rocker. Alright, as we wrap on today's video. Thank you for watching. Thought of the day. Do something that scares you this year. I think big that scares you. Because doing easy stuff. Feels your ego. If you feel good about yourself, because you need to shit that you're good at. Heart stuff. Feels your ego. Forces you to grow. Thought confidence become better person. Try. And then Calvin's going to start taking a trip. No, I mean he said. No, he told me. So he said. No, he said. He said something. We're going to take a trip. We're going to take a trip. We're going to take a trip. We're going to take a trip. So I'm going to try and see if I can take it. I'm saying people are scared to do it. Okay. I don't do that. Somebody comes trucked up. I will make you better. Don't let somebody calving to ever. We're supposed to. Peace out. Peace out.
