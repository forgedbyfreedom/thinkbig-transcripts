Can't forget my leg under it. Oh no. There we go. Yeah. I don't ever feel it. Oh no. Well, there's some crushed dreams. Leave a little hundred pounds. Saving yourself some money though. That's a very true. Come on! Come on Chris! Come on John! Still! Oh, total code! Oh, yeah, let's go for this one! What's the... What? It's a very cool location. I'm just about to go and close the bar. I'm very excited to be on Photoshop. It didn't. Selfish is just one to bring myself here. So, I'm just going to do my best. I'm going to do my best. I'm going to do my best. I'm going to do my best. I'm going to do my best. I'm going to be on Photoshop. Then, selfishly, I just wanted to bring myself here to check out Charizard. But in this shop, I'll be our curated. It's down here in Miami. Right away. And they have just vintage supercar. It's very flambles. They got some photos taken here. Everything you can imagine. So, we got Stephen here. It's gone guys. It's been a tour. A little history of some really cool things. I'm going to be doing a Vomitrish Photoshop here because I had a vintage vibes of it all. And what better place to do with them is for our reason. I'm also going to walk around the shop. It's telling us that Charizard is a good thing. I haven't even seen them yet, but my dreams have won one day. So, this is a pleasant one of the vibes I do. Alright, so starting off, we have one of our most significant cars in our showroom. This is the Bugatti EB110 SS Super Sport. But it was not only just a super sport, but it's a car number six of the prototypes. This was actually the USA Development Cars. It has a couple of one-off features. That is a single fuel tank. So it's important. So it drains evenly. It also has a unit carbon fiber. So you can actually see the weave in the carbon from here. This was the first time a car has been fitted with four turbos. So a car makes about 607 horsepower and a reduction of about 300 pounds of weight off of the production cars. And this one has the engine and driveline that set the landscape record for this car. So, there's a lot of that. How's it going? How are you? Good nice meeting. How's everything? Good, good. Yeah, nice meeting. You got to do a great job. Thank you. Yeah, whatever you need. While you're here, how are we going to help? I know the team won't have enough water moves on here, but I've got a huge fan. Oh, so I appreciate it. What you've done. Thank you. You as well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So yeah, whatever you need. Oh, yeah. Appreciate it. Great to meet you. Yeah. You're a fitness. Oh, this one with the buckets probably. It's like, it's always a tight like this. I started on the bed. I'll get my custom seats when I go. Yeah. It's a new one seat. That's a. This is the second. I'll see. So behind is actually another Bugatti. This is a Bugatti 16.4 Varon. So one of the early cars, but what makes this car notable is it's one of three in black black. Most of the cars had a two-tone color. This one, most notably used to belong to Little Wayne originally. Really? So it was the first car which you had. We just got it back in service with $62,000 for tires. Yeah. Yeah. Bit of a bit of a process where they had to actually take the wheels off. Some glue the tires have them shipped to California to be mounted to the car as a re-glude and shipped back. So it's a bit of a procedure to service. Sure none of these car that just like swap the so. Yeah, exactly. Just as not just that simple. Yeah. These cars are like a lot smaller in person. Yeah. Like a waste smaller. So we've got the Merchillago RGT product. This is actually the Gini Auto Show Show Car where Lamborghini was announcing that they were going racing in the RGT. It was designed by a radio engineering and it was for the ALMS and WEC in Dura's Cross Series where they did compete for I think one or two seasons. Behind it. Well, 5,000 original miles. So one of the lowest mileage best examples that we'd ever had come to our show. That's the same color we had in Wolf Wolf. We have a white one. So funny story. We actually, we did racing the car that car. Really. It was a car that I knew personally for 13 years. Yeah. And I went on to be notably in the movie. Belfer had never actually had a Kuntosh, but his car was a white white anniversary. So a slightly later car than that. Yeah. But it was a white white car in the movie. There you guys do a bug getting these cars. It's everything. It's literally everything. It's Dornocking. Like, hey, this guy's neighbor has this car. So Dornocking. To brand itself, help to wear. Hey, this is what we're looking for. So people come to us with stuff. You got built it now. Yes. Yes. And then the technicians, where they've been around the cars, hey, remember this car. Other relationship with other dealers and other friends like, oh, I know this guy. I mean, just letting people know that we're looking for as well as being involved in the relationships that are built because of the cars. Yeah. Once you start, I think once you start building a relationship and you realize the community smaller than you think everyone likes. I know this. I know this. I know this. Exactly. And it's, you would track what you put out. It should be good. So. And one of my now favorite cars that we have in here. This is the Conexic CCXR. So the CCXR they made it, believe 49 cars for the world. But the CCXR they made 9. And this car is mostly one of three with a manual transmission. Features, one of three made with a manual of the CCXR package was the 85 conversion. So it features around a thousand horsepower. And also this car was fitted with a Ghost Package, which was 100. $1000 carbon fiber upgrade kit. And this car was also featured in Fast 5, the end of Fast 5, where they say now there's two in the Western Hemisphere and they were all together. So 3000 miles and a $20,000 custom floating house titanium exhaust. It isn't absolutely right to drive one of my own. So amazing too. In the same one of my favorite features is the doors, which are one of the most unique features upon this car. So you can actually get in. Yes. And the roof comes off too, which is also smaller and there. That one over there. That shift gears on there. I don't even know how you drive that manual. It's quite so hard to drive that manual. That one's not that bad. There's other cars that are a little more tricky. There's a lot of feedback and it's actually pretty communicative. So that one's actually really communicative. So it's not that bad. This is the orange car with the doors up is the Geopold GT2. This is the only factory competition car. It was Lamborghini's goal was to race at Lamar. It featured two races and it raced at the 24 hours of spa. It never actually made it to Lamar. But it was the only Diablo that ever featured in competition wheel to wheel racing. That one also lived in the Lamborghini Museum up until 2015. Couple cars that are mid-progress here. We've got two mercy logo, 40th cars. So there's another one over there, which I'll feature is the press car. And over there's a Gallardo press for Montague, which is three cars. I'm hitting with five remaining transmission. Yellow F-50, one of 31 yellow cars. And under here, I can give you guys a sneak peek of what we've got coming up for. The car world, one of the biggest events is Pable Beach. It's kind of a super ball, the World Cup, everything roll into one. This is a near-MS. We've spent three years in restoration. So this will be making its public debut for the first time. Pable Beach is here. Yes, thanks. Thanks for the one. One other car I've got to give a shout out to is this Maricilago of the front. So not only a curated one, just by a significant examples, but all the cars have an interesting story with them. So this is also car number 24. And that's important because this is the global press car. So this was the car that was featured in all the magazines and all the shows and all the brochures. And when the car was announced to the world, so this was the car that was actually in that so. The cool piece to find. The two AMG Mercedes over there, one is a one-car lift in Japan. And that was a 1990. The SLL is white and blue tier and features six-liter engine upgrade from these two to the wire. And the LH-SEC, AMG is six-way-out. Some people like to call them cameras, but that's kind of one of my things is the hammer was a little bit more involved in the conversion. So this car was technically the 560 SCC wide body of six-way-out. There are never things that are really cool cars. These are like what I am going for. Yeah, this is a child of soap. These are the cars I got some of the most seen time in. There are a lot of functional aerodynamics with the cars. They just all the engineering that went into the rear of the Mercedes feel of it. And you get effectively doubling the horsepower in a very capable platform. Just because the little is a good one. Well this is the actual competition. This is the real thing. It's still nothing. It's like a rocket ship. Yeah. What's VCU? What stands out to you? I've got a lot of good contashers. I'm at the Able because they're the NHL player in my city who I orange DL. Oh, I drove her out. We've got a blue roadster. And then this can touch was I can't be able to so we can sit in that one. Do you want to try that? Hold on a minute. You can't get a fair play. Doesn't fit a camp by? Yes, you're a student. What would it be? Okay, if you're by leg under it. Oh no. There you go. Yeah. I don't know if I can. Yeah. My dreams are getting crushed. And this is probably one of the most room. Really? Wow. You know, this one's way. Imagine me coming in to a nice restaurant. I can't get out of that. Do you have to like, I'm in now. Okay, would you try that black card? Wait, does this have back seats? No. No. I thought I don't know. You probably found the car. I didn't do that. It was an easy one. So this one actually has comfort seats. Where you could off. This card you could get the technical package, which featured carbon seats and carbon ceramics. But this one was option with the steel breaks and the comfort seats. This is one of my favorite land violence cars. Yeah, no. No. Yeah. You can see my muscle over there. That's muscle bar. Yeah, exactly. You have to sit in the back of the engine to put the jet though. Yeah. Well, there's some crushed dreams. Leave it a little hundred pounds. Saving yourself some money to offer. That's a very true. There we go. So this is probably going to be our best bet in terms of the set. It has the cars done. No, you know, where they made a little bit more room for people. Unfortunately, you know, I'm Italian car sized. They tried to say. There you go. Kind of. Right? I think a drive it because it's automatic. Any of the manuals I wouldn't know. You know, I should buy this. Look at this. I can drive this. But the roof would be like. Yeah. It's such a short. Yeah. It takes like 15 to 20 minutes of what the lawn is. If you know what you're doing. Really? The roadsters are easier to use. The lawn is a lot. But this one's a lot. He doesn't spend any of the cars. All right. Well, he doesn't even have a fire. He's a good one. Good luck. Very cool though. Last but not least, if you wanted to pop your head into the shop, you can see it also goes into the process here. And I did want to show you John's car. This white clundosh is very similar to the car that was featured in the Wolf and Wall Street. This one is a European example with a 4,000-y original miles on it. Really? We're going to read a color to see. It's called Bianco Pralotto. It's like a pearl. Yes. This is like the bill though and more. Yeah. That red. And you? The anniversary car is a little bit more of a disease. The personal car. This is a Diablo SE30. These are the cars that John the others must pass on. This is featured in the iconic Violua 30 Purple. And this one is, I think it's Car number 90. Yes. Car number 97. But most notably, this was the car that was actually designed by Rachel Codani. Really? This is first car before he left the form of something. Yeah. So I'm not going to let him know that he has seen 30. This is a little bit of our shop. A little bit of what's going on here. I'm going to leave a couple of cars getting ready to go in. Very cool. It's a very cool, first day ready to go to the public beach right now. A few cars in the middle of restoration. But it takes a village to make these cars. I was wanting to give a shout out to the shop. Oh, that's not competitive. What are you with? That's at 5000 hours. So that's in 85. That's actually the engine that's getting ready to go back in. I'm going to go back in. I'll go back in. I'll go back in. I'll go back in. I'll go back in. What's that orange one right there? Well, that's a whole, four more seawater. So slightly older than the roadster. So similar to the blue cars. But it's mostly 6,000 miles in its factory manual car. So O2 to O3s. They were all manuals. But no 4 to O6. They were options. We got a couple of little updates from back there. So we're going to go to the surface. So the silver car is actually what's called the low-tech seawater 1000. It was a custom commission car. If you put that was commissioned. And it took them about four years to build. It was the goal of being the number one car. It had a 1000 horsepower Mercedes-Benz turbo engine. With, I think, a theoretical top speed of 268 miles. And it's essentially a sawper C9 LeBoc car underneath. What do you call this? Kind of drifted off and do obscurity for many years. That's fully tough to them. Yeah. One of one carbon chassis, 1000 horsepower. Just absolutely insane. I don't feel it. I barely set the neck already, too. Not even, but all those are, you know. Yeah. Me for lose 50 pounds. Yeah. I have no idea. You're getting somewhere down there. Yeah, they got something. Good? Yep. Yeah. All right, so we just wrapped up the shoot here. We are curated. I am very inspired to go to this car this one day. So hopefully we'll modify me to fit in it, but you never know. We'll find out. Anyways, wrap on the shoot right now. We gotta get some food to be hungry. We're sweating to the water. So we catered to something. And I'm gonna go work out. I have to tonight or if not, then we'll finish the vlog tomorrow, but I'll see you later. I'm so wrapped up. The shoot yesterday at Miami, you know what I'm going to do today. Cause we go home at like 8.30 after a driving after Miami. But shoot went really well. Huge thanks to the guy that we are curated. Carls are fucking cool. The guys are really nice. Just genuine good people. Showing us around, brought us an extra car at the end of the shoot with. It gives a history of the place so it's really cool. Kind of thing all that shit. Still disappointed, even the day after that I don't fit any of the cars. But this is what it is. But yeah, that's like well we're back here and revive. And a bunch of fucking upgrades. I think he gets a Dom said they got 32 new pieces in. Which even better than before. We're going to arrange it a little bit. So some new toys. I don't know if they'll set up yet, but if they're maybe going to try and show the piece today other than that, show the day. Gotta get's quick in. Because they got to be a dinner. Like seven o'clock and it's already like fucking five something. So be rushing out of here. And that's it. So I probably didn't talk much. Okay. And you go home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if I'm going to week or thronger. That was fucking good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's insane. The work you've done. That's insane. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
