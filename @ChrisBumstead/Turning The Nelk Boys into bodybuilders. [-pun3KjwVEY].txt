Where do you have lunch on? Holy fuck. That's a bit of a relief. All those ones. Yeah, we're just... I thought it was the one that you found. Dude, it's a big chair. It's a big chair. I think it's bad. I didn't know it was that one. The fact that you got enough. The jokes thing is someone probably saw that, eh? Like, they're like, look at up a chair just flying. They're just flying. They're like, where are you? So, not even there. They were done. Yeah, they were. So heavy. To move, we'll get it like... You think? It's not a light chair. I will say that. I thought I was the one that was on. I was like... You know the one where you put the cushioning... You just pick it up. No. That's not the one that's on. No, dude. It's like all over. That's fucked. Yeah, I didn't know that. Yeah. So, you should have my... No, wait. Wait. I need to go for a bit of a walk. It's a scratch. No, no. Olympia 2025, eh? I don't know. I don't know.

So, look at that on the top of the car. I look good, man. I'm very proud. What? That's so pretty. I was gay. I was gay. We have a month in like six days before we're no boys bodybuilding show. Three of the studies down to pull up and judge potentially. We're going to let the fans vote. We're going to let the fans vote. All right, well let's go. All right, well let's go. I'll win. I'll win that in your neck a little bit. Can you do some of the ease? The J-pop? Yeah, I'm so excited. I'm going to go the metal, eh? Yeah. Are you manifesting? Yeah. More in this breakfast, like, we're now. Next Mr. O. Yes, man, that photo. You're not like fried, dude. There's no rage. Where's the rage at? To them up to 60. That's true. Well, to 60 it up to the rage. Yeah. Look to 58. Yeah, folks. All right, so we are here in Atlanta. I've been traveling a lot and not really talking about even what we're traveling for. But the difference was raw and bomb managing growing them is that we have to use a lot more to serve it as for energy because they go into a lot more stores, sea stores, which convenience stores, gas stations on that stuff rather than raw, which goes in like white and macho, but we sell it by the macho and then they're all across the country or G and C's the same thing. So we have to partner with the tubulars in each state each county that have a good connection with them. They'll sell for us. They'll go to the store and make sure everything looks good. Looks pretty. Everything's in stock on the shelf. Everything that we need. So we need to sell the brand to them and then sell the brand to places like QT, raise tracks, seven loving, all that stuff and they help us get it in all those stores. Sell to them. They already have relationships with them. But it's a much different business. It's not just selling to the end consumer like you guys. We have to convince multiple levels of the business to take it, sell it and promote it for us. And it helps us kind of grow. So that's what we've been doing in traveling to states, different companies, help us go through it. We're going to land right now trying to get into those gas stations here. The first one we're going into is going to be a Dallas Texas. So we're going to be going down there meeting with them again next week. So a huge part of this year is going to be a lot of travel. A lot of meeting with distributors, DSD, what we call and just trying to get the brand out there. So this is the breakout year for Bum Energy and raw. We got some protein RTDs, lots of cool stuff. So that's what we're doing down here in Atlanta trying to push it out here for lunch. I think it's the same with shop. I really hope that the dumps that it is. We're going to eat head back home in and out Atlanta in the same day. So be home tonight. Physi times. Got a love it.
