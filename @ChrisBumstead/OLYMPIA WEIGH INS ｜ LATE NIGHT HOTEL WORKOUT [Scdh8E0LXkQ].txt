This is too. It's crazy. It's good. I'm 30, I'm 30. Can't believe it. You're so good. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not in the press, are I going to do it? Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on. Come on. We come, I'll let you in, Chris. Let's go, Chris. You're done. Sorry, I'll get you. I'll get you one. One. Yeah. Push it, Sharon's going to roll with? Yeah. Yep. These are all the secrets. One potato? It's one potato. Every 27 minutes. Nice. Put a pound of ball over there. There you go. Set. Do you have to tell secrets? I think the potato is 40 different ways. Just to keep up the diversity. So that Mr. Bumsat can stay bougie. Boosie. Anyways, what is up YouTube? Mustache is a full effect. Wings are in... 3 hours. Probably 4 hours. It's been a long time since I've been in interest in day. We woke up under 240. And it's just been about keeping me there all day. So lower my water, lower my sodium, and literally tracking everything that's going in my body from the time to the gram, so the ounces to the water. Everything that's going in me and then every time I eat a drink. I take off all my clothes, I step on the scale. And then we see that I'll give you a little more. Can you drink a little more? Which is balancing that out pretty much. I'm just being a wizard right now. And it's bouncing around. And the corn is been a chef all day. Cookin' steak, salmon, rice, fish, potatoes, anything you can imagine. Right now we saw some different ways. We wasted out when we see which one sucks the most liquid out of it. So we're kind of a bunch of bored to the other part. But the more cars I can hear right now with some minimal amount of liquid, the better, so we're just trying to drive this shit out of it. That an air fryer would be amazing, but I did not get an air fryer during the next time we will get an air fryer because the air fryer is a little bit of a best. But we're three hours away right now. If you don't pretty good, I've literally haven't left the hotel room. I've been like sleeping, shaped my beard, sleeping, eating, kind of stretching, moving around, trying to make sure that I'm not too stagnant with the food in me. So that I can actually move through and have a good poop in everything. So yeah, it's pretty much what's been going on all day. And we're going to keep doing this to the APM. Make way. Eat some food. We're going to have a late night workout. So after in the hotel, I had some biceps, alarms, just whatever I've been finishing up we need to do, and then the more I'll be getting. So, let's see. Alright, that was an underning shit tomorrow. So, right? But you're not doing shit tomorrow. I got a 10 press conference, maybe another 10. Oh, sorry, that's for... I think meat and meat, 10. A lot of you go on the long run. Yeah, tomorrow's a very, very loaded day. A lot of the meat and meat are so difficult. The long day in the meat grid at like 9pm, and you're just like fully depleted. So, luckily you have an extra need to rest. Yeah. I've opened up like swollen after standing there for three out of meeting people. And like, people who are mad at you, if you leave it like 10 o'clock, I'm like, I had a complete year here to watch me look good, you know? But, I'll part of the game. Yeah, it's hard to come up with these because I spent too much time at the main grid. That's why I had a lot of it. Right? Yeah, see you later. See you later. Also, it also is for the appetito. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Sounds good. I'll show you a few little things. You water it after too. Which you're food? Yeah, every bag, like every... Just bring the, you know, where you're going to water. I'm going to bring a bag in a bottle, a smaller bottle. Imagine the water, you know? Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me have you in. Yeah. That was going out yesterday. How do you get that? That was going out yesterday. How do you get that? That was going out yesterday. You felt a lot. It was pretty good to show out at the moment. Yeah. Oh, that was good. What? What? Here. A little lower. There. I'll pick you up. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm ruined that. Good job, Eddie. It's 6-2. It's so hard. It's so hard. It's so hard. You could have found it. My life was pretty scared to do that. You're going to pick me up like, you're going to have done this recently. That was perfect. Now we're going to make an extra 10 pounds. Not actually, but I'll be 6-1. In a half. Alright, so we are officially 30 minutes out. 20 minutes out of weigh-ins. So walking over to play in Hollywood now is going to find the ballroom on the way-ins. I think there's a meeting to 12. I want you to be able to form yourself a while, but I'm currently like pound under 240 on my scale. Hopefully there's a scale that's similar. On you and check their scale earlier just to make sure it was close to ours. And you said it was pretty much right on. Mine was a little bit heavier. So we're going to head over there, weight it out. You've got a beautiful meal in the bag ready to go for a while. And just stay put your potato. Then late night workout. It's good to bed. How do we get that? This is it. Line of Chinese things, exciting news. This year got the fourth. Look at how big a tube is. And big watch. Actually, you're a big fan of your Chinese. Well, I love those things. You should go there.

I'm going to see you. I feel like I'm making it in my mind. Just to put it in the water. Yeah. I think I'm going to walk. I think I'm going to walk. Hello athletes and fans of bodybuilding Terrikel Gindy with the Mr. Olympia. Three-time classic physique, Mr. Olympia champion, Christopher Bumstead, aka Ceebum. Chris. Now, while back you said to me, the most relevant Olympia for me was the second one. I felt like those the most relevant. It had a lot of importance to me. But if you win the fourth one, that's a dynasty. That's you cementing your name saying, hey, I am the one who put a statement on that category. How do you feel? I mean, I'll tell you how I feel after it. Don't tell me that you don't tell me that. But like I said, 2018 was special memory for me because I went through. But each one had its own beautiful moments to it. It'd be great for everything. A lot of me. Now I'm just excited. It's journey so far. It's been so good this year. And I feel great. I'm ready to bring my best luck in it. Maybe it'll be my favorite one yet. I'll never know. So obviously, working with Hany Ramon, he's a great coach. He's got many Mr. Olympus on his camp. Tell me a little bit about this modification. It's a new coach. Did you feel like it was an easy transition? I think it would be easy transition. To be coached for me, Bahá'í, when it's in the street for a year. He's been with champions for years. You know what that takes meant like this. And I think it's what we've done a pretty impressive because you've got like a lot of the name ropes don't fix it. But the champion is a better every single game. We've got to get better and better that I'm going up against. We had to bring my level, might just get to the next level. I believe we did just that so. Should show up. Chris Bumstad, he is one of the greatest competitors we have now days. And every year he continues to get better. My name is Terakil Gendu with the superstar C-Bum. We'll see you on stage. Good job.

Do you make white court? I'm gonna get back. I didn't say I made white. I'm gonna get back. I was sitting there a little nervous. I'm like, you're mother right. Did I shrink? And he pushed the thick heart on my head. Like down. All my hair down. Oh my god. I tried to make my hair puffy. Didn't work. He just pushed it down. He said, oh, you're almost sixty. I'm like, my sixty. Or they're like, six, one and a half. I'm like, oh, I need it. So I was 237.8, which means I have two point two pounds to play with. I'm never in the evening drink until I start. I think I could put on four or five pounds. Thanks, too. So make it. But for now, to the ease. Arms. Let's do it. All right. So late. Very late right now to go 11. 20 almost 130. And in the gym, hitting some late minibisep's last minibisep. And it's a great night. So tired. Finish wayins, made way. A little bit of food. A little bit more water. Just kind of re-aduring myself. And it's supposed to be my final workout today. But the way it took way longer because of sixty people in classically serious health. Took a minute to get out of there. It's probably hardly any workout. Tomorrow I rest. Got a bunch of stuff going on today. After I rest on the two days of the rest between. So we're just finishing out this final little workout. The last weight lifting workout. It's a beautiful hotel gym. This is great on me. Awesome great music. I'm trying to just get through this. Go get some food. Put a bed up. I'm going to bed at like 9.30. So it's like 11.30 right now. It's the latest health. I don't want to be here. But we're going to wrap it up. I don't work out of the year. Then it's all food from here. So it's got to get us over with. Awesome. Really good. Awesome. Really good. Really good. Really good. It's good. It's great. You're good looking. Yeah. Yeah. Not that didn't be for this workout. Just trying to get through it. Push it hard. They did a lot. Few workouts. Some of my biceps are being neglected. Just finished this shit off-struck. It's late. I'm tired. Ready for bed. What? I mean barely, but feel it. All right. Yeah. But I'm going to come up soon. Where are you right now? You're going to head in the bathroom right here. All right. So we wrapped that up pretty half as a workout. But I honestly felt it marms a little bit and how hard I've been pushing. It's all I really need. I'm not trying to like fatigue and beat up my muscle right now so that they get hurt. I can't get pumped without too sore. So my mean being tired, it gets helped out. Turned out your shit iron was there. Had to even know they were going to be here. They felt some clips too. If you saw them in the background, another camera. But that was. But the wrap on today, Wednesday tomorrow's the big busy day of running around a whole bunch and making me tired. And it's automatic. They made weight. I get to eat some food. It's beautiful. It's really fucking lit right now. So I'm going to shower, eat, and get my ass to bed. Because I am tired as fuck and I know Calvin is too. So peace out. Thank you for watching and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
