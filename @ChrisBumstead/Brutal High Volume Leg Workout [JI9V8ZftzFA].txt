Depends on how you can be nice. What's up YouTube? We're so here in Arizona, back with Mr. Justin King. Yeah, we're at his gym here and build better. So I'm in the middle of a business like it was training legs. And I was trying not to be a little skinny business today. And out there, let's do legs. I need it. And he's like, all right, we're doing a two day. I think the fuck I don't do two days. And he's like, all right, just lift him up. So what end is when you guys are doing it? And he is a two-day ball for them legs to clarify better. Yeah, they're both legs, of course. So in the morning, he's doing more of a neural type of training. So we're looking at knock-off the high threshold motor units in like grow terms. It's like, those are the fast twitch fibers. That's like one set of fibers that you want to fatigue. We're doing all of that in the morning. And then from there, that potential hits the work that we're going to do in the evening. So when we come back, it's four to six hours later. His nervous system is going to decline. Then he's going to jump four to six hours later. And then we change and then we go to more of a metabolic type of stimulus. So morning, we're going to jump into the heel elevated back squat. He's doing eccentric hooks. So overloading the eccentric, we're getting a lot of a neural stimulus, more of a strength type of side. Once we go back, PM it is just balls for the wall like burn, lactic acid like it is much of a metabolic adaptation as fast as possible. So great. This makes it to where what we do in the evening is going to hit even harder. Yeah. So it's actually more beneficial to do. Exactly. All in the same day. No, it is. It is. Yeah. If you if you play it that way, you again, you're able to lift heavier weight in the evening. The load creates more tension, more tension, more damage, more damage, more high-perature. If you're a company, so it would you do this for multiple days in the week or this like a, no, you definitely should live once in a week or you would do it. No, you can't. I like. Yeah, on one end of the extreme, you could let's say you're trying to specialize with your legs. You could do it two a day for legs. Everything else is one a day. On the other end of the extreme, you could do something that's like, there's a protocol that's called like a squat holiday. A holiday coming from like different country, but to where you do like 13 workouts in the span of three days. And like you just blast it, right? Or you're doing three a day workouts for two weeks and it's a chest and back, a legs and arms and shoulders and you space that are probably so it's all, it's all how you want to, how you want to set it up. But that's to be productly periodized. 100% left for three months to be fucked. Yeah, no, no one should just jump into this. There should definitely be like a method to. But it's a really, really good and underutilized tool for bodybuilders, especially, that can be utilized. The both hyperature is 100%. Then you can get huge gains from this. Here's gains. Okay, absolutely. That's all I need it. So yeah. Yeah. Alright, like that is two workouts a day. Get after it. Sweet. Okay. You go down. 8665.431. That box off and then you come up and you just below the top of it. Just take your time in the body. These are set for an anticipated bite that they should be at. Then you get to the bottom and it's like, oh shit, we should have had some more room on it. Yeah. Let's pop them off. Alright. So 8 seconds? 8 seconds. Okay. Take your time walking out. Okay. 87765. 433. Oh yeah. Get right. That's going to be the feel of it. But then after that 8 second, you'll do three more reps at a three zero extra. Okay. Yeah. 87765. 432. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1. You're ready for this. How often would you have someone do this like two or three a day workout? If it was in a program and you do it every day for that body part? So, again, everything is like, you're asking for an RPs. It depends on what's called for in the RPs. It depends on like, time is in time to find your talent. For you, if it obviously, this is your job. So for you, it's like a picture. I have 12 weeks to get like the craziest games that I can in this, this, this, this, this. Maybe periodized very specifically. It's all like it's dependent on what? Okay. Try steps with the last. 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, up. Take your time to the top. Best side. It's like this, I'll keep it. That one, that. 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1. That's good, quives.

So the way the overcoming ISO system works, is I'm going to be standing here holding this and you're pushing into it. It's going to be in the mid position. So, like, as a practice of you're to do it on this, go up to mid position. And then you're going to push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, and I'll hold it. And then, go the other side. Five, four, three, two, one, up. That's six five four. Five four three. Four three. Three two. One up. One up. One up. One down. Two. Two. Two. Two. That's good. Eight, seven, six, five. You'll go all the way down after this three, two, one down. Two. Two. Two. Two. Three. Four. Five. Five. Again. Five. Two. Seven. Five. Two. Seven. Five. Five. Two. Five. Five. Nine. Two. Four. Four. One. Five. Four, one. Five. Five. Four. Five. Four. .. come here I'll save you How many? shah lose This is the first amount of volume that you can do to consider the type of set. So this is like a intro to the change. That being said, three sets is like the minimum that we use. Right up to me, pushing for five. Ready to go five, four, three, come on, come on, come on. Down. Stretch. Go. Two. One, go. Control.

Alright, so we wrapped up the second leg of this leg day and survived. It was nice. It was good. It's good. So good, my legs were crumbing a little bit at the end of that, but it's an interesting technique here. I don't hate it. It could be a big Saturday Sunday kind of thing. Sunday, double leg day, so something to try out, but obviously with a method to the madness. So we're going to chill, go get some food, I guess. Go get some sushi. You told me you had to eat a fucking food, so we're going to eat a fucking food. Do you want that? Do you want that? Do you want that? Do you want that? Yes. I hope I'll be like next time. I'll just like next time.
