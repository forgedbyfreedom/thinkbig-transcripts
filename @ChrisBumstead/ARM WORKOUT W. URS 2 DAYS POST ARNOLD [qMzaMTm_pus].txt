We're going to train with the second place Arnold Classic competitor Mr. Err's Cala Chiminski. I don't know what to say last name. But we're going to train with the skinny bear. The skinny bitch bear. And I'm also sampling you flavor already of energy. Like really mean. It's fucking delicious. So I enjoyed this. We get some caffeine. Our hotel room in a water pretty miserable. But it is what it is. We're going to jump meters and try not to be skinny. Because we both are small and we're just. So I'm in there. Just kidding. Subscribe. Good job. Good job. Turn it at that. You want to know what's right? Maybe I should. Definitely should. Maybe you would have won the Arnold if you were taking a step. I don't know what I'm going to do. That's what's up. On day here. We're by water for a bit. No, no. I finished it. That's fine. We each max one of my credits. That's what's up. Bruh. Very cute. Come on. Come on. You're mommy here. Oh. Let's stop. I'm not ready. I'm just pushing off season. No, yeah. I literally bit like. Nah, yeah. Nah, yeah. I don't know. Nah, I don't know.

So, he tries to surprise. He tries to surprise. I'm sure he's doing me a good job. Yeah, Arnold weekend. He's told me something about water. It's not working at the hotel and I said like, Bro, we have a job to eat done. I'm need to grow. My ones need to get way bigger. It's like, too. We both have to get the army so we're feeling about the future. And then we said, like, okay, fuck, we need to do this. We need to get the job done. We'll line up on some terms of my LBNB. So, a lot of work. But this guy every weekend, you're on the road since four weeks every time. I'm not going to start. But he's like, yeah. Fuck. For like, a real champ. Living out of the, like, a good, a good last thing. It's for him. No, very, very fresh. So that's good. Honestly, I'm done with this shitty food. Yeah. It just did like, and yeah, if I don't mean hell, I'm shitty. Yeah, I did a healthy good amount of potatoes and chicken and that's it. So I enjoyed it. Because your appetite is, it's not that high and I just put poison in me. Yeah. And then, yeah, I want to get back to the basics and don't eat jackfruit. All the camera guys eating this shit. Clay's throwing that guy over here. Yeah. I'm just saying, I haven't actually got better. He's playing better. No more Ben Jerry's at 3am. Yeah. We're cutting that out. The whole week was like this. So yeah, no one done with this. You inspired me with this at 2. With the healthy life. The organic shit. But actually it's covered in coat. I noticed it from before. She gets all the grass through her. She's alive. He sent me a picture of the geowoo reiner to water and shows that works. He's like, that's okay. That's what this is for. He sent me a bottle of axe spray. This is no. That's not high school. Today, no, I have a pressing. So what if names are black? Yeah. What if you're something like that? One plate. What do you think about diamonds? Who about it? I was the event for you. Yeah. And you really asked me some secret. I like the old deal for all of that? Yeah, it's good. It's true. It's honestly nice to me to do what I meet people that have organized like a few hours. Yeah. So it's like in hell. And I'm not like brain dead by the end. Where sometimes we do like eight hours events and it's not tough for eight hours. Yeah, you can do it in the same amount of shit right now. Yeah. That's very good. Good. But we have one question in Germany. When it's for Seabound, come into two Germany. The Seabound? Yeah. Tell me, you got to bring the answer, yeah. And it might each year home. Oh, I don't know. I only have a tour tour room to park and walk. I don't know. I can sleep on the couch when I like this. Do you have a roommate? Yeah, my girlfriend. Is she here for the adventure? No. Yeah, there. Because it was a little tricky. Yeah. Because it was a tricky version. I was in the couch for a long time. And then take my notes. Yeah, you remember, well, yeah. I think everything can tell you remember. I'm not a fan of this. No. People are sick of it. Yeah, they're sick of it. They're tired. They're sick of it. Because it's not something else. Like what? Put the cloth on. I don't think it's a cloth song. I'm so tired. Actually, my attending spread of this song. My attending game is on point. A little splot, too. Definitely dug it with me, though. The best thing after the show is to pump two warm upsets and I'm feeling like we didn't going to set the pressure. Oh, I'm not strong at all but the pump is good. It's strength, strength, strength, and everything. I don't know, I can do that. You had no idea. What did you do after the interview? If you go to the show grab again. I went one week through Dubai and enjoyed life and then I kicked it off again, geez. Yeah, that's what I can imagine. Just to share the rest super, super weird this year. And then I write how I have the recovery of pace going on. And then I'm so upset. Time to do this again, boy. The machine in the back is pretty good. The machine? Yeah, it's fine.
