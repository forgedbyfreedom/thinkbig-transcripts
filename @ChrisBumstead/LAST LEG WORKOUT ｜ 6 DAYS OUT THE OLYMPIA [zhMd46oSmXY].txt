Part of the people, the heartburn, the gas, the consultation. It was the game. We'll make sure not to spit it tonight. We're gonna double tea bag you. No. No. I'm not eating. I've been stunned on teas. It stopped on. Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on. Come on. We come on. Let me in. Come on. Come on. Help me, sir! That's why we got to make sure the water is really high right now. Because that helps with moving. That big, big, big, big, big water. You know that, that's what's interesting. The water and then getting you the digestive enzymes and then getting you something is going to help with a little bit of that amazing question. We'll be doing this. Well, maybe also if you drink that caffeine, that back in the act of the stimulant to help too. What is up, YouTube Saturday? 70s out. Peak because we got him. It's game time and guess who joined us. Game time. The sir. Honey himself is an entown. And we are about to hit the final leg day of the 20-20 to a limpia prep series. So welcome aboard. It's going to be a good one. Do you have full legs? Everything we can kind of hit, caps, the hamstring quad. Maybe my life liked it the entire year. Could I hit it myself, trading like the first one? Maybe you will see probably not. But yeah. So... Okay, right. Thank you. No comment. We'll see that comment for a while. We'll see if it's a lot of the show that we drew us out on. But yeah, I mean, I got some energy right now. So we're going to try and get the fuck out of here. It's a gym. It's a nice dead yesterday. So we're hoping it's like that again today. You know, crush this final leg workout after this we're cruising through the week. So it got some weight to drop. So it's depleting so I'll push in. But, you know, it's very rocked peak week. So let's do it. The shower. You like it? The whole kitchen. Yeah. What is nice having real cold water? Are you in the detonate? We're going to make a stand. Okay? Yeah? And then I'll show you a set of my two sides. Choose a Wednesday. Fuckin' out for a guy outside. Saturday, bro. This is a video for a week already. We never hear this early. I've been going by pretty slow. But this is also like the longest you've been going by for a day. It's been going slowly. One day. I think I haven't been that long. I can't do it. I can't do it. I dropped my water. Oh, I just built ghost all of a sudden. I didn't want to cold it. I still need to hold it. That's all still heavy. Thanks. Well, they didn't get it today. Well, I had my revive like kidneys. In one hand, there's a lot of kitten. And I went to open up another one with it in my hand. And I did this and I just dumped like 400 pills on the ground. I was like, I just threw it up in through my mouth. Fuck it. I just bought a cane. I just wanted to get it. Yeah, it's rolling when it down and fucking go dude. Okay. I can't have the dynamic blooded spinal cord. Everyone's just kind of like, just rolling when it's down. Can you Kevin, can you please? Okay. It was like after you ate it. It's fermented. I'm telling you, I'm telling you. Let's see if guys, I don't sleep next to him. I sleep over the blanket. I was suffering blanket. It's just like, you know. What do you mean it's always before the gym? It gets so worse. I'm telling you, fish before the gym is not the milk. Yes, he's asking. Construction. I just kept doing it with the camera. I love everybody. I'm very grateful. Well, I'm in the middle of the workout. One week after my final leg day, I love you even more. If you wait until I work out to ask me the questions. Finally, what's the plan for today's workout? Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to get blood in his quads, hamstrings, calves. We don't want us to throw in a mileyess body, but we want to be able to continue to keep that fullness in that way. It's as much as possible. But the reason why you don't go 100% is just to throw in, is because you've got to make sure they're nice and dry by the way. So it's about 80% and it's just a matter of just keeping that volume in the station and all the muscles in the lower body. You know, the carbs in the my leg, you know? I like carbs. You make a carb up with nothing but a inhale burger and diet-tapsy because diet-tapsy will make sure you let's go. Okay. You can see the cost of the elevator. Did that run up? Yeah, I remember you only had your lunch. They have a bacon, peanut butter, hamburger. I think they need the carb up here. Have you ever had peanut butter in your dinner? No, it's not that. So it's a major. It's a famous place called the Working Out in Canada. It's like 200 burgers and they have one-celled skater boy. It's like peanut butter for Dama, burger. Yeah. I've never had peanut butter in banana, but I've had peanut butter at slators down in certain calfrey. And they made peanut butter burger with this jelly. That's like a marmalade jam. Yeah. It's so good. They also have a bacon jelly peanut butter one. Oh, that's fucking good. I really want. Fucking a huge chest. So good. I'm ready. Let me touch you on here. Yeah, you want more? He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. There it is. Good. Good. Hey, turn your tongue over. That way. Get your child. There you go. There you go. Go. Go. Go. Good. Nice. Very good. So nice. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You're going. 14. Yeah. It's a little different. Hold on. Just so... You're pretty sure we're good. Where are you just like... Well, I switched on. Just a speaker to the final leg workout. I'm gonna have a chance, Camer. Can you get out of the stairs? I don't know. Too late for them to implement it now. But next you will have new tickets. Okay. I'm going to do it. One more, one more. Go. All the way. Slow. Good job. One more. Just go away. One more set. Come on. Two more. Good. Hold on. Hold on right there. Good. You're going to keep closer together. We're just going to do like... You get 12 to 15 reps. You just... Really get... Like... You're going to flex there. All right. All right. What we're going to do is we're going to focus on being able to just get some reps in some quality reps. We're going to keep this feet a little closer together. And go with it and just really finish up those hamstrings. Get that really good contraction. Let's keep it moving. Keep it moving. There you go. Good. Good contraction. Good. Good. Go. Two more. Good. One more. Good. Good. Good. Good. Press. Just go away. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. You see that jump? No. It's good. It's good. Good. Yeah. I feel like I'm going to do it. There you go. One more. The building is the room. One last pleasure of the world. Sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have a carpet anymore. It's going. Damn. What's the coffee? The sad cardio session. You know, something anymore last year. You know, it'd be like dogmas to the parking dog and brother. I can't get up at 3am and I'm running 50 miles. That way. What? I'm going to get under 240. How happy is that you are for the food on three places. It's just so weird right now. Because the first two routes feel like really light, but then I'm just so tired. I feel like I could. I would just go to the room on this. And then you'll see where that goes. Because I think you can probably get what you want to 50 on this. It's weird to like, it probably get like, eat the 10 on this. 5 place empty plate. But as soon as I hit like eat, I'm like, oh, like a plug-to. But if you want me to hit 12, then you probably get it. Just push it a little bit more with some more laps. It's ringing the people a little bit. So, that was all the time. So, I'm going to go to the bathroom. So, I'm going to go to the bathroom. So, I'm going to go to the bathroom. So, I'm going to go to the bathroom. So, I'm going to go to the bathroom. Go. Yes. It's so easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy to take any bed of 13 beds into a bed of 11 Yes. Yeah, there's probably the best I think for me In any breath like normally it was not be able to move that way now. I'm in your left I have no problem. I'd be fucking like like I'm used to my muscles or a limb and also the fuller. I'm lean it. It's just like there Is well like what two two three we talk you have nothing else What But anyway, Paul is there Where are the lutes back? What? Where are the lutes back? It was turning into one of those susboys. Not on me. I was thinking of the other nudge. You get more of these. I saw them in a title to the video. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Push. Good. Good. Good. Good. You can move it. You can't wait a little bit. Good. Good. Keep it moving. Last set on this. Come on. Move it. Three more. One. Two. Go on. And drive it. Good. Excellent. Good. Good. Good. This one. You're looking for a minor champion for a title. That's a really different. Yeah. And more. Mm. Come on. Let's get this working set here. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on. Good. Smart. Ready to go? Go up! Watch out! Go up! How's that way? Light? Turn it until I hit five breaths. I see it has it feel to take a couple of months off our lifespan in the car. Feel pretty damn good. I know, it's what I say. I hope you enjoyed it. I would say it's good. Do you know? What two months up on the lifespan for you? Because you just are feeling a gas. It's my muster gas. This is the ship you were going on. The heart part of the people. The heartburn, the gas, the consultation. It's the game. We'll make sure not to spit it tonight. We're going to double tea bag you. No. What do you think about it? I bet it's done. I don't even know what the heavy size is. It's a sexual one. We need to drop your balls on someone's face. I don't want any of that. You're wrong. Get away.

We'll shorter than him. Not quite done. How do you keep growing that shit in about a week? Yeah. Did you ever see him when it was really long? It was pretty, uh. And then he bleached it once. And then it made it look like Hoco in. Yeah. He's got a kept that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good job. Yeah. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Good. Good. Good job.

You're done. You're done. You guys all get the moves. Those guys are on. You got the baby. That's really bad. You got the baby. That's what I'm talking about. You got the baby. That's what I'm talking about. That's the medium. Good. Good. Feeling up. Feeling up, eating. Just a bit. Your face is like vinegar. You're not. You know, a fancy, like you. You know nothing. She's a dreaded lettuce. No shred of lettuce. Not even loaded. Just a little bit of this berry. This, this, this, this, this, this white fish. You know what's going on? You got your barbecue buffet. Yeah. You're doing last week. That's one. We're doing the first belt. Very fun. You remember? You feel a pressure of 130? Yeah. You're hit for a little more. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Okay. That's probably your own camera. I'm gonna see it. Yeah. This Mr. Dr. Marlin, the GOAT best RMT. Cairo I've ever seen. I can say that with pride. I've seen him twice since been Vegas twice last week. I haven't seen him once or twice the week. This prep and it's been helping me so much open out my clots. Flutes everything. He just like knows the body so perfectly. And he's not afraid to hurt you. Luckily I've been doing it for a while. So we opened up a lot of the shit. Yeah. I'm not afraid to hurt you. And he knows how to beat me up too bad. No, I'm glad we did that work beforehand because I don't know how it would have gone. It wouldn't have been a little too rough. I'm going to run for it now. That's why you gotta keep up with the body. You gotta take care of your body. It's so crucial last year I didn't do this. When I felt it in my body, I saw it on stage. So I'm doing it all this year taking care of everything I can. Trying to cheap my body rate. He's helping me do it also. Not perfect. We get it on my soul. So let's see here. You want to do hamstrings first or you want to go and do hamstrings first. Or you want to go into the quads and inside. Where do you feel during your leg workout? I think so. All right. We'll hit one. I have to change the calvone. You get the lot of your ass to put it on. Okay. You're still. Yeah, because the quads will be nice. With that, we'll get you face up here. Let me just get, sorry, if I play a little music. It's kind of like the vibe of things. Yeah. Yeah. Over so if you focus anymore in those upper quads, so we're just going to lather down. I like to use a shade butter. No essential oils or anything wild into it. They've got a tanner that's going on. And you don't want anything to irritate the skin with that tanner. So plus it's just moisturizing and it's good. And it glides. It gives you enough grip. Because sometimes some oils are too slippery. And I don't, I don't like that. Just go ahead and give me a little flex. Let's see what we got. Just nasty. Let's just sick. So yeah, what we're going to go do more. We want to focus and start to open up this line here. Because you can kind of see there's a little connection and then up through the top. And then that's going to be sort of a mangle. We'll act it there. Yeah, we have them pressed down that heel. Does this process called reciprocal inhibition. Pretty much you turn those hamstrings on and it'll turn off the quads just for a little bit. And it'll be enough for it to let go. And I just check in with it's face because. You know, he's read my face with it. Get to the bad part. Yeah, because if it's, uh, he's got to click that. Just try to think. If it, uh, you can just soak up a lot of heat. Put 600 pounds on his back for fun. So a little bit of me. You put. And the puss. So we're opening up these upper quads. His lower quads, they contract really nicely. Go ahead and flex. There we are. So we're starting to open up that channel through here. And that's what he's been wanting to focus on is these upper quads to fire when he's posing. You get the deep, like, cuts up into your hip. I've missing that last year. Now we're going to change it up. So that was just kind of a deep dig. Now we just kind of change up the technique to more of a spreading. Doesn't look too much, but I know he can feel its openings like open in his Ziploc bag. And press that heel down. Flex. Here we go. Starting to get that open. How's it feeling up top? Good. So what we'll do here, bend this knee. There you go. Let it fall out. We're going to follow this our tourties up. And the sarturious and, like, all the other adductors, they are pretty sensitive, especially when we get to the top, they feel like fire. And the second here, we're going to see those veins open up. You can start those veins sort to really pop out. And that's what we're looking for. So open up those adductors to allow that to really flow through. And I mean, he's not even on any sort of, he's a very hard load right yet. I'm really can only imagine what this is all going to start to look like. Real food. Yeah. Lossium. And I can't really imagine. So we're going to have a roll this leg in. What we'll do is kind of. Nice breath in. And you guys can't feel what I'm feeling, but there's, because, like, little rice Krispies. Next, what I call them at the least. And those are little micro adhesions of the fascia. And as they start to cut weight, it's really between the muscle and the skin. And that's what we're trying to have it let go. So that the skin doesn't have that rigid look. It's just look like a layer of wet clothes over the top. I shouldn't even be seeing it better. See, here we'll just test that out. Give me a flux. There they go. Really nice clean. Let's get that. I need you to have a let's go. Oh, flux. So I'm going to go ahead and go approach this sort of little straight line. That's going on in there. I'll just go to feel it in a little part. One of the beauty with these athletes is you can see the adhesions on most people. There's usually a 10, 15% body fat that will cover that more. So these guys, you can just really see it. Flex. Here we go. Starting to loosen up, relax it. Just twitching. Flex. Here we go. And now it's starting to let go. Perfect. Let that side relax for a second. So Chris, everyone probably knows how to injury to this quad, right? What are one? Minor. So it looks just a little bit different. But we've been working on it and we've actually been noticing some fairly good progress. Let's get it shiny. We have flex. So we want to get up into this ridge line. Get up into that upper quad again. Nice and easy. Bend that knee. Just head of fall. And now slowly straighten that leg out. Sometimes I get a lot of people who ask me like, is it exhausting to work on these big guys? And you really be surprised. It's actually pretty, find it a little bit easier because their muscle belly is so big. That you can use your full hand contacts. You can use good knuckles. And you're just leaning on them. You don't want to push too hard. That's too exhausting. Just all about leverage. I keep my tables low so I can lean. Some massage therapists and facial workers. They'll keep their table too high. And they're just using too much shoulders. Here I can just really lean into it. Some of it's effortless. And I let their body do all the work. Good straight in that leg. Flex for me. Sounds good through that channel now. Try to straighten that just a little. There you are. You said that does. It's just insane the versatility. It starts really filling. Go ahead flex. Yeah. Now we're getting those straight. You shouldn't have to come out. So let's follow the certatories here. These are as long lines. Not everyone's looking for. I think once you see a good sartoria song somebody. That's when you know they've gotten to there. One more flex. So yeah. We're getting those separations up here. Now it's that TFL. We're in a lighting in this room. We'll have Flex it. There we are. Hi guys. Let's get me wrap on today's video. Like the no more leg things. No more leg did till the prep is over. So it's all done. And this is a new thing I did for the first time. Was it last Tuesday or something where you told me he's like no it's actually good to train legs and then you get a leg massage immediately after. And it feels so it feels so good. The next day if you're more recovered the blood's moving blood's flowing and like everything moving the way you want it to not tight bound up and beat up. Especially right now because we can help remove all the inflammation and everything through me get those deep cuts that we're working on. So super grateful for that. Take care of your day and body. Very important. If you're in Florida, Dr. Miles of the man to do it. So. You're going to say that about people on the road through. So. But this is going to be our one-day video.
