I know I have someone. The only one I got was one. I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I got a... I... I... I'm... I... I... What? What's up YouTube? Welcome to the final leg day. Twenty twenty three minutes to our lunch meal prep. The last time we're doing leg. I might use a vlog session throughout the week. The party thinks my legs look small and flat. I'm carbon-oppersum, but this is probably it realistically. So... I'm gonna enjoy it. Feel pretty good today. So, I thought it was a beautiful thing when you were one week getting off the Outlook deck. The better my workouts can be right now. The better I'm gonna look on stage. The more full of my muscles can stay rather just flattening out. We can get tired like in your fast. When I'm super depleted. So... Yeah, just kind of... soaking in the day. Enjoying the final leg day. Much of these sucks sometimes when it's last one you're like fuck. They can be fun too. So... We're gonna do the best we can. Nothing crazy. Just trying to really like squeeze the muscle. Get everything out of it. No PRs. No hurting myself. And we leave all the end of tomorrow. So... Fun fun. Okay. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. What's that? Mmm. There it goes. Mmm. I like they're so lean that they actually contract so hard. Fuck it. It hurts so good. Oh my God. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Ah. Yeah. You know that, yeah. Yeah. Mmm. Yeah. Mmm. Mmm. Alright, move it on to my favorite machine this prep for whatever reason. The squat press just feels fucking amazing. Old side of the machine. So we're sick with what works. No freeweight shit. This is the first year where I like built my foundation. Do squats that I was like, I'm gonna protect my knees. I'm gonna protect my spine. Do a little safer. Everything heavy on machines. And it's honestly felt really good. This is one of those things where it's due as I. Done not as I'm doing. But I built my physique doing what I did. So you have a different way you need to build. And then when you're at a point where I'm not trying to put on 10 pounds of muscle of years kind of more fine tuning what I already have. So I'm not hurting myself since I was doing squats. Do more machines. So not saying what you do when you start. For you got to learn your body. And I know I've been feeling a lot better. I've got that in my joints. Everything of best they felt in a prep ever. So take what you will from that. I'm still felt pretty strong on that. Less it. The machine maxed out at 11 plates. Now I was doing 11 plates for like, I think 18 was the most I've gotten. I still felt pretty strong in there. But you feel different when I'm like my weight drop. I'm this lean and I'm this dry. You're going to feel a little achy and you're using muscle. They're just like they're kind of like picture like you're hugging your grandma and you're just like gentle. That's like my knees. So didn't want to push it. The 12 reps could have done a little bit more. But like I said before, my head and the PR dropped the weight. Bit more volume. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. Move on. They're lighter, one higher than I thought. This is one of the greatest machines that we've ever made for your lower back. All right, so, belts quite. Another fucking favorite machine in my in this prep. I'm going to have to do some lighter. Close grip. Trying to keep my feet really underneath me. Really focus on a lot of the quad. I'm going to upper quad in here. Squeezing through there the whole way. Everything I've been doing right now has been a little bit wider. I'm going to have to be able to do some more. So we're going to final press movement here. This machine makes some bodyweight lunches. I have volume flush the blood to the quads. And then I got six days. Let them recover and relax. Hopefully look at on stage. Woo! Yeah. I couldn't even explain that. I could just tell there was no contraction energy left. Just like nope. I lost for words. But you're finished. You have these workouts. These squattings in your machine. Fucking great squattings. It's really late. But it squeezes the piss of your quads. And bodyweight lunches. And at this point, the workout, the bodyweight lunches. I feel like I have a hundred pounds on my back. I have to worry. Just a shot of the blood into the muscle. I don't know what else I'm going to say. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.
