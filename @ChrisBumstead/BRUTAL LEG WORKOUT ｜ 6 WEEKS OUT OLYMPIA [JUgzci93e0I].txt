What is up YouTube? Welcome back to a yeol prep series underway. Going to be our first workout we're filming. Start it off with a bag, hit up some legs today. This fucking gym has been my savior lately. It's just so nice coming in here in this like tank doom of solitude and beautiful equipment of everything I want. I want so again a lot of appreciation for pure muscle and hook in this all out for me to be able to train like this a lot of fun. But like they're right now finally getting back into the groove of things and I'm feeling a lot better day by day. It's definitely so now under seven weeks out. So it's fucking game time. I'm lucky to have a no more bullshit. Some of the prioritized bodybuilding not let all the other bullshit get in my way. This is what's most important should have always been but it's on track now. So we're going to try and fuck up some like today. Quad dominant like Dave. Do some of the full new machine. We just got this swing squatting without fully finishing set up. I don't know if I can use it or not. Maybe I'll give it a shot but you guys know what it is. Fucking lots of water because of the hottest shit today. And hopefully we don't pass out on this like day. I like workouts lately of consisted of a little bit different shit. I've been cutting out heavy hacks. Really starting with really heavy squats because my knee is just taking it cold. And it wasn't hitting the part of my quads that I needed to anymore because I was giving tighter and tighter. And my body was naturally working around injuries. So so warming up with these knee extensions. Not that you have to either the best thing for muscle growth. But they do help my knees personally. So I do with that. And if we got a bunch of really cool machine dough there, I'm going to go over there. Hit him up. Gonna love it more volume right now rather than like 68 reps. Trying to get a few sets over around 12 at least on the leg press or something. And then a bit of a more heavier compliment. But just trying to keep my strength high. I'll even get some size and fucking bust out these leg days in this 90 degree humid Florida weather. Really makes you sweat. Beautiful. These were the 5G I might have to feel bad about throwing the weights on the floor. No. What? What? I don't know. We'll put that in our pantry, though. You probably won't be getting that much right. Alright, first compound movement. Doing this squat press, side backs squat press. We've got a side backs regular linear squat and squat press. This one really feels good for me to go high and wide. And I can do more of like a two-most squat type thing. Where I can hit a little bit more of my upper quad of doctor is getting hit. Where that's something has been really hard for me. Like I've seen on some of the squats I've gotten so tight. That I just started to get all like inner quad. It's hard for me to open up and feel like a wider squat position. So, I think I'll back to my roots on a good ol' leg press. I've been having that good machines everywhere I go that I haven't been using like press. Or prioritizing it. And it's how I built my legs when they were huge squats and like press. Squats aren't doing it so we're going back to leg press and we'll do some other shit. But just warm it up. Make sure my groin everything's open and then trim some decent weight on. Go for like 12 to 15 reps. Oh fuck. Like press pyrrish like a Thai school. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. I got like 15 with some kind of recorder at the end. No knee pain so God bless that fucking home yet my head. You work out they're going to be sponsored by raw hydration. It's hot in here. I've got to get 30 reps however many it takes to pick off 2 plates at a time. Hopefully I can do it in 2. Then I'm maximum 3. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. You're hard to do that. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. I'm going to move on. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
