Come on, just! Driving! Driving! Driving! Come on, come on! Come on, Chris! Come on, two more! Come on, let's go! Let's go! Alright guys, so before the video starts, I wanted to get in the light Friday week, so bear with me while this is like going down, but it's 4-year-old benefit because there's no way to time to shop then right now. And Raw is having a buy one, get one, 50% off on the website with a few tiers of getting some free stuff and we're giving away some good shit. So at $100, we've been $100 to get a free garbage of a mystery flavor, so we're going to pick up flavor randomly off the shelf and throw it in your bin and you've been spending $100 and then we've spent over $200, you get a garbage, as I said, and then you also get a bag, a funnel, a shaker, that it, and the whole website, buy one, get one, 50% off. Last of me to sell, we didn't have that for a giant sale, not for averages on sale and we're even one away because we love you guys, Black Friday. What we do, and the celebration of giving and you want to be a beautiful life in our appreciation to you guys. That's a type of shop. Anyways, getrunutrition.com, use code. It's, it's their different codes. Yeah. Calv is going to flash big. Right here. What my code is, I think it's different for Black Friday, but this code and this code only gets you the deal, so be sure to use whatever code Calv is putting on the screen over my face or wherever you're putting it. And there's any proof. You have a dragon fruit, that average just fucking tastes really good. So I recommend buying the dragon fruit average, and then if you get a fruit, you want to probably want to be dragon fruit. I don't think we're putting that in the bundle of mystery ones. You get for free, so by that one, you'll have another one for free. It tastes really good. It's like a fresh sweet, different, different, different, it's pink, it's good. Amazing. A rocket pop or a parrot tree. So, inflavors and good sales. Now let's get on with the video. What's up, good deal. That doesn't get any better than that. Chester, you do it. All right, so we're back here at Appalachian Recombe, beauty gym with Anna, but for sure, hopefully we don't get harassed these times. I mean, how do you get some chess? We got beat up at a massage earlier, so I know he's tired, I'm tired, but it's time to wake our ass up, get to work out in, where we set only to the left, and chest-day, so it's got to be a good day. So, ready to kill it. It's good. It's good, but not super stupid, and let's just go. Then we can get high to work at his pace, and then I feel like we can get really good chess work out. And then from there, we'll decide if we want to do treasure, we'll do maybe arms tomorrow. Or we can decide from there, but I feel like all machines and myth maybe, but nothing the free way. We can do that all the way through, but we can do pre-weighting religious duties and dumbbell wise or something like that, but we have some really good machines too, so let's just kind of go from there. Good. Good. Look at this. FST7, I know what. Yeah, we're going to do some FST7, so we're going to do some really good, blood flow, my muscle connection, and we might even do some FST7 super satsin. So we're going to get a really three dimensional call, that's how fucking killing. So get some juicy, petty. Yeah, that's a good one. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good work in that, put me.

But came back, had a meal, had to do some more cardio, did that, and now meeting my last meal, and Calvin, honey, and honey, it all my salmon. It was not mine, but it was the collective salmon. And so I was left with like a measly 80 grams of salmon, so I had to combine it with steak, and some broccoli, but a little circumter, can't complain. So it tasted amazing. So I put this down at the bed. Yeah, you don't want to be here on my sand back there. Boohoo for me, you got a sand, and I didn't. So he got like 400 grams of sand and dude. He's not a cool man.
