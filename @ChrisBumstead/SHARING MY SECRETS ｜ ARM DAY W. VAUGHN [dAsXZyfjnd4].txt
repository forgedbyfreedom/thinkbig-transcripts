Armday was just getting a little bit and fun. I said and fun. I said and yeah, it's so quick to react to your life, everybody. I said this getting a little bit and fun. I'm gonna say that's like two rows in that line in a minute. What is up? You're welcome to Armday with Seabun. Seabun. Seabun. Seabun. Beech ring. Bahn. Walker. A case. Getting a little bitch. I can only say that because I'm a skinny little bitch. But anyways, we have a fun little thing that I'm gonna share with you guys finally after a lot of work. A lot of hiccups. I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you what went wrong with it yet. So I'll tell you that maybe that story to later time. But you guys want to hear about the insights and outs of my perhaps and all the secrets and everything. So we compiled all of them into this beautiful bottle of pre-workout. I think you fucked up before the gym. This is gonna be what's getting me through prep this year. Give me to my work and I thought, I just lay down and fell asleep and on the fuck I'm tired. And we moved, we removed our office and we just grabbed my couch, I'm rug and some chair and shit and I was like, be tired. I'm a cool little bitch. So today we're gonna be putting Christmas secrets stuff, Come on, we'll all together and of course, six and two scoops. As all pre-workouts are meant to be taken. And obviously, after you take this, you just only have a little bit samples. But this is something I think we've had this in the books for four months. Mainly able to have to change it. Like I said, I don't know if I'm not telling you why we had to change the yet, but it looks beautiful now. It is like a soft little touch, little chalkboard. And we got some like hidden little messages in there. That you'll have to read if you get it. But it takes a lot of shit so it takes just like winning. It's your favorite one. It's so hard for me to everyone though with a quarter of your favorite flavor. And when we checked this every day, we see how many new ones all the time. So my favorite one's usually always the newest one. But three peaked came back, but this better than three peaked right now. So, apparently my favorite, but like I said, if I take this for the next eight weeks, I probably want something new. And it's very limited edition. This is not ever coming back again. We made one run of this. This is Christopher's secret stuff to winning four hell in a pit. And it will not be coming back ever again. So it's very exclusive. The one run in the weird. Completely done with it. And you won't see it again. And we will not be coming out with the flavor in a different label either. It's just RIP to Christopher's secret stuff. So get it what he can. What is the drop? One day. One day. That's 12. What day is that? What month is it? So October. October says November 2nd. Yeah. November 2nd. Also got a bombaw since mainly for Calvin. Because I can't eat all the meals in it. The monitor's so specific for perhaps. But, I'm curious to eat the whole thing. And the duration. Come, Vulking Ray now. We're getting fucking jacked up. This is how we do it. You took the ice out. What are you doing, man? I melted it. Oh really? Yeah, it was about ice packs in it. It's fine. It's still going to put it in the fridge. There you go. But anyways, we did a big update to the bumbox. Turkey, rice, vegetables, simple thing. But we have a chicken stir fry, which Calvin ate. Everything will want to go. We've got the fucking delicious. And we have bombana, nap muffins in here. Let me just look at some of the ingredients for you guys. Banana, organic, o-flour, maple syrup, walnuts, egg, extra virgin olive oil. I want to know if it's cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, vanilla extract, sea salt. Not make natural ingredients. And they taste delicious. You don't know how much I wish I could have some muslim before the gym. Honey, please give me a muffin. I would love some. hungry and very hungry. But yeah, so there's that. There's the bum bowl, which is the past of meal. But you have to customize it now to what meals you want to be in it. So, however, make it for meals.com. You can use co-team for a little discount and be sure to check it out. But others in that, we got to get some gym because as always, I'm laid as fucking buns. I'm going to be able to cook when you're always laid. Everywhere I go, people will have to cook your own sleep. I ran on my own time in prep. Sorry, I'm sorry. So, that's all we got going on.

To get that last like durefs, that's a little extra squeeze. It's like everything. So we start with preacher, mooner spider curls. I'm saying I like doing this, but he got a crazy pop. He's getting. He's got this getting what? He got a crazy pop and it's hard to curl. It's done. There are too much blood in it. So the spider curl makes your arms hang a little bit. I'm just gonna do this. I'm just gonna do this. I'm just gonna do this. He got a crazy pop and it's hard to curl. It's done. I've just got a little bit of blood in it. So the spider curl makes your arms hang a little farther away from your body. They're below your heart. Before whatever reason, whenever I do these, not a lot of people, you would kind of almost lose a pump. But it's a good contraction. So we're getting a little blood out of the arms. And we have a training part and they can help you squeeze a little bit. It's good. Plus, it's a very different curl motion from the preacher curl here. So we're doing these secondary and then half of this. These are dumbbell curls and then we'll superset it all over the day. There. Fall down. Give this a show. Ooh.
