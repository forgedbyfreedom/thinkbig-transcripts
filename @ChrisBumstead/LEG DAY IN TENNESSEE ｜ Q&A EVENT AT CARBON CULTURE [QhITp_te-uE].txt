Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, pancake, you're a mouth. What? These up YouTube. Welcome to travel vlog for the first time in a while in the last time until the Olympia. We're headed to Nashville, Tennessee, a great opening of one of our friends, Jim. Carbon culture. I'm going to be doing a Q&A and M.M. I'm going to talk a new, I don't know how many people. Like a thousand people are coming. We've got to custom seeking to trip to workout coming and the smash-filled flavor, which is like their natural lemonade or something like that. So I have a sleep, it's currently at like six AM, which I never do in the pitch black and I'm weird. But you can get my pancakes in, we're all packed up, got meals where you go. They've got food ready for me there too. I think I'm going to say get in, try to say I'm prep. That's all that's going on. I've got a E.T. pancakes and get to the airport. So see you guys there. Go to the me back home, play on the board. I found a few cardio six weeks out. Hello, I'm here. You weren't even doing it for a week? Yeah, what do you mean? I don't know, I just wonder if you can wake up and do it in the office. I don't know, maybe. I'm up at like 7.30. Are you? Get my turn on. That shit works. 45 minutes of cardio. You sweat like a pig on it. Yeah, a lot of times I eat, that you look on you in the garage. Oh, yeah, it was a lot of shit. Yeah. Yeah, my next little sore, a little longer than the bed, but don't completely speak of it in the middle of the plane. So, she had a breath, her chin gets inflamed. I'm sure it's all in my plane, but... Those are like boiled with a fly. What? Those are my legs, like this. You're gonna make it real? Yeah, that's true. Those are quick flights, they need to... I'll eat for you, land, but I'm not taking it. We fly pancakes. Oh, we're gonna have to... You're definitely a Kevin, so... I'll try not to get these balls to make it easy. I'm not gonna get these balls to make it easy. What does the national level of fuckers mean? I don't know what it means to know how to do it. You gotta go pee, okay? You know what I think? I do, probably. I can't wait to get my back. It's probably gonna be like six months ago. So, I have to fully film shit everywhere. Tom, so when you get one of these coffee makers for the office, I do. I do a big group. Even at 50-50, if you can have some regular coffee, so I don't have to get too much caffeine in the train. You know what? I'm just kidding. It's on the internet. Yeah, it's a little tired, but... This morning, just get off the boat. Yeah, it's on the boat. Yeah, we did all the class for the class. It's on the boat. It's on the boat. I know. Yeah, I know. It's on the boat. Yeah, I get a line. Yeah, it's on the boat. Yeah, it's the one for kind of carbon-carbon-douper. Good. Let's do a round of tasting before they get this guy shit right there. Yep, yeah. That was it. I think I was trying to take that. Yeah, great. There you go, Tom. What is this? Great, yeah. Fuck yeah. That's good. That's like good. Like good, too. Well, former was it? Yeah. It's like great. See you, B.A. The camera one? Uh, shan, how much did a man's good you have in that? I have a couple. They've had the meal and the dinner right there. Oh, that's the meal. I think it is. I think it is. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, that is. The meat is from the oven. Yeah. Sure. I didn't know that I could taste that there. So, that was good. That was good. Yeah, shit. That's red slush that you all got. Yeah, that's the same one that you've seen a thousand times. Yeah, shit. It's literally the food slush though. He gave me the lowest. I like it. It's like it's good. I don't know. 24 hours. I don't know. That's the same kind of a hydrogen. I mean, pre-extreme is the exact equivalent of that bucked up stuff. Same thing. That's the mood. So, didn't you get that thing? Call it Bumjeece. It was out. It was out. We'll be in every place. We've got an American bottles of what actually could be sold. I told him I wanted to make a Bumjeece flavor per pure. I don't know what it was. I think we could do it. It would go viral for sure. Yeah, maybe I'm like doing exclusive. Yeah, sorry. Was that blue raspberry? B-A. Yes, sir. J-L-Dats. That's your new one. How does it feel? It's good. Hopefully it was it. Red raspberry. Red raspberry. Did you get like the red slush that set? I think that's one. Yeah. Yeah. You like the current, all right? I can't do it. I think that red slush is like a slushy mission. I think so real for real. Yeah. Better like a snow cone. Maybe a snow cone. Blue raspberry has revision 3 ace k to cover that back end. I don't know how to do but. I like it. Okay. Get it. I'm not gonna do that, okay. You covered up the uh. I just don't love the blue raspberry. Did you like bring up the- It's like something else is like a strawberry in the front. Yeah, it's coloring back end, but it's like different from the front. What'd you do? I'm about to flavor just a little more. I think it tastes good. I think it's good after days now, though. Yeah, these are so hard. There. There's so little. This one's. You got over 10 grams of the uh. Me doesn't like that. This is really good. Kind of a little more than one that hydrate. Yeah. Just go kind of other way. Oh, there's not. There's not. There's not. I have the texture of one of these. And put it on the protein. So that one should get it got us. See, view sweet and one of these. Some point. Especially for hydrate. Whatever the best hydrate we have that you think we can do a stevia base hydration. Okay, that's like a little bit off. So can you sugar? Yes, but I don't know. I agree. I don't know what I mean. Is that all it's like, dude? Like, because like, people don't care about water too. Gramps of sugar. Good. Long wind the flavors and then use some stevia too. So it tastes way better. Yeah. Because you don't taste a stevia at all. Just like great candy. Great. What do you want to cut? I get a little more of that. All of these are so refreshing. That's kind of the good thing is that you don't want these too sour. What's that? What's that? What's that last one? There's like a certain amount of potassium. I like that a lot. I think it's like a certain amount of potassium. Yeah. Absolutely. That's all right. How are you? Very good. What's better? What's better? What's better than last time we came here? I never thought. Oh, you never came here. Oh, no. It looks so much better. I did. Yeah. This is the new carbon culture gym. You need to be Nashville Athletic Club. I definitely know what it is called. Something else. Pop of the gym. It's actually just a chain here. It looks completely different. It's actually the front of what you look like. It's completely black. Clean, new equipment now. Looks beautiful. Got this little leg area here. We're here testing it out. I guess you can see it with a grand opening on Saturday. We're going to have to get some more of our credit. Night where everyone's going to come in. Line up along the down-sale power. We're going to sit up here to our little Q&A and all that fun stuff. We're going to try and get a workout in now. Long day, a child, on everything by a tampering day. Fudge that with some ham swings. Fudge squads that we've done. But ham swings may be a little bit of back at the end of the field off to it. And yeah, just get to it because that'll get juicy. And ham swings.
