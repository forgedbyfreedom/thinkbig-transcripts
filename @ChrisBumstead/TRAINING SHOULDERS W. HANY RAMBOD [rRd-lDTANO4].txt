Let me start over. Thank you. Listen to him, don't be. All right. So we're using the Pinole power Smith machine dual system upper. You couldn't come up with a longer name. Basically, it's very similar to a Smith machine. But it's ISO. So you get the benefits of using a machine. But also the freedom of a dumbbell. It's a very similar to a Smith machine. But it's ISO. So you get the benefits of using a machine. But also the freedom of a dumbbell all in one machine. And you can use this as a shoulder press or an incline press. So we're using it as shoulder press and going up to two place, which is a good amount of weight. How's the feel? It's good. Nice that it's converging. So it feels natural. It's very heavy. It feels like free weight. Yeah. So those of you know don't know what converging means. It means that as the dumbbells come together. And that's naturally the range of motion you use. You use dumbbells. But you have the safety of being able to walk in if you end up going further. What is up YouTube? So I had a three videos and finished out of them. So I was on the day three.

No, I said banana cream pie protein. Yeah, yeah. This is so light right now. I'm going to watch. Just warming up. I haven't done a free way of pressing. This is like six weeks.

See positive things. But now. I think we should go a little bit lighter. And then let's go ahead and change up the grip a little bit. I'm using a neutral grip. And from there, go a little deeper. Get a faster delts. Get a nice range of motion. And then we're great. Like an argument like converging just like if we had one of the not-of-process but being that we don't have it we're just going to simulate it here. Give it that a little more. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's two sets with neutral grip. More weight. Probably like 60. Start off with 60 and then it's got to see a few. I think you got time to warm up. Okay, well. So at least. Yeah, same as mine. There you go. Like this. Good. Side lower than one. I don't know if that. Second. Right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Partial. Partial. Partial. That's it. Good job. One of my axis. Good job over here. All right. So what we're doing is we're using the Penata Multi-Flight Machine. It can be used for ladder raises and as well as front raises as well as cable. Almost similarly a cable fly. The great thing about it is it's got this joint center points. You'll see some of the machines now with different manufacturers that are used. The joint center point X. You want to do is the moving point in the joint in your shoulders. We lined up with that. You'll be a little bit higher, a little bit lower. Of course, you're trying to fit right in if you had a pull or a some kind of middle rod that go right through your shoulder. You'd want to be able to hit that point. But if you're somewhat in that vicinity, you're going to have a really good contraction. But if you're too high or too low, the biomechanics are going to be a good. The biomechanics are going to feel off. So always try to line up whenever you can with the center point to can. I'll do it all out. Is that feel better on that? And or do you like to use that hand? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Good. There you go. Squeeze up. Good control. I've got that slow up. Slow up. Again. Up. Good. Slow down. Slow down. Good. One more. Up. Slow down. Follow. Woo. Good. Come on. I'll help you. Slow down. Slow down. Good. So how to wait. Slow, slow, slow, slow. You got it. That is your bum show. Yeah. Good. Good. Good form. Good form. Good. Good pace. Good cadence. Good. Good. Good. Good. The liar. Good with me. Now good. I'll help you. You go slow. That's it. Okay. Now partial touch. Go. Go. Touch. Good job. Woo. So we're getting honey to get angles. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I think I can go. Yeah. T. T. I'm going to say. This is in the whole video series. This one. That's it. You want to get a problem? All right kids, wrap up that workout. We're going to do a little podcast with Mr. Honey Rambad. The truth podcast. I might be up by the time of video up. I have no idea. Do the quick little key on end.

Deluel. There's one. I think that literally, you would do this. You would drink this. Actually, we went through the catch up on like, through this. Oh, that's the one. We said it right in the morning. You only got to go. You only got my back. You said you. Oh, gosh. I want that fucking sword. You think that's the one? Yeah, when I moved to Texas, I'm buying this store. Find the sword. Do you like what? No. Not even getting you a little glossy. You can just, you know, fucking living room wall in our house.

Very important version. That's not a lot of things. I don't know how those versions are. So that makes you perfect. Got those? I don't know how. Why don't I look like such a nerd with a class in life? Any cooler glasses? This is the empty Olympia every year. We've got the target on this back. Put a set of you down range. Meas to it. Wow. This means it's got a frame of a 1911. But it uses 9 mm. So. What's the line? It's ready to get in range. Okay. So keep your finger off the trigger. Okay. Safety is on. Okay. This is on. It does a safety is on right now. It does a safety is off. Safety is on. Okay. We'll always have your finger on. Never have your finger on the trigger. Okay. Which class bring us together. And you're going to shoot a line of one. Two. And keep tight. Almost like your choke in the chicken. You're going to try it? Yes. So you'll first. Okay. So may able to hit that X first, right?

Welcome to Texas. America. Now let's go to the barbecue. Yeah. Oh, because... Alright, so we just shot some pistols. They're fun. I like shooting pistols more than automatic guns. Because it's just like... A little bit more... I don't know what the word is. Scale that you try and get better at. Even though I'm fucking shoot three twice in my life. But I actually do have aspirations of doing some like long range shooting at some point in my life. I'm out by God. So for now we just enjoy this and have some fun. So thank you very much for having us with 300 ramparts. Yes. So I'm fucking... When in Texas, do you take this shit? That's right. I can't even ever use the way shoots some shit. Yeah. Yeah.
