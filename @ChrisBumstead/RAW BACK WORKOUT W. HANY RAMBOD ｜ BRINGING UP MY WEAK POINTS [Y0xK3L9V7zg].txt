They're both torn now. Oh, let me go change my quads now. I'll read it. Everything happens for a reason. Come on! Come on, Chris! Come on, you're one in two, four, four, two, three, yeah, go, for me. What's the... All right, we love raw, but what do you make? Yes. The ultimate pre-workout concoction here. We're going to go next level gains. So, stick a comb. Let's do it three, four, five, six, six. So, and then actually, we got one more, so we'll be seven, because just like at the C7, seven, we'll send you a question. So, we'll go ahead and create one more. It's the C-bomb energy, you know. I love it. I love it. All right, let's do the great concoction game, guys. What we can do is we'll do a little tasting. I'll say south. Yeah, a little taste test. I know if it's good, you'll come out with it next week. I want a great bomb energy. Yeah, round time candy. Who would it ho? All right, let's just... We'll go with the captain. It's 200, but I'm just going to use this one for taste. So, we're going full-send mode. We're going to go EVP Extreme N0. We've got 200 milligrams of caffeine. It's got the nitrates. It's got the Argentine... Argentine trade. It's got the Citroën. It's got the mushroom extract for focus. And then we're going to add in the glyphogen, because it's off season. And so we're going to add in a little bit of that cherry to go along with that grape. So it's going to be either really, really good or it's completely disgusting, but it doesn't matter because you want to be huge. We'll need your shots. You ready? I'll need you. I feel like I've reached out to you. And these shaker cups will not have been certified to give you 20% more pump. To go along with your pre-workout. All right, let's go. It's magical. It's magic. It's really hard. It's really hard. Our wine's so hot for you. It's really hot. I'm like... You're... You're... Just like a test. It's kind of... I mean, the oxidative is in your back there. Okay. The white film in me? Yeah. Something starts running down your leg. You know why? It goes pepper. It's a great fun game. It's a great cotton candy with a stupid cherry to like a jack. And a half a lit of acu. So you're going to get the full mess. The focus. Now, when the use of tummies will throw them like you should or so? Yeah. Yeah. I need to say that. You can't. You just... What? Yeah. It's a long time. It shouldn't. No, the two of them. Did you get me to give me 20 grams? Yeah, well, I just give you 10 for now. Because you're used to three. It's doses three. So you give me 10? Yeah. 10, half a lit. And too much makes you shut yourself into give me three. Yeah, it's much like 20. If you haven't, you're not used to it. And you take a full 20. You're not used to it. You're going to feel a little grumbly through the sun. You're going to be like, should I? Yeah, I mean, you're going to be... You're going to be... You're going to be so cool. It's definitely done with the style. Oh, cool. It'll be fine. You'll be fine. The end result is going to come out of your roof. Oh, dude. The end result is trying to get out of me last night. I thought I'd be like an alien in me. I was driving home and I was like, something was going to come out of my chest. You? I'm out. I get, but I get to tell you this man, I still have heart-aid about it. I gotta tell you. Heart-aid looked way better than that. Yeah. Heart-aid? What I heard? That was kind of a disappointment last night. There's a little bit I was like, oh. I was waiting back because she was like, I wasn't good at it again. You hyped it up so much though. You're still my favorite. I didn't press it better. Am I a pin? Ooh, I don't know, me on. I don't know. I'm literally still like this. It looks way better. Because I had this brand that far. Yeah, well, like, if I take you to walk up and pull it off the barbeque, rather than, like, if you do, it was at their hands. Yeah. I was just confused as to what you were touching. Yeah. The next place we have to take is like, no, it's not for the last time. It's both on the road. It goes on the road. Pearl I like it. No, it's like you want to be a fan. No, you're cool.

It's a little bit stressful in the gym because a lot of people and I love you guys, but if you think of a gym and you're staring at me, just imagine if you were at a gym and every one at the gym you walked in the Alsteria, you pulled the front end so it's zooming in and filming. You know a little bit uncomfortable, so I'm pushing you guys in the front and finish my workout, come up after. I'm still here at my video, Tim is holding up and I'm very awkward. I'm making a comfortable. So yeah, back there, joining the huge. Soon you'll get all the back on, honey. Oh that's honey. This is a price of fame. Good. Good. Squeeze. Good. Good.

I don't know. Heard it. It's like, I don't know why it's just all low back. Because the angle doesn't allow me to get over it. It's like pulling me down. Oh, it's one of the four. It's like things that have been offered. Like. Okay. It's just trying to arch your back slightly. And then just get a good stretch and then pull. But don't go so far that it throws you off. I'm going to, I don't like your ergonomics with this one. It's okay. So that one we last time was better. Yeah, the other one was last time. You know what I mean? Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

Was that before after party weekend? I was like 170. 170. Fuck is wrong with me. I have no idea how much it wrong with me. I'm going to turn into a book. The list of things wrong with me. That's a very big book. That's the next. Yeah, the book. There's a book. There's a book. Yeah. The book is like right. The book is too bad. Yep. Yes. It's a full of machine and they're all over the world. It's really my reason to pull over machine is because we're trying to keep the way I'm elbow, keep the way off my bike side so we can't be fatigued in my arms.
