Bro the three bodybuilders I've seen have been set there in flex I feel like I have For it's all good, but they're still better than they were when I told you I was training I'm gonna let you take the time off of just training calves What's that? sexy sexy Don't shoot I am It's new, not much yeah Everything this way have fun Yeah, it wouldn't be home though, you know, are you? Yeah, it's like sick what we'd say, but obviously I'm not traveling. We might have sick what we've done. Oh yeah, everything is good. Busy, very busy. Busy with just fucking every phrase. Everything. Family kids, Adela and Terrarysio, just shit. Yeah, just shit. Yeah, everything went good. Yeah, Adela and Mike ride into it. Yeah. Like she's my first born, so like, dude, she kills everything. It was heartbreaking because she was at states, like put together a hell of a fucking meat. It was going to go to regional, like, and put freaster nationals, and then Terrarysio, they're in a competition. It's a big enough. Yeah, it's a big enough. T-tune in this life lesson. No, I, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's a, that's a, we're looking at. But other than that, just fucking busy with work and kids and family and. Awesome. Yeah, it's a little fun. I'm just got one more exercise one more. So, I like it. So there's ours. Should I go to the, I'm good, whatever. How do you train that? You train like the bodybuilder? I was going hard at the beginning of the year because I just was like, I got a work with fucking doing functional work. I was doing the road split for like two and a half, three months. And then, and then I went back, I was like, I need to stay in shape. I started gaining weight, let press the wind back up a little bit. I'm like, I can take it back and function or shame. Now I just do push pull and legs and functional workouts. Like run around and insert pulls push up, set up, run in the mirror. Yeah, that's what I want to do. I want to compete with the cross-set. I want to be the cross-set game for now and so. I want to be, I want to do the tack. I don't know whether it's that. It's cross-fit with guidance. It's all it is. It's pretty shoot. The more you just hope it. No, you, it is, so it's just like the cross-fit games like there's a bunch of different obstacles. But then you run and fully get it out. Pistol way are, I've never run with guidance. I can shoot to my liking. I have a lot of them. But I've never done actual training with it. So, picture your neighbors. See, you're running out there fucking assaulting your back. Just running to the tree. I like it just because it's challenging. Like it's hard. And I know that if I keep doing bodybuilding stuff, I'm going to keep wanting to, it's myself back into it. I don't know. Because after I was done with the transformation challenge we did, I was like, I didn't have a run trend in like, four years. But like, what's your daughter? I don't even remember what it feels like. You can't have a height of like, don't you do it? You don't do it. So I was like, fuck, it just stay in the tree. I don't know. I'm old too. The dog truth. Do I say it as that? Well, the three bodybuilders I've seen have been set, they're in flex. And I feel like I feel like I have no cat. I feel like I have no cat. Plus the cat is still a cat. Oh my God. You have a better name. You should be here. You're a tall guy. But they're still better than they were. When I told you I was training, I was taking time off. I was just training cats. Your shoulders are warmed up. It's still a little light laterals. And all that. Get your rotator tough and you're going to rip a bullshit. Get the bullshit out. Fuck it. You're old faster. What's up?
