How to be confident, see you on a great question, horrible wording. But I'm going to speak once, specifically, that I was like, witness to hear that was very different. And it's kind of obvious, but doing things that scare you, build confidence in every aspect of your life, not just to think that's here with you. If you're someone nervous, pick something small, this here is you and do it. It's just like fixing the help, keep doing, keep doing it, and you're going to build confidence. The possible not to. Come on, come on Chris! Come on, you're one, two, Oh, come on, come on, you're one for you guys! Come on, come on! What's that? Sorry, last Friday. You told me what you're doing. Two scanning. Yeah. Scan your bed. I want the middle�. Oh my god! I think it's actually really good though. You don't count. Apparently I don't count because I don't eat this stuff. Yeah. What's the milk from cookies when it was really good? This is better, my opinion. That's right. Ready, go, Chris likes it. What's up, YouTube? I'm tired today. I'm very tired. I'm sick and fucking tired. I'm driving for an hour to this goddamn gym. I'm serving at the office. So I need my gym to be open. But today was really good. I got blood work that's what I'm trying to say. Perhaps starting soon, some of the blood work makes sure I'm healthy. Body's ready to rock. Create a fuck-shick, fuck-shit. Up this one, be up to 13 speed grain now. But good blood work. Get back to five days, Hunter are going to review. And then lock him low and fully into this prep. And get spying right now after he came down. So feeling good. I'd take two days off before. First thing like three days off for blood work through your results aren't too good. But I took two days off and want to take them to shem off. And then... Here I am. I don't know if you're fucking going to go on this. So yeah, the shoulders and by a set of stay-framing, I'm catching up for a missed day. So to mining, we're getting a hat. Doing this this week, oh my foot. Five steps a week in my delts. So putting vices at the beginning of this workout, mixing themselves, finished with delts. But I'm actually pushing my vices up there that they need to be. But this isn't normal program, it just has to take you through days off and I don't want to not change arms for like nine days or one, eight days or whatever. It would be a smooth sweat. So hi, tell me now. Put them in the beginning of the workout. Warm up delts and shoulders. And then finish with like three delts and normal. So your number one foot's weight is Alright. I don't really recommend warming up the biceps for shoulder best. Probably should done this first, but it's still feel good. Doing that little pives, curls with one arm, pives curls the other for biceps, like my cheek curls for getting like a crazy bicep pump. And like pounding some mind-must connection at the beginning of the bicep workout. It's been helping me a lot. It's too much. The man is a hell of pump that turns your shoulder press, but we'll take what I do. This is a good machine. What? That's a good machine. That's a pure delved tree overhead. I mean, you know a brand new thing you could have used this. Some of the things are like thirst for, so I don't have that brand. Well, there's a few others like this, but they don't have a brand like that. I have the max book. I don't like that one. That's too short man. That's short you're it. Are you the short king? Alright, so just a percent cross lateral raise with front raises. Just trying to pump the hell out of my shoulders. It sounds a lot of volume like 10 reps of each super set. What about good to do like a. Kill your front delved, your side delved, and then move into a front delved. And because my lateral delved with fatigue, force me to use my whole hand-sharier delved, and it really may be burn out weight quicker, such as the way I played that, and make sure you have a round shoulders, rather than off-lighter ones. So, finish with the re-delveds of the same reason. The vice steps, we're gonna go home and follow it today. Alright, so let's get me around on today's shoulder by Seperke at a random workout that I don't normally do, but yeah. Hopefully we have enough footage right now, but Calvin's gonna be heading out of the vicinity of the Ming for a while, so we're gonna be back in about 12 days. I don't have my camera. But I'm gonna vlog a bit maybe, and if my gym's at him, I'll definitely be vlogging. I also want to vlog more of this crap. So I'm gonna be stealing Calvin's camera, I'm gonna commit to the YouTube Grand and buy another one of his cameras, and then vlogging the morning, film a Super Junior Day workout, and make a little bit more entertaining content. But, kill I said I was gonna answer some of the big questions in the last few videos, and I didn't, I have some save now, I'm gonna quickly run through them, wrap up the video, and just gonna run into it. This is from YouTube. So if you have leave questions in YouTube, I'll try and screen-chop them and save the man to the money where I feel like it. First question is, says, do you have a protein with that sucre loss? So the raw protein that actually speeds in the stevia? The sea bump proteins are sweet, it was super low. So if you look at the raw ones, they are grass fed, New Zealand way, with stevia. Sea bump is not, that's why the flavors are a little bit more like me and chocolate chip and stuff like that, and similar to a cereal, they're a little bit more playful. I guess you could say in the sea bump line because there's a question, do you ever feel that traveling, cuts into your workout time? And also that others are hungry, and then the gym every minute of the day, that is concerning you. So I guess it's saying it's my life to track me too much into the worry me. I'm not sure if now, I think I've found pretty well to travel up the beginning of the year, and when you compete once a year, I'm like others, so that's my advantage. And I honestly wouldn't feel fulfilled living a life at 28 now, which I did this for a few years, that you're sleeping, training, eating and sleeping, eating and training, doing nothing else. I really love the fit, this is rebuilding everything I get to do during the day. The travel I get to do for the business is, and then everything like that, it really feels me gets me excited, and if I ever feel like I'm like behind or something, you just kind of give me a little chip of my shoulder to kick myself in the ass when I got home. And training even harder. So I don't feel like it's putting me back at all. Regardless, it's making me a lot happier and setting me up long term for my future, so I'm just enjoying life and doing the best I can with what I got. Thanks, Juan. I'm always at the gym training for three hours. Is that too long? So the pump I get, then it's amazing. I mean, if you're feeling fully energized and sick of it, three hours, I mean, it's not horrible. And I don't tell people to do what I do now, because when I was younger, and I could train for three hours, I used to do it with different three hours every single day, almost, probably six days a week, one day I was too hung over. And I felt great. I was getting strong, I was progressing about 20 years old, and nothing to beat me up. So I was just enjoying the talent with my friend, you're a gym, you can still show, I could have sped it out better. But if it's not taking away from the rest of your life and you're truly training hard, and you're making progress, you're getting stronger, getting bigger, whatever your goals are. Who's this luck here? But I promise you both time you're like 28 miles or even younger, you're about to catch up to and you're not going to train that long. So enjoy it while I last. And if you have a busy life and you feel like taking out of it, we're going to be more efficient with your work. All right, last question. How to be confident, see you, Bob. Great question. Corporal wording. But I'm going to speak once, specifically, saying that I was like, witnessed this here, that was very different, and it's kind of obvious, but doing things that scare you, build confidence in every aspect of your life, not just the thing that scares you. I learned this this year when I was doing a bunch of public TV events. If you're keen to, they either keep steps, you're seven hours, and a bunch of stuff that I would never do. And every time they were coming up, I was trying to find a thesis about government, because I did want to do them because I was scared to me. Every time I did them, I would anxious my heart was racing, and felt like I was going to suck them up. And I went through with it, I did okay, and after I'd settled a little bit more confident. And I kept doing it, and I realized after a while, my day-to-day life and other decisions that I was making stuff I was doing, I just felt more confident. Because something that once scared me, where I thought I was going to fail, and I'm not being about it, I thought, not mine. I got through it, proved to myself that I'm more resilient, and I thought, and then I'm that's not an aspect that your body is more, or your mind is more resilient in every aspect, not just public speaking, but just full, like, aptitude of life. So I think that's one of the best ways. If you're fucking someone nervous, pick some of the smallest gears you and do it. It's just something that you can keep doing, keep doing it, and you're going to build confident, the possible not to. This is a help for me and it's useful. But yeah, that's it. So like, as watching, we will see you guys soon. Hopefully, the gym will be ready, and next video I'll be going to try and up again. Up, thank you guys for where my gym is at, so this should be done in that like, 10 days I am fingers crossed, a hate drive. Yeah, see you soon. Love you guys, catch you later.
