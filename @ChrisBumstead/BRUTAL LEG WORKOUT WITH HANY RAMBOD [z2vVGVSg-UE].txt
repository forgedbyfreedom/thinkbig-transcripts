It didn't hit legs. Every year one of his like sick folks just started to tear it. No it's weird they're all like a little dull but hypersensitive. Like certain sounds like hurt me. Furnced mouths making sick like lights hurt my eyes and my brain like... How can I help you if you won't let me in? The world's too... You need bitch. Come on! Come on Chris! Come on you won't stand. Oh come on you won't be able to go for this one. What's that? You gave this yard to where Mike did it? Do you want to come to dinner today? I have to go to the movies. Oh he's denying my invite. Oh shit! How many times a holiday? How many times a holiday cup of the town? A lot. He doesn't actually. Emotionally he does. Every day to Chris. Or you. Yeah. Technically he called me a midnight. I'm gonna do it in the hospital. But he decides to work out in the hospital. I'm into that. What? You do. Also just... Just being with us not ours. What's that else? I don't know. I told Calvin I'm gonna say using a bike but he said pressure. So you guys gotta wait for that to have your idea. I'm trying to tell him who doesn't work at all. So you can blame him in the comments that week. I don't know. I don't know. I told Calvin. I'm gonna say using a bike but he said pressure. So you guys gotta wait for that to have your idea. I'm trying to tell him who doesn't work at all. So you can blame him in the comments that week. Did I get enough shit for it? But like Dave, with Mr. Harding about to go through a quad workout, he's making sure I'm up to power strong enough, big enough, lean enough to be getting the season rolling. So it's over due to the day. There's nothing else really to do. Any secrets going on? I'm the share of secrets. Secrets, consextra. Because it's only this. Because seeing the chin is safe, darling. Eh? No, you say secrets don't exist and then they don't go looking for it. Okay? Always. I can't lie then. You're our secrets. I can lie all over. Yeah. There are secrets. Are we smart? Have you been there or in the media? What depends on how you feel? Are you gonna be a skinny bitch? I'm always skinny bitch but I can also squat heavy. Well, let's try to be a strong skinny bitch. Good. You weren't even that stress last year. I was actually surprised. Everyone's all mad. How's he doing with all the stress? I don't understand. When you were telling me that, I was like, I've never really been a stresser. I'm anxiety, maybe that's why I thought that's... We've been the admitted that I have been... But like, every single person has anxiety. But I just say it. Most people just share like, I don't have it, you know? Yeah, I guess. I could be it. I mean, you could get it around. Huh? I said, you've been around. How does it? It just shuts down. Oh, you internalized it? Yeah, it doesn't go. It doesn't go. Yeah, you shut down and you go into a closet. That was the stress down in 2018. That's when I shut down. So you just shut down. That's the way of handling the stress. I'm not mental like everything. I mean, everyone shuts down a little bit. No. A lot of people go out there. Yeah. People go out there. People go out there. People go out there. Some people go out there. Some people get fucking just mean and nasty towards everyone around them. They create a fucking glass of. My head... I didn't walk around my head down and like, mopey. I was just... Why? I'm not thinking. I'm a little bit of everything, so. Calvin rides away. Ooh, we got after something. It's just this. You know, it's... You feel it affects you? No, I just feel it more. I can share a tea. Not affected at all though. It's good. What a feeling of being. One breath. It's a... One breath every second. What the... Yes. It was so big boy. He's like, I know I'm in this body. That's right. Oh yeah. Happy dog. I think he's got bigger legs in here. He's got bigger legs in here. He's got bigger legs in here. He's got his own collar. It's crazy. He's so scared. I just wanted to chat with Stringer. Pointing my toes, you mean? But like, you want to hold it on the top? Yes. You want to do the way. If I do this way, I'll hold it at the top of the first leg by the breath. And then go. You want to make sure you hold it. Right? Make sure you hold it. Yeah. So that's point of the whole set. It's just... we're getting it. Now we'll first three or four reps without hold. Then we'll go ahead and do some hold. And then we'll see how you got it guys. And then maybe do some partial straight. Good. Good. Straight. Good. Straight. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Pause. Pause. Good. Do you want like that? One more like that. Good. Two seconds. Good. That's right. Try to see. Go. Keep it moving. Five. Four. Three. Two. One more. Good job. There you go. Let's get one up. Now it's just a little bit tough. What? Good one up. Now it's time for working with us. I thought there was a work with us. No. That's a warm up to a working set. That's a main. That's so mean bro. Not here'd be nice. Yes. That's okay. How you got five images? So what we want to do is let's go into a turn sideways. Two of them are quad. One more. One more. One more. One more. Push it. One more. Five seconds. Two more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. Hold that. Good. Good. Well. You ready? It's a look of excitement. Could my legs hurt? Yes. I told you. I didn't. I did. I'm like I'm going to get some fun. Let me do it in a great spot. I just wanted to get some footage. Okay. So let's go ahead. I think we should be able to continue to try to go ahead. So we're going to ahead any spikishings. I think it's really comfortable for you. And then from there we'll decide on where to take it. We might end up doing really in hack or there might be another exercise. If you have a good pendulum or you have something on those lines. But let's go and screen to a smithishing spot. So we can go and ask the counter to jump that. While your body is still somewhat fresh. Let's do it. Let's go. Let's go. Good. Good. Here we go. You ready? Nothing. What are you waiting for? How many reps? No idea. I'll do it. 15. I'll be easier<|en|> last time. I did that with straight line but I think I'll leave you. You got it. You got it. Let's go. Let's go first. Come on. I still like it. You got this. Give it to me. You got it. Oh, is it on? WellANA is OH. I think I got at least five percent. You look forward. Oh. Come on, life is a need. Why do my needs hurt? I wonder why. I think I'm going to buy more plates at my gym. I'm going to have to carry it around the cushion. I'm going to have to work it around the fucking gym. That's why you got to get Calvin to do it for you. I have been a center. I'll probably get to see you sometimes. I'll rip it to cause it my nose. This is extra cardio. I'll tell you Max might as well go through carrying ability. Right? That's right. Mine are big bags. Big bags, small balls. You got to wear something ridiculous for like week out the week out. Just like to see if people don't want to. I don't want to. We'll do it with a hot-y trun. Just don't wear crocks. I won't do crocks that I won't do. Never. What's your opinion on crocks? Camels. Okay, well that's different. He's like 10. Yeah. That's too old. Got to change the ways. I got to get him over to Burx. I'm going to rip wearing Burx. That's why I laughed at you. I was wearing Burx. Cause it's a Northern California. That's what the fuck you are. It's like, you know, it's like the weeds and seeer of the woods. But you know what's not? I think that would be good. Yeah, would be good for that. Yeah. I'm going to have a talk with Cam like 7th team. And I'm going to talk to him about Travis Scott's and Kobe's and off-way. All they should. He's already done. I need to have Travis Scott's. No, he's already asked me about what he's about. Kobe's. But he sees all my Kobe's and he's like, can you get the kids Kobe's? Yeah, but you're really cool. Cam, if you had these shoes, you wouldn't be here. That's too old. Yeah, I was going to have to fucking send you the bill. When you're in try to put my son into a fun and speak there. Ready? No. No. No. No. No. Troll. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No way. Oh. Come on. Croupe. Do you have aATECIS? Youования? Do it. Good. Good job. That was on two tight. A little bit is a little spruiner feet out. Can I say this one if I go water if you have my ducks. That's what I do. Why do you say when I just told you when you were, you just repeated to my song? I said it before you said it. Is that a first of the night? You should be excited for all the same way. Say wait and per one, say wait and wait. I bet I love it. What's that? Always wants to be unique. He does. He does. He's very unique. They broke them all the way. I probably wanted to be unique because I'm so basic. He leans into his basicness. I mean he wants to train in August this year. He's saying. Hi, hi, hi, it's an hug. The program you're like a bear foot chooset. Who was telling you, where did you want to see it? He's huge red boot. Yeah, we're going to have a problem. It's like a thing. Is there a dragon on Mr. Miss? Mr. Miss? Sorry. Mr. Miss? I'm going to make the music. I'm going to make the music. I'm going to make the music. I'm going to show you the music. I'm going to show you the music. Actually, actually, it's a free version. That's it. That's it. Good. Good. All you better. Good. Good. Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Don't pass. Just go. Just go. Three. Two. That's it. And dry. That's it. Why? Perfect. That was the guy. That was the guy. That was the guy. It didn't get late. You saw something. I like it. I like it. Good. I don't realize over the years with him. Every year, one of his senses, one of his like sick folks, just started to deteriorate. No, it's weird. They're all a little dull, but hypersensitive. Like certain sounds like hurt me. Frinch smells making sick. Like lights hurt my eyes and my brain. Like very like. I think there's something wrong with my brain. It's not like you're in the zone. To him, it's like you're in the zone. Do you really like, fuck I'm dying? Your hands weren't that thick, bastard. I think that was the problem. We had to do it. It was a lot of deepness. What? It's solid. It's good. No matter how I looked, I thought you think I looked. Yes. I'll be on the table. I'll be on the table. I'll be on the table. These are not your droids. Do you have a drink? Do you have a drink? Do you have a drink before stage? Do you have a drink? I think I need a burger in the fear I can feel it. Yeah. At least I like one chick play sandwich. I can't. God. How is he wants as a burger? The dopamil is making the distrust. He creates my cord of the omelette. You should just order your pizza. No, no, no dairy. It looks hairy. So that sandwich can't have any cheese on it? No, no. I've never get cheese. No cheese, extra ketchup. And all of a... It's all of a ketchup. It's all of a ketchup. Oh. But only one pickle, not two pieces of, you know, no two slices. You don't want to use a glass. It's a little over. Yeah. Yeah. See this. That's sex. Good. Come on. Right. Come on. Let's go, Chris. Come on. Come on. Let's go, Chris. Come on. Two more. Up. Up. Let's go. Go. Oh, my God. Up. That's it. That was good. I thought that feels so chubby. We're eating y'all. Yeah. Yeah. It's too much. I can do them. Oh, you helped him. Yeah. Maybe you haven't worked enough. How's that way? Yep. Oh, I mean, I mean, given birth. Thank you, Matt. Come on, Chris. Oh, this guy. He's gonna go stop. Go. Go! Good. Go. Three last one. You got the last one. Right. Four. Two, three. Three. Three. Four. Good. Five muscle connection. Good face. Not too heavy. Ah. You're going to want to stretch out. You can set your ad. That's true. My groin is already fired. Yeah. You're recording. Get in there. Then we'll do two sets. We'll rest up. The rest time is a little shorter. And then we'll come in and we'll keep your feet parallel. And then we'll go ahead and blast the other quad. So why? Yeah. Yep. Yep. See those hands? Then we'll do this. I need you to turn over the Handsaw in. And have it cut down. What's the thing to do with Jeffery's in Jeffery's? Jeffery's in Jeffery's? Yeah. It's like a kind of operative? Yes and no. Yes, closest thing to do nothing, but Jeffery's in all sorts of stuff. They're better? Yes, they're definitely better, but it's what you need, not necessarily. Otherwise I'd be telling you. You know what I'm saying? Right on that slide. Good. You'll let that go, right? Good. Good. Good. Nice. Stretch. You're going. Three. Go. Two. Good job. And left. You're going to do this. You're going to do this. You're going to do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. You're just getting your visual clients of a blood-lessed like I said, going to this on the floor right now. That's what you're trying to do. You're just in golf for your toilet. You have that super-sacced toilet. I just wanted to get extra. I wanted by one of the bougie-tweiles, which was like a cooling heated seat. You used it that place. I don't need my cheeks to be warm. I'm going to do it. What's it called one though? Oh, that's even worse. What? It's more like imagine the vents of the vents that seats like in a car, but I know toilet. I can't believe it. No, because then my whole... I would get goosebumps all the way down my life. I'm taking all the juice. I'm just gonna go over the other side. I can't stop. I'm just gonna go over the other side. I can't stop. I can't stop. I can't stop. I can't stop. Madricard, you're being pussy. I never do this. I can tell. Breath's wife. She can do full matrix. I don't really like what I'm playing on the floor. I'm in the core, but... Do you know what I'm saying? From what? What? I'm saying that video. I thought you might have... The video's not on the left. I couldn't see shit. I told you that one. Resolution. We did a video on the channel. Is that all of shit? Yeah. He didn't resend it? No. Oh. What happened? I cut this out. Joe. Why are you fucking stressing me out? You shit, time? He's like, tough job. I was horribly lying to you. He'd like your pectr or what pectr. Oh yeah. Well, you and I had to chill like that for me too. How about you, Adam? Did you? I'd take you every time I hear myself. I know myself. I know myself. What's the total? So? I worked out to you. You need to be like... I've been like quarter-stop. Every night, course all the rules back down. We're getting to build you a meditation room in New Orleans. Is that all? Fine. Good. I got a break. Good. You're good. Give me big light. Good. There you go. Keep moving. Keep going. Keep going. Okay, now go all the way up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Come on. You're too subtly. Come on. You look soましょう. Spoon. Directions. Naturally. You got this pussy. You just pushed him over. We're like, last one. I didn't even do another. cage. I think China has already hooked this on too weird to have bought some of these. One of my last chances to enjoy this is the right choice. The list should post work there. Wait hold on, get the good flavor one, yeah that's true. I got the original. No, the other one's actually good too. I like a little bit more basic, a little bit basic deal. Yeah, that's definitely a... That is actually, I think, um, texture wise more satisfying than all the other ones I've tried there a little not ours. I'm sure the ones with the original one. Oh, even the protein ones. And I'm sure the one had nothing to do with it and that's probably why. Well, I mean, I was just buckled in. Oh. You can watch this? You can watch this? That's right. I don't even know the guy I'm just looking at one of the most about me. He's just fine. Alright, wrapped up that like day. Pretty brutal like day. What I so strongly enjoyed about it. We only used one set of hacks, lots. Normally if I hit five plates, I might feel good I'll do another set. That's a smith machine, I always thought of that. Anyways, that fucked my central nervous system with the whole workout and then the rest of the workout. I'm sad we did one working set there, one working set on a hack and then like six or seven working set on the leg press. And I got heavy weight and a lot of volume in my life. I've buckled this right right now. So good workout, good game plan, good to go. I had some choral protein, tasted delicious, had a bond treat. So we're living in the dream right now. We're going to dinner because we're living life right now because we're about to stop living life very soon. And yeah, I thought it's going on. So tomorrow's back day and see you guys there for the final workout of this three-part training series with Mr. H.T.
