They look like they do in like drawings. It just looks fake. Exactly. It looks great. Oh, yeah. Power for the bull sharks too. Incredible. So one thing we got to get you out of doing is, uh, so after the limpia, when you win again, right? We're going to come in back to Cinger Island, Cinger River, where you got the black tip migration. Yeah. And we're just going to fish it off the beach and just catch sharks, like off the beach. Crashing. Thousands of them swim. That's crazy. So that's fun. Because you just know both. No, she's sick and sad. Exactly. There we go. Yeah. I know. I just want to make some people over here. I'm here. There you go. Jeff, what's that in your legs? Start cranking. He's going to get you fast. You're real fast. Yep. I have a legion. Keep really, keep really. On Jeff, I'm going to. I'm going to get my two feet with the boat. Yeah. Yeah. I like that real. Nice. And international 130. I have a boy Jeff going to create your up. I think Chris, we're going to be bigger than yours. I think so. Excellent. Yeah. There we go. Come and ride on it. Go ahead. All right. Oh my gosh. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go, Jeff. Here we go. If he's going to come around Jeff, we're going to walk around this side right here. You got the glove cord? Yeah. Just lay down the ball right here. Oh yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Wow. That is a nice coat. I got it. Wow. That's a big boy. That is a big boy. You've never got a woman ready to get her. We got to take this guy for those. Yeah. That's a big boy. That's a big boy. That's a big Jeff. Great. Great work. That is a monster. Oh. It's a monster. At the 250 pounder. What? Oh. We're going to head on that. Great. Oh. Oh, it's so far. No, we're never. Haha. How is incredible, eh? That's amazing. Yeah. You're good, buddy. That's good. Just put me in the same. Love shame. Always show me how it does. Alright, Chris, this is where I think you got to come right here. Do you just hang it out? I don't want to do this so small. You're right behind him. When you got small eyes, you need a big mouth. I guess so. You're just chilling right now. He's calm right now. Jeff caught a bigger one than Chris. You got to be pretty fast. He did. You did. You go on. You can go on. It's a big one. You're like, oh, cold. You'll snorkele it over. You can't. You kind of drag it in the water and let it go. Hold this way and then just let her swim that way. Hold this way. Hold this way. You pull towards the beach. Yeah. And then head to the back of the water. Oh, he's heavy. Walk it out. Walk it out. You're not walking at all. No, you'll be fine. You're a controller and I want you to walk it out. And then slowly start to pull it. And then get your legs to push. That's a big shark. Yeah, man. That's heavy. Yes. Pull one of those. Great work, man. Jeff, I'm the leave of a moment. I guess that goes down for the record books for your biggest fish. Actually, I think that'll be the record for life. Alright, so that's a wrap on today's fishing. Yeah, I've got over board a few times because I've not built for any kind of motion. But we came back in around Calmerwater and that was the fun part. We got the catch a few sharks. I caught a little one in my dad caught a big ass shark. This is on there at the end. That was really cool. That's something that you can't really explain what they're like. Like I was saying, like, they look like a fake picture. We're so perfectly silver. And you touch it and it's like sand. You get to even run your hand one way and then it's soft the other way. So it's really cool experiencing that. How powerful it's starting there. Just pure muscle and too crazy. So what's the biggest shark around New York? Ooh. David, did you see that? I've got a hammer hand? Four, two hundred pound hammer head? Yeah, four, two hundred pound hammer head. Probably like four of those. I'm a hammer. Five of those. Five of those. That's pretty good. Yeah, it was crazy. We're going to have to come back and do that one. So yeah, we're going to have to go back and do that one. So yeah, we watched. She saw a hammer head this year coming up down the beach followed with her drone. What would you say David? That thing wasn't school bus. Yeah, it was usually 13 feet long. Yeah. Yeah, it's grown when they were, I'll show you the footage. So I'm really full of it. We actually hooked it and then we ended up losing it. Oh, really? Yeah, and then we never saw him again. Oh my god. So yeah, we got to hop the beach. Yeah, that's wild. So we have to catch one over the road. When you come back, man, a hundred percent. Absolutely. Definitely we're going to come back here. Hopefully on the day when the season of low karma, they were bad today. Yeah, they were rough out there. So come back on their commerce. Catch them when we get eaten. So a lot of people might hear your hard work. That's a good question. Something like that. We could get eaten and enjoy it. Probably in the off season too. So it'll be good time. But if you're gathering in Florida, Southern Florida, Black Tip Beach, check them out. Appreciate that. Private tourists, charters, anything you got to need to support for. So make sure to check out their YouTube channel. There are three of them. I'll black tip beach. Oh, thank you for the meeting. Thanks. Have a nice day. Yeah, man. Appreciate it. Take a nice day.
