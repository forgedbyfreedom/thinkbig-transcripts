Trip What is up YouTube? Back at elevation gym room waiting for the current raining men's physique, Mr. Olympia Champion. That's a lot can buy the door in here. It's the last pretty version of myself, but shorter, less pretty version of myself. I say that because the way more beautiful than I am. But Ryan Terry's on his way here, we're going to work out. That's the event today, I'll do a stream shark. It's fucking bonkers to see how good these guys are running at ends, especially having a few events for a while. If they don't even compare them together, they do here. So it's difficult to see firing to see and to have the brand that they've built like this is insane. So here's this little fucker walking in now. He's actually five minutes late, but I wanted to send like you five minutes early, but it's a little late. You're late old man. What's the fuck? You got me waiting here forever. You wouldn't want to limp you, now you're a big hot shot. That's how it works. That's how it works. I just want to sleep. That's how it's going to do. If you canceled, I would have gone to sleep too happily. Half a week. You got it? You got it? You got it? That was so nice. You got it? You got it? You got it? You got it? You got it? I did like an hour. It's crazy. Yeah. It's getting, it's, it's a stuff, yeah. It's getting, it's, it's a stuff, yeah. I'm not saying else to prove now, mate. That's the best part. What's that mate? I've got it. Work in sets of a triple drop of some of that. Couple super sets? What was going to do like, two middle or three working sets in there? I could triple drop of some of that end. Sure. Yeah. A lot of things. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Say again. Say again. How do you like being called? Do people call you champ now sometime? Yeah. That was my favorite thing I ever heard. It was like a sub champ. I was like, oh shit. Oh yeah. I'm usually eight to twelve rep. I've been doing a lot of like one second hold for a second negatives. Yeah. It's honey going. You're doing that. No, I actually have a guy like a, NFL NBA guy who trains them. Just drink training for a bunch of products. Can you help me do shit so I don't hurt myself again? Yeah. How heavy do you normally do? Really heavy. What? Really heavy. Really? I don't train like that. It's also the same. The last two years of training alone. Touch water. No injuries or anything that way. There's been training a lot like to a lot of, Really been training later now. Yeah, way lighter. A lot more control. Exactly what you're doing. But you want an Olympia like that? Exactly. Imagine that. Well, put six pounds on as well. It's just crazy for me. The process for like ten years and ever put a pound. You can say it's a bigger thing you changed. I'm a buyer. Just a posing. Yeah. Not even your training, just a posing. Well, no, we're training the training last year. So two things. One of us I was doing my backpow. I was hitting like um, because I was training with super everybody. I was doing like normal, like, you know, what ride? When I saw Stephen, why are you doing it? I was like, I've done that for the last ten years. So what are you meant to do? And then you just like, if you pinch my lower back, put me chest all. I think anyone. See, that's right away. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly that. Yeah, exactly that. Maybe I should've made it for the next year. That way. Honestly then, how you feeling about becoming a dad? I'm genuinely very excited. Yeah. I don't know what my health my last going to change. I don't know how you got it. I've already feel like tired and strong. Yeah, with all of the shit I'm doing. So I'm like out of baby to the mix and no sleep. It'll be interesting. Yeah, that will be fun. I'm at least not traveling for like too much. But that'll really help. I'll tell you the truth. He's seen it first. I'm just like, look at everyone kids again. He would tell me that. Do you think I like playing with your kids? And I hand it back. I get a little blown. Yeah. Smart man. Nice. Nice mate. I'll be with your gym compared to this. Maybe about just the size of the room. It's perfect. I want a 40-pound square feet. Yeah. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Look. Yeah. Last one shoulders. Easy right. Yeah, good. Yeah, good. You need some mate. Come on, Mr. Olympia. There you go. Thing is though, you know, after the limpia, I was like a king for two days. The third day got back home. And by the middle of the day, so I was in a skim. Took you down on the carball boxes. Yeah, broochin' off after all the builders are like, It's only gets worse there. I had the night of the Olympia in the next day. You've had it enough. Moving on. We're doing for five years. We're going to fucking... All right. Oh, well, I think that was good. I was on a podcast with a Flex Wheeler. And he was going to me. Oh, you're living the dream and wasn't so like the mission in here. Look down there. I'm a merry-gold, because I've been mocking floors. And I ran back. I was like, yeah, living the dream. I've got people's piss all over the planet. Yeah, fantastic. You're a true hero. Ah, I expected. Ah, I expected. Oh, good. Awesome. Awesome. Nice. Good. Solling. Eat it, keep going. No, yeah, yeah, I'm going to joke in boy. Yeah, so back to reality in it. So, but like, you work so hard not even thinking about what it's going to feel like. Yeah, and you get that victory. And then you almost don't know how to enjoy it. Yeah, but that's what people say. I've enjoyed it. Like what's it going on? I said to all these things I was going to do with a title. Like I've got to leave and then I've got it. I don't know if they were there. Just like, looking. Took me three years to walk into it. It was like, and that's what my thought where I prepped my mind to like, depresden enough to enjoy it. They were like, I think when you enjoyed it. And now I saw sort of, for me, the content we were saying about you learning to be president and being there. Because that was my problem. All I kept thinking, I still do it now. And I'm trying not to, is that right? What kind of do with it? I've got, I'm not blind at all. I've got to do that. Instead of thinking, just fucking enjoy it. Enjoy it. Yeah. You know, your whole life to capitalise. You've always been there, though, and I'm doing it. Yeah. Yeah, see how things change when you become a dad, like, if it drives you to it, or if you, whatever it takes that time away, for me, in the early days, because it was cried, who shit didn't want you. Wasn't that bothered, but now he's three. I've smoked him three times a day. He's like, that ain't when you're coming home. I missed you now. Is that, are you going to read for me tonight? I'm like, oh, fucking one, I'm going to be over there. Kimmer or what book has read, but it was someone talking about like, leaving for all the time and traveling to work. And they were telling their kids, like, I'm sorry, I got to go. They got to help, they got to help make money. What my family and all this stuff, and then the kids looked at him, like, the daddy, what if I don't eat, then do you still have to travel? And he was like, I literally started to cry, I'm like, yeah. Yeah. That is it. Because my brother and little took him to football today, which I taking the football at, yeah, soccer. But then, I saw him all his game today, and I was like, I should have been me. Fucking hell. That's my thing. It's tough for sure. Yeah. Again imagine. So, if I've done, he said it was it, 10 weeks. You just had off, just training or what, or just had a rest from, because he said he wasn't going to be in back training. I took him about 10 weeks off like everything. Yeah, that's like nothing pretty much. Yeah. So, first time I have done it, we're not intentionally that. That was just because of the, you know, the gym building, every, I was eating off. There's no point in his, yeah. Yeah. Right. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm going to do the press. You want to do dumbbell or machine? Don't do machine. What do you want to do? I thought you were going to play it when you looked at that machine. The most entused two champions ever. I don't want you on the other. I picked lateral ridges that you picked. All right, we'll do a press. Which press? That one, right. Yeah. That one. Yeah. All right. There. There. There. Yes. There. There. Bye. Bye. Oh. Oh. Little D.L. Thanks for the press. I'm going to, with the flags, right? Don't make it. What arm is it? I mean, it's a straddle me. You all have to do that. That's good. Let's go that. Come on. Nice. Good. Don't make. Nice. We'll control. It's all in. You missed Canada. I missed my parents. I just didn't know that she's not here, but nothing else. Just my little. Good. Good. The Jake L.R. video. Got home. Yeah. Thank you. Young old man. Why is it by sweety? What? The second one. When I got one of my favorite. Everybody said that. In 2019, I almost shouldn't have won. It was up in the air. Yeah. And then I came back. And I was like, I didn't really even expect to win. So that's a bonus. Yeah. That didn't feel too much pressure on me because not everyone really was like, it was just like, can he prove himself? Yeah. So it was almost just my year just to enjoy it. Have fun. Yeah. You've already got your win. Let's just prove what I want for myself that I can do this for me. And it was way more like chill. One of my best love. I was so chill the whole time at the great prep. But it was COVID. So I just didn't do anything else for that. Yeah. And I mean, I know you're going to win. Well, it's like, no, for proof. That's me. The first one's obviously good. But the second one. It proves not only to. So everybody else that you are. It wasn't a fluke. It wasn't a fluke. It wasn't a fluke. Yeah. So the second one's always better than the first. Yeah. Well, I say, just forgot so much on. But that kind of drove me to do it though. So last year, because I've had the British championship, another round of it. I had the new born. I had the link at the gym building. It's fucking mad. I was living on two hours sleep. I was training 12 till two at night. I was about four till six to my cardio. And I was on sight all day. If you're a U.N.I.R.I.R.I. I don't think why you think that might be a good way way help. But I also think part of the reason it was higher is to enjoy it. Was because you were in such a state of stress for so much. It was going on and all of a sudden you got it. You're like, what? Yeah. Where is this? You're not going anywhere. If you want to retire next year, you can, whatever you might lose, you'll build back up, but you probably won't. If you just take your time, be selfish as fuck and enjoy that. You're family and that. I need to. I know what you mean. Never. Everyone else. You'll fuck yourself. Tell everybody to go fuck yourself. Exactly. I love that. It's so safe. How are you? You're fucking okay. You're fucking okay. You're a good. Nice mate. Five solid. Six. Good. Seven. Eight. Eight. Nice. Nine. Five up. Go. Great. Good. Four. Got a matchet. Five. Four. Four. Got a matchet. Five. Four.

Eight- Warriors. Eight. I'll just return tomorrow. Yeah. Sorry? Ah, maybe. It's up in the air. I'm excited yet. So Jim, I'm not worried about you being lazy. We trained yesterday so we taken to the L. I'll be going, guys. Oh, sorry? I'm not, I'm going, but not compete, obviously. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm not being... No. What's your task in your opinion on it, Chris? Oh, I can't do like a machine. What's your thing with that action? How do you be serious? How do you do, Chris? Hey, make food. It's not out, buddy, is it? No, no, no, no, no. No, I only have one of you that worked in the company. I don't think you'd be excited to switch off that. No, I just can't. You're just supposed to say it, mate, to say it. No background music. I can't hear anything. Yeah, whatever. You've changed. Oh, no. You've come all the way up. No, I've got... Let's see. I've got a nine now. I've got this one. Pop side. Come a bit of cool, mate. That's some chaos, then. How can you mind if you should not have a penny? I barely have any at the L.M. beer. That's about... Nice, Chris. What a pleasure I did. That was a new one. 2018, yeah. What's going on, man? What is that? That's mental. What place were you at? 1990. Sir, you were up there for sure. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that you. Yeah, I placed 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1. First. Come on. Last year as well, I was like... Well, you didn't come second. Six, ten. Twenty, fifteen, the year, 41. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because we were in court and we went on to... We were here together and stuff. The thing was, that was the most frustrating year for me, because obviously honey and Jeremy were like a proper team, weren't they? Yeah, yeah. And our member was bed centre in 16. He looked like a porcupine. Never moved. And then right then, they moved us. And then, like the crowd just went, Roo, so they put me back and then sent us off. So I was like, where does that pour? Is that what happened there? Yeah. And then I come second and I was like, Oh. And then I just knew what... How many had Jeremy won before that? Three or two. That was the fourth? That was his third, I think. Yeah. Yeah, how was it back? That was the second. Especially, you could be like, Yeah, after like, dominate the move amount. You know, it can't be like, maybe. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah. I think it, yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's getting 9' or something. Oh, that's a gym. RT fit. Alright, kids, so that was a great workout by Mr. MP and CP Olympia. We've got to say that MP. People are offended if you know. I know, right? Trading like some true tramp series. Yeah. But, you know, we had a long day. We met a lot of people, so give ourselves a little bit of grace. Yeah. You're nice. We're a heart to heart to feel in the workout. So we're growing our heart strings. It's getting a bit of emotional. That's what I do, you know? I'm feeling the last, so a lot being a dad. So getting the dad bond. It's taking easy nowadays. It'll be rough. One day we'll actually train together and prep in actually train. Yeah. Well, you have to have lunch before, so we talk it all out. No, but yeah. And then we'll have lots of space. Some bullshit, like, yeah. Alright, there we go. But that's it. That's the wrap on that. So another day tomorrow. We're horrible. This whole youth is here. I'm terrible. I am. I'm terrible. I am. I'm terrible. I am.
