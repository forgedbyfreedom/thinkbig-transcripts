Come on, you're one. What's the... Three, each step. What is up? You two, you had my priority over. You even coach honey calling me. It's just day today. It's gonna be a good day. There's a lot of bait out in here. I got some drinking fruit. I have to finish some pump and some bait out in here. I'm gonna be eating my goddamn pace on today. But I've been really enjoying the high bait out in the workout. So it's what we're doing. It's raining today. Beautiful day. So I don't know what's going on. I think we're going to the gym. So together we're back. Alright, so four, I started this workout. I told you guys finally updated my app. I'm gonna show you guys a quick thing. If you're right now I'm not gonna go to deep in the gym. But this is my chest day from two weeks ago. It's a little bit of backlogged on me. So I can chuck my workouts and put it into the app. But this is what they do. I've stayed looks like I'm in a three-minute court so you guys can see. You're gonna open it up and it shows it goes straight to the day that it is. The today, two day, June 20th of chess and shy stuff. What it was a week ago. This is the same workout I did. So I took a high-pully cable crossover, Smith Machine and Grandch. And we're going to make the inclined process. It shows you everything. All you have to do is click. That works. Wow. That's what we've got to do. I'll start today to workout. We got this workout. So you hit, it starts with workout. You click on the exercise. It brings it up to the scene and it tells you 15 reps for a set, 15 reps second set, third set of the drops that you do 12 success, 12 reps and an am wrap for the next two drops. And it actually lets you track your weight now so you do like 15 reps, 200 pounds. Hit, check. And then it counts out of the down. And then a little timer starts. You do your same thing on the next one, 5, 200 pounds. You just check through all that like that. And as you go through over time, your weights will be tracked. I've brought every single exercise so if you do bench press today, five weeks or now you do bench press again on a different self workout. It'll still stay the exact same weight that you didn't last workout. So you can hit info, you can go back and check how to check that out. So it's a little update. We got to go. I got to do like a full actually update of it. I just keep forgetting to do it. So I wanted to make sure you guys do that because it's only one week left. Sign up for my transformation challenge. The end next Monday. So it's going to be a Seabumb-fit and a.com. 50th of all that enter. Close you guys the prize to win that is five grand plus a chance to come down and you train with me. So be sure to check it out. If you just want to download the app, you don't want me to contest. Let's see if I'm fit in this.com. But the app where you can find out on the app store. Either way, you can find out. But yeah, we're going on right now. So it's time to work here. It's going to be strong today. I'm going to check the chronology one. 40. No one 35. I'm a Dumb-Bill before that was 140. So I got weaker after my trip to Italy. I'm going to try to max out with Jim 150. And if I'm really cool, I'll order 170 pound dumbbells for my gym. You can see if I can move though. But it's time to get weaker and prep. Alright, I'm going to hit you. I feel like a year since I've done this. So I'm setting the tone for the off season. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. Thank you so much. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I don't know if I mentioned this. We were talking about the event this past weekend. We were going over programming this year again. 20 weeks out, just in our 20 weeks out right now. Gold just be literally a strong and possible. So I'm trying to hit the 150s. Next we're going to play it on this. I'm going to begin a compound picking movement and row movements. We're going to be strong right now. Gold just be strong as fuck. We're going to close the prep up the volume. That's when you get huge and shout it. We're going right now. This is the time where the next four weeks out to hit my PRS for the entire year. It's going to be strong and possible. Then we start prep. Hopefully you're getting a lot of food. Have a good prep rather than a miserable prep where I start myself. I'm tired. Look at a pump though. I wear a tank top. Hell, it's getting just a tweak of the Kelvin. Go on the other path. Let's see. Uh, what? Nothing. I've never been able to do a D-clines before. I've got five years to come out of the room. For some reason, recently I can do D-clines. So, try to set up a peck minor D-clines action. And then maybe push up and we'll follow the deck. By the way, for the delay. Yeah. We're going to hit a week ahead of my body. Body weight exercises. The stronger I get, like weight. The weaker I get a body weight. Definitely. I can't. Get shown up like a crowd's finish like we did. There you go. I don't know. What? What? What else? I'm not praying. You're my coach. Steer master with two hours. You're. You're my best state. This is cooking up 6x70m. They take two hours. That's the point. What? That's the point. What's the point? That's why they take it long to cook. I have nothing to say in videos anymore. I'm not like research questions and interview myself on TV videos. So, I'm excited to film it. The fourth month I'll have to go buy a set of 170s. Hopefully I can get those back in the year. I will be here. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be here. I'll be back. But I know I'm not a parallel student. I'm focused on my form. I'm going to put it to everything that I want to hear myself. But mentally, I just like you can go and stuff myself. I'm going to do it. I'm not going to cause this. I'm not going to cause this. I'm not going to cause this. I'm not going to cause this. I'll break my bad. But chest best I can do that at least. So, I'll enjoy it. Fuck. I'm going to wrap on this workout. I'm going to go some food. I'm going to have some fish and vlog fries. I'm going to have to be a few shaggers. Take care, thanks for good meat. Follow me on a few later.
