You need a little... We are the stage. Good. Watch! Come on! Come on, Chris! Come on! Come on! We come on! Let me in, Chris! Come on! Come on! Come on, Chris! What is up, YouTube? We're in the good elevator today. There's another elevator that has stake on the wall. I would much rather look at this signature peanut butter and bacon bigger. Just drool and watch out for you now. But Monday yesterday of Sunday didn't really vlog yesterday, we counted in at it. I was feeling so hot. When someone was brutally killing me, I was like, no fat, no car. I was just like pushing that like, that's how you get gas. You couldn't go to the bathroom. I just didn't feel good. So, took it down to vlog and we're back out of today. Fireton took a little poop. A whole lot better today. I want to give you some fat soup if I wait dropping and I'm fucking shredded right now. So, feeling good, you love me. You have a little bit more fat in my diet. And that's very beneficial. So, we have to jump right now and see you guys out. You're on. All right, here we are. Back at our old man gym. Final back day. Monday, back workout. Like I was saying on the elevator before people were coming up with us and we talked with a poop. I had some fat and maybe you feel more aware of that or so. I ended up with a little bit higher today. Trying a little bit earlier too, which feels better. So, happy about that. Doing good spirits are up. And weights coming down. So, we're going to make it. We'll make way. We get through that workout and get on with the dinner. We're going to do that. We're going to start the workout. Let's go. We're going. Come on. Good job. Let's go. Let's go. Good. Good. Good. Go. Don't swing. Good. That's it. Perfect. Good. Good. Good. Good. You done this before? Yes. So, we're going to do that. So, we're going to roll. You're mother fucking dog. What's I should do? What's I should do? What's I should do? What's I should do? Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Two more. One more. And that's it. Good. The hand position. So, what we can do is we can go ahead and lighten it by one. If you want, or take a 45 off and I recommend it to 25. And then do it over hand. So, let's grab the 45. Take it off. Yeah. We can't. We're going to go high, bro. Yeah, a little bit. It's really awkward for my long arm. Okay. So, let's go ahead. I'll have that problem too with my long arms. Yeah. Yeah. Seven for one. I'm six one. It's the lens on Calvin's camera. Yeah. This is my way limit is 3400. Good. I said one. Yeah. I'm a second one.

Excellent. Not a little bit. Wait. Let's get on the ice right now. I think it's a little bit difficult. I'm exhausted. I'm like, finished it. But I can do this. Typically, I'm used to being so fucking tired. I like to like, like, it's beyond. Then you can make it. Yeah. You feel good to have a little more life in here. Yeah. I mean, you want to have enough energy to do a set. But you should feel tired. In between the sets. Because your body should be depleted. But not so to put you in the ground stand. Put your pants on and like, you put it in my shorts on. But sometimes it's really, it's just like, it's a nice set down on me. When you have to say, babe, come put on my pants for me. It's not cool. Yeah. Sheave my butt. White my butt. Just put my pants on. Yeah. Just sit down. Yeah. Yeah. Two, two, two. One more. Partial. Got it. So let's go over and just finish that off. And then we'll be a straight-run pull down. And then we'll finish up with some kind of extensions and we'll go over the other shot. I think we'll be on the coach. That's not a judge. My sheet of cables only right now. We're just going to contract and make sure that my muscles are like firing. And now they sort of feed myself up. It's going into my muscles. So it's like diving on that eating line now. I had a little extra cards. So just really make sure the muscles stay alive and move in. And that's not going to feed them up. And definitely not trying to injure myself with fucking heavy rows when I'm this dry and lean. My like, you're flush it and you're flue it and fucking all your joints. Like my spine can like hurt sometimes. So nothing really body was part of all cable shifts. We used to piss out of it. We're half of these last few workouts. And you know the drill. You're right that back. Good. Try that back. Good. Good. One more. Good job. How's it going? One second. One more. Good. I'll just get it today. Three, two, one. Try it. One more. I can try that.

The seat of the last day is pretty good. We set that quite nice. Get that back, one more jump. Hold it, hold it like that. Hold it like that. Hold it like that. Hold it like that. Hold it like that. You need a little. Watch. There's too much. There's too much. Too light. Oh yeah. There's shit with the view. Good. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. That's it. There you go. Come on, it's good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. One more. Super set. Yeah, it's cool, but. It's like a burger. There's a lot of stuff to do. There's a lot of stuff to do. There's a lot of stuff to do.

Do you have to pick one sugar kid? What is this? Classic. They're all classic babies. I need to send this to Melissa. She's gonna die. Women's that's the best. They are the 990s. Nevermind. 590s. You would say that. I don't know. I don't mean that. I don't mean that. I don't mean that. I don't mean that. So hurry. We got the law. We have the law. Billy. Bobby. Yeah they do. I'm like brown black. I'm good. I don't care about clothes. I know you love the website. I don't know. I love the website. Wow. Bobby some nice kicks. We got a pair of Jordan Threes. I first ever pair of threes. Got the muggles. Beautiful sugar. Jordan got the muggles. You're not that sure. One of my favorite shoes. So it's like that. It's like that favorite online store. So we're checking out the muggles. But the shadows are the guys that have been accepted. Give them free shirts and free socks. Give them free shoes. I'm sure everyone your shoes. I'm not sure of them. I mean it was too bright in there. It's too bright. All right. So back from the mall. We're in the whole legit calories. My weight was good today. So I got a bunch of food. And I got a bunch of cheese. So we're like. I put them all. My first pair of Jordan Threes. So something more I need to provide. Why would you? Why don't I get one? Does that like a cream? It is cream. And like a light blue. It's very nice. Just a little hint of red. I like it. So maybe we're going to have to jump tomorrow. That would be like all the pancakes and bacon. It's a cool accomplished shopping bag. Putting up the delicious shoes for sure. But. I can't talk about these. Well, that's going to be wrapped on today. What happens today? Turn back to the eat. Some more food. And now we're back to the ground because tomorrow's Tuesday. And then I have to weigh in a PMO. I do like I said. So we're trying to go over a game plan. Of like how are we going to have my weight below 240 at 8 p.m. Because like at night I'm like 246 typically. So it's just a. Renching the game plan. Then we typically do considering weighing in at 10 a.m. A lot easier. So we're figuring out maybe I just drink a lot. Eat a meal throughout the night. Train really early. And then kind of nap all day. And just chill. Lower my sodium a little bit. Then it'll make me flush more water due to less water. And just like monitor it. Be on the scale all day. Making sure I'm not going over or over too much. And then kind of be there by 8 p.m. So we're going to figure that out. But tomorrow's still working out. So I think we are maybe just because my last full workout workout took two say. And then I'll be doing like a lighter upper body. They said one say probably. And roll out all the week.
