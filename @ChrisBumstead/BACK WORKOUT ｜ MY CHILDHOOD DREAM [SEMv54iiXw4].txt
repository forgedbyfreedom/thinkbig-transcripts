So good and tasty What's really wanted to eat some fucking bread? Jeeam Shake bread, that's all I'm making baby Fuck Come on, come on, Chris! Hey, I'm your one, two, four, two, three, yeah, let's go! What's that? What's that? Music Did you close the front of me or then a shatter? Because you're fat? No, just looked at it. My ugly ass mug just fucking broke it in the middle of pieces. I'm actually trying to be proactive and clean. I was getting rid of all my old t-shirts and I was dragging the garbage bags down. I should bump in and that's over and I'm pretty pissed. But I couldn't do that. So I just wanted to switch into perspective, 7 years, good luck. Last all about perspective, you know what, about that? You're the truth, it's gonna be bad luck. And then you're also like the manifest bad luck. I'm sure the truth is gonna be good luck. So good things are coming, it's Chris, but come here. You're all welcome. No, it's not like you don't have an elevator place. I'm not in fucking break that mirror. Yeah, it'll be hell. And all of them, anyway. But anyways, what is up YouTube today? I'm like setting day. We're going to bear Jackson, which is like a really famous car show. Probably the second biggest car show in North America after me come. Like an auction where they bring out like collectible on a mobile. Like usually vintage ones. And I'm been dying for my 28 or like 18 years probably to get up. Three cars I really want, 70 charger, maybe 68 charger, 67 Camaro, 69 Mustang. I'm holding off because I want like a fucking beautiful one one day when I can afford like custom building one. For me, I would love to get, I'm probably not gonna get one here, but I'm gonna go look at a bunch of them because I have a bunch of vintage old cars. I don't even know if they had chargers, they have list online. But I just really love old muscle cars and my grandpa, which didn't really get to know very well. He owned, he passed away when I was pretty young, he owned a mechanic shop. And I think he had a plimate bear kuda or something. Very similar to a charger, but he was into cars. And he used to talk to me about some other really young, I remember I could see him around and shit. I was like always wanted one ever since then, and I really had a connection with double cars. So one day I would love to get one. So we're gonna go look at them and check out the auction, just got something cool to do. It's in Palm Beach, 20-30 minutes from us, meet Dom, same eating, filming, Matt, Jensen, all going to go check it out. So we're gonna bring him along for the ride then later. We're all trying to get together. Oh, I was gonna go to Miami. But yeah, that's what's going on then I can train back a little bit later today. So leaving him like 30 minutes, I'm just killing down there until we go. So I'll see you guys out there. Hopefully he doesn't rain because it's a little bit of a monkey day, at least it's not hot. It's really ugly outside. It's beautiful outside. It's kind of nice to have them. Oh. And people right here on the left, he's the opposite. Also, thank you so much. If no idea where we're going, we're definitely going along the way. He's definitely not so worried about it. Oh. It's not the right way. I feel like we've got a park somewhere more to see me from there. We need to go to a fucking 12. Well, he told me that. Fuck that guy. This guy's drove all the way up here. He drove right in where we've walked in. Well, I didn't think you could. But he just... Yeah, our cars look like they fit here. For sure. There's a lot of food. Oh, 14. There you go, make me. He's going back. He's going back. I'm on my car. I'm on my car. Please, just jump. Yeah. He's on my car. Oh. Oh. Yeah. He's on my car. Oh. Well, he's on my car. Oh. He's on my car. Yeah. This is fucking ridiculous. I think. So good. Everyone's on my car. This is fucking ridiculous. Yeah. Just walking outside of the room. Bro, it's a hurricane. Oh. Oh. Whoa. I think that's what you put. This is the name of the name. Yeah, that's what I'm going to call it. There are two, I looked at the history and they go through like one 15 to one. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's not perfect to what you want. Like you get in the custom, make every piece of it. But I don't think that's true. I like things here. It's like that whole leather. Yeah. It's a little Dutch. Good brown. It's a little brown. It's a little brown. This thing is called f**k it with the name of this. It's whole car is my private. Yeah, this is the city. I think it's about the image I was going to be like two days ago. That's all I've been put here. So if you get in the car, you just like that. This car is the stronger than metal. Carbon fiber is like a breaking. It's a 1970. It's a 1970. It's a mere of a dominant tread of zero watt. But that's a little too fancy new for me. I want to finish looking one. I don't know the screen of it. Yeah. What about the touch screen here? It has apple park on it. It's totally dynamite. I think I can imagine the one side put a sound to it. It's a little bit of a... Yeah. I think it's a bit of a... Yeah. We got two. I thought I was... I thought I was... I thought you were... About two volts. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. I'm serious dream park. Yeah. I see it so long. It's so long. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. It was a car. Give a P1. What? Give a P1. You want it? Yeah. Right there. Yeah. That's where... That's the 10, 16, wide body. I think? I think it's something to see. Onward. You're on? Yeah. I don't know. Just... Of course, it's up. It's a little bit different. That's the wide body. It's a 10, 16, wide. Look at the door. It's a two-door. Yeah. That's the actual line of the car. That's how wide they're almost at the 20s. Really? Yeah. This kid is only... It's like a front splitter, a part of the new wing. This part is just a bottom. The only thing it adds is that, like, see that thing, like that bul out right there? That's... You've got a back-up here. Okay? Before they get that. Yeah. That's the only thing it adds. There's your truck, grab your arm. And, like, that's what I was talking about. You know, actually put my arm on. You can go through it. The second stick here. That's just a whole by row. Because it sticks in the middle. It's not big right here, don't you, don't you? Get another four? No, I've still got no 40 in the shop. Right. It's not like the... The... Like the flag, like the stitch in here. Yeah. This is... No, I do. I don't like the color, but... Yeah. This is good. You know, the pants are all about the clothes. What? The pants are a little bit funky. I don't like the girl they throw on. They're just like... You're beautiful. So, right now. Oh, that's a right here, right? Man, one. Oh, honey. Oh, honey, you see that right there. Get them here? That's... Nice color. Is that good? All right, feel it. This is exactly what I want. It's not made of... Rip. Rip. It's almost a lot of old cars. They take it from that in bulk of cars. You go to a tree. And then they keep the original frame on it. And sometimes the original frame is like being the shit in our new days. But, the beautiful is the car. So, that company's lost. He's got... Give me that Bronco. They're starting to make these soon. Might tell me what the good time. This shop is fucking good. Yeah. I still beat up. Have you ever looked at it? That's why I like mine. It's broken. That's really... It's one of those nice chip-a-noss in it. Look how you get it. Oh, they picture me, too. It might dad told me a story when he was young. His neighbor bought this exact car. The judge, they call it. Funny actually, too. He said all the kids in the neighborhood used to... Drive up and take pictures of an afternoon term in the oven, around the entrance. They're all about cars. Knock out the wood. You all in there? I wish you'd want a regular take. You'd take me down there. There's a few there's one here. I'll be honest with you. This is over here, right? Yeah. This is another one too. Time? It's got... It's kinda... It's the whole time I have the whole... Skin on the body on my side is all like... ...way-be-indventy. Looks like that. Yeah, this is just like old steel. This is sick though. I kinda like when the inside looks beat up though. It's okay. That'll be in the room, if I could. Probably. Probably. It's actually in the bathroom. It can be in the bathroom. It's in the bathroom. Isn't it? It's all from the trunk. It opens the door. Oh, it's in the bathroom. There's a lot of teeth. Look at me on here. Look at me on here. Look at that fly also. Look at egg. I don't want to touch it. I don't want to touch it. I don't want to touch it. So, we're gonna get it, Matt and look. What is that? First, we've got to get it, Matt. Dude, get that for a recording. Put it in the garage, and see if we can show it died. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. I have to sit under here. So I got it under the floor. I just want to put that on. I don't even care for your life you'd be driving this way. I don't even clothes. It just walks in with the door handle. Wow. I don't see what I'll do to you. This whole view of Grand National. So, you're looking at the comfy steps back in the day too. You're like, help you. You're like, help you. Oh, yeah, it's a seat belt. Under 20, right? Under 20? Yeah. Right, it's a bit. Under 20, right? Under 20? Yeah. Right, it's a bit. It's what I'm happy to drive and make it down. Oh, you got to drive me into the... Yeah. Together with me, yeah. I think this might be spray paint, too. I think it'll fuck something up though. What is that? I'm curious. I think that Pvis-Dish fucking vinyl roof they put on these cars though. That is. I think he died. Yeah. I'll tell you what it looks like at 27. That's a manual there. Another Dominic Tradocar, 70 charger. It's fucking V6. I mean, this one does both wild, but I... I know how I got in my boat. He got one of these and he said that. He gave it a... Just chaos. I think it's like a standard of drivers. I don't know. Alright, so to wrap on Barrett Jackson for the day, a few dope cars. I didn't see really, I saw a few 69 musts in there, but I didn't see any mock ones that were the boss. And not a 4, 290, there was a little boss 300, but some dope cars, a few dope Cameros. There was a 68 RS black. Exactly how I wanted it to be, except a lot of Maddox not manual. But it was a little old. There's a few online that are really good price, and I found one was like an LSX Supercharged Motor in it, so they're like 650 horsepower with a new engine. So I'm like tempted to get one eventually, but I mean, I also just wanted to see that if I really got the H sub I1, and I kind of did, honestly, their fucking, I love those guys. So those old Cameros are the charges. But for now, I'm gonna resist. I'm gonna use my discipline to resist temptation. Maybe one day I'm gonna pull it up with the fucking Cameros and rip it into the three two burnouts. Until then, I'll be patient and go work out with get you. So that you get for joining a lot of my projects experience. What you need in bro? I'm gonna video where this black guy, some of his body needs to be in straight breath because he's so high. He's a dope. He's called the Hybrose. He's in checkin' it right. He's all I do with bro. I believe he's a good guy. I should have thought I could check it out with him. I've only used for two days and he's canning and send some songs. I can't believe he's a good guy. I'll stir fry it. Put them off that way. Stop eating. I'm really wanted to eat some fucking bread. Actually, I really wanted to eat banana bread, but if I have too much carbs. Where'd you go? Where'd you go? I can't eat before the gym. I can't eat my energy. Just eat something. What's the difference? Because it was rice, was fat, and fruit, and protein. Then this is just sugar and bread. So much I'm gonna be tired. I feel like I'm tired. I'm tired. What about energy? I'll pre-work it. Make spult on them. No. Bum energy is not gonna get you a pump. Bum energy will be around 5. I'm not gonna fucking sleep today. I'll have a Bum energy. I like a sleep tonight, but I'll pre-work out. That's how you drink. That's right. You alright? Are you good gym? No. What? No. Well, it's lost my hamster. So, it's a power book, my hamster. Alright, back there. Fucking hate busy gym. We're in a busy gym, so I'm avoiding the cable dumbbell area for now. And for the first time in my life, I'm warming up on something. Other than cable, pull down. This is the machine pull down. So it's not much different, but underhand, grip, power strength, pull down, get nice stretch in the lap. We're gonna do a bunch of sets to warm up for the fucking take and tired, but back there is. Do you think notice? That's a new merch coming out soon. That's sample on right now. First ever printed. Things drop in the end of the month, so stay tuned. I used to do these with like 110, 115 condom bills. I felt good. And there's a place in time for that. We're doing these with like 85 right now, given a week or but it's also lighter. And just squeezing, full of deep range of motion. Like, arching my back and pulling my elbow back and fly like, yeah.

Sometimes they're nice and Florida. I think I want to do that. But it's only when they see that. I'm using it to take the funnel protein into the bottle. It's like, it's going to be weird everywhere. 10 minutes? 10 minutes. You're not going to break the name as you got there. Yeah. They're always like to break these. I think they're lots longer. Yeah.

So, just let's do some imagination. I'm sure you've ever looked up as a sky at name. It would be grateful for the beauty of the world we live in. It's actually really blue because my camera just sees that as very blue. It's like purple blue, honestly. It's actually, I actually do love leaving this gym. Could you look up at the palm trees and then it's just like always a beautiful sunset. It's sunset down now, but it's nice. No. You can finish your work, it will feel good.
