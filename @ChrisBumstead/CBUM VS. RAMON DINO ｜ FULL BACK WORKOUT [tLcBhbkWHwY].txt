What's up YouTube? This is crazy man. This is crazy man. Come on, come on Chris. Come on, you're one. Two, four, two, three, let's go. What's up? We're a came in one of these and it was literally like a stripper pull in the middle, like lights and music. It's awesome. See how long it could have been. That was like the big red, all it could be. This is the car. I'm just wondering if there's anything in here. This week. Oh yeah, this tower line. Yeah, Jake picked that up with a bear Jackson. So that was super cool. Um, 1988 to 2019 for Olympia programs. So it's like old school. That's 2018. That's not that old school. But yeah, all these old magazines are in here. I think it's a little bit too old. I think it's a little bit old. It's a little bit old. Oh yeah. And you can't see anything. I think it's a little bit old. I'm going to talk to you about the personal experience. I think it's a little bit old. It's a little more professional. So there's a good job. It's a good job. It's not that old. If you think of a base, you can see the rest of the world. It's a little bit old. No way. You have to. I should take it for a walk there. No, no. But where are you going? I'm going. I'll be chipped on us. I said longer chipped than us. Yeah. Only a few hours off. What is up YouTube? You're here at the Olympia headquarters. You should be the one in the strength. Only headquarters out. We can strengthen all that stuff. We're kind of storage stuff from the Olympia pieces. There are some little shows. The front of the entranceways. Some cool old mouse trophies. We're here shooting a little promo for the Olympia. For Mondes then here with myself. I mean, we're going to get a work out into tomorrow. Some super excited about that. I really need to let it some Portuguese because all of our Mondes had to say it was just a shit crazy man. We saw it except in the speech. You know what I mean? But just to provide us this what we're doing today. You're near Zona. You do a podcast or something right now for a prime time muscle. And then train tomorrow and it's better to reach out. So say tune to her. We're going to prepare Mondes for the Portuguese. So Chris, you are the classic physique champion. You had a dominant performance at the last Mr. Olympia. But you had a chance to watch Ramon perform at the Arnold Classic. He was the winner. What do you think of Ramon? Did he get better from the Olympia? What do you think he got better? And what do you think he can improve as a competitor? I think he looked better. He looked sharper and leaner. He looked like he was a little bit tighter and drier. Maybe it's a show. A little bit leaner. He had a lot more time to prep. I think he's just going to be kind of filial on his frame. I think some of his shots. He felt him with a little bit thin. Maybe that because he looked leaner the show. But I think he looked better than he looked at. Now I just want to add something. Because a lot of people were critical of him because of his posing and the Mr. Olympia. They said, hey, Chris was able to expose you in the pose. Did you feel like he improved on the pose at Arnold? I'm tired for me to say it because I was so focused on myself. But you won't be. I didn't know it was having you with posing. But I know it was posing look good at the Arnold. So I didn't see any flaws in it. We did a live on Olympia TV. And I kept asking you, who you think can be a threat to your crown as Mr. Olympia? And you looked straight at me and you said, I think these guys are fighting for second place, tearing. Do you still believe that? They're just fighting for second place. I do, yeah. And I mean, it was Arnold. I'm sorry, I was in Vermont against each other at the Arnold. I think it's going to be that battling for the next Olympia. I just got to beat myself next year. So do you have any strategy to change anything based on what you saw for a remote? Or you just don't care. Are you going to do your Chris for the next time? Do you go do the Chris Bum set? Thank you. No, I have a strategy to be better, but the strategy to be better than myself. Not anyone else. So that's a goal. Very nice. That's all. Thank you very much. I think you could put gas in it. Just keep the receipt. We'll keep you up 20 times. But you should be okay. Take your eyes or go. It's diesel. It's diesel. Yep. As you get to know. Yeah, right. And it says it on here too. Oh, it's not the right thing. Yep. All right. You guys are all set. All right. You're all. I jokingly, jokingly. We're going to get taco tack up the Uber. I was jokingly like, I'll take the spinnerband. They'll drive everyone dinner tonight. You're all too sure. Take it. So here we are. Look, it's spinnerband. I think it's a big ask. Try it back to Florida. All right. This is a one of the bigger things. I think it's so much bigger than I thought. I just presumed it was the same size as that fan. But I had the eight key while I'm here. Fuzzy's. All right. So we made it with a crashing. The Kelvin has highly recommended. I'm going to try the taco shop. So this is his redemption for an angel of barbecue. Because that'll be better than that. I'm sure they check it. And I can't eat those. Oh, that's a good idea. That's a good idea. For here. For here please. I don't know what's left. What do you put on? Those are good. I don't know what this is. There you go. decent, right? Okay. 4G tacos. Way better. I can remember the way. 4G is a little still. It could use a little more sauce on it. It's a good chipotle or sauce, but it's good. Edible. Solid. 5 out of 10. But for 10. You're old too right now. Listen. I don't know why I keep listening to you. I wasn't gunning. Sure. Oh, by the way. We're fucking traveling. Don't let Kelvin pass. They might have been at towards you too. We look at it. Dr. Warren. I wasn't gunning for a good place. I was gunning for a taco. And last time I remember it was good. You can leave me alone. I didn't. I didn't. Raven thought that recommended. Just a name alone. Fuzzies tacos. Like it just have 30. I like a clean shave in taco. Alright. So that's a wrap on today. To the poor cheap podcast. I don't do what they sell on it. But they just wanted to. We're going to have dinner tonight. They go to bed and climb tired of fucking the hundreds. We're going to train with Mr. Dino tomorrow. So pump for that. See you again tomorrow. Hey. Say hi to you. Yeah. Okay. On this planet. Yeah. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. It's a whole lot of money. And then you head to Brinkress Corby. Hello.
