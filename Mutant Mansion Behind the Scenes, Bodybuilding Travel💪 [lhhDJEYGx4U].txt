So, less than a week ago, I get a call from the guys at Mute and they're like, hey, what do you think about coming out to Vancouver and recording your podcast live with Dussie and Ron from West Coast Iron? Maybe check out the facilities, check out Mute and headquarters, and today less than a week later, I'm in here, we're heading to Vancouver, so I think you guys posted, this is going to be a pretty trip, like I'm even more in staying, alright? This is gonna be interesting, this is truly an adventure. Alright, we're here. What is this? Come on, we're here. Come on, man. Come on, man, let's go. Come on, man. I'm sick of getting things going on. Hello. What's up? Is that the secret weapon? She's the proger there. Gay color. Send me the Mx. Yes. The Mx is actually sending us to the community. I think they didn't even see the stress, they said they're sending us to the community. You know, like, you said we like mad ones? Right. We are live. Welcome. It's just bodybuilding live from West Coast Iron. courtesy of mutant, of course. We got the flag. We got dusty handshaw, fresh out of the shower. And amazingly enough, mutant brought Scott McNally up to settle this up for us. And get this live and we appreciate everything. And that's it, that's life. Remember everybody? It's just bodybuilding. What do we got here, dusty? Beef, cherry hot beef. I went, um, your 50% being because you got veggies. Uh, I'm 0% being the sister meat you're right. Dusty your food has a light in it. The thing is, you can only eat the sushi pizza, not to eat the light. That's the light, it was, that was a second time with the hospital, but the real thing. Girl, I'm like that.

I'm going, I like, another one's fake. All the way. Wait. What is it? Now. Blow it. I'm gonna get eye-cossacks. I got one more blow. I don't know what I got. I see me go there sometimes. Which one I'm going to switch up on a bit. From here to here. I'll start with the little bit of men's lips. So you can drive it for the end. I just thought, hey, it's really on balance. It's not my men's lips. So now I'm gone. Have you trained yet? Yeah. We're out of trained today? Yeah. Pretty soon. Okay. Follow you guys around. You're waiting for the rush. Call me. Call me.

I was born in patient. And like a damn free place and I'll run this nation. Call me. Call me. We're working with the group. He's a little bit co-coated. How'd your day go? Day was phenomenal. Say it was phenomenal. That's fun. I see you're trying to do this in a fun day. You should have worked to do this. You should have worked. We're just checking. We got a knock-out. All-life has nothing to do with their goals. And you should like, eat. We're catching the action. The food's burning. We're putting it in a bodyguard in the box. Yeah. I see that. I see that. I see that. Yes. What do you have there? I need to get a bit of a chicken. And rice. Oh we got chicken and rice on the hands. You have a bodyguard in me. Oh we use pineapple. But garlic and garlic is the most measured out. Trying to keep up. You're not a chance. So Jamie, what's the secret to your coffee making skills here? You've got the instructions. You're getting back to form. Like the side instead of half in the serving you're doubling it. Double in it. This is legit the strongest coffee. I think I have ever had in my entire life. I'm so awake right now. It's not slow. Two spoons in per cup. Oh my skull is off. One spoon per cup. Or some heavy. I usually do like one tablespoon per two cups. That's what we did yesterday. That turned out. So what he did. He did. I did two per one cup. Who is this strong? It was the strongest coffee. This is after we added more water. That was like after we added a bit more. I feel like I'm going to be in the bathroom. Real quick. That's enjoyable. That's good. Yeah. It's good. It'd be ready for your day. It's good. It takes that much just as a feneronous coffee. I've never eaten a chocolate. I've got a block of block. So I have to know what goes on here. This is preparation for the next round of shoots. What do we got going on over here? He's right to jam. Yes. What are you eating? I asked him with our mouthful. What are you eating? We'll come back. Dusty. I just did six eggs. Four pieces of toast. I triple chopped coffee. I'm way over it England. Yes. That's what I do it. Keep it classy. Keep it classy. Alright. I'm going back to Shelby. Boom. You can have morning. Oh, my. Five ounces. Um, we all. Here he's. We're going to stand there and buy the bill there. Correct. She just woke up. Sorry, guys. I had. Oats. And. Tea of butter. Alright. And. Actually, two more eggs. Yeah. You guys aren't training lakes today. Are you guys not? Alright. One more. We're going to go. Whoa. And what is it? This is what a giant breakfast looks like. This is a stall. I'm going to. It's those. Yes. Four eggs. Yes. Nice. I don't have any of the few tables of people for myself. And me and his, like, basically everything you could possibly need over here. I was going to get a bunch of stuff over here. Now, how is breakfast going to look different tomorrow? Do you know for sure? No. It's going to be the same because I'm not a crab. So. What's your idea? Call it. Call it. And that's going to be. You got to be in here. 78. It does seem to be very dangerous. That's right. Let's go down here. That's the important thing. We're going to go on. We'll ground beef action. Yeah. I don't want to be at once before I train this. We're going to ground beef. Meals. I'm going to show you guys a little jam. If you don't know, Dale's. Dale's life. Changing for ground beef. One of his nails. Garlic powder. Onion powder. Now can you get this code? Does he 20? Yeah. It is some of these nuts. Oh, there you go. It's not. So yeah. You should definitely have a taste. Tears from the half per pound or else it gets salty. Like, it's not. Do you want to start with the taste? Yes. What's that mean? The agenda for today. Well, these both are going to have a jam. And they're going to go do their thing. Yes. You are coming with me to the office. You're going to go get it to work. And I'm going to show you around. Trace some stuff. Yeah. You have to sign it. You know, wait. That's what's the waiver. You get that. Okay. Talk about it. We're there. Okay. Okay. We're going to be exposed to stuff that you know, no one sees it. So this is not our traditional Vancouver day, right? Look. This will be going in. Probably like tomorrow. It'll probably ran. Okay. I think it's my fault. Kind of I brought it with me. It was still in a lot of Michigan. Yeah. It is. Always. Where's it? It's not going. You're on my way. It's when we put Jamie inside of the standard size for the equivalent. You got some clues here. They actually like this. It goes forward. Oh. That's a big question. It's not the ad going forward. Yeah. There you go. Seption. That's last. Just enough. You know what? Yeah. Well, I'm a sort of guy. So yeah. Yeah. This is the life of a shorter guy. A few. It was a different story. So coming to mutant. I had a vision being able to take video of like protein going into juggs and down conveyor belts and all that stuff and I did see those things and I saw the research and development where they're creating new supplements and flavors and stuff. I saw everything they're doing with creating new merch and different lines that are going to be a bit different. The only thing is they didn't want me to shoot video at any of that. So I wasn't what I expected but I'll tell you what. It was really cool to have that opportunity to check it out. The take home point to me is really that these guys they really do care about hardcore body building meaning like they haven't forgotten about their roots. And you know, that's not super common in a company that is growing the size of mutant. So I love seeing that. You can see it in the way they treat people. You'll look at the athletes that they support. Look at the way they take care of them. They even they advertise with think big. So it's pretty cool. Oh, and I did get a picture of this cutout with Ron. There you go. All right. Can you make that look like a pro? Yeah. You know, you're the host. I'm not. I'm the host of the most. I'm the host of the most. I'm the host of the most. I'm the host of the most. I'm the host of the most. I'm the host of the most. I'm the host of the most. We're we just here near what was this. And bull again. Yeah, it's this place. Good. The cross street with Jim. Stake rice, karaoke, those you need. Maybe I threw a little sushi in the day, you know. Yeah. And it's our with for us. Yes. Then five were here. And six were here that seven and eight. So that's what happened in your cross street with Jim. No, no, no, no, no. It's just well. It's cross street. You hear? Because of the second time you've been on the mission. Isn't it? Yes, it's my step. But if I was a quarter host last time. Yeah. Now I am Ron part of the year. You know, I'm going to be a little taller today. I'm going to stand up. Just angle it like this. Yeah, yeah. And I'll stand next to you like this. I'm going to have Ron kind of, you know, conquer down as they say. Yeah, you could have looked at one of those boxes for you to stand up. Yeah, it's really perfect. It's going to be good. Yeah, I'm going to walk and throw. And I'm going to ask Ron questions that I want to know. I think that I've learned that from Joe Rogan. Yeah. I'm not going to try to be clear. What is that to one of those? But what do you want to know that you don't know is a question. There's a lot. Yeah. I already kind of figured out like I want to get into like, what's your little fear? Because I mean, think of the pressure of being a quick and guy like Ron. Oh, I'm opening your own gym. Yeah. You've got to stack up against the best gym you've been in the world as you've been doing. It's easy to critique other people. Oh, yeah. And the businesses. Everyone thinks that the businesses are not in this easy. Yeah. You get into a gym business. Especially a hard-clutch gym. Yeah. Your carb-dub. Oh, I'm way too hard. I'm curved up just to watch. You know? What I might need you to spot us in one time. All right. Look for me as a, uh, we're a confident business. We're in a good team. Yeah. I'm going to miss something. I'm just taking off and we're going to Canada. I think you do it with the number. For a second. It's fun. You've got to look like you have a hustle of getting. You're like you do what you're doing. Yeah. Oh, no. Oh, no. I've got all my shoes. I got some mutants too. Oh, you do. Yeah. They hooked you up. They did. Nice. You got to get all the food. I've got some beer. Oh, yeah. Oh, wait. You mean got that. Oh, okay. Yeah. Glove of the. Gotcha. Oh, wait. Look where we're at. Family show. What's going on? It's best go starting. Oh, wait. I think that's one of the owners right there. I was so sick of it. I have to go in and get a hammer. A little behind the scenes here. So we're going to different talk. I'm going to do two separate. My. Oh, yeah. Look at all this. Oh, that's high touch. I'm going to get you. Oh, I'm going to get you. Oh, I'm up some lemon candy.

I just want to go hard and have a good workout and stay healthy and you know, so if you did some tea bars, we just did, I don't normally do those early in the work out. Yeah, this is not heavy, but there were good. I love that not always machine. Yeah, I'm going to be finished with it. That was a good one. It was really good. I'm used to starting with it.
