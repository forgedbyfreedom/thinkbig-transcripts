Now, a little, he was in the pumping iron. He was about 275. OK. That was in the 70s, of course, 1975. But here we are now 20 years later. And he was using the new supplements that were available. And yeah, now he was over 300 pounds. I mean, probably way over 300 pounds. Probably like 320, 330. So yeah, much, much bigger than he ever was before. You know, what's going on, guys? Welcome back to Think Big Body Building Media. And I am back today with Body Building Historian John Hanson. What's going on, man? Hey, he's got a high-done buddy. Great to have you back. People really have enjoyed the reaction videos we've done. And I'm excited for this one today. This is, what is it? Standing tall with Lou Froigno. What? What is this? What year was this? This was filmed in preparation for the 94 Masters Mr. Olympia. So it was kind of like a pumping iron, like take off, I guess. And it shows Lou coming back to Body Building. Actually, he came back two years before this when he went to Mr. Olympia 92, 93. And then I think he realized he wasn't going to win the Mr. Olympia because he just was too old and, you know, he's going up against Kevin Le Veroni and Dorian and John Ray. Those guys are much younger, better genetics. So the rumor I heard is that he talked Joe Weater in a creating this Master's Mr. Olympia contest. So he didn't have the title of Mr. Olympia. Okay. You know, no one's going to beat him because he looks fantastic for over 40. So he trained really hard in 94 to win the Master's Mr. Olympia. But as we know, Robby Robinson beat him at the contest and Lou got seconds. All right. Yes, it makes for good documentary and guys. Yeah, literally like how they prepare for the show. And I think Boyer Cole also was featured in the documentary as well. All right. We'll see about that. And guys, if you're new to our content, let me encourage you to subscribe and hit the bell.

Oh, the website is John Hanson. Okay. Cool. Check out John's podcast too. So quality here is not necessarily the greatest, but I still could tell you that that was a new base enough of watching this right now because of the hair and the body structure alone. You know what I mean? This looks like a really young Lou Ferrie, probably. It was probably 20, 21 years old or maybe younger. Okay. And now did he train somewhere at Worlds Gym? Did he train at Worlds? Yeah, so back in the early 90s, 80s, of course, too. They had Worlds Gym and they had Gold Gym, so there was pretty much two distinct camps. They had the Gold Gym crowd and the World Gym crowd. And Joe was good. Or Lou was good friends with Joe Gold, the owner of Worlds Gym. So him and Arnold and Franco, they all trained at Worlds Gym. Okay. Now here's that. That's Eddie Duley. What's next? See the same guy that jumped into Arnold's arms. So they're recreating the scene from Popeye. All right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Good money for that. That's right. New Zone training. I used from Brooklyn and he used train with Lou back in the day. Okay. You got ready to come and train with him for his preparation for the Masters Olympia. How old is Lou here now? I probably was about 44 maybe. Okay. I think he was 42 when it came back in 92. Let's see. It was born in 51, so if we do the math, this is 94. So 43 maybe 42. All right. So not too old. You're still in a good place for bodybuilding in my 40s, you know? Yeah. But he had a long layoff. He was his last Mr. Olympia was 1975 when they filmed Pumping Iron. And he never even again until 1992. So that was a long layoff. Did he start the Hulk and everything? Okay. So he started an incredible Hulk at that time. Yeah. Okay. He was supposed to go in Olympia in 77 and he was in California all year training for the Mr. Olympia. And it was the first time he moved to California because he lived in New York this whole life. And he was like a couple weeks out from the Olympia and then they gave him this offer to do the Hulk. So he dropped out of the Olympia. And I think he could have probably won the Olympia that year because he was really looking good. Everybody thought it was going to be between him and Robbie and then Frank Zayn ended up winning. Okay. Okay. Yeah man that incredible Hulk role I think is where he really became a household name. You know what I mean? Yeah. Peel and down. Four to ten pounds. Six feet five inches. Making Lou the largest body builder to have ever competed. Assisted by his best friend, Ayurban Kovsky. Lou has emerged from a 19 year retirement. And these years masters Olympia. The main reason why I came back is to tell I want people to think I would have passed them. I really want to turn just into my ultimate dream to be a world champion again. That's over the age of 40. You could have never want me to appear and I want to be the best. The reason why people want to be mature to live here because they want to say I am the best build man on the planet. The world, the best of the best. They only want this to limp here. You can be misuse or you can be misuse or you can be misuse or you can be misuse or you can go with the national. But misuse or limp here means you are number one. Let's go. Wait there's one Mr. Olympia but he's also the master's Olympia is what he's going for here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He didn't release me last. Yeah. The master's Olympia is really a simple goal of professional body building. It was an idea that Joe Weater had thought about for a really long time and it was the bring back only former greats who had been in a previous Olympia. What it was was to get all these all time greats that many of the people remembered going back is much as 20 or 25 years. To get him on stage again. Yeah. Yeah. It's a long one. Zero. Well, I think I can tell the understanding if anyone wants to come back and compete in the missed all the good competition. It is just a very Arnold Schwarzenegger. It looks like young seven-time Mr. Olympia. You know, to come back out of retirement and to get back into the swing again and to get that momentum going in the rhythm going of training and to create the hunger, which is the most important thing to the will and the hunger to train four or five hours a day in the beginning. You get to the number. They did what? They did what? Arnold looks like someone. How he did in Terminator 2. He does, doesn't he? Yeah. You would do it. That is the kind of will and hunger that you need. See about lose age? He's four years older. Four years older. So he's in his mid four years of 20. Yeah. You can lose the competition. So that's the most dangerous thing to do. He's to go back and maybe not create that hunger and that will anymore. And I think that's the obstacle that Lou Ferigna has to overcome. One thing of the unstange you want to be in the best shape, but everything is then the mind. So I thought I would hire and I put together. No one knows better than two of us. But I put myself in a position. Okay. I'm not going to fight with you for the contest. You see, I really need some to do tell me. But if a path I will fight with him because I want to make sure to be a winner of the Magnumite Heavy Body Pot, I oppose him. I'll say I'll be a workout. We'll check my clock with. But the most important thing is just time to peer the years to go. It's your mind. Put it in the mind and do it that nothing could have stopped. But if you got pain, you'll work around pain, you'll wrap with your eyes. You've got to do it. So it's been the three jerks in saying it there. You have to fold them. You're going to do it. It looks very good. I like it. The limit more of a line. A little bit of a stretch. Try to do it. You're going to do it. First I think it's a real exciting contest. I know that I know I'm going to be really, I'm just really anxious to go see it. I was originally in front of a bodybuilding journalist. I said that Wayne Demilius said he wants to keep it to just former Olympia contenders. You want people that have been in the Olympia. What we're going to see now is people that you've read about for years and years and magazines for the competitors. They're really hype in this thing. So it's going to be like a high school reunion. It's going to be really great. And for the rest of us, I probably have to hold back tears because it's going to be like seeing my old friends up there again. People I used to compete with people that I read about and I interviewed years and years ago. It's going to be really nice. Yeah, down competed a lot in my late 60s, early 70s. He had a pretty good physique very fiasco. I don't think he ever competed in the IFBB. He was doing more like the AAU and then he went to the WBBG Dan Lourry's organization. I never even heard of the WBBG. Dan Lourry was like a rival of Joe Weader. And then his own magazine, Muscle Training Illustrated, and then he had his own organization called WBBG. And he had a called like Mr. Olympus, which was like, I think he was really Olympia. Yeah, yeah. Where were they at? Was that also out of like Los Angeles area? New York, I think. New York. Okay. Yeah. WBBG. You've never heard of them company. Mr. Worth. Or where you've seen him to feet blue and win the masters of Olympia title. I like that machine. Yeah. That's one of my favorite machines from Hammer's Things. I don't like the Closquer Pando. I like that one. Exactly what he's doing. I just maybe my technique would look a little different. Trying to keep my chest worth the pad. Just really great for the lower lats. For me, it's something that I've always wanted to do. I mean, being big and strong goes as far back as I was five years old. I used to either buy the bodybuilding magazines when I had money and when I didn't have money, I'd steal them from the grocery store and look at the pictures. And I remember it had to been five years old because I couldn't read. All I could do was look at the pictures. But at that time, that's, and I wasn't, at that time really clear that you used to wait to build a big strong body like that. I just knew that when I grew up, that's what I wanted to look like. I recall my grandfather had a barber shop. And I used to shine shoes in his barber shop. You know, when I was 14, 15 years old. And I used to tell people who I'd be shining their shoes that I was going to be Mr. America one day. And these guys would politely look down from their newspaper and nod their heads. And I'm sure they had no idea what to help Mr. America even was. Much less this skinny little kid in front shining their shoes is going to be Mr. America. But I believed in myself. And I think a lot of that has to do from basically everything where was he for us? A product. Louisiana. Okay, I heard that accent. I wasn't sure. My parents in school year. That sounds like you're going to be a Louisiana name. Yeah, right. So how old was he about at this time, if you remember John? I tackled the I continue to. He was about Arnold's age. So he was, okay, this is pretty clear. Okay, see you guys. I'm telling you, John knows literally freaking every detail about everybody building from this era, especially. I look like he's a great guy. I've had him on my bodybuilding legends podcast several times. He's very articulate, great stories, very honest, just a really good guy. Do me a favor, send me a link to one of those and I'll drop that in the description. So people can go and hear more from Boyer. Yeah, absolutely. And he's a great guy with Bronson. He and I are about the same size. We're about the same strength level. And he, again, is very determined. Has a high degree of intensity puts everything in his workout. He pushes me out push him. It's a friendly competition. Many times, if it's just him and I and the GM, we can go through the whole workout. But probably not saying more than, you know, how much weight you want on this exercise or something. Because we're so in tune with working out. The training is quite exciting. So, is he still in Louisiana here? Where's he at? He moved to California. I think in the late 70s. So he's, I think he's still in California to this day. Okay. This doesn't look like goals. It doesn't look like worlds either, does it? Yeah, it's another gym on the worst train. It looks like I have a dumbbell, so. Yeah. Yeah. Back in 1980. That's the boom came in there for a minute. Yeah. That's what he's doing. Well, Louis, Louis is just a big guy. I mean, if Louis didn't have the height that he had, you know, which obviously makes him stand out. I don't think he'd even notice. Well, for a whole time, if he's so much taller and bigger than everybody else, headhand undoubtedly, his he enjoys a great popularity because he was fortunate enough for me and I hope so. You know, it's he has a lot of press, but as far as being a bodybuilder than I say, that I'm fear or that I've learned about. Yeah, I'm not in the least in the other words, but he decided. He's got some thick arms. Come back. What did he do to us still? He did the size of his hands compared to his forearm and his arm. Yeah. So I'm going to say it's kind of like the father Kelly, this one. So this time it's like the father competing against him. It's like the own boot competing or the own leg competing against the young man. The old line never tells all the people. I think what they were trying to make war like the bad guy. Yeah, yeah. And they were kind of like creating a scenario like pumping iron did, you know, where the world I don't know if Blair would really sound like that, you know, to and if he was just being himself. You think they were like feeding them those lines that they're like, hey, we want you to kind of do this. We're going to make some entertainment. Yeah, I think probably they tried to create kind of like a doc huge arm, like pumping iron was where they tried to create these, you know, rivalry. And I don't even know if they knew Robbie was going in it because I don't think he's in this movie at all. So you're kidding me. I think Robbie was like kind of a last-minute entry. Yeah, yeah. A win for sure. And then Robbie came in and beat him with his incredible shape, you know, with a small waste and everything. Yeah. So it looks like he's doing it every here. I'm going to run forward just a little bit. See what this is all about. This is, this does not look like the show. Okay, mental weight, weight, mental weight. This is mental weight. This is mental weight. This is mental weight. This is mental weight. This is probably not the only thing that's probably not the only thing that's probably the one. Because I know after he competed in the 90th of Olympia, he was he was on the guest posing tour, you know, for a couple of years, you know. Okay. Do you ever see him, guest pose? No, I never did. No. Yeah. Would you have still been in the Chicago area at this time? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Man, I would have loved to have trained at Quads Jim back in the day. Yes. Back. That would have been cool. There. And what is the other one? U.S.A. Jim. U.S.A. Jim. That's what I was going. Oh, you're going to U.S.A. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Quads was a little bit far from me. So I was going to U.S.A. Chupsan off the lawn. Yeah. Yeah. I hear that's a rough area that he's in. Yeah. Southside of Chicago. Southside. Yeah. Every day I wake up. Every day I am cool. I bet I'm on. He was in the, um, bumpy iron. He was about 275. He was about 275. But, um, here we are now 20 years later. And, uh, he was using the new supplements that were available. Yeah. And, yeah. Now he was over 300 pounds. I mean, probably way over 300 pounds. Probably like 320, 330. You know, so. Yeah. Much, much, much bigger than he ever was before. You know. I'll tell you what, too, man. And you tell me what you think, John, because you have even more experience than me. But I, you know, I can tell you that I had to really push and eat hard to have the muscle I did in 2012. Um, then now, like, you know, by 2020, I, I really, I spent several years, basically like Lou pretty much retired from competing. Yeah. You know, focusing on the channel, focusing on my coaching and all of that. But obviously still training along the way, the muscle just keeps going on. You know what I mean? Even if you're not trying super hard. So I bet you that was a fact you're in to get older. Yeah. You what? I think your metabolism changes as you get older. And then you have some maturity, you know? Yeah. Yeah. So I see what they're doing here. They're really trying to hype him up as the favorite. And I guess it would have maybe been even a more successful documentary. He actually won the thing. Yeah. Yeah. You notice the camera angle like from behind of us that they did that in pumping our into. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Same angle, so I'm going to skip forward just a little bit here. We get back to some training. We want to be able to watch the whole thing in its entirety. So we're just going to skip forward a bit of time. Yeah. Back in the gym. Back in the gym. Okay. I think that's the way a few years ago. And I know he was really the final lose. Yeah. I think I'm not sure if he's in California at the time, but I think Lou might have been brought him out from the York just to train with them. Oh, no kidding. Manager of World Gym and longtime friend of Lou. There's a, you know, if anybody loves bodybuilding. If you, if you pick the top 10 guys that are in love with this bodybuilding game, from longevity, from longtime, from long span to the. He'd have to be way up there. You know, he's totally dedicated and in love with this. It's a part of his life, Louie. That never was fulfilled. If Louie wins or loses, he'll be. Louie will always be a champion. But he's doing now is fulfilling a dream. And the dream that is fulfilling, LB fulfilled in Louie's eyes. But that's what he's doing. He's fulfilling a personal dream of himself. As far as the people go, Louie is. And the same. Another planet. And so Louie is a superstar right now. Then we will always be a champion. Do you ever see him on that King of Queens TV show? Yeah, I did a couple times. Yeah. Yeah. He was kind of like a regular recurring kind of side character. Yeah. It's magical. Oh, he's awesome. If you really come down to body parts, it's just one good body part. I think he's his traps. That's it. You know, as far as boy or he's, he has everything, you know. A little distant of that. It's like a good all around package. The boy was probably coming back after like a senior layoff because he was in the 84 Olympia that that Lee Haney won. Okay. And I don't think he competed after that. So this was 94. So yeah, this was 10 years later. Okay. And doesn't have to, you know, like 200 pounds, 200 five pounds. And I remember for this show he was about 225 or 230. Okay. So I asked him on my podcast. I said, what did you do to get so much bigger? Yeah. He said he goes, I cut back on my training. I was doing more high intensity training. And he goes, I took a lot of growth hormone and steroids. Oh, right. They'll do it for you. Yeah. Because they had growth by then. But man, I bet it was freaking expensive in those days. Yeah, everybody was using synthetic growth hormone in 1990. So that's that accounts for the funny thing. Yeah. I remember seeing in the back of the magazine, John, where they used to have, you know, like you go in the back of flex and there'd be an ad, like, you know, call this number, or whatever, to get, you know, actual growth. Yeah. Yeah. And I called the number, man. I was like, man, I can't remember how old I was. But I was a kid still. And they were like, yeah, you know, we'll fly you, you know, you have to fly down to Cancun, Mexico, and we'll get you a prescription and the medications and send you home with it and everything. Obviously, there is no way I can afford that, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Man, that's the satisfaction I get on it. But it's the total result that you get from being the best you can be. Because I've got to look at content. Pretty big. And the content is all stuck to. Yeah. Very thick. Of some other people. It's only a week point was even have abdominals for somebody. You know, okay. But just weren't there. You know, everybody used to really criticize them about that. Is it he looks like he has a shorter torso. Yeah. He does. Yeah. And I think sometimes those guys with the shorter torso's, the, you tend to extend more and you tend to not have as much as, like, like, like a guy like Dennis Wolf being the opposite of that, you know, like long torso, highlights, kind of, you know, opposite shape. Well, I mean, we've had that smile. You know, you want to use your younger. You never really had abdominals. Yeah. Yeah. This must be loose home training from the lead towards Arnold. Oh, okay. Because I know we got into personal training for a while too. He was training a lot of celebrities. I think he was training Michael Jackson at one time. You're kidding me. Yeah. And I think I think he might have even had a good trailer full of weights. And he would drive to the client's house. And he was going to his trailer and he would train him there. Imagine that. Yeah. I think Louis had something to do with convincing Joe to lower the age to 40. So he would be allowed to enter. Which is fine. I mean, doesn't, I, I, I, just for it. I'm concerned. I don't give it down. Who enters. I feel like boy is the more of a champion in the lead. I feel like he's attacking. Yeah. Oh, Joe, we don't care. This is Joe leader, fine. Not staged at all. No. It's just, I'll be right now. We have to carry those rooms. Yeah. I don't even know. It's still here. Maybe it's not staged. Maybe it's not staged. We might mind at the time of the little training. I just see what you want. You find one, you know, my partner is going to work on my problem. I do. What's happening? Well, I came out. I don't know money. I was see only, I think, two or three hundred dollars for the guest pose in faith. I was so determined I think I'll home because I figured my only chance is to stay in California. So I slept on the beach for two weeks. Is that check, Norris? I don't mind it. Because you know food really has that. I called Joe, I begged Joe, it's a joke. Please, I want to go home. I'm looking at contract. I really want to stay here. I want to thank for the Mr. Lempie. I convinced him that I would not go to the lead body building. So for that time on, I started to do pose in the back of the beach in the main California. My home, like a dream coming true because I had to go home. I was not going to be a happy person. And Joe, I mean, saved my life. So what happened? Okay. All right, Joe, come on. So you see when I brought him here, I thought that that time he would be able to pull himself together. And I worked with him. I encouraged him and was preparing him to enter the Missile in Pilar. Believe that he would have wanted that time. Because you know, he was competing to these great champions. He would not have that heavy develop. His size, his muscularity, was awesome. And if he's trained a whole year, I was sure that he was going to win the Lempie and for a couple of years. There after. In back in the day, you just beg for a contract from Joe Gold and then you, Joe Weater and then you get to stay in the back of the town. If you're good, Lifetime. Yeah. I was a different person. I lied about my parents saying, I have perfect parents. I would have the kind of family like you would see on father-in-law's best. You're working right out of my house. The opposite. I carry or hurt Gild and Angle. Because he project all the feeling I made because he had other friend who policemen. They've read about this and my son at school, my son at doing this. He's getting it on the test. And then he would come on and see, look at my son this and this. What's the sad? I think the fact that he could not relate to me having a handicap, so instead he was then himself, probably hated himself. The fact that he had a perfect son that he did something wrong. So we had really no barn or connection. Well, you know the sad thing is when I was a champion of the one of our who loved me, he couldn't accept me losing. He only showed interest in the way that he made me, and he was trying to make me get an attention, but he couldn't see his son losing. He can't accept defeat. You know, we are many interested. I mean, it was like a lover, hey, relationship. Everything my father wanted to be a match in the be up, he said, if you had you here and you're going to be a great athlete, if you had you here and you'll be a popper to my chronic strength and that girl. So if you had her, I heard that initially, people I heard rumors that like his dad was really like his dad. So first of all, pumping iron, they made it look like his dad was his coach. And I had heard that he had all these resentments towards his dad and stuff for coaching him and all that. But then find out later, his dad really didn't coach him, right? Yeah. So like he said, his dad was always hard on him because he was deaf. Yeah. You know, he wanted like a perfect son and his son had a, you know, Lou had a handicap so then he was always hard on him. So Lou was always really skinny growing up. And then he got into bodybuilding, started lifting weights and he was a huge bodybuilding fan. Lou saw like the Mr. Olympia back in 1969 when it was in broke actually saw it in 1966 when it was in Brooklyn at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. So he saw like one of the first Mr. Olympias as a kid. Yeah. And then once he started training, he grew really quick and he was a big teenager, you know, six foot five. And then he won the Mr. America, IFBB, America and universe when he was only like 21 years old. Okay. And then he won the universe again in 22 and then he went to the Olympia against Arnold at like, you know, 22 years old. But Arnold more experienced and Arnold beat him. And then like when they made pumping iron. His dad acted as his coach and they thought that would be good for the movie. But he said in reality, his dad was never his coach. He was trained by himself, you know. Yeah. His dad wanted to be famous. You know, his dad wanted to like, to be in the movie. So his dad wanted to, that's why he kind of created this role for himself. Yeah. But Lou kind of resented that. And then this Lou said after he lost the Olympia to Arnold and serves new prey, his dad was like, call them a loser. You know, he just died. Yeah. He just wasn't supportive at all. And then he said, 26, Lou didn't even compete in bodybuilding. I mean, after Arnold retired, you would have thought Lou would have won in the Olympia against Franco. Right. And he goes to Toronto and he plays, he tries to play football for the Toronto Archimals. Man, he definitely would have beat Franco too because they wanted to, they liked tall guys, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we've been definitely between him and Franco and Zayn. Let's hear what Arnold has to say here. Arnold's back. And then you, that you meant to win this contest. And that faith in yourself and that vision that you have, winning that we're going to carry out there. That is what would take you through the hours and hours of breaking out through the pounds and tons of lifting weights. But if you have to first get you act together and first have to set your mind, that means that you didn't have it. And also he's got those insightful, champion tips doesn't he? You got some career practice stuff here? He's really, he's really hard to adjust his, you know, especially his lower back. I sent him for some extra ease and they had a tough time getting the extra ease through him because he's so, There he feels like he's doing it. It's all muscle. Yeah. They figured out the factors that would take to actually somebody his size and it didn't work. They had to like triple it because somebody his size is usually fat. He's he's 300 and you know, 10 pounds of muscle. So yeah, it's definitely a challenge to work on. Just relax. Just relax. Let's run it forward a little bit more here. Just relax. More anxiety. But I mean, as I said earlier in the press conference, I haven't changed anything in the last 10 years. I've trained just as hard as I would have followed the end competing. So I didn't really have to do anything special to get in shape for this context. And one of the things that I feel very good about is after training some 34 years and doing a lot of things right. A lot of things wrong. I believe at 48 and I hope to prove that tomorrow that this is the best shape I've ever been in in my life. I hope you'll appreciate anything. I hope you'll appreciate it. I hope you'll appreciate it. I hope you'll appreciate it. I don't know, I've been around for about 45 years old to 125 pounds. Six feet tall. A Mr. America and Mr. World has came out of retirement to compete into Mars event. You kind of miss it when you're not there. You've never how he did, John. When you run that stage, I mean, it's just you. He was, I don't think he was in the top five. Okay. What's interesting, guys, they had a lot of old champions come for this first one. I think they looked at it as like a one time event. Maybe you know, they didn't know it's going to keep going. So they had like Lou, they had Robbie, they had Boyer, they had Chris Dickerson, Danny Padilla, Bill Grant, so a lot of old timers that used to compete in the Olympia, they were all coming back. So it was pretty exciting to see all these guys come back after 10 years. Yeah. Yeah, I agree, Lou had a lot of muscle, but you really didn't have great shape. No, I didn't. And I think with the girls and stuff, his waist got a little lighter, you know? Oh, okay. We very impressive, don't get me wrong. I'm going to take anything away from him, you know. Yeah, huge guy. For sure. What did we say? I think I saw something he had claimed he was like 305 pounds and 1% body fat or something like that for this show. It's not my long nose lines. I know from 92 to 93, I think 92 was his first year back at the Olympia. That was the Erdogan, the H1 in Helsinki, Finland. And I think he might have gotten a little nervous overguided a little bit. And then when he came back the next year he was like 30 pounds bigger. Yeah. He didn't make the same mistakes. The other thing that he had here, which was, I don't know, the camera will show it. He had calf implants, which looked really bad. Yeah. I never knew that. Did you fix that up? My calves? You know, they weren't really small. They were developed, but they're just a little high. Yeah. So he couldn't have been plants this year. Your kid and me, did he eventually get them taken out or what? Yeah, he did. Yeah. You'll see him if the camera comes back. All right. I'm going to look for a picture too. I have to bring this up. But what's amazing about Lou is, you know, I really think he's like a bodybuilder's bodybuilder. He, this guy loves bodybuilding. And despite all the success and all the money he made doing the Hulk and then any other TV shows you might have done or whatever, you know, I'm sure he made a lot of money doing the Hulk with the syndication and everything. Yeah. I really feel in his mind he always wanted to be Mr. Olympia. He probably always wonders, you know, what would have happened if I would have just kept competing in 1977 and I wouldn't have got that Hulk roll. What would I have won? Could I then Mr. Olympia, you know, three, four, five times, you know, in Frank Zane was winning it. Yeah, here's the Kevin. I can't blow that up any bigger, but yeah, there's no question there. That's, uh, that's suspicious. There's Lonnie T for used to run. Oh yeah, man. He's all over the place as abs are in. In my column, I predict Robby Robinson to win this show. But I'm starting to think, you know what, LT, you may, maybe it made a mistake or very big mistake. That's one huge monster there. And I think of Lou Ferigno as the Hulk on TV, this big green monster coming out of your screen and you're delivering room and now he's going to be coming out of the posing day right into my seat in the front row. I can't wait. Lonnie is like an ultimate fan of the sport, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Lonnie was great. It's like all from Rotterie. But it's not like you knew Robby was going in it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And we're living a lot of the past. It's really great to see all the fellows again and I'm anxious to see what they look like and what they have accomplished. Alright. Go ahead. We could avoid any. Alright. And the uncanny. First egg or something. Here. Lou Ferigno's here. Yes. Herbert Thompson. Here. Oh, my God. Here. Is that a Pavilion? Here. Anypidilla. Louie was right. Louie was his right-use, one human being to be for a contest. They don't even mention Robby. I know that we've done. You know that Robby's name was mentioned on that list. Right? Yeah. If he was the winner, they don't even mention, they don't even show where they call them. You know what I mean? It's just one of them. It's just one of them. Yeah. Oh, that's an anti-professional competition is joked on the afternoon before the night show finals. This round of judging establishes the place where we jump in. We're going to get three round points. 94. Yeah. Why? This was all part of the Mr. Olympian weekend in Atlanta, Georgia. 1994. Yeah. Okay. So this happened the same time as the normal Olympia. Yeah. I think they probably did it on Friday night, maybe. Did I? Oh, that'd be wild man. Each other, for example, doing quarter turn. There's building for the number of biceps doing side chest, doing all the mandatory poses. You want to look great. They're looking at the big arms. There's Danny Pagia. Whatever happened to Danny Pagia, he's still up and Rochester doing personal training. Is he really? Yeah. He did, he was like my favorite short guy. And I really like he'll look at his physique. incredible physique. There's Trysu Galato. Same thing. This whole scene they're trying to mimic again pumping iron the guys in the audience talking about it. The next three who have come from Oslo Norway to compete in this year's competition. Robbie believes he can beat Lou and Boyer for the overall title. Come on show the whole shot. Let's see him from the front. I don't care about this. I think they're going from the front. I know if you need to see him or Robbie next to each other. There's legs. We're still waiting to see him. He's got great arms. He's got good triceps and biceps. There we go. He looks good. thick is how you know in general. You're always trying to real fit every area. So another dive always. I've never reviewed one area. In my particular instances, I've always been standing or one that's, in other words, I've always tried to bring everything up. There have been satisfied with the way my arms look. My legs are back or anything. You just get to work. You just get to work. You just get to work. You know, magazines go. They did what they were Sean Ray and Boyer Co. And they'd have a guest time. They were do workouts. I've been years. But yeah. Yeah, that was in like the early 90s. I think that flex wheeler on. It had Kevin LeVroni, Lee Priest. I was going for a little view. Then I don't know how old he was then. But he was a great shape factor. I would say legs are the not here. You know, his legs looked pretty straight up and down. And I think that might just be. Okay. And it might be the element of age making that a little more pronounced, especially if his upper body is even bigger and rounder. Yeah. Yeah. His legs were always kind of narrow. But I saw him once when I was a kid. I saw him guess. He did a seminar at a gym and then he came out and he had a special light. And he came out and he posed in his posing trunks. Yeah. I couldn't believe how good his legs looked in person. Yeah. Just from the hardness and the separation he had huge calves. Like they didn't look the same as they did in the magazine, you know. Okay. Well, losing that beaten him on legs either. So there's that. Who's Tan looks a little weird to. It's hard to tell. But I see what you mean. Look like kind of weird on his face. Yeah. That's a good shot on him. Yeah. He's a good chick. You've got to be totally focused. You know, you can have all the goods. But if you don't have your mindset on and ready to do battle more or less, I guess everybody else, then you're pretty much defeated. Troy's who could. It looks like he is training. Yeah. He does. Yeah. He just psychologically you prepare your. More like a football player or a basketball player. The same goes to bodybuilding. If you could have the physique, but if you don't mentally have it to go up there and stand in the pre judging tense all the time where you get drained, I mean, just stand there flexed through a whole pre judging with last about two hours. You know, you're physically drained. So if you're not mentally prepared and physically prepared like in football, you can be the feed of the before you use step on stage. What I've seen today, you know, again, if it depends on the judging, I think they all have come in an incredible shape, a better than I've ever seen any of them. I think if you're judging on cemetery, I think lobby is the best part of cemetery goes. If you're looking at overall freaking size shape, just monster, then you've got to give it to a roof ringer. If you're going for a hardness with kind of condition of bodybuilders in, then you've got to give it a boy and then you can just put it around. So really all three of you could win the show. It just depends on what type of judging what type they're looking for today. I would like to see a shot of all three of you together. I think they're getting better at that. Did you notice, did you watch the live stream of the Olympia this past year? Yeah. Do you notice they did do more straight on shots? Like they kept the camera where we want to see it more, you know? Yeah. You guys haven't seen any problems, so it's not something that looks only involved with just myself. So it's not anything big. I didn't have any cramps, right? I mean, shape or it's not being the exact same on a long stage. Like, I mentioned earlier, once it's kind of like right about, it's going to do it to, you know, how to do it. You street go over here and you've got to look at the shows that here. It's a little weird. We've got to get to the whole show. We've got to climb the park on the two out. How do you sweat? What do you get to do? Well, it's our girls band streaking. Yeah. Yeah. I swear, look like you had dream fan on. Yeah, maybe good. You know, it's street, and when you turn around, you can see the blotch is running here. You see it's all blotch. You should be right down here. Okay. I'm going to look at my peer. Oh, you're doing good. Conditioners, you as well. Good. You need to have to have a red. Are you going to get pictures? No. I'll be back to the hotel. You're the show, aren't you? This is show. Yeah, maybe not. I'm looking at it. No, that's the 92, and I reminded you. No. You went back out. You know, when you got to start white dwarf, and you knew where to put on, and you came after the second. I thought you looked much, much better. And then the third half of the look, I thought, it was, but we, I got to the road. You're really, really, who's just with you, too? You're really wise. You're definitely a better person. Yeah, I'm going to shoulder your stupidity. The one thing I think that was always the same for me, seeing Lou, was that I know him so well, and I know the kind of tenacity that he has. He has, It's his wife, Carol. The quality that I admire so much in another person. They still together, that he is a champion. You know, he has a champion mentality. I am the opposite of him. I am a woman who started out very young, doing five million things, and I can do them all really well. But I've never focused on one thing, blocking out all the rest, and me becoming a true champion that can win, you know, all these great awards. I never did that. I do all the other things that make me happy. And then, he had one direction, and that's what I see in champions in all areas, is that quality. To blanket all out, do the one thing they love, and be the best in the world at it. The competition is in progress, and the judges have cut the field to five for the final post down. Here we go, John, you ready? I think Dickerson made a top club. Who's the other one? Like a Uber, no. Oh man, that denim sleeveless shirt with a collar. Guys, for beating, you know, from the first minute when you see them in state, to then have a gun to win, but they believe they're gun to win. They should have another contest. They have a loser's contest or something like that, but not with this competition. It's winning, it's speeding, it's destroying the other people. And that's it, you should be standing out there as the victim, top of the pedestal, get this gold medal around it, get this trophy, take $100,000, go home and say, I was the best, that's what it's all about. If you wanted to do something else, then you have to do something else. Run a gym, train people, or do something else, but don't go in the Olympia. My whole life of carriage is suitable, but they frequently encounter suitable, but because it was my protection. I come to the realization that people have loathed the meat, to who I am, not because of the 300 pound hole, or the 300 pound bodybuilder. To try to learn something answered to my happiness, that's what you're saying. You don't have to really have an opportunity for beyond state. So, I feel like champion to make this. A lot of people turn against Lou with the whole autograph thing. Yeah. Where he charged people, $10,000, to sign pictures. There are a lot of people had a bad taste left in their mouth, because of that. I heard that was his wife's influence. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. On the level of the whole guy is, who will he vanish from Russia? He used to be pretty good years ago, but he was a hard-seeker. Of course, you knew who he was. Yeah. He's not going to get you down. Just for the joy of competing. It is other nonsense. If anyone thinks that he can then win, or that he can really show his best, the idea of competing is always that you show the best that you can be. And that that can match up against anyone. And that you could beat anyone and you best stay. That's why do you go in the compete. The idea of competing is that you want to show the world that you number one. I'll take that award to the third place finisher. And I'm very close to contest. To boy or co. Good job, boy. Good job, boy. It's the power to win. Good job, boy. Good job, boy. Good job, boy. And that second place is winning the silver standout medal, being presented by Richard Pizarro and Winner Robbins arms. It's the second place. So the medal ain't given to you. Move for a moment. The first one. Let's go, Robbins. Yeah. Yeah. A couple of pulls once we're saying. First of all, I'd like to thank Joe Weader for inspired me. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Yeah. Yeah. A couple of pulls once we're saying. First of all, I'd like to thank Joe Weader for inspired me. So, I'm going to honor everybody. Please serve me now. I want to thank all come out to thank Joe Weader for inspired me. Yeah. The Mama was getting really气 to talk to you. Just to take a look at your microphone. And and are coming together. So I really appreciate was doing this. He's wanted to slick. Yeah. At the club's club at least tonight as my first title online, you were one of our first name people who had his, and I went to the Youth���z, and I was scared thing possibilities, through the compete and what effort it took. Louis gave it the best that he could give. And Robbie Robinson may have had an advantage in the competition because when you look at Robbie's career Robbie has not stopped, Robbie started at 18 years old, Robbie's 47, and Robbie Robinson has been competing over 30 years. And he's never out of condition, and he's never retired. So if anybody possibly had the edge because Boyer had retired and long time and made attempts to come back and his look terrific, probably that person would have had the biggest advantage to win if any of them, it would have been Robbie. And Robbie looked a little bit more separated possibly. Obviously, nobody in the world's as big as Louis. Robbie, and as far as I'm concerned with the whole, I think there's a genetic factor. When's the over 40, 10 times? It will never magnify his name as one of the true legends of the sport. I compare him to Bay, Ruth, and Lou Garic. I compare him to Johnny and I just I compare him to Jack, necklace, depending upon the sport that you're looking at. Louis is Louis. Mike Katz, you don't get happy. You say Louis, who? You said big Mike, most people think of me when it's Arnold. It's short-sneger, when it's big Louis, it's Lou for Rigno. He doesn't have to prove anything to anybody. Louis for Rigno is one of the most respected and loved body bovers, and one of the truly great body bovers of all time. Whether he was second, whether he was third, whether he won, whether he didn't. So my hats go off to him. He's one of the most loved and respected men that I've ever known. And he will always be a winner with me and with the rest of the world of classical. I feel that a little bit here. I have so much of my life. I have my family. My wife, Lou. My children. You're going to be hanging a queen's pretty safe still, and another TV show. It's just tied up. I'm not going to change my relationship with them. All right. And the most beautiful part. So they're trying to wrap this up and turn it into like things are, it's still a successful documentary. It's a vibe I'm getting here. I heard he was like super pissed when he got off stage. He shouldn't have filmed that part. I would have met for more. Yeah. All we saw was him right here. Let's see, right after it. Yeah. So he just, we just see him for a second. He walks away. And we don't hear from him again till he's back home. And now he's composed. Yeah. I was able to process it, right? Yeah. And then it looks like they're going to. Is this, is this at the show or this probably under guest program? It's been a mission because it's time for me to move on. Do a PNR to the local government. You hire me. He's still like the Arnold retirement speech at the microphone. Like they didn't want me to. Today. Yeah. I love to do it to you. But we are my fan. And my poem is I will continue body beautiful. That's my life. But thank you so much for having me here tonight. And it brings a little sadness to me. But goodbye. And thank you very much. Man. What do you think, John? How was this movie? It was okay. It was pretty good. It was a lot more fun watching it with you because you knew everybody. You tell me you're interested to extra details. If I was just sitting here in the audience, which is sitting here watching this on their own, they wouldn't know all that stuff. So you bring dimension. You make watching these things fun, man. Or more fun. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like they were just trying to copy off a pumping iron and this was going to be loose. Mr. Olympia, you know, this was going to be his. But unfortunately, he lost to Robbie. And the story, I hear, I think John Romano said this, Robbie was living in Norway at the time. You out of the country. And he wasn't competing. I'm going to, when the last time you competed before this. And they break, they reached out to him. Wayne DeVillier reached out to him. It's a, hey, we want to compete. So then they brought him over from Norway. And then he ruined the loose story. Man. Well, good, good show nonetheless. I'll tell you what, too, man. I wish that they had the master's Olympia at the actual Olympia. That would be cool. Dude, I'd come in a day early to see that, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was kind of cool in the beginning because they did have a lot of those old-time guys. And I think that's what they created it for. But then it just became any pro that was over 40. So then you have the names from the 70s and the 80s. So it kind of lost its original intention. I think like Boyer said in the movie, I think they just created that Joe Weeder created that just for Lou, because Joe Weeder love Lou for now. I didn't interview a Rick Wayne who was one of the best writers ever in bodybuilding. And he was around in the 60s and 70s and he wrote for Joe Weeder's magazine and I did a long interview with him and he told me that Joe had kind of a love hate relationship with Arnold. Arnold was his main marketing guy, but Arnold was so, you know, he's such a smart ass. You would, you know, he was just always so biting type of humor, you know, and Joe hated that. But he loved Lou for a note because Lou was a nice guy and he wanted Lou to be the guy to go all the way. But he never did, you know, I mean, he just never reached his potential as a youngster because he had that whole thing. And when he was competing against Arnold, it was like, I mean, if you saw pitches of him at 21, 22, he was amazing. He was a monster. He was a universe against Mike Katzen Ken Waller who are veterans, you know, and he's 21 years old. Yeah. So I mean, if you would have had the right coaching and if you would have went up the California and trained at golds and stuff, but he stayed in New York, and then when he was finally moving out the California, he was finally going to reach his potential in 77. And if you ever saw any pitches of him from 77 as he was leading into the contest, he was bigger and cut. I mean, he was really good. And he brought up a shape. He brought up his weak points, but then he got that whole thing right before. And the potential was never realized, you know, and I think that's why he wanted to come back in the 90s because he just, I think it was Antonio. He could have made millions of dollars. He could be the most famous guy in the world, but he's a bodybuilder. He's a bodybuilder, heart, and he wanted, I think it just bugs him that he never won Mr Olympia. You know, yeah, I know how he is. He's a bodybuilder, man. I know it's just no matter how much money he's got or how much fame he's got, it's still must nod him. And you know, like, what could have been? You know, when you have that thing, like what could have been? You know, they'd always bugs you, you know, because you can't go back in time. You can't do it all over. So you got accepted the way life was, you know. Yeah, that sums it up really well. I think with the master's thing too, bodybuilding has changed, you know? So the guys who, like, I couldn't imagine a lot of the guys who have competed and then retired continuing to push at the level they push to get to where they're at, I don't think they can hold that for 15 years in stay healthy, you know? Yeah, that's a good point too, Scott, because if you look at some of these guys in this movie, some of the guys from the 70s, like Robbie, Lou, um, Chris Dickerson, Boyer Co., like Boyer was competing and Chris Dickerson was competing and that early 60s. Yeah, well, there was last at 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s. I mean, who has that kind of longevity anymore? Where they can compete 30 years, you know? And it's a testament. I mean, obviously Boyer said that he was pushing things to come back, but I mean, it's a testament though, one of the things we talk about on the channel a lot is using the least amount you can to get the most progress you can, you know, using your training and your nutrition as the foundation. And I'll tell you what, if you were to use, you know, 70s level of gear, I mean, if you could achieve a physique that these guys had, it like 75, I think a lot of our listeners would take that, you know, and if you're in versus taking three times as much gear and maybe still only making the same amount of progress by the time they finish anyway. I agree with you. I think that's exactly why these guys can't go 30 years, you know, because stuff they're taking, they're careers so much shorter because they burn out much faster, where what were they even taking in the 70s? It had to be minimal amounts of, you know, I mean, Boyer started competing at 16, you know, I mean, so he had a long career. Yeah, that's hit 30 years, you know. We have a few people like that. Maybe I like I wonder, I'd be curious to know, like, what a ducks to Jackson use compared to some of the other guys. We know that he wasn't like a crazy intense trainer. He didn't push things like crazy in the gym. He had to eat a lot, right? But, and I mean, on that say, he didn't train hard, but I have a feeling he probably was able to coast along with the PEDs and not go quite as hard to keep up with like a really winkler, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe just the genetics and whatever he used was enough to to get him there, you know? Yeah. You know what, two back then, I guess thinking a step further, a lot more, there weren't as many bodybuilders, right? There weren't as many good pros. And so to be it's they were pros because they had those genetics to begin with, where is now you can there's more of a choice. Like, well, I can push the gear really hard to be able to keep up with these guys for a period of time. But at the same time, too, I don't want to take away from the new guys because the level that they're taking there for Zix to today is so much further, you know? Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Anyway, this is cool. Hard to say. Well, it was really good as a teenager. I mean, I remember, you know, he was he was winning titles at like 17 years old. He was winning Mr. Texas. It's 17 years crazy. I believe it, man. I believe it. Well, this is cool, John. I appreciate you coming on and hanging out with us and sharing those little shows with you. Yeah, this is cool. It was like really, really nice to get your insights. And this is something I wanted to watch anyway. So getting to watch it with you is fun. Number one, and the number two, you just bring so much more to, you know, so much more color to it. All right. Thanks. I appreciate it. So people check out the Bodybuilding Legends podcast you're on YouTube. And of course, you're on audio podcast. And as we mentioned in the beginning, we've got your coaching.

I'm looking forward to that. That's freaking cool. Lee Haney is still, he's just an awesome person, man. Yes. I follow him on his Facebook and I see him post it everything all the time. So he's, he's, he's still a guy who's passionate about the sport. Yeah. He's very passionate about making a difference in the future for the younger people. You know, he's really pushing the training knowledge. He has his own training certification. And he wants me to help him with the history of bodybuilding and that because he, he wants the young people coming up to know about the history of the sport. So he's, yeah, he's very, very involved with making a difference in the future of the sport and all the younger people coming up. Yeah. That's cool, man. I'm going to say I was just thinking about it. I've never met Lee Haney, but really, yeah, I never have. But he'd be one of the few people I feel like I'd be like a little star struck by to meet him. Yeah. They should have money show him. Sure. Come on. He's, he's all really open to that. You know. I'd freaking love to.
