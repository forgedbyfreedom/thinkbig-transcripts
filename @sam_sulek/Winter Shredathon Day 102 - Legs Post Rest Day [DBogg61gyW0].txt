This is actually two days from the last lift two days from that last arm day. Yesterday was a rest day and this was, you know, now the day after I'm gonna try and do it legs first. So usually I've been doing cardio session A, wait for some time to pass, lift cardio session B, but with legs I don't really want to wait until after I've done an hour of cardio and not really scarf down a ton of calories. So I did this a couple of, I don't know how many days ago I think it was back, I did it back day earlier in the morning rather than waiting for later into there. So mind the yawning, but that's the approach for this morning. So pre-work I'd not yet consumed, but I'll say that for a little bit closer to the actual ETA to the gym. It's just so it's really kicking in when I'm starting quads and then that's pretty much it. Some walking cardio after, no, no seated bike right after legs. The seated bike is a little bit too quiet heavy in terms of like stimulus and kind of fatigue. But the treadmill, not particularly, well I guess you can say tiresome, but not particularly soreness inducing, which is what I'm aiming for right? I don't need the cardio, it's a V, the tricky part and I want that to be getting more chill. So I do not anticipate that being too tricky to finish because I get episode one of season two of severance to watch. And I know that's like a 45-minute show. So I'll probably try to line it up such that I watch maybe 15 minutes or random BS, be it Instagram or Eels or just like a YouTube video or something and then get that show started a little cardio tip. If you can really get engaged and kind of locked into whatever show or like game your plan on your phone while you're doing it, time does seem to pass faster. I'd say there's most certainly an entertainment effect which offsets the boredom. Typically you're so here, typically associated with low intensity steady state cardio. But in terms of the left it's going to be pretty standard. Sissy squads, leg extensions, maybe some machine leg press superset it with some leg extensions as a pre-exhaust. And then hamstrings, hamstring curls and some Smith-Arty-Eels. Truly other is too it. Maybe a little bit lower on the volume side of things but that's not specifically intentional. I'm just trying to do as many sets as necessary to feel fully fatigued and fully pups, writing my hamps and quads. So if I get that sort of sensation of like completion after four sets of hamstrings and only like five sets of quads, then that'll be the end of it. Because that's all I really need right now. I'm trying to stimulate the muscle, maintain it and peel off that outer fat layer to reveal extra cut striations and veins which are currently being hidden, currently being subdued. And they want out. And I'm talking all the veins and spider webby wood bark striations. They want to be revealed. They want to be seen and they want to be put in the spotlight. So it's have to meet a get rid of this sort of soft blubber layer on the outside and be the be the messenger to deliver those muscular, well, it details. Not that I really think about it that deeply. It's just kind of the funny way to say it. But I think that's all I got to say. I'm going to get myself amptops as a music become caffeinated and let's say, well, for me it's going to be more like 15 minutes. But for you, I'm so happy to hear you. Adductors have been sufficiently warmed up which even though it's not like a massive part, it definitely comes into play. So if I warm them up first, this feels way better. And I'm curving my ego a little bit because instead of doing 200 pounds we're just a full stack. 170 felt a little hefty. So I think it's sweet spots around the middle. No. No my god ohahah Ah, let's算 towards 70, one more. Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Let's do some audio sound. I might come back here. But that'll be after... I forgot my straps. That's okay. 80 pando riels... Perfect. Now... Okay. Oh... Ah... Ah... I don't need it. Oh... Back to a curl. I don't need it. Oh... Back to a curl. Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Okay. Yeah... Let's get to quite a start. Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Okay... I think that's my time. First I'm a Sissy Squad super set. No... Light squeezing double-like light extensions... 10 repsish... Then some body widths... Sissy Squad's... Sissy Squad's... Alright... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Okay... Let's go pose that. Alright... Legs complete... And almost exactly the amount of volume that I had predicted... Except... It was that five sets of both... Either way... Legs are pumped. Now they're not skin splitting pumped like a full, you know... 1000 gram a car a bulk day. But give my current circumstances. I feel pretty good. So let's just see if there's a visual reflection... That matches the sort of the inflated canis feeling. Yep... There you are. Alright... Shoulda weren't shorter shorts now that I... Not actually here but when you have a thick one. And I still work. Ooh... So give a little extra zoom in... Quad only. Yeah, there we go. No... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... They certainly feel pretty freaking cut up. Yeah... That's a pretty good amount of quadra freaking hamstring separation too. And the ham's are as freaking... As they would be un pumped. Kind of cause when you have a hamstring pump... They sort of just... You know... Combine... Individive a blob just for the flationary effect of being pumped up. But... We are definitely on track to freaking something. So for you... Let's get in the car... Head back to the crib. But for me... I am not leaving yet. I've got an hour-long... Mill session. I can tell you one thing... If TikTok gets banned for real... And this isn't all just you know... Rain and Mass talk like it always is... That looks kind of suck. I've got a lot of hype... Edits that I've got saves on the TikTok like one piece and everything else. It's getting me going. I've deleted it off my home train. So I don't use it passively. Like I have at least relegated myself to just... Instagram reels. Which I think is at least a little bit better than bounce in between two... Apps worth of doing scrolling. But... Yeah... During the cardio. If you've got like 30, 30 seconds... Like hype one piece or hype a backier... That can tighten there any other kind of like... You know, a little badass freaking edit. It's a pretty good way to pass the time. I mean, it gets me going for real. So that's how I spent the last 10 minutes on the treadmill. The first 40... 45 issues show. Hmm... Oh... Including five of just a YouTube video. First... That was spent watching the first episode of the... Relatus to season of severance. Very good show. Very freaking good. I'm glad that it just released every episode at once. You know, as much as I may have liked it in the moment... I would have just... I probably would have just watched a whole thing today. And then I'd be freaking screwed at a lot. So... I'm... I'm strongly considering starting to watch last. But I'm kind of in... Like, season three of suits. I just got a... It is ordered that you just got lit up mug on Amazon. Because I just saw that clip, which I thought was pretty funny. But it's like... Six more seasons of the same... You know, this data, the other Harvey Spector, Lewis, whatever. I don't know if I could do it. It's a little too much. I'm... I'm... Spectering myself out. So I think I might... You... Well... Hmm... Hmm... Whatever. I'm sorry, but I'll be honest. I'm gonna start today off freaking nice and girly. It was kind of cool getting to watch the sunrise during the cardio, though. Not something most people get to see. I... I'm kind of... Like, usually I think of myself as a cardio-efficient auto. Right? Because I got the 30 minutes on the regular. Which is definitely more than most people. But I'm up there in like the top... Something percentile in terms of... Clock to hours of cardio, of at least the last like... Month-ish. I think it's been... I can go back and check the pictures, but I think it's been just about a month. That I've been doing the two hours of cardio per day. Phew! That's a lot, man. It's a freaking lot. But... I mean... I'm not trying to dog you on you. I'm sure you probably spend more than two hours just... Playing on your phone anyway. I know I do. So it's not like I'm really adding anything to the schedule. I'm just kind of turning one mindless task... Sitting around playing on my phone, which is not even a task. Into... Now a little bit of a multi-sask in the situation, right? And of course it takes some effort. I'm not using the cardio. It's not like completely zero... You know, 100% easy, whatever. But it's not really the hardest thing in the world. The hardest thing isn't even actually doing it. It's just going to do it. Because once you've already made a trip to the gym to do your cardio... I mean the success rate of that mission has now increased dramatically. I mean I'd say the success rate of guys where they just say to themselves... Alright, I better maybe have to drive to the gym later if you cardio. Or tomorrow morning and we need to cardio. Yeah, tomorrow morning I'll do it. The success rate of that thought... Pretty low. I think it's definitely sub-25% in kind of thinking that a lot of people think that to themselves. And then the time comes and they say, ask, screw. But the percentage that do make it to the car and actually do head over to the gym. They get their shoes on, they get their headphones, they get their phone, they get their... They're energy drinks sitting right next to them or whatever. By then the success rate is at least 80% you know. So it's not really an issue of maintaining the momentum of actually going. It's just getting that momentum started. Because even if I feel like total trash, even if I'm tired, I'm sleepy, it takes me a second before I even walk into the gym to do a workout because I'm like... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Which sometimes I definitely do feel. I mean, not every one of these cardio sessions goes by extremely easily. Especially the morning ones. Like I think it was maybe two or three morning cardio sessions ago. It took me a minute to really get up and get my shoes on. You know, maybe not as serious as like the David Goggins scenario where he's like... I don't want to put my motherfucking shoes on. I don't want to get up and run out there, man. You know, however he says it, not that serious of course. But definitely took a second, right? But I know that I want to do my cardio, or I guess really. I know that I want the results that doing my cardio is going to give me. So if that's the case, then it's simply a balance of, you know, a balance of desires. And my desire for those gains, or at least the progress that the cardio is going to give me, is just strong enough that at outweighs my desire to go back to bed, put my blanket back on and say, I'm going to sleep. Even though that would be all, it would feel so nice. You know, it feels so good. It just cozy back up and dead. Don't worry, it's so warm in here. Nothing cool, or at least nothing worthwhile happens when you're cozy up onto the covers and you're scrolling in screen rails. Nobody ever did anything cool like that. Now it's a nice to come back to. And frankly, going out and doing your cardio or lifting and having a good workout, just having a good day in general, if you know you killed it, at least in some degree, then when you come back and you do get to chill, it's even more enjoyed. Because you kind of earned it in a sense, you know. So, all I'm trying to say there, get you free because you're a shot of this here. So, I am sure that I'm going to take a nap after my post-workout meal of some cubed top-round steak, as well as probably some frozen mixed berries in a little bowl on the side, with some yogurt. And then the real battle begins because for me to do all this cardio and to work out, even when I'm feeling a little extra weak and a little thorgic, that's not really the challenging part. Like that's, I'm enough of a gym-rat where that's like, that's just a given. You know, that's regular daily activities I'm working on. It's the calorie restriction, that's the variable that's taking the most effort on my end. But not rocket sites, not freaking rocket sites. Simply making sure that I don't exceed my limits. And then with the extra free time and I have to eat so much food and prep everything you just sit here with the full stomach. I'm getting clean. I got a straight-in-a-malfe as a bit more, I'm getting some junk and old boxes and stuff, but I got a shelf to put up as well. Yeah, I should probably do that today too. So, plan for the rest of the day, do a little bit of house cleaning, clean up all my dishes and the same can everything else feed the cats. They, yeah, crap, they don't have breakfast yet. It's not a clock, they're probably freaking. Well, this is about their breakfast time, but I know that they're feeding for it for sure. So, then it's all that. Go back to the apartment gym later tonight. Do another hour cardio, probably a combination of seated bike and the treadmill. And then just keep going from there, right? Goodness. Every day, a little bit leaner than the day before, that's kind of my current state right now. And it's not the most noticeable, you know, jumps in leanness from a day by day basis. Really, it's negligible. I don't wake up one day, you know, pounds upon pounds or percentages upon percentages leaner than it was the day prior. But, over the course of a month, pretty drastic changes. I mean, look at a go back to even just scrolling through the thumbnails, like look at the last day, there's the last days of the Bolton phase, to like halfway through this kind of dining phase. To now, I mean, it's only been like three and a half months. Or, it's not even that. It's barely, it's not even been three and a half months. Yeah, it's only been three months and like, well, now yeah, it's about three and a half months. But, it's pretty drastic. So, even though it's slow, it is steady. And steady is smooth and smooth as fast, so really, it's gone by pretty fast. But, oh, that's to say, if you're in a deficit currently, or if you're getting yourself amped up to start a deficit, then you're kind of like on the crap, I don't know if I'm going to really pull the trigger on this thing, man. You know, it's winter time. I want to be Bolkin, that, pick one. The worst decision you could make is in decision in terms of if you want to bulk up or cut down. Because too many lifters I feel are just plateaued and trapped in a state of maintenance. You know, they're just staying the same size, the same strength, the same everything. And it's like, if you're coming to the gym every day anyway, you only have to add a little bit more effort to tip the scales into some vector of progress, be it bulking up the more cutting down. So, slip a coin, hedge your bulk tails, you cut and odds are, once that coin is actually in the air, you're going to know which one you really want to do because you're going to get lean towards, lean towards whichever one you actually have a sub, sub-conscious preference for. But whichever one you do, if you can stick to it for long enough and adjust accordingly, depending on what scale reads, and I can guarantee at the end of it, you'll at least be able to say, alright, I may substitute it rather than just basically fast forwarding the next three months, and being in these X-AIMs watches that you work. That's the worst thing you could do is just become stagnantly trained. That's why I really like the bulk enough you can down because I'm always headed towards a specific goal, and it's very tangible and direct. Like, I know I want to lean right now, and I know in a few months I'm going to want to get bigger and bulkier. So, it's, I get kind of the best of both worlds you've learned back and forth. But I think that's all I got to say. I ain't ready to eat something, take a, take a mid-ish. Well, I don't know. Sometimes if I take a nap when I'm dieting, then it's hard for me to sleep at night, and I end up being a little more restless. But either way, I know I'm going to feel my legs tomorrow. So I think that's all I got to say. I will see you for what I hope to be a rather freaking chess day tomorrow.
