Alright, it's 2. And now not 2 in the morning it's actually, it's actually 7 o'clock. It's 2 freaking degrees. I'd say something, that's 2 cold for me. I'm, uh, I gotta start actually really bundling up or running down the steps, starting the car, then going back and on my pre-workout stuff ready. So I get into it, it's already kind of pre-heated a little bit, because I'm talking like numb fingers, and I'm only a bit in here for like three freaking minutes. But certainly non-optical that cannot be overcome simply, uh, simply a discomfort style situation. But plan for tonight's leg day. I think I'm gonna go a little easier on hamstrings. I might get hamstrings a little bit of a break today, because I'm doing a lot of seated bike right, and that definitely gives me a little bit more hamstring activation that I might have guessed. And maybe it's just something that I did, but like I can tell today just kind of based on a flexing sort of feeling situation. My hamstrings feel a little more tender than my quads. They're not sore by anything. It's like I'm not walking around my quads, my anise. But definitely a little bit more tender than completely perfectly well rested. So my my today a little more quiet focused, which is not a problem for me. His element really aimin' for is a full on leg pump. Overall kind of leg stimulation, some ad dr. work, some calf work, make sure everything's still flowing, and just trying to hold onto as much beef as possible underneath. As I peel off the, uh, the adipose, fat tissue layer on the outskirts. Yeah, I did, um, so sometimes in the morning when I go to my cardio and the, um, at the apartment gym, I'll just walk, so I'll kind of double up with like a long johns kind of layer, then sweatpants, t-shirt with it sweatshirt. So I really just get extra kind of drenched afterwards, but it was, uh, obviously nothing like the clips of, um, of Ronnie Coleman when he's walking around of those yellow tights, where you can see, I mean, even as well, look like these get the legs of a horse with his veins kind of all over his quads and everything else. But I was getting my own little hint to that because I could sort of see a couple of quad veins through the, uh, the long johns kind of tights between me feel pretty cool. But hopefully we get a little bit more of that now, and even just walking around, I've kind of just got quad veins now, but it's nothing compared to where they're fully pop. So I'm sure it's going to be a pretty large discrepancy in terms of veinyx, you know, vein, of viability in about maybe an hour or so from now, it's really not going to take too long, because I'm not doing any crazy heavy squats or crazy heavy leg press. Mainly leg extensions is my primary quad movement right now. Kind of similar to triceps, how I'm doing a lot more like lighter, squeezing kind of sets, because I may even for stimulation, you know, not complete kind of bulking annihilation, which is a, you get a little bit more of a buffer in terms of your recovery ability, you know. But all that's to say is I can guarantee that within about 60 minutes from once I'm parked and walking my buddy into the gym, I'm going to have a reasonably freaky quad pump, and then I am going to be ready for a good night's rest tonight. I think the house started to organize my little office space. I've still got a couple of extra boxes of like shelves and stuff I got to undo, so, yeah, probably not gonna do that tonight, I'll probably save that for, but we see it every tomorrow. But as a wait for the candy in the kidney, let's just get ready for this like that. Let's just jump straight to business. So I can't doubt on the ad-doctor machine a little bit. Nothing crazy, just like five or six sets of like eight reps of the stack. And I don't mean to start like the flex, like just kind of a basic wait, don't hook yourself, but I like doing that pre-handstrings, just kind of feels a little better, but let's start off like half a stack here, and really squeeze the top of these. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Who? You want to die? Very reminiscent of twice every extensions with a good hold on top. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. Oh, yeah. Who? One more thing. And then I've got a plan for how I wanted to change it up. Same machine, different execution. Yeah. No. No. No. No. No. No. Oh. Let's change up the style. Some single-linked alternate work instead of double-light. So same basic style, but now five reps on the left, five on the right, just alternate, until hamstring destruction. And very light. This is less weight than what I was just doing double-light combined on the 40 counts. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I think one more though, some metal be in for hamstrings. I do not mind keeping this lift simple, given all a million before it's stimulation, and it's a big, much lower. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
