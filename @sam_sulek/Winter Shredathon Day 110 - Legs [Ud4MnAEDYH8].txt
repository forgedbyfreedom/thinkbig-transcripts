Alright, you know something's bad. When walking outside, I think to myself, wow. 30 degrees. This is nice. This is pretty freaking enjoyable. Of course, 30 compared to zero. I'm talking Fahrenheit. I don't know. And I'm not exactly sure what zero degrees Fahrenheit is. Celsius. But either way, I'm talking, you know, freezer butt off cold versus, you know, where a jacket is a little bit cold. But that's nice for me. So I don't have to sit here freeze. I'ma fingers off. I mean, honestly, 30 is alright. 30 is a, oh freaking K with me. So, play it for tonight for likes. I was on the, I was on the fence about whether or not I wanted to make it today or rest day, or save it for tomorrow. And I think that today being the rest day is not necessary. And I might even just make tomorrow extra chill and just do, uh, just do shoulders. And by shoulders, I really do mean like a chill, like probably only four sets of reverse, you know, rear delt work and then four sets of laterals. So certainly not the most stressful workout in the world. But, you know, it's, uh, it's a balancing act right now, you know, because I don't necessarily think there's such thing as, um, over training per se. It's more so a situation of under-recovering, right? I mean, you're pretty tough. We've evolved for a while to be able to handle some pretty damn serious situations and circumstances. But, not having enough food in your system, not getting enough sleep, not getting enough, you know, hydration and recovery, that's going to mess with anybody. Across the board from a damn perfect organism like, Zina Moore fall the way down to, you know, whatever kind of a meat is or floating around. You don't get many food or water. She's going to stop working, right? So right now what I'm balancing is, okay, I would need some weight-based exposure and I want to maintain some strength, I want to maintain my size. I want to keep all the muscle that's already built up, while I reveal that muscle by peeling off the body fat, right, by eating that calorie deficit. But in doing so, I'm limiting my ability to recover from the workouts, because I'm no longer eating, you know, five or six thousand calories a day. I'm down in the low-toes to somehow just two and then on a lower day. Even below that, getting in the 1900s sometimes. So, what that tells me is, maybe I don't need to do five plate squats. Maybe I don't need to do ten plate leg press, and not even maybe those are off the menu for now. So all I'm really aiming for on a lift by lift basis. I mean, really my two goals are only, don't hurt myself and get a pump. And this don't hurt myself as definitely goal number one, and get a pump as followed that. So, if that just means four sets of laying leg curls, and go hard, get a burn, know that I did push myself for my current sort of circumstance. And then some leg extensions with some cyscizy squads as a drop set, you know, certainly not even close to the most weight and my tension that my quads could feel on like a max exertion crazy heavy set of squats. Like I'm not even getting close to that. The amount of quads work that I'm getting from like crazy squats, mid-bulk. I mean, I'm not sure how you could quantify it, but it's probably like, cumulatively, as much as it's being done and like all of these sets kind of combined. Now, maybe not exactly the amount of that amount of that abrupt, but it's just not necessary for an aim at four, right? Which is a little bit of a downer for me, because that's kind of the fun part of the training. I feel like right now the training intensity side of things is getting pushed onto the back burner a little bit, because the trickiest part for me right now, the hardest part, is the diet, right? Not eating in a food, or not eating too much food, right? So the training is, I mean, it's going to be done, it's doing it's serving its purpose, but it doesn't have to be absolute balls to the wall muscular destruction. This is where I'm definitely going to agree with the stimuli, don't annihilate, kind of crowd when they talk about working out, because yeah, that's what I'm aiming for, stimulation. Now, fast forward, you know, three, four months, once I'm getting into a legit surplus and I'm chowing down on all sorts of rice, ramen and everything else, so I'm talking treats will be included within reason. Then yeah, I'm going to be trying to go as nuts as possible, because my results are going to be pretty much determined on how big of a stimulus can I give myself in the gym, and then can I recover from that? On my, you know, out of my, outside the gym or team, right, diet, sleep, hydration, everything else. So as long as the food is being consumed, which, I don't want to speak too early, but to give it to my track record, I've never had a problem with the bulking side of things in terms of my calorie intake, then there's no reason to hold back when it comes to the weights, but right now, not so much, certainly some reason to hold back, get a pump, go hard, be a little bit more, a little bit more controlled on a set by set basis, which is definitely a good thing. A little bit of a break for my knees and my joint to everything else, and I still, uh, make some little reset, because as much food as I'm eating in as much as I can recover, when I'm going too crazy with the weights, constantly every left, it's still, excuse me, definitely kind of accrues some kind of stresses and everything else. So that's one reason I like the bulking and cutting side of things, apart from just the fact that I feel for me, it's my fastest track towards getting bigger, is it's a nice little break, you know, you are almost in season in the training and then off season in the training. But now I can tell I'm just getting a little bit rambly. If I had a, if I had a little blood glucose monitor with me, I'm sure I'm in a very healthy range, I'm talking maybe a little bit too low, right? Because I'm not a huge pre-workout meal or anything else like that. But more than enough food to get a solid leg pump, and I'm hoping to see some brand new veins, cut striations and all sorts of separation and everything else from need a hip. So now that's left to do is the work ethic is going to result in perhaps not a skin splitting pump, but certainly something close to it. So I think no more gent, it's just going to be going to happen. Not even the whole stack, but with these leg curls at the top of every rep, I really want there to be like a momentary. Oops, even if you can't really see it, like two guys can do the exact same set at the same tempo, but for just a moment at the top, like imagine this is my leg. If they have an extra little squeeze, I feel they're going to get more and that set. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Few more just like that. Methods you complicated. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, okay. Two more like that. And then I'll do a fancier, light a squeeze in the set. One more basics that way, then. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I think one more squealing set. And that'll be it for haps. Short squeak. I think a little five, five, five style. Will be perfect in some finisher. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I think that's it. Let's start with some blank extensions and then go from there with quads. Instead of doing the 5, 5, 5 style, let's just take legs to failure. Left to failure, then right to failure. Go from there. Turn it to the inside. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Just like that. A little heavier for the set. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. One more simple one right there. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Let's do some alternating more burnish stuff next. This will be left side, right side, right side, right side. But instead of nasty pumpish, fast reps, much slower with a much more intentional squeeze and up at the top of each one. And as such, a bit lighter. There we go. There we go. There we go. There. There. There. There. There. There we go. There. There. There we go. There we go. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. I think that's all. Give me a moment to really decide. There's one more. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There.
