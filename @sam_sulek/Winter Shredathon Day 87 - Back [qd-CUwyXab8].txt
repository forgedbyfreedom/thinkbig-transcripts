Alright, day two, day two of the year, 50% I don't know what I'm talking about, not 50%. Barely even, barely even 0.1%, but whatever. I saw some new faces. I saw a couple of new faces when I was doing cardio this morning. I guess I'll just have to see which ones end up sticking around or not. And if you've got your eyes open, you know, if you keep a lookout, you should start to notice who's actually getting after it. And I don't mean like on a day by day basis. Obviously, I guess I do. You can tell if somebody's trying to kill it. But just over time too, I mean, I've seen dudes where, you know, the course of a few years, the term unrecognizable does not feel at a place to describe how the sort of transformation has gone. So I mean, pretty drastic things can be done. You know, just takes a long time to do. Right? But we'll see, I would love to have access to all of the gyms, like YMCA's and plan of fitness is in any times, like actual analytics. It just says, really, you see what happens during this time of year. Because we all get the gist, you know, there's more people. New years resolution or type characters. Or, you know, just anybody where New years happen to be the time that they got their membership. But it would really be interesting if they would actually release that info of, like, how many new memberships were paid for versus not used. And then like, what percentage of dudes actually basically just show about a nowhere and say, alright, I'm gonna make this happen. What percentage of guys actually make it happen after they say, like, alright, 25. New year, New mean, for real. Zero irony, pure iron. It's got to be low. It's got it sucks that it's low, but I would probably wage your view would be a little bit on the lower end. But it's, I mean, the hype will die down. So just keep an eye out. I'm sure you'll see some new regulars. But I don't want to, I don't want to make every drive just talking about new years resolutions. So I'll try to make this my last time talking about it. We get a dollar or all our regular sort of topics. But, you know, I'll tell you now. And this will be, maybe I'll save this clip on my, on my desktop to look at later. It's like, the year has just begun. What do you want to set out to do? And then hopefully this is, I'll find this clip later. All right, a full year has passed, man. What happened? We haven't been to show for it. I would hope so, but it's not, not my, not my split, not my workouts. Right, not my circus, not my monkeys there. That's, that's up for you. That's up to you to get sort of. But for me, I am much more concerned if we can make sure that I have a free lead back day today at a certain purple and yellow gym. Followed by some pretty lengthy cardio. And, yeah, post-workout cardio is going to be a little extra lengthy tonight too. I got to start getting real here. So after back, I'll do a 30 minutes on a seated bike, followed by 30 minutes on the treadmill, which is not that crazy. You know, mild incline just to get a little bit of extra umph, but walking into the treadmill for 30 minutes at three miles an hour. I tell you, in my own half, it's really not that strenuous. The bike can actually get kind of tricky because you're really peddling like, I'll be sweating pretty hard. I almost use the cardio on the treadmill as like an extension of my elevated heart rate. But without thrashing my quads into oblivion. Because an hour on the seated bike, if you're peddling pretty hard, I'll feel it. Like, I will definitely feel some fatigue building up. But the treadmill, not so much. And then, obviously the treadmill goes by so much faster. Anytime I'm watching a show, I'm saving squid game season two exclusively for only what I'm doing cardio. But, you know, now that I'm doing more than a freaking hour a day, I feel like I'm just watching the show in my regular pace. But, you know, if you can try to distract yourself in the fact that you're doing it, it does make it a lot easier. And then, one more little cardio tip before getting into it. The back day is going to look like, cover it up the time. Do not watch the clock in it. If I'm sitting on the seat of a bike and I'm peddling, and I'm starting to feel a little bit uncomfortable, like okay, I'm puffing the puffing. You really think it's going to do me in a good look at the clock and say, oh, I've only been doing this for 45 seconds. Huh. Yeah. Not really. You know, so I always cover up the timer with a towel, or I get a clipboard or like fold up some paper towels or something. Just so that I don't have to look at it. Because it kind of, if you can get into a little bit of a, not a meditative state, I would not call me getting, you know, 50% of the way to crashing out a clash royale after I get to, you know, my skeleton already logged. I would not call that a meditative state, but you're certainly in a state where time starts to pass a little bit more quickly. So, I like to say there is being not look at the timer before you know it. Oh, 30 minutes. What'd be? Very nice. But so for the actual back portion of the lift, just pull down, rows and pullovers, man. And then probably a combination of a pull down in a row or a pullover in a row, as like the finisher kind of a superset just a really kind of pump up my entire back lats to traps. Or I guess traps to, you know, traps to lats. And then, ever post that, the stakes are kind of low with the train right now. The normal main would force go hard, get a pump. You know, I'm not really crazy concerned with any progressive overload. I don't need to get any, not only doing that knee, but I'm not getting any bigger and stronger right now. All I'm doing in this dining phase is maintaining the muscle that I've already built. And what is all I really need to do in the gym. Get a pump, make sure you go hard and do my cardio. So the cardio is obviously probably the more. Well, not important, but the part of the training is actually a little bit trickier for me. Because I love getting the first, getting the freaking back pump. But, you know, adding 60 minutes of LIS, S-Lone intensity, steady state cardio. That's, that's a little bit trickier. And I don't think I'm alone in that boat. But, if you're looking into some sort of way to differentiate yourself from the rest of the lifters in your local area. Consistent cardio is a pretty reasonable way to do it. Nobody wants to. It's hard. It takes time. It's not very exciting or fun. And there's no immediate reward. It's a long-term type situation. So, if you can do what nobody else does, you probably get some results and nobody else is going to get. That's a pretty good way to think about anything. But, I think no more jetting. I'm getting reasonably amped up and excited for back. So, let's just hope it's not too busy and get this lift started. So, I've kind of developed a habit of basically just doing a lot of regular, straight bar pull downs and like, single arm cable rows to start my back days off. And not that I think there's anything wrong with that. But, I kind of want to break the pattern. So, let's start with this machine, underhand pull down. First of all, it's not the full stack, but just enough weight where I can really get a good squeeze at the bottom. Because that's one thing that's machine is good for. It's not just the movement path. It's a good hold at the bottom and really feeling like my lats right within, and it's all the way down, like right above my hips. I feel like you're right here to pull down. I kind of feel like more so in my lats like up here, where is this is way down there. Okay. Oh, goodness. Whoops. Two of these being good starter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, goodness. I think let's move on to the low row. Right next me. No need to move too far. These reps will look very different, a little bit more rapid, but I still want to call this Sling it around just a bit of faster pace set. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. They're a superset. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
