Alright, today is quite a head of schedule. You would not believe what time it is. And this is not cardio. I mean, there's going to be some post-lifed cardio, but this is not the dedicated cardio that I either. It's 11, freaking 30. Now, of course, it's a Saturday, so it's not like the gym is going to be completely dead like a weekday, but either way, this is weekend. So now, I'll just have a, I don't know, it feels kind of weird. Like, I think my, my circadian rhythm of lifting has me lifting a little more like 6 p.m. or later, but I feel like I'm kind of hurting my sleep. And I'm not saying that I can like, I'm laying in bed jittery three hours after I drink, whatever pre I just had, but even if you can still fall asleep with some caffeine in your system, it doesn't mean you're in like complete ram or complete everything else. Like, get in all that, after what's, what are the sort of resulting compounds of the caffeine, it's like, nor up the feds, or something along this line. Like, just having that in your system while you're sleeping, it's kind of taken away from your restfulness. So I think it's probably gonna be in my best interest to make these lifts a little bit earlier in the day. Maybe not this early every time, but a little bit earlier. So this'll be a quick little, just a description of what this lift will look like. And half of it, I mean, we'll just have to see, you know? I mean, try steps first. And I definitely wanna do some machine dips because I haven't done those for the last like, two or three arm days, but other than that, I mean, biceps can be really fucking simple. You know, I don't have to sit in here and do, like, eight different kinds of curls. Like, last arm day, the only real curl I ended up doing was like kind of a cambered cable curl. And by the time I did four sets of those, my biceps are wrecked. And with something like biceps, tries a little bit more complicated, but biceps, especially. There's not that complicated of a muscle, you know? Like your chest, obviously, you wanna do pressing, you wanna do flies, you wanna do incline pressing and flat pressing, maybe some decline like, big stretch work. Now with your back, you gotta do pull downs. Lat folk is movements. Rose, more mid back, maybe some sort of upward angle and rose for your upper back, like that sort of stuff. But with, oh, and then with triceps, you definitely should be hitting it from, I'd say, these three different ways. You gotta regular push down, be it rope, be it a straight bar, be it a W bar, be it a V bar, whatever, like a push down here, and overhead based extension, to be a bit more stretch focused, as well as a dipping movement. And one could argue that the dip is almost, just like the push down, it's just only slightly different. But I'd say those are the big three, but with biceps, I mean, even when you're doing a preacher curl, or a barbell curl, or a concentration curl, or whatever. It's not really changing that much, you know? So, oh, that's all that's to say. It's like if you do a set of dumbbell curls, and they click, and you're like, holy crap, these feel really good. And then you do another set, and that one feels pretty good too. You do another set, that one feels pretty good. It's like, okay, if I do like four more of these, I'm probably gonna be fully pumped. Like I can tell my whole biceps can hit, and then I would just stay there. Like I wouldn't see the need to wanna move on anything else. If that's already really work. So, it's not like I'm saying never do different movements or biceps. Lift by lift. Your work at should look pretty different, just to make sure you're hitting everything in all sorts of different ways. But don't feel like you have to. I mean, I've had arm days where all it was was, not straight bar, but like a W bar, pushed down heavy eight sets, and then dumbbell curls right off the rack. 60, 60, get a little bit weaker, drop to a 50, a little bit weaker, drop to a 40. Maybe do a, like a squeezing superset at the end, like little things like that. And before you know, and boom, full on arm pump. You have no idea that I didn't just do a 10 diff, because it's, I don't know, I feel like that's just kinda some kind of misconceptions. Like I see that a lot in a lot of comment sections of anybody's work at, and it's always like, all you did was dumbbell curls, why do you specifically target your break your ringialis? Why don't you specifically target the long end and the short head of your bicep with it? It's like dude. Do a crazy set of dumbbell curls. Go hard, really push it, and then you tell me if you can feel any portion of your bicep, that still feels extra strong and it wasn't worked. Because as much value as there is to specifically targeting different portions, like I think that's totally true. But as much value as there is to that, don't get lost in that details, right? We've all heard the phrase, you focus on the tree, you lose the force, you know, you focus on, well, you get what I'm saying there. But either way, let's just jump in there, get this arm day started. It's early on day started. So let's change it up. I've been starting with a rope extension, like every trisip lift, haven't given the crossbow extension as much love. So like 30 pounds each, this is a weight that I can manage, but these reps are very well. So I'm gonna make use of that by when I get the pulley extended position, really try to wrench it as if I'm trying to bend my arm backwards straight out of the extra system. So a hard, hard long squeeze at the bottom, like a full second, up very slowly, try to feel my whole trisip, like relax, and then just repeat until failure. You know, simple enough, but a little easier seven down. One breaths. Yoyosh! Yoyosh! It's your second punch. My... But I need to ask that. You do. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. What a two more. Let's get open. No. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Yeah. No. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. Let's do some dips next. I'll be going to change up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. One more like that. Yeah. Yeah. No. No, okay. Okay. Yeah. Let's get some more dips. Oh. Yeah. 브라이러�KA Oh.... 자. Now. Yeah. Yeah... Hmmm. That's coming on my curriculum. One more important thing. I guess the one here is blood. Yeah yeah. Oh my God. Straightinaur drops out, or a superset runner. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I was bad. You know what? Yeah. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. Okay. Oh, man. I was bad to say I'm going to need one more set. But that little drop into the regular push dance. When you try to start done, let's start curling something gosh nangin'. Alright. So I've got a history of starting with curls. Don't bell curls, preacher curls, cable curls, whatever. Now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever started the bicep day with the bicep biased pull dance. So in the spirit of changing shit up, changing stuff up. Let's start with some of those first. Can I lift you up? Don't beat me up I ain't эти 있든ame out how to dance. Sucuri hums. You. Oh. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go. Get on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna get it. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do a machine, guys. I think. So what I'm thinking here is alternating five reps at a time of a pretty moderate weight for these curls. And not too heavy. Like honestly, if you would call that last set 100% weight like failure at six plus impartials, this might be 50%. Where every rep, oh, I guess I'm kind of just combining the hard squeezing portion of those bicep bias pull nands with a little more heft of a conventional curl. But let me see how that is 130 feel. Yeah. Just do one 10. Just barely above half of the slide. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's a bit of a year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Arms are fully pumped. Let's go find some lighting. It's the other really looking. There we go. All right. Arms pretty much pumped to heck. Didn't take that much either. Those sets weren't the craziest. That wasn't like my really heavy leg day every set is like a huff and puff. You know, like event. And honestly, it's almost like, like my energy was good, but I feel like I wasn't as hyped today as normal. Which, I mean, I'm not saying that. Like it was a bad thing. The vibe of that lift just, that's a little bit more chill, which whatever. I don't think the pump has suffered much at all. So let's see how we're looking here. Yeah. Trying to get to make sure my arms are totally symmetrical. Let me show it more. Yeah. Oh, crap. Yeah. We are most certainly getting somewhere. And especially in that front last bread. Like I've been, I've been hidden at this for months. And now it's finally starting to happen. I can actually see some strong separation of shoulder, tricep, bicep on our teeth. So what used to be kind of just a little bit of a smooth transition is now getting a little more angular. And then as I get leaner, that is only going to become more and more abrupt. Like right here shoulder striations, bicep, brykianos, tricep. Ideally that will all be very sharp. Sharpe is a good description. Oh. Okay. Now am I hallucinating? Or is that a hint of some tricep striations right there? Oh. Let's trick it to reach around this far. There we go. And that's just freaking cool. But arms complete. So now let's just get in the car. Head back home and eat something. I am hungry. Also thirsty. There we go. Okay. Some time has actually passed since that posed him because 30 minutes on the seated bike turned into 60 minutes on the seated bike. Now when it comes to cardio, if you've, which you know, the topic I've referenced reasonably frequently, I would say this for the most part, your best bet. Thanks to heavy noise. There we go. But for the most part, I would say your best bet with the cardio. If you want to have like an active routine is going to be cardio in the morning. Go about your day, eat some food, kind of, get back to baseline and then lift a little bit later. You know, whether that lift is a four or six or eight or whatever. Cardiola morning and then lift a night. But for me, at least that makes the most sense. It gives me time to go through the day to get warmed up. Get some food in my system. Then have a good workout at night. You did another meal afterwards and go to sleep. But I got a lot of cardio to do right now. So I'm going to have another, technically this is actually the morning session. Oh, no, what am I saying? Oh, no, it's an earlier session. So yeah, but I've got the cardio in the morning in cardio, post the lift. So, double it up. Usually I just ended doing an hour in the morning and then 30 minutes after the lift. But today, it felt a little bit extra cheeky. Get a, get a three to three to three here. And the reason I would say you probably wouldn't want to do your cardio, post workout is because after workout, you should go home and eat something. I jump straight to the recovery process. But that's more of so for a maintained baseline kind of maintenance, whoever you're aiming for. This is, this is definitely pushing the envelope in terms of the calorie burning side of things. So, I'm going to go a little bit extra far beyond. But I mean, I just don't understand the hate. I mean, the cardio is so easy. Like, I think it's just an idea. The word cardio is scary. So, maybe next time you feel like you're in a safe space. Nope. You don't have to take them to the threats around you in the gym. Just take a seat on the seat of bike. You know, don't even start pedaling. Just take a seat playing your phone, you know, mess with the buttons. And then maybe put your feet on the pedals and just see what happens. So, no pressure. And before you know it, I think you'll get it. You'll suddenly grasp what I've been trying to say all along. But I feel rather tired. So, I'm going to have a good postwork at meal. Probably 10 or 12 ounces of top round steak with very minimal oil to sear. And whatever, pan-lay end up using. And then maybe, uh, I just do some steamed broccoli. Just, uh, just for the sake of having more fluff to eat. Because there's a certain value to just eating food where having stuff in your stomach makes you feel full. Not having stuff that's really like calorie-dense or anything. Because what's going to make you feel more full? Eating two pound strawberries, or a pint of energy. The pint of energy has five times the calories. But, you know, by the time you've actually eaten the whole thing, you're not going to feel that full. Whereas even two pounds of freaking strawberries, that would fill you up. So, honestly, that's kind of making me think I should stop at the store and grab some of those. Because dining down at least, it's always a bit easier for me to stick to more whole foods. And with that, I mean, just like basic stuff. You know, changing it up or, uh, or, you know, trying to hack the system by eating, like, protein bars and, like, the low carb, um, treats and stuff that you see in all the vending machines. Like, it's, it's just not really any better, you know? Like, if you got a protein bar where it was like low carb, you know, it's flavored with, like, all the sugar alcohols and the erythritol and all sorts of fancy, like, Sugar replacements or whatever, where it's like, oh, it's actually only got two calories per gram instead of four. You know, by the time you look at all the macros, you flip it around, okay, 15 grams of protein. I'd probably just rather have that from, like, some ground beef, some turkey. 15 grams or, like, 18 grams of fats, okay, that's actually a lot of fat with the, I thought this is supposed to be a low calorie thing. And then, you know, a bunch of, um, like, carb, sweetener replacements, where if you eat a bunch of them, it totally just mixes your stomach up and makes it feel bloated right? So it's, at that point, I'd rather just have, like, a couple ounces of ground beef and just substrate up chocolate or something. It would have the same coloric value, you know, so there really is no getting around just being a little bit strict with the calories themselves. But I could tell, I could probably do it with an app. I could see a nap happening very soon. Once I get back to the house. But anyway, I think we'll just call it there, make this a little bit of a quick one. So December 22nd for you, three days until Christmas. And this year, at least for us, it's a little bit different. You know, Santa doesn't have a naughty list. And he's got a list of guys who have been skipping their cardio. And yeah, unfortunately for you, Dennis, you're on that list. And I know you're laughing at your buddy Paul, but guess what, you're on that list too. Because he knows that he checked it twice. Yeah, no gifts for you. You're getting straight keen-wise in your stocking. You know, he's not going to hang that cold, but pretty close. Either way. I don't see you for some leg action tomorrow.
