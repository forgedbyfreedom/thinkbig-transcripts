And I think I showed him to you guys, didn't I? Yep. Yeah. This guy's a monster. You guys got to follow this dude just for motivation and just like keeping your brain open to what's possible, like, obscene human strength. But this guy, I don't know the story about him fully. Six foot eight, 360 pounds. But I think his weight varies a lot. Like he moves his weight around on purpose. I think he's been like 400 at one point. And I think he's been, you know, diets down and stuff. But he does, he lives in Australia, I believe. And he, um, he does all this crazy shit. Like, we'll put up some of his, uh, oh, yeah, he's ex, ex armed forces, ex Australian armed forces. But he does all this crazy stuff. His workouts are nuts. Um, you can find his face if he's searching, but on his Instagram, he never shows it. Yeah, I can see his. Yeah, I can see he just trains at home. Okay. He's got all this crazy stuff he does. So put up one of his bench presses. I can last bench press video. All right. So what are we looking at here? Six. And 61 pounds. Most butt. Most butt. Any positive on his chest. Yeah, 61 in a sweatshirt. And listen to this bench press PR. Three singles hit over two days. She's so he did it two days in a row. So like he's not just strong buddies. Also like trains crazy. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like the type of guy that's like, let's bench 661, two days in a row. Let's see if I can do it. Look at that. He's just doing this like in his backyard. It looks like.

I can't see from the head. 81, 81 quick dead. Whew. I wonder if he has anything in his pockets of his pants.
