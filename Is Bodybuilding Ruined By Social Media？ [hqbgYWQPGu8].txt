you were in a coma i i knocked out some bang or episodes there was a couple good ones in there there were a couple they were like keeping in the coma let him down whatever just don't bring him back is it was like a soap opera you know what I mean like there's the dusty in the coma period of time yeah there's like that the coma era where Ron is doing the show by himself yeah you know after death during death yeah yeah yeah absolutely um okay what's it what's our first topic today can you body build how important is social media in body there is that what we're talking about yes yes that one important is social media in bodybuilding okay well let let's let dusty start this what how do you how do you take that question well I take it simply is well how important is it well depends if you're doing for a business if you're doing to bodybuild like you can absolutely I think this is the tricky thing I see people complain about social media all the time right and they act as though we are being you know held by gunpoint to do social media if you don't want to be on social media just like the key is don't put it on your phone and don't do it go to the gym train and get big just like we did back in the day but if you are trying to make a living out of bodybuilding in any way shape or form then yeah it's it's highly important and valuable I think the area that things get confused to me is you don't have to do this in any way you don't want to you know I mean today we went to the gym we trained and I told Nicky I was like we woke up we're supposed to do leg gesture today we obviously traveled so we didn't then you get here after you know a rough three days in Vegas and I was like you know let's just do back and I don't want to film anything and then halfway through the work I was like I'm kind of liking this machine I created I've had a couple sets and we'll see if it is worth a shit and that was that but you know at no point did I feel like I must do a post today you know and I think that's where people get off yeah I was just watching this other I don't know which podcast I was watching and the person was talking about how healthy it was to like you know reassess what you put on social media and how it affects you because people don't stop and think about how it affects them right they just think of it as like a promotional tool like oh I got to get this out but you know sometimes there's people that like let's say they stop and join their hobby right and probably becomes like really chore and work oriented and like they're sort of feel like it's all discipline you know and grinding away at their hobby and it's just discipline just and they realize they're putting a lot of it on social media and it sort of sneaks in on you and it makes it seem like your goals and focuses are on other things now and you didn't even realize it and it can you know make it a less pleasant because you start getting all that you know you don't get as many hits on this video as you did on another video and this is supposed to be your hobby yeah right and so just being aware that that can sneak in on you and it can actually poison what you're doing because you get this negative feedback loop of all these other things going on when it used to just be your hobby and your mind was just on what you're like let's say you're you know learning to play piano or something you just literally for the love of it all the music and all that but if you started posting it all the time it can get in there where it becomes about more than that and so just being aware of that like some people I think they they wind up with so much anxiety in their training because the social media has sort of snuck into their training regimen as like a part of their training and you just got to really try to keep those you know those dividers up really try to make sure you compartmentalize what you allow that stuff to sort of you know get into because I see young people like you know this there's stress about that in their workout you know and you just that's that's where it becomes a problem to me yeah Scott yeah that's not bodybuilding you know and it kind of takes me back to just just in general whenever I had gotten just too overwhelmed by everything you know like like everything involved it like we talked about before there was a point when my whole ritual just to get to the gym and start training it required like three different peptide injections and intro workout shake and having these muscles go down yeah exactly exactly this meal needs to be prepared all that potassium yeah great right Scott by somebody um you know and and if I didn't you know if I didn't have it all lined up then I didn't I didn't feel like I did that is optimally as I could of when in reality you know I I had step back and I would remind myself like where did this passion come from and for me it was finding my dad's old weight set in the basement literally under the work bench he had like the old plastic weights you know and I pulled those out and put them up on the on the weight bench and I I figured out how to train and then his his friends helped me him and his friends you know taught me stuff and I had like some train posters I put up on the basement wall and stuff and I took myself back to how that felt and I reminded myself of the foundation of like what that original passion in love was and I disconnected myself from those things because it is so easy to get wrapped up in that just the the your the hobby I like the way you put that run the hobby can kind of take over and I think especially for a lot of us in bodybuilding we we have that tendency to do that you know and I mean to keep building off of it I mean God right now with with I'm shooting stuff I'm considering getting into reloading and like that's a whole other hobby on top of shooting you know and I mean it's like now I have to dedicate part of my basement to this thing there's 500 different machines I need to buy and it's like you know draw the line somewhere this is just supposed to be fun you know I mean yeah yeah but that's the I think that's the key though it is understanding you know what Ron said I thought was really valuable which is if if you take your hobby and turn it into a business make sure you're not sacrificing more than it's worth you know now because for example for me if someone were to say well you can make an extra 100 grand a year off of bodybuilding if you do xyz but you won't enjoy the bodybuilding as much yeah it's not worth it because I'm really not money motivated I learned that over time it's like if I have to sacrifice quality of life that I'm not money motivated I'm motivated to find ways to enjoy life that are profitable and I think that's something that people really really miss out on and I wouldn't sacrifice like you said Scott the joy of going to the gym for any of those things like I just like to go you know that's why it's always been so simple and I had to get to the gym the other day he was like what are you drinking in that shaker cup because I have a mutant metal shaker cup that like it keeps the drinks cold and I was like water with ice both in this cup you know and he was like oh that's all I was like yeah it's legs I found that any amino's anything with flavor upset my stomach so I just was like oh I just want to do that anymore yeah you know and I know when I was younger whoa whoa you can't not have your amino's and your shaker demon all those things during the workout it's going to be a terrible workout especially legs you know yeah yeah so literally the two biggest body parts that I train as far as you know breaking down the muscle legs and back are the two days that I drink water in the gym yeah and nothing else I always said do the amino's anything before but all like young me I should say that would not have worked because I know what the book tells me the book says you gotta have all these things while you train so interesting piece but I think more people should consider training and doing things purely on passion and then just seeing what they do you know I choose to record my videos just for myself and never did anything with them I just it doesn't have to be like you can do bodybuilding and not have it be like also a social media thing and you're trying to promote some sort of business like just because you're getting into bodybuilding doesn't mean that you have to do all that stuff too like you can just watch the weights you know yeah I I even had like when I go for when I take my bike out I've even had some days where I'm like I'm not going to put a camera up I just just want to like not think about it you know what I mean I mean it's trying not to be interrupted at all and let my brain flow a little more and that sort of stuff and it's super fun like it it's a different experience because you're just thinking about you know audit oh I want to forgot that you know like you just don't think I see that with clients sometimes and actually I have to talk to about it because they'll set the camera and then we're doing their set and I'll see them I'm like camera didn't fucking move dude do not worry about that and if it did move oh well like set it and be done and that's yeah very cute because you'll see it and it's funny because I always say something like you have no idea how much you lost during that set because you were thinking about the camera yeah even if it's just right before like they're sitting there with the dumbbells on their knees and they're getting ready and they kind of looked just to double that last triple check you know and then you will only die 100% in yeah I've never there's not a single set that I've ever posted in 17 years of recording body learning in some way that would have cost me my career if it didn't go up so like you know I mean I've had that before I mean it's funny but just just the other day I can remember what I was doing but I had a really good set of of rows and Nikki actually double tap the screen like she was trying to kill me so she started and turned off the camera at the same power and then filmed the whole set and then she got done and she goes oh and I said did you double tap the screen and she goes yeah sorry I go cool because I did that two sets ago to you I of course had the first amp it up like I was disappointed I don't care right right right start with you know abuse of your spouse and then tell them what you already did I think it's healthy first I think it's healthy first to miss stuff accidentally miss some of that oh can always have it our way we know it's keep you a little hard it allows me to lie about how me reps I got on it too yeah I was 17 she's like it was 12 17 you weren't there it's on a camera yeah yeah so yeah well um I don't know we were just in Vegas Dustin we were talking about that you got about that for a minute I got your thoughts I got your thoughts if you guys being in Vegas and uh and I heard you guys were you guys did a podcast you guys were at the the Dragons layer and you got on with uh Flex I wonder when that's coming out I should check right now we don't even know the answer to that see there was a lot I didn't ask you did I I knew you wouldn't know the answer you couldn't ask Flex either he wouldn't know either yeah yeah he's the one of us I was like that he I guarantee if I said hey I'm gonna send you 500 dollars but you can't ask anybody wins the show anyway yeah but um great great guy yeah we're gonna start at the top though we're gonna start at the top so okay Ron explain how we found out that both of us are in Vegas because the amount of people who do not believe me yeah no no we got you that trip so um it was like a couple months ago Emily and I were like we need a little like like at least a weekend away before the work trips start you know right I was like she's gonna come to the Arnold with me and she's you know she might might even come to one of the other shows with me too um but you know they're work trips right so she's we need a little getaway so so why don't we get away in January we book a trip to Vegas and um and and uh and uh then I just happen to be talking to Nikki and I say hey it's 10 weeks out this weekend why don't you have a cheat meal because she doesn't have one yet she's done like 10 weeks with no cheat meals right and she's you know she's like okay y'know you know tell take a meal that to be great because I'll be in Vegas and I go oh we're gonna be in Vegas and then I said text and dusty and it just so happens that they're going so we uh we wound up making plans to train at dragons layer one day and then we went to went out for a steak and a magic show on Saturday so you had your show yeah it's good who was that who is it dusty shinlim yep shinlim and he had a mentalist with him which in my opinion the mentalist stole the show I don't even know what that is what's a mentalist who was them mentally they like read you know read your mind remember his crazy as shit Charlie cloud wasn't it something sure I didn't pay attention my brain broke so he towns during yes it was awesome like he's just like he's pointing he's like he's like okay what's your post a code and the guys like you know 90133 and he like puts in the calculator is like what's your post a code and other guys like we're gonna just add them and then he has another guy randomly hit the the things six times or whatever and he keeps adding all these numbers and he get this this weird number yeah and yeah that's all do the same thing but we're doing it on our phones with him so we all have the same number on our screen okay and then and then the number was um was one 25 yeah 20 25 27 27 23 or was it was it nine nine anyways anyways the date time of the moment we were in and then he goes the reason this number is so important is everyone look at your phones and he goes any draws lines through the numbers and it's the date and 733 and he puts PM which we all have done our phones and it's January 25 2023 at 733 PM everyone's phones says 733 and the whole crowd just like popped like it was crazy it was just like that sort of stuff all night like that's just getting hammered hammered with ridiculous stuff and then the the card tricks and the illusions and it was a lot of fun I really dig that stuff because I I really I don't know I I have such an appreciation for like a people that are so crafty and the sights and practice you know like how many hours did that guy put in yeah okay I know what you're talking about now and I saw this guy do something was crazy he it was on a TV show and they brought in these three social media what do you call him people who why can't anything of the word right now people who are thank you thank you I guess I just blocked that word out of my head or something he didn't want to say it any any had all these different sets in all these different props and he had a conversation with each one of them and he told them I want you to be creative and I want you to use the props in here and I want you to come up with your best picture and through that conversation he gave them suggestions without them knowing and they all ended up creating the same picture like every single one of them out all these different rooms all these different props through the suggestions he gave which is crazy to think of just how how much we are able to you know how susceptible we are to that kind of stuff but these guys that they were like the best and they all did the same thing yeah that stuff is so fun that stuff really is I can imagine it was a good night oh yeah it was awesome and there was like show the really cool interaction stuff like he gave us everyone had four playing cards yeah remember that at the very beginning oh yeah I go to your seat and there's four there's a little pack of cards on everyone's seat and it's four cards and there's all different random cards and he had us shuffle them and separate them and move them around and then he had this rip them in half and then restack them and then cut and then throw it over our shoulder and then cut, restack, throw it over our shoulder you know he had us do all this stuff until we only had oh and then put in our cards one under our pocket yeah and put like one piece in our pocket and then blah blah blah and then he had us down to three and he threw two over your shoulders so you throw two over your shoulder and then you hit your left with one piece of it's like half a card okay because K now take the one out of your pocket and you take it out and it's the matching half for that card that's so wild and it was like every single person so you're just like yeah that was a great evening thing and so yeah that was the first trick wrong and I'm looking at Emily and I'm like it was gonna be a long night yeah just and I know that a lot of like some of those tricks are like these mathematical rules that are super deep and complicated and like people like me are brains just go do you know yeah so but I like that that show me show me what I show me how much smarter you are than me like you're deep understanding of mathematics well I'm gonna look forward to hearing the podcast when that comes out I'll be sure to put links up to it here at Think Big and also Peter friend of mine and he was at the gym there and I know that his significant others working with you Dusty he had told me that you guys were sitting in the lobby when he showed up and he said some guy younger guy came running up it was like hey I love the podcast do you guys so how many people did you meet that were into the show um there was a few at the gym yeah that uh there was that that older dude in the gym too that was training it was like oh you guys are the best I love our fears show so funny and it was just really like I was like oh wow that's awesome you know and um yeah there were several people at the gym that listened to the podcast but there was two young dudes that came up they were great they wanted Dusty to watch his deadlift video one to the back he could deadlift video yeah that was very good by the way he didn't go to actually he said what was funny was he said he goes I had three hopes for this trip hoping that I would see you in Ron that I could get you to review my deadlift video and that I could run in the Nick Walker so I was like oh cool so we're sitting there and he showed me the deadlift video and it was great and I was like man I said you know a minor tweak to like head position but as far as your execution in this and that yeah it was flawless you know what you don't get to say very often what you're hoping you get to in your in person yes great and we're kind of chatting it up and I said hey good news man he's just what I go your third thing just walked in behind you and Nick Walker just walked in and he goes no way that's right what a trip it was funny it was funny yeah we saw Nick today's both days we were there we saw Nick so he's training and just gave the you know said high and and said all the best this year and you know he was pretty he's pretty excited I think this year and he looks he looks great he's a big and lean like yeah you know that's he walked out he walked out with a sick hamstring pump with a short kind of up yeah the ham's hanging out yeah I was a free funny yeah he's fantastic so it's good good time and then obviously we we didn't enjoy the show you know with with flex and that was another thing is because I had told flex a couple weeks ago we were coming and he told me to remind you were coming right that that I was coming Nick you know and then I forgot so literally like the night before we came I was like hey Ron's coming to so hopefully we'll see you and I missed him at the gym we trained and did whatever they were at the shot show and I left and Ron ran into flex and then I don't know what happened but after chatting a little bit whatever late that night I get a text wrong gets a text he's like hey is there any way you guys could do the podcast with us good yeah I got a schedule the whole thing like having talked to the producer but you're both here so can we do it and it was funny because I will I didn't see it I was up 22 hours straight at that point so I went to bed before that text which was only like nine something there but it was midnight my time yeah and I woke up in the morning and I texted him back and then we didn't hear from for a few hours that he's trying to get a hold of the of the producer but he was already doing other things he wasn't planning on shooting that day and eventually he was like can you guys be there two a clock and Ron had plans with Emily I was so low because Nicky was shooting that day so it was easy and Emily proved her her status with Ron because literally I texted my go I don't think guys are out flex just asked about two a clock and this is like what 12 30 yeah and Ron likes like we have the whole day oh no kidding literally three minutes later just we're all good to see that I'm like and that is how it is done yeah and we guys just take note of how you support somebody on a good opportunity and you know she just said cool and and we were there for hours I mean yeah I was we were in the hotel we were actually in the hotel gym that day trained okay because we didn't have time to go to dragons there we had a date and yeah and so we're in the hotel gym training and I see my phone and I'm like I shit you know I walk over to and I take my headphone out she takes her head phone out and I said so uh flex wants to know flex wants to know if Dusty and I might want to do the show it to a clock and she goes oh I work on my laptop by the pool you just go to your thing that's cool and I'm like that's why we work yeah you know yeah I didn't blink no issue 12 years later you know I got back to the room at like 430 and um she's like chilling with a book and she's like let's go we're like okay you know what I mean that's awesome man that really is hey we got some good feedback on the last episode people are freaking there really been they've been enjoying the show I do want to say we could use more questions for the next episode but I wanted to bring this coming up in particular because there was a correction uh something Dusty had said remade steak. Dusty had said that Justin Harris wasn't the prettiest physique and trappone nutrition said small correction I believe Dusty meant to say Justin had the prettiest physique I think that's what you meant to say. Yes I love the people who don't know who that comment came from that are like I don't get it yeah for those who missed it that was just in correcting me on his gorgeous flawless Sean Rodenesque. Yes yeah especially the silhouette shots. Oh yeah yeah yeah I think of the arm over the head from the side I don't think of Roden yeah I think Justin Harris. Also we had Justin, Shire Chimden. Every time someone says 20 rep squats I think of Justin Harris for the rest of my life really I always think of him because of those videos those widow makers sets that was how I learned about DC was watching him do those widow makers. Yeah so that will whenever someone says 20 reps squats I think of his 405 widow makers and my guy yeah since we know he watches or someone will direct him to this. Yeah Justin this is your public invite to be on the show. So massive. Yes and we don't have to we could talk about anything we talk about guitars let's talk about guitars man come on. Let's talk about guitars for like an hour. It's like late a minute. Yeah yeah okay we had Justin Shire commented too. If you remember what we posted those pictures he wasn't satisfied he says I still am not happy when I look at those two pictures today so it's good not me. It's good that this is no the judge he has. Yeah yeah Justin's photos but Justin's physique photos leave me eternally unsatisfied. Yeah yes. So we did have a bunch of stuff though one question I'm not seeing it off hand but I remember what it was we had a guy say that so he's wondering when's the best time to end a cut. He said he's not competing anything like that he's just trying to get into better shape now he does say he's a strength athlete so I don't know what that means and he says that his strength is plummeted over the last two weeks. So I thought it'd be a good topic just across the board especially for guys who don't have a show when do you stop cutting? Yeah so people that are cutting for purely cosmetic reasons are part of this group right and there's those that cut as part of a strategy to maximize insulin sensitivity and you know make things more efficient if they you know that sort of stuff so those are kind of the two types of people that I think mainly cut without a show when you say oh yeah yeah so if you're doing it for cosmetic reasons I mean if you haven't gotten the result you want yet then like I would maybe look at fixing your diet instead of ending the cut like maybe he just needs to do a week of really high calories fill out get kind of like you know all glycogen up and maybe the strength comes quick right back and he can get back into a more strategically planned cut there he's not going to have a strength plummet on that's one option and then the other option if he's doing it to like you know maximize insulin sensitivity and all that sort of stuff I mean then you know maybe it's time to end the cut I don't I don't know the reason why you're strength is down like are you 3% body fat and that's why you're strength is down like are your glutes peeled or are you just like under eating you know so those are the questions that have to be analyzed but yeah there's only a few real reasons to continue or end it yeah I was going to say the only thing I was going to add was I think sometimes the a very common mistake it's what I did when I was first even coaching people was the calories were too low too fast the output was too high too fast yeah you have to be very understanding of how a cut works and also understand that it's not linear progress you know linear progress because that's an issue we we just talked about it Ron driving back home last time it's like people don't see that Ron with he was working with Nikki like he started a diet and it kind of went along and was going really good and then it kind of like fluttered for a little bit and just kind of hung out and experience tells you sometimes especially with a longer timeline leave it alone you don't need to immediately the moment progress stops go okay but I better lower the calories or increase the output or whatever give it a minute because all of a sudden it started dropping again you know and all your guys time together it's been two adjustments total yeah and that's all it takes to make massive changes if you've got the patience and I find I mean I just had a guy a fan send me a thing hey you might look at this diet so he sends me his diet over it so yeah I'm starting to cut this week and I said can you send me your previous diet real quick so he sent that over it was a 1,400 calorie difference he was planning to do in a day oh god right like a median like day one like yeah day one is this I was like whoa whoa whoa whoa and based on his pictures and wait and everything he was in good shape I was like I would do I would shave 200 calories soft total right right and and just cruise for a minute and then I said and maybe implement a off training day diet that's you know another two 300 less than that calories start there you know so that is usually issue because outside of mentally you shouldn't be losing strength until your deep into a prop yeah yeah yeah I saw a few people remember a couple episodes ago I made a comment about how I used to you know have the mentality of fighting to keep every rap you know what I mean yeah and I saw a few people reposted that like they you know that that struck a chord with a couple of people and that's that's that's you have to keep that in mind like you should be able to get really lean and still be really strong you know it's a break record so the end yeah the I I there there was an exception with my pressing would always take a bit of a step because I felt like you know with a lot of fluid in my shoulders and stuff when I would be heavier I had like a pillow on my chest and then you know I dropped like 10 pounds of water and I was saying there's no pillow on the chest so the my pressing my pressing always took a bit of a hit but that's other things would go up during crap you know so and if he's a strength athlete that would be super frustrating you know like if anything you'd want to get your strength to weight ratio maximize so you'd want your old lifts with your new body weight you know and so yeah we're just being got our new curse probably just drop calories too low for too long you know agreed there's even that point too where if like you were saying Ron if you took like some time to to really fill out for a week maybe that will fix it sometimes even just like throwing in higher carbs or something before you train you know on a big body part you might find that you you hit that point that like that magic pocket where you start adding food in and you keep getting leaner you know and I mean yeah at that extra cup of rice and before training and now you're like three times as hungry after you train you had more glycogen and the muscle more energy and yeah now you're getting even you know lighter than you were before yeah I've had a lot of people say hey you know like most of the people that reach out while they're already dieting and asking hey can you like help me with my prep yeah I find the number one thing is when they send me the diet they're on it's like way too little food too far out that's yeah that's kind of one of the common things I think then that's what triggers them obviously to reach out to a coach it's like things aren't going well you know and dusty mentioned that kind of a rough number he said 200 calories for that one guy which is totally you know doable but like for the most part I tend to think 500 calories like that's where I kind of started it's like that's full 500 calories but you know obviously someone's leaner I would go less you know the latter might might even go like 20% of their calories you know but there's a little bit of over they already yeah and timeline you know like I got nine weeks his a little different than 19 so yeah you know at the end of the day time is your best friend when trying to get leaner and hold your strength so you know there's also you have to you know if you're rushing a prep there's only so much you can do sometimes I remember when I started bodybuilding like my first show when I talked to someone I was like how long do I need to prep and they said 12 weeks and this was based off of nothing I didn't they seem like sure it off just 12 weeks was the number that's how it is it's been yeah yeah it's so funny because now like at the end of my career um 20 weeks was always my number not because it takes me 20 weeks I can get ready really fast I just found that I enjoyed the prep better it went better I maintain more muscle mass strength all the things I enjoyed about bodybuilding stayed with a longer prep so now it's funny I almost feel bad because people will reach out to me and to have a high effort prep how long should we go and those send pictures and they're in a good spot you know where I could get them ready in 12 weeks I'm like listen perfect world it'll take 10 can I have 20 right and it's not because I'm trying to make more money off of you right I can guarantee you a better result with that timeline and unfortunately it's become common enough now that people say yes to that where I think when I was younger 12 was the number if somebody asked for 20 I'd like to just try to get my money yeah people would think we're a bad coach if you told him 20 weeks yes for me I would take you that long yeah I remember the old like I kind of kind of cut the tail end of that um that was an 80s thing was like a 12 week prep and everyone it was very common like all the pros would say yeah you know 12 weeks so for the Mr. Olympia like it was very very common to hear that number and I think it was because you know first of all those guys were you know at the time the genetically elite you know of people that were lifting weights those 80s pros were they were the cream of the crop like you know there's and um and they kind of you know obviously stayed leaner in the offseason anyways and then also the condition wasn't as like ridiculous of a standard for the most part yeah so there was that so I sort of saw that like transition like you know I think my first show I even prep for like 20 might have even been 12 week prep for my favorite for show but when I was in high school I did a show as a junior I might have done 12 weeks for that but but by the time I got to like competing and like hanging out with bodybuilders that everyone was talking about 16 weeks that week that was the number yep yeah and it was 16 for ages like we always did 16 week prep and we'd be fat as hell and we'd get to the 16 week mark and we'd be like just so mash everything to you know getting shape and then the kind of the concept of the 20 week prep I remember when that was creeping in and these guys were coming in like you know you know at first it was like the guys are getting super super dice we're just genetically the best right at getting diced but then when the prep's got longer I found that was when other people were getting peeled yeah that's I think what the change was it's I agree yeah it's it's time time is the key for most people to get peeled and it just takes most people a lot longer than than we used to think we used to hope you know right so that was my trick was was at at the state level I could be competitive because I could get really really lean and honestly the conditioning that I brought I don't think it I don't think it would stand out as much compared to the guys today like it would just be like oh yeah there's another guy who's in a good shape you know it was like literally everybody is absolutely peeled now like the people like just got top five at any of the national level shows for light heavyweight like all of those guys are going to be way more conditioned than what they were you know 10 15 years ago but it was the same thing was that 12 week went to 16 and and then started extending but I remember back then it like the 12 week preps people people used to think that like you would go too far like after that 12 weeks it would be like it would be counterproductive yeah like you know now you're going to lose muscle so you need to keep it short and man people used to come in like like you said Ron like the early 2000s like heavy and then they would die at hard in that 12 weeks like it that was brutal diet man well man that nasser nasser would be 325 pounds like 12 weeks out from the Olympia yeah only be eaten like double McDonald meals with double blizzards and everything like that and like and you know water just blown out and then you know within 12 weeks he'd be 280 peeled out of his you know at the Olympia getting second yeah you know it was just crazy and so there were those guys doing that still back then it was like just seems harsh I remember when I worked with Chad Nichols in 2009 um I you know we we were getting really heavy like that's when I got to 330 yeah and I was like we're going to start preps soon and he's a guy just want to sit at this weight for a while and and then and then come down and I was like we don't have like a lot of time like a laughter because I just sit at this weight for a while and I go well how long do you think you want to prep for me he's like well I really like to do 10 weeks how do you feel about that and I went I do not have the confidence to do 10 weeks like I've never been to tell you in my life and I want to be like really pillbs I go okay well let's do 15 you already 15 and I was like okay so that's the you know that's a nice that's a nice job yeah yeah but in hindsight I think you know I could use another few weeks I mean I could have really sat in better condition for sat in that condition for a longer period of time and it would have been a better even if I didn't lose body fat it would have been a better you know you know what I mean yeah so so you know in hindsight I kind of wish I would have even done more than that I think that you know you know Chad's worked with some pretty genetically gifted guys they get shape in a hurry so he probably gets some of those guys like you know oh it weeks let's go you know but I just was like man I don't think my body's gonna do that I bet you no matter what you did to Ronnie he never looked flat you know what I mean I could imagine dieting him it had to be easy not easy but easy you know the only way to get Ronnie to be flat would be to overly dehydrate him yeah I think it's kind of what happened in O2 against you know it's funny is talking to Chris about this and not him specifically and people he worked with but something he brought up about prepping guys like that that is different he said well it's easier let me refray this I'm going to put my own words that's what I'm gonna put in his mouth but more or less the the idea was sometimes it's easier but sometimes it's harder because they always look good so you have to remember that you know ramen eight weeks out if you were working with him and you were a very good prepped coach but you'd never work with someone like that I think the overall mass and what appears to be conditional the things is so mind-boggling you don't realize how much more room there is to improve we said that it kind of hit me because I have I did learn that over the years working with people was like when I worked with someone who was small I was like listen we just gotta get nasty because there's nothing here to work with other than conditioning and it wasn't until years and getting better that I understood how to bring someone in that was 250 on stage and sliced you know because they looked great at 265 and you're like oh this is this is good and and I think that's the the line of the longer prep two because it allows you to bring that plane and slowly and you know you can go a little too far so they flatten out wherever go okay now it's bump it up okay what happened to the look and kind of get some feedback because you know Scott you were like oh man now everyone's peeled and I was so glad you mentioned national level shows something and you haven't been to the shows I've been to like no one's peeled you mean at this day level yeah and that's it I mean I want to bring it up not to chart you know take a shot at state level shows but to remind people they're on their way up get shredded that is your magic that's what we'll get people's heads turning that middle rates win over all's at local scale that really can because they get nasty and I can't press that enough because every show we go to I mean we I went to a show a few months ago and there were it was that is the best show I'd seen a long time at a local level show and a figure girl walked out and I was like there's the best I have seen the entire show I mean she was mind boggling and I'm like no disrespect to her but we're talking about up to heavy weight violence it were very good and she stole the show because they weren't hard enough that's cool you know when you're like and you want to go tell them that like you guys were awesome and you won the overall but you want to know that next level because I think that's what people get thrown off on is you really should go especially if you live in area where it's not hard to do I think you should go to a national level show or pro qualifier and look at the top guys to really understand what for black about term averages yeah the top five are all the nannas as far as conditioning goes at a pro qualifier and I think that's really important when you're coming in because that's not what enough people are thinking about and and you'll find yourself getting embarrassed pretty quickly because conditioning makes you look bigger than you are you know and a lot of factors and I think I've shared this before but Chris Cook told me at one point the first national level show he went to he's from Alaska so didn't know anybody yet and he was a heavyweight he got to prejaging a little bit late and he runs in and he sees all these guys lined up and he just had falls back and he asked the sky goes dude how long ago the heaviest go and he goes oh they haven't went yet we're middle weights and as soon as he heard that he realized he was going to get smoked because he thought they were all heavier than him and there were two classes lighter than he said like brain yeah he immediately goes that's what I realized I spent $2,000 to watch a body yeah when I first started coaching I and and really when I first started coaching competitors it was the men's physique guys that started coming to me and it was when men's physique was brand new and I remember the guys in the gym they thought like oh well we're not body builders we don't train like body builders a lot of them thought like at the time like we don't have to train legs because you don't see legs all that stuff all the all the stereotypes that we all made fun of men's physique yeah that was that first round yeah so I had a couple guys that came to me and wanted help and so I was like well fuck it I'm just gonna die at them like body builders and we just got peeled like absolutely lights out freaking peeled and we went to the show and they took first in second you know second to the the guy who took the other yeah and and back then because it it I just was thinking further about conditioning then versus now because it was like it was almost easy to coach back then when I first started because like nobody else got that and I became like this men's physique coach like all of a sudden all these men's physique guys were coming to me like I had this special knowledge about men's physique I was just doing what we did with body builders you know and their smaller dudes their smaller body builders and it's just gotten crazy shape you know yeah it still works today you know if that's what I do it so what I do with figure competitors they're just body builders to me yeah I think they're all body builders and really important yeah yeah yeah yeah but I can just like I can use just the differences the fullness at the like the conditioning at the end you know what I mean it's the same level of actual muscle or fat loss but you just don't want to see veins but it's like the exact same thing yeah I mean I've had you know every time I've helped like a you know I've had like several really good figure clients it you know went one in pro cards and stuff like that and um I always get a bunch of inquiries afterwards you know what do you you know what did you do and I'm like well she's I don't know her body weights 135 so we just think of a body builder but with a body weight of 135 pounds this is a hard yeah so that's all it is to me just muscle in fat that's all you made of you know muscle fat and bone your own water such yeah it was some water yeah there's a lot of water a little bit of that yeah yeah what's next got run what's a hoser ah that's another Canadian word a hoser's like a softball yeah like a goofball like a yeah I wouldn't say loser that would be it there would be like be I could goofballs a hoser dummy can you use it the sentence ah don't be a hoser man copy let's go it's very that every single movie slap shot they call the each other at all the time like their friends hey hoser yep yeah hey loser do like not yeah sort of offensive well in 2024 probably is probably yes anymore yeah everything is offensive we used to it's a thing that would be a it's it's meant it's meant it's meant to be offensive between friends yeah yeah it's a funny way to do that to my friends yeah all right we have a whole whole list here says no prize for guessing who questions is uh who the this question is to trigger would you rather use an expo toilet barefoot eat a burger that's arrived fully loaded with salad in mayo and you can't send it back or pick it off or use your cell phone for a critical call that's been on the gym floor facing down for an hour no you cannot clean it no option for Bluetooth or speaker you need skin to screen contact no blue paul's buscoe balls deep raw into this answer she hears and he says I'll see I'll see you next month so he must be going to the Arnold so I don't even because I know that it's so great I've read the name of like this is fun to Scott oh Scott that's a good one he actually he well thought out he message me last week and he was like did you guys record yet and I was like no not yeah I was he was like okay I got a question for you so this was that was good he was playing this yeah what yeah um funny enough I'm going with the phone off the floor pool picked a phone up off the floor put it flat against my face make it call I'll even hold it against my face until the emergency crews arrive oh see like I'm using it to call 911 for an emergency if they're like yeah you know ambulance to be there in ten minutes I'm okay I'll hold and I would do that I think the last one would be I couldn't do the burger I didn't eat the burger now I couldn't eat it it would because I would just it would just be too much it's too too much sensory violation for me that's violation of the inside of my body too like you're violating it inside of me like I'm not gonna let that happen like the barefoot the toilet I can handle that like I'm a man I could walk through the forest naked if I had to but it's not something I would ever want to do and I would be very interested in disinfecting my feet as soon as possible but I would rather go through the forest naked than through the bathroom at a bodybuilding show with my bed oh yeah I'm just saying like he was a weak comparison okay well make it minus ten no there's a lot of enchasing you I don't know I don't think these people understand how the toilets and Dubai were but anyways go yeah yeah so so yeah so I would I would put the phone against my face nice okay that's where I am I got that wrong just so you know I actually thought the thing he would least do was the thing I thought he would accept just because I was like it's just a little mayo it's fine but I should have known since we know onions put a movie edge too anyways it does completely change the burger I'm gonna agree with you on that yeah so hey if I put shit it's not like it's an oxygen needle yeah yeah it was just got shit on it it's the same meal it's good yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah all right so Tony has a good series of questions for us coming up apparently he says question for the next episode and every episode I'm going to ask the same thing for a different body part what are the most common mistakes you see people make when it comes to training hamstrings first one is a lot of their hips lift up when they're doing any curling movement so true we're going to low back and glutes into it yeah the thing with hip flexion and extension is it has to be like for leg curls it has to be set like if you're going to be flexed at the hip then you're gonna be for the state flexed at the hip through the rep and make the hamstrings do all the pulling right if you're going to be you know on a laying leg curl you know like more like that then you just want to try to maintain that position because the more of this you give up it's like it's like leaning back doing a cable crossover yeah you're you're losing power you're like adjusting mechanics to compensate you're getting less rep there's less of everything happening so you want to make sure you're in a fixed position when you're leg curling you know I would say not hinging properly you know doing stiff leg deadlifts but they're just not working the hamstrings like they should be they're not hinging properly so this learning to bend over and hang from your hamstrings like even with no weight just full of your arms over your chest and you know drop back in a stiff leg deadlift position but you know let your butt like drop back behind you and kind of you know what I mean it's just which will learn to hinge on your hamstrings where you can feel them holding you up that's really important you can see you can see your hips moving backward and space right yeah as your binging forward versus I see a lot of times people make the mistake of like that lower back is doing all the work and then coming up and it's like just basically it's just a deadlift at that the bar at the bar should go really straight up and down close to your body with your stiff leg deadlifting you know what I mean I kind of reach out over their toes and that's a huge mistake too so if you just hit hinging when you're doing those or something that you know really important is people are reaching for the ground like they're thinking it's about touching the ground or getting their hands or the dumbbells they hit the ground okay winning reality the the perfect execution to keep it simple is that your torso gets parallel with the ground and the only way of that happens is if you're like you said Scott the glutes go backwards because if the only focus is leaning forward then you're you're also putting the weight into your toes I just barely went over that with someone actually with a row okay same thing if you're trying to think about just leaning forward to do a row well you have no power you have no base and your weight is in your toes so I'm like no don't lean forward so you're as backward you automatically fall and now you've got a better balance you know in your body for more power so keep that in mind and actually I think it was Joe Bennett's he went into pretty good detail about getting your your back parallel the floor and when you think that way you really realize that in order to do that your hips got to push backwards pretty far and it's an extreme stretch yeah I think that's the mistake I've made with barbell row now that I think about it because I've thought always thought with that movement about bending over and then just brace in the fuck out of it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it was terrible yeah yeah yeah and then I don't know another thing would be you know you see people do kind of those those reps where they they pull real hard and it comes up and it sort of really quickly hits their butt and bounces it off their butt yeah yeah you know like there's no control in the top of the top of the rep and you know that's the the strength curve on a lot of leg curls is kind of like harder out of the bottom and then it kind of bounces off the butt but yeah try to mean try to mean obtain control of it at all times and it's good to do like some sets where you hold it in a contraction yeah it's good to do that on on things so you master that's also part of mastery of movements to is just understanding how to do that with you know even if it's just the odd set here and there I like that it's a good practice if you ever with the lying hamstring curl only brought it up like three quarters of the way yeah that was probably a set for sure yeah like they were like gone up on my elbows to try to fully extend my back so I was literally straight trying to get the shortest when trying to get the shortest contraction possible by having the hips fully fully extended I never tried to do that one and rather say old you know like the old nodded the slag curl was flat right you know so if you guys go up on their elbows and their hamstrings are literally being like the craziest short position but you can only use like feel 30 pounds in that position right what do you guys think of like the single leg standing hamstring curl versus the prone versus the seated what do you think of the standing particularly I always love to single leg curl I was love the isolation of it there's lots of them I've really loved using over the years I usually try to do them standing up they were sort of a more of a contraction based thought of in my mind I found that realistically just and I think this comes back to simplify things I could smoke my ham's way better on a seated leg curl than any other curl in the gym and I also found that a lying leg curl in a standing leg curl was the same thing I'm just laying vertically now and I feel like sometimes in bodybuilding you need to do that it's like you can get into the you know the the facts of what that is and break it down but you don't need to like if I take the lying leg curl that is here and I put it vertically what are we doing yeah I'm doing a lying leg curl again and I understand that because I write programs for people sometimes where I'll put those you know a couple things and a lying and a seated but for me I do seated every time I never lie down I don't need to yeah it's the same movement I get the most out of it and then of course ten years later I find out that that actually is the superior movement like you're checking on it so it's like oh that thing that I felt was accurate but I do think in the same regard of somewhere argue with me and they say no I feel a lying leg curl better then I say do that you know because like you said run you and you like a standing leg curl you like a standing leg curl because you have really good connection with your muscle and you keep it out of it and you're not twisting a younger athlete if you put them on a standing leg curl they're gonna mangle it you know what I mean yeah often it does allow you to to to that shows how connected you are because I actually like them too I do a kneeling one sometimes which is the same thing it's just one yeah yeah yeah that's a knotted but that's another one where you see people on it like oh I really just sit down because you're twisting your hips coming up and everything's pulling except for your hamstring or it's getting a little bit you know like our kneeling leg curls actually really good one of my gym and I always laugh because I go up to 80 pounds on it and it goes to 200 and I'm like right let's use in that because my 80 ain't pretty so oh man okay yeah I don't know we were talking about hamstrings doing leg builds or some shit yep yeah that's always happening yeah but we don't have any um and that was about our last really good question that we hit we did have one question for Ryan that was training or excuse me something to do with music there was a Ron music okay and just getting reconfigured out on Ron music that's beautiful give you just a second oh and then scroll through the list multiple choice or something yes oh yeah here we go um love the show is always always love hearing Ron talk about music so was wondering um what he'd like to achieve in playing on in 2024 and how does picking up the base feel in learning guitar first and any personal favorite bases says play based in drums myself can't help but be curious uh okay um i forget where that question started oh yeah one of my goals in 2024 yes yes so 2024 has started really well just by fluke of all the practice I laid down last year I learned two guitar solos in the last two weeks and uh they're easy solos but i'm not a guitar solo guy right i'm like been learning riffs for 30 years and i've never really been able to play solos but i'm learning a lot more this last year with scales and stuff so i'm able to play some stuff and uh i got two black Sabbath solos now that i can play into the end of the void and snow blind which are like two of my favorite Sabbath songs and they got great guitar solos and um i've got those now and i'm just getting them better and better now and i can play along with them and i still screw up at the end of both of them a little bit sometimes but i'm right in there and so it's really been good because i all kind of came together um there's some some acdc guitar solos i want to learn this year that are a little like a little easier you know not quite as blazing fast a little shorter little easier you know so um there's a couple of those solos i'm gonna learn this year and then as far as the bass goes um i picked up a bass a couple times when i was younger like and fooled around with it so um but having one now i can't have a play to it for about a month but um you know once you play guitar for so long picking up the bass is pretty easy like yeah exactly the same it's just the strings are fatter and it's bigger and it's got to kind of adapt and um obviously it's a different instrument you know you know when you're playing and like like what's your role in the band it's a different instrument right um but it's been a lot of fun and and learning a bunch of songs on bass has fundamentally increased my enjoyment of all the music i love because yeah i just understand the bass lines more now like you know i used always here the guitar riffs and i could see the guys hand moving and i'm like i wonder where that is on the neck that's probably around there he's probably doing this and then the bass line just sounded cool yeah but now when i'm doing it they're like i would i would say oh i love that bass line but i wasn't actually thinking like what's you doing where is he and now i do that so um so that's been cool so yeah a lot of the music that i've loved for decades i i listen to it now and i have a new little bit of a new appreciation for some of the bass and um there's um as far as like bass players that that i that i appreciate or whatever um i would say christino vicelleic from nirvana is like one of my favorite bass players because his bass lines were like the it's all the melody and then in nirvana songs kobains riffs are very simple they're they're like the almost the marching part of it and the bass line is like all the melodies and stuff going on and he's really really busy on the fretboard and so that's really cool and then at the opposite end of the spectrum you know cliff Williams from acdc he takes the opposite role he's like the train tracks that the song is on and it's going that direction and you know a lot of dom dom dom dom dom dom dom dom dom dom dom dom dom dom dom dom dom you know like a lot of eighth notes just drive in the song along and uh that's been his role for 40 years in that band and you got to you got to hand it down you got to hand it to him because like you know it's easy offensive lineman of acdc right you know they get no credit no one knows their names but the quarterback wouldn't have any of those yards without him right and yeah so so that i i respect bass players a lot and Steve Harris from iron maiden is probably i think one of the all-time greatest most important bass players um because he's also the principal songwriter of that band so when you listen to iron maiden listen to it from the concept of the bass player wrote these songs which is very unusual in most cases so that's why the bass lines are so crazy and iron maiden and so important and so complex is because like you know he's actually the songwriter principally so yeah a no cliff cliff cliff from metallic you know cliff Burton he died after the master of puppets album but he's on their first three albums and cliff was he's probably thought of as like the most influential metal bass player of all time he was just and he was like the Jimmy Hendrix of bass at the time people were like what is this like people would listen to metallic albums and they wouldn't realize that like certain parts was cliff on the bass they thought it was a guitar riff like you know he's got that opening riff to whom the bell tolls people a lot of a lot of times thought that that was guitar but that's actually cliff on his bass with a phaser and there's just a lot I just I really appreciate these guys I love what what they all contributed and you know bass players are cool like I said there you don't get a lot of love you know but at times they can they can walk around the venue and they don't have to have a hat or sunglasses on you know but you know they can get away with a lot which is probably great thing hey you know that's a win. it's a flee he got he got like a ton of credit as a bass player but they they're coming you know not kind of he's one of those guys like everybody knows flee you know yeah fleas a larger than life bass player you know and what a sound too like he's got it he's incredible bass player I've people here that chilly peppers obviously but that's you know you got to watch video is a flee like freestyle and with other bands and stuff and you realize how unbelievable he is he just play any man like those guys at that that guys like flea they're that's not an instrument that's just part of his body you know yeah and there you could do anything you know so yeah pretty cool pretty cool that's all we got over here we got to remind people once again we didn't say it early so this is once again for the last five minute crew or so maybe last six minute I don't know the Arnold I'm getting pumped you I've had people messaging me like hey I can't wait to meet you guys I can't wait to see you guys out there so I'm getting excited I need to start laying out all the equipment and making sure that everything's situated now that's like what my game plan is in this next week that way I'm not like running to try to find anything last minute it's gonna be a lot of fun I can't wait to get to the Arnold and you know see everyone again I got people messaging me I'll see you in a few weeks yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no I'm excited I'm excited for the to begin all the traveling I got mute none of missions starting again soon nice contact a bunch of gems we're
