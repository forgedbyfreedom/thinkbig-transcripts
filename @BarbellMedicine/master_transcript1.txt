How do you spell youretta the unlived in the lac hot The biggest mistake I see trainees make is mistaking training and testing performance. So they come into training sessions. They are looking to add weight or increase their performance sometimes at the expense of the training effect of the actual session. Any hidden talents? Huh, I could repair things, but that doesn't think that's hidden. That's my past job. But I can't sing or joggle or anything like that. So no. Just because of someone's age, no, I think that's going to be a case by case basis. So I think someone's training history tells me much more about how to manage their training than just an age. Deciding on which variation or accessories to prescribe for my athletes, I think that if I'm watching someone's technique on a certain lift and I think that an assistant sexer size or supplemental exercise will help correct efficiencies and technique. And by deficiencies, I mean stuff that takes away from them executing a certain lift with a consistent reproducible technique that they can use at a meet. Then I would use variations in that case as almost as drill work and to modify the fatigue throughout the week. I think that's going to come down to a liftor. You're going to assess each liftor and prescribe variations. That way, versus just shotgun variations all the time, just for the sake of variation. I think it'd go off the deep end. You can be too specific, but you can also just throw variation out there with no good reason and end up with less than ideal results. I like it. My favorite activity outside the gym. It's just walking like in a city. I don't have any recreational hobbies like tennis or golfer anything. I just like walking around in big cities. That's walking. Yeah, just walking through New York City or we walked around San Diego a bit yesterday. And that's it. Yeah, if that's what you mean by physical activity. My favorite can or revs the movie. It's definitely not speed. What is the, I think I'm forgetting the name of a movie I just watched. John Wick. John Wick. John Wick. John Wick 1, 2, 3. I think it was the latest one, 3. Okay, that's a favorite. I think that was good. Bill and Ted Dexlin, venture doesn't register. No, no, I'm not a huge can of Reeves. Whoa, yeah, cutting that out. It's the money. My typical breakfast today, I had Greek yogurt, blueberries, and I stole some of Lea's oats with coffee. That's what I had. That's a typical breakfast for you. Either that or just a shake and like some sort of fruit. I'm not a huge breakfast person. So I just try to get something down and that will carry me over to lunch. I'm not a big ass challenge. I have faced all my years of lifting. I don't think there's one particular moment. But it's been trying to reproduce a process that like I can, I can repeat to peak well for meats. I've always had great training that would indicate much higher performances than I could usually get at a meat. So I think that's been one of those things. There's been various random eggs and pains and stuff like that. But I wouldn't consider those huge setbacks. I think one of the biggest challenges I have going forward is trying to recreate that peak, that peaking process. Lossia can clean and jerk 264 kilos. Does he have the potential to deadlift 500 kilos? I don't think so. One because 500 kilos is an insane amount. I don't see that clean and jerk in that deadlift being related. The training for both of those things will be very different. The velocities are different. I think the person that excels at one or the others. It's probably going to be a different person too. Lossia is very strong. It's the money. I think coaching, it's watching people progress over the long-term, not just in numbers, but in their understanding of training of how they go about the training process and watching them develop that way. It's the money.

=== FILE: 10 Questions with Coach Leah Lutz [NO1FvmcCBeM].txt ===

So... C'mon, Victor! Hi, my name is Lielettes, and I am a Barbol Medicine Coach. What is the most common error that I see in training? And I'm going to go with someone overthinking their lived or their training. So they make everything seem a lot worse than it really is. Everything becomes a really big deal. when most of it is just, it doesn't matter. You just need to keep training, keep going, you're fine. Perfect. Yep. Do I have any hidden talents? No, I don't think I do. I think I'm an open book. Like, here I am. Yep. Okay, do I have any specific advice for training elderly individuals? I think my, I would start with consider what they need to start with. So don't come in with your set program that somebody else wrote down that doesn't apply to this particular person. Think about what this person's actual activity level is right now, what their needs are and what they're comfortable with and realize that moving forward and making improvements is the goal here, not like how much weight can we put on the bar, the fastest, how many training sessions can we get this person in to do, but make this something they can keep up with on an ongoing basis and feel comfortable with. How do I pick which exercise variations someone does? So it definitely depends on the client because someone who is more of a general strength, trainee has I have a lot more room to move with something versus someone who's a competitor. So someone who's a competitor and has very specific goals in a timeline. I'm not gonna change quite as much. They're gonna have to work with them to stick with some general specific movements. But I care about what that client wants to do, what they know how to do, but also what they could learn how to do, some change, some variation, it really depends. I don't look at them and think, that's your one week spot. I will use this special movement to fix that. What do you think about this? My favorite activity outside the gym. I'd probably have to go with cooking, new things, baking, cooking, reading, everything related to that. So I watch cooking shows, read recipe books, follow chefs online and then I love to create things on my own. So my suggestion for one book to learn how to cook would probably be one of the classics, like the joy of cooking or anything in that line. Martha Stewart has won. There's a few others that are just, they walk you through the basics. What do you think about this? My favorite Kiana Reeves movie. Ha. I don't appreciate the fact they do ask me any question about a movie or a song. This is very mean of Jordan. I don't know. I don't even really like Kiana Reeves to be honest. I don't know about the movie. All right, we call you, we call you, we call you, we call you, we call you, we call you, we call you, we call you, we call you, we call you, we call you, my typical breakfast is oatmeal and then either egg whites or Greek yogurt. If I have Greek yogurt, I put blueberries in it. If I do not, then I put peanut butter in my oatmeal, mixed with egg whites. What? Yes, you heard that correctly. My personal best lifting moment. Probably no surprise for anyone who has seen some of my recent competition and that would be my third deadlift at raw nationals in 2019 when I pulled 175 kilos. It was the longest deadlift that I've ever pulled, but I got it. And for so many reasons, it was the winning lift of my life. Yeah, do you have any hidden talents? Okay. What is my general course of action? If someone has only one lift that is not responding to their programming, number one, we'd be a little bit of time. So just because sometimes people react too quickly to something not moving or changing, but I also have no trouble changing the, let's say the volume, the intensity. Sometimes I change the place in the programming, even of that lift to alter the way they look at their training. There's a lot of options. Some don't pull it up, put something else in. For everything I could be, stop training on that smooth button run. My favorite thing about working for Browbell Medicine first off who submitted this question. This is not me. Actually somebody asked me that in person yesterday, as well. And it's, I don't, it's really hard for me to say what my favorite thing is because I like almost every part of my job, literally. So I love having personal clients and building a relationship with them. I've had a lot of clients for a very long time, and I get to know them, and I see their ups and downs, but ultimately they're long-term progress, and they're success. But then I also love seminars, because I like the travel, meeting new people, seeing people went on one, and then I even like taking care of some of the back end stuff. Like all of it. Yep, I do. I even like the people I work with. So I mean, what can I say? That is, you don't need shock value, Tyran. I'm a con, kiddie island. What a native speaking. Oh no. Oh no. My cell hatred on a subconscious ram page. Why my naked-given speeches from a boys who have a man-kate. He's falling out in my page while I'm ranting. That was your answer. Team J-Lo or Team Shakira? I'm going to go with Team J-Lo. Why? Because she's older than I am. And she's still fantastic. Yeah.

=== FILE: 10 Questions with Dr. Austin Baraki [7nP5cpkJLeI].txt ===

I'm Dr. Austin Bracky, a physician and coach at Barbell Medicine. The question is what's the most common error that I see in trainees? I think it's probably having inappropriate expectations about the nature of progression, strength adaptation, things like that in terms of over-interpreting ups and downs, expecting that the process is far more linear than it actually is in practice, both in training and in rehab. Question is what people should do differently when training old people? I think that probably one of the things that I tend to do more often is getting to know the person their beliefs and their expectations before I start so that I can reframe and do some education. A lot of people, particularly as they get older, they have self-perceptions of being more fragile or that exercise resistance training is more threatening, more dangerous to them. And I think that I would aim to dispel that, build more confidence in self-evocacy and the process rather than reinforcing those and making them feel like a fragile, super special population. That's probably where I would start. Question is what is my favorite keyhoney-rease movie? I'm not good at remembering all of them off the top of my head. I feel like the most recent ones I rewatch were the Matrix series last year. So to be Bill and Ted's Exxon Adventure, Matrix, Speed, John Wick. Yeah, yeah, so I think it's probably close between the Matrix and John Wick. John Wick has just like brainless entertainment value. Matrix makes you think a little more, but that's what I do. Questions what I normally eat for breakfast is usually old-fashioned oats, not quick oats, like Jordan prefers mixed with some way usually. Do you play this in not an old-fashioned? Not an old-fashioned for breakfast, old-fashioned oats. Question is what is my favorite activity to do outside the gym? Lorraine and I like checking out new restaurants and trying different cocktails and things like that. That's usually our favorite thing to do. What is my favorite part about working with Barbell Medicine? I think that it has probably been the collaborative learning effects in terms of, you know, I could have ended up going through standard medical training and becoming doctor like any other doctor out there, but I think I've developed a unique skill set in education and bouncing ideas off one another, has expanded things much more quickly and more broadly than we would have otherwise had. So hashtag range. Questions what is my personal best lifting moment? Man, I think my favorite was the first time I pulled 700. I knew it. I mean it's tough because squatting 500 for 10 will sweet too, but one our arms are, I mean better. Question is do I have any hidden talents? Not that I'm aware of. They're all on display. Yes, this is it. Open book. Questions, Lashuk and Cleaninger 264 does the other potential of deadlift 500? I think estimating people's potential is a fool's errand, but I think that whether he can pull 500 I think is probably unlikely. I think it's a low percentage shop. Yes. Who pulls 500? One person. Not anymore even. This is the last bunch of way. One person. Questions kind of what my initial approach is to somebody who has one lift that's not necessarily responding to the programming. So I try to get a sense of what their programming history has been like, what they've tried, if they think anything has worked better or worse than anything else. And then really it's just a matter of experimenting with some of the variables. So if they're doing high specificity, I might change them to low-respecitor introduced more variation. Adjust the dose of volume, might give them a higher dose of intensity. I don't think that there's a standard sequence that I necessarily go through, but we typically talk about programming in terms of the dose of training and the formulation of training. And so I think that typically I'll look at changing the formulation of training if somebody's been working for a little while and nothing's responding. And then from there, if I get a little progress, then I might bump up the dose from there. So formulation and dose is what we look at. The question was Team J-Lo or Shakira? I think I'm leaning Team J-Lo. Did J-Lo anyway? I don't know. I don't know.

=== FILE: 10 Questions with Dr. Jordan Feigenbaum [K15DJ_VP_m8].txt ===

Alright, everyone. Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. We bring modern medicine to strength conditioning and strength conditioning to modern medicine. I'm your host Dr. Dr. Jol and Vagmamp, we're a Coronado Beach San Diego. I literally just got off the golf course and the entire tire. It's also a sunset, slash golden hour. But the beach is closed. I wanted to get on the beach, but it's closed. This was supposed to be on the beach, but they closed it on the beach. It is what it is. Let's get to your questions. Alright, so the question is what to do if one lift isn't responding? So yeah, if the other two lifts or whatever lift you're deeming are important are responding, I probably wouldn't do anything about it in that particular training block. But as far as what you go, what you do on the next step, the next training block, I typically like to go pretty extreme with the changes. Meaning that if the exercise variation was relatively small, I want to go large. The volume was relatively low. I want to go up, but I want to build up to that over time, but I want to make a substantial enough change that we get things moving in the right direction. If we made a change that the person's going to respond to. So it's not necessarily just a week one little thing, because you're really a different organism at the start of that next block anyway. So I like to make pretty substantial changes. Even if it takes some time to gradually work into that, but yeah, I'm looking at exercise variation. I'm looking at total volume. If we're looking at maximal strength type stuff, then I also want to look at total average intensity. I might ramp that up, depending on the previous training and training history and with the preferences, or I might go down. So there's no one answer, but typically my first moves are going to be exercise variation and volume for the most part provided that they were actually used training appropriately before. The question is, what is my the most commonly asked question? And honestly, you know, if we compile all the Instagram lives, all the emails, all the everything that we get, it's going to be, I have this injury, what do Dr. Barackie did? Create a great resource called pain and training, what do? So I linked that in the description below. You should check that out. If you do have an injury, then you're like, I'm not sure what to do. That's where you start. And also, we do offer these pain and rehab consultations. And I know it seems like I'm just chilling for barbell medicine. But the thing is this, if training and physical activity is your sport that you choose to pursue, or it's, you know, your recreational hobby that you care a lot about, the an absent of that or been missing that for extended period of time due to an injury, or, you know, as a lot of people are realizing now, potentially a pandemic, really can upset your life. And so I think if this is one of the things that's super important to you and you can't find a way to get on the path back to normal activity, normal training, normal competition, having some professionals guide you would be the way to do it. You're still running 20% off sales there. So would recommend contacting us through our email, support at barbellmedicine.com. Honorable mention for the second most common question that I always get asked is what shoes are those whenever we're deadlifting? Look, they're Nike Davinos, they're indoor soccer shoes. I don't think they make them anymore. And I don't think that they're going to make anybody pull a lot more weight. I just wanted a flat shoe. That was pretty thin. I didn't really like deadlifting in chunks. I hated deadlifting slippers. And so I just picked up some indoor soccer shoes, Austin actually used to train in sombas until he saw my Davinos and he was like, what are those? So the question is why barbell training, look, the name is barbellmedicine. So we can't really recommend kettlebells or machines machine medicine. I mean, people already think that medicines are big machine. No, but seriously though, I think there are some maybe unique benefits to barbell training, particularly with a balance component that you don't see with machines. But you know, that's not just relegated to barbell training, you can do that with dumbbell training or other free weights for e-implements. So in reality, I don't think that barbells are like the best training tool to use. I think rather whatever somebody has access to resource wise. And so again, this is being like widely exemplified by people not having access to all the particular equipment that they want during this pandemic. So whatever you have access to, that's important. And then whatever you want to do that promotes adherence, those are going to be the two biggest things with actually exercise selection. If you are a competitive athlete, particularly in a barbell sport, sure, you're going to have to do most of your training with a barbell. No way around that. But that's the sport you chose. And so obviously you like barbells, but if you're not a barbell sport athlete, you could make a case for having somebody do a completely machine-based training program or kettlebell based training program. If they prefer that, if they've access to those things. I think the biggest things that barbells have going for them are that they're relatively inexpensive. They're relatively widely available when gyms are open. You can incrementally load them without a lot of extra things. So like it's hard to incrementally load a kettlebell with respect to weight without having a ton of different kettlebells. And so maybe for the budget, you know, minded individual or facility, yeah, you can make a case for barbells. But I also think, you know, there's stuff that's uniquely beneficial to machines, particularly entry points for people who may be intimidated by barbells. So it doesn't mean that you can never use barbells for those individuals. If they prefer using machines on the front end. But again, the major thing is increasing the physical activity participation rates. And that's going to be based on whatever somebody has access to and whatever they prefer. All right, what is my favorite thing about working for barbell medicine? So I started this thing in 2012, Ish. And honestly, this is bigger. It's grown bigger than I ever thought it was going to. I thought it was going to be mostly just me, you know, kind of doing some consultation work or, you know, providing information for folks, educational resources. And now that it's bigger than just me and it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger, I think that's really what's the most rewarding thing for me is seeing it grow and also just in the right way. Because effectively, it just gives us a bigger microphone to kind of promote positive change in our community, whether that's improving folks' self-efficacy, improving physical activity participation, improving lifestyle interventions, sort of adherence, improving outcomes by educating other clinicians. So that's the coolest thing. Our microphones weigh bigger now and that's the whole goal. Get the microphone, get the platform as big as possible so we can possibly affect as many folks as possible. All right, so the question is favorite, Keanu Reeves movie. This was the fan favorite. All right, so look, I got a bunch of recommendations to go watch point break. And look, there's a love story, there's like some crime, there's like some mystery stuff, there's fight scenes, but the ending look if you haven't seen it, you're going to have to see it. But the ending, I can't do it, not for me. So that is not my favorite. It's going to be matrix, all the matrix series. All right, what is your favorite lifting moment? You know, honestly, it was probably the meat that I had in 2014. I was in medical schools on OBGYN rotation doing nights and I signed up for this local meat at the gym that I trained at and total 17.95 at 198 pounds. I was in knee wraps. The weights they used were not terribly well calibrated, although at the time that was kind of powerlifting and then also it was on a deadlift bar. But 17.95, I was squatting 640, benched 430, although my butt did come up in the air, they didn't redlight me though, but I know that it did. I'm honest with myself and then up pulled 725 and that was just putting that whole meat together out a lot of fun and I still think about that meat. It was just a really good day. And then also 2015, you're later, Ron Ashtonals, USAPL and up getting 4th there actually did not perform very well. They're not sleep very well in that 4. Had some personal stuff going on. But you know, got on the rally bus and it was cool. It was cool to perform on that stage. It was like the first, they didn't really have prime time, but everybody was watching us because we had like all the heavy hitters in my flight and it was really cool to take 4th out of almost 100 competitors. Yeah, that was a good day. The question is, what can I do to boost recovery? And this is, I view this as the same question, like what can I do to boost my immunity? The idea is that you can do these things to take your recovery and your immune system to the next level, super physiological levels. And that's not really the case. There are things that promote like a well functioning immune system and you know, appropriate recovery. And so that's the approach I'd like to take. Instead of thinking about trying to boost your recovery, let's just try to maximize your potential to recover. And so things that you would want to do. So one diet needs to be on point. Particularly that you're getting enough protein. That's 1.6 grams, per kilogram body weight per day. At least with some evidence going all the way up to 3.1 grams, per kilogram body weight per day. Sleep is going to be a big deal and that's very individualized, but 78 hours per night you can go to a sleep podcast, we go in depth on that, making sure you're going to have sleep apnea or other parasamias or other sleep issues. And the next thing, outside of that would actually be training more. So the way that you improve your training tolerance is to gradually train more and more more. A big base of training that it's includes aerobic training and also anaerobic training. So you've got to do both to get your training tolerance up. And so yeah, training more, eating appropriately, sleeping right. That's how you boost your recovery and really just maximizing your the potential you have to recover. The question is, which person has impacted your life the most? It's definitely got to be my dad. My dad, he's my number one fan, number one supporter. I know it sounds corny, but it's true, like I wouldn't be where I'm at without my dad. The cool thing about him is that he, you know, he gives it to me straight. He's never, you know, blown smoke up my, my rear about telling me, oh, you're this great athlete and this, whatever, he's just like your hard worker and that's how you end up, you know, succeeding. So but if you know, let me pick the cheeseball answer, I'm going to pick this mentor that I had right before I went to medical school. Actually, one of the reasons I went to medical school ended up applying and kind of going through that process. Dr. Piper, great guy, spine surgeon, actually coach him for a while and is cool with watching him be able to squat and deadlift even though he had a back surgery and, you know, he didn't think you'd ever be able to do that as a spine surgeon so being able to take him through through some resistance training and getting him kind of out of the idea like, oh, you got a back problem. You can't ever do this stuff again in a six-deck age of life. That was really cool. And he again, similar to my dad, he always felt, you know, he always kept telling me, like, you can do this. You can go to medical school. You can be a doctor and, yeah, probably if it wasn't for that push, I don't know that I would have done it, but it was really cool. So those two probably the most influential people in my life. All right, so the question is favorite thing to do outside the gym. It's probably going to be golf, but I'm not just a one-trick pony, so if it's not golfing, I want to be cooking or entertaining friends that's probably my second favorite thing to do after golfing. I have the question is, what are the best accessory movements? So, you know, this assumes that somebody's probably a barbell sport athlete, so they have specific lifts that they want to get up. I don't think that actually applies to most people watching this. Like, if you haven't signed up for a powerlifting meter or weightlifting meat, like, I don't know that you need to restrain or constrain yourself to just, you know, swap-enched ed lift. There are other exercises out there, and so my overarching idea is that I want people to do a wide variety of different exercises. This not only helps like motor learning, so you get better at like, do it in movements and like knowing where your body isn't spaced by doing different type of movements. It's like you get to better outcomes that way. Also reduces the risk of injury from overuse, and also just makes you stronger all around. So effectively, strength is very specific, and if you do a lot of different things, you build this broad base of strength that you can later apply specifically if you want to, and so the specific periods will be relatively short. So I like almost all variations. I think if you have good data, you respond relatively well or better to particular variations, and performance, max strength performance on the big three are very important to you. You should definitely be keeping those records. Then those are the ones I would default to, and I would try to kind of build this X-size library if things that you prefer, so adherence will go up, and that also you respond to. But in general, there's a big range of motion, easily easy to load, and like fairly similar to the exercise that you care about. This is probably a good variation.

=== FILE: 10 Questions with Tom Campitelli [FK6GfRk0SIU].txt ===

What is the most common error I see in trainees? Probably being overly self-critical, or if I were to expand that a little, loading the bar too much and going a little too heavy. What if any specific programming changes would I make for elderly people? I would probably not change things significantly unless they displayed a difference in range of motions, specifically if they for whatever reason couldn't lock out a bench press or a shoulder press might need to make some adjustments there. Depending upon how detrained they are, they may require a more gradual ramp up. However, the similarities between what older trainees would do and what younger trainees would do would far outweigh any differences. What is my favorite Kiana Reeves movie, The Matrix? I thought for sure you're going to say Bill of Teh. Oh man that's so good too. Oh, now you got me thinking so it's got to be between the Matrix and Bill and Ted. I'm going to probably still go with the Matrix just because it's so cool. But Bill and Ted had a lot of cultural resonance for me as a young suburban adult. My normal breakfast is about half of a 32 ounce container of non-fat plain Greek yogurt coupled with a scoop of way protein and then maybe a little bit of cereal. Gluten free of course and by gluten free I mean gluten enhanced. The favorite activity outside of the gym would be taking pictures. Although unfortunately I'm normally in the gym when I'm taking pictures. It is interesting. It's the picture that you take in fact or actually. Yeah so I don't know if that really counts. Another big fail. Woo! What is my favorite thing about working for Barbell Medicine? My initial answer is nothing and I dislike it intensely. My favorite thing about working at Barbell Medicine would be getting to discuss a whole bunch of health ideas as well as programming ideas with Jordan and Austin as well as coming to fully embrace nihilism as a way of life and realizing that truly almost nothing matters. My personal best lifting moment. I imagine it would be when I pulled 227.5 kilos at my meat in 2016. Did you meet my guess? That's 500 American pounds. Yep. Do I have any hidden talents? I think that's the wrong question. I think the real question is do I have any non-hidden talents? And I think the answer to both of those is objectively now. Lasha who is a very accomplished Olympic weight lift eric in clean and jerk 264. 264 kilos does that therefore in to it well that he will deadlift 500 kilos. With all due respect to those who would use the word into it well with regard to light deadlift translating to heavy deadlifts, I don't know that it into its well that he could given that strength tends to be more specific than we might think. What is my approach if one lift in particular is not responding to a lifters programming? Massive caloric access. Just find whatever they're eating and double it. No, it would be reviewing what they're doing and it would probably involve having them be exposed more frequently and with higher volume to the lift provided that that is appropriate. It's a little difficult to say just with that information because is the question that they are overly fatigued or that you are not giving them enough. And in most cases it's going to be that you actually need to find a way to give them more stress throughout a given time but perhaps with less acute fatigued. So perhaps upping the dose as it were.

Do injectable corticosteroids have similar catabolic effects on lean body mass as described with oral systemic corticosteroids or do interarticular cortisone, shots only have a potential for damage you tissue within the joint cavity, ego, tendon rupture, or a cartilage damage. I can do this. Yeah. All right. So we talked in a couple instances this weekend about corticosteroids like prednisone, for example, as a catabolic type steroid that sometimes patients can take. They're also injectable types and they can be injected in different ways. So they can be injected directly into the muscle. They can be injected into an IV. They can be injected into a joint for osteoarthritis or other purposes that orthopedic surgeons and other types of doctors will very commonly do. So injectable corticosteroids, if they go in the muscle, yes, they have a systemic effect. That's pretty much the same as an oral corticosteroid. But it's pretty uncommon that somebody would be regularly receiving intermuscular steroid injections repeatedly over time. It's usually a one-time thing that they might get for a particular condition and then you move on from there or if they need continued treatment, it would go to be oral. So that's a less common scenario. I think this question, Asker, was more interested in the specific interarticular types. Maybe they have osteoarthritis in the knee and they get these injections put into their knees and the systemic effects of this stuff is pretty small. I would not be particularly concerned if somebody gets steroid injections in a knee or an adjoint that they're going to lose their muscle mass or get sarcopenic as a result. After multiple reasons, number one, the systemic absorption is relatively low. And additionally, most doctors will not perform these injections more frequently than about three to four months at a time, once every three to four months. I will also say that the evidence that these things work much better than placebo injections pretty weak evidence that they are super, super effective. So I would river it back to a lot of the advice that I gave in our lecture about pain and managing it and we have strong evidence that increase that strength training for patients with osteoarthritis can improve pain and function. So I would definitely recommend that. If somebody for whatever reason is a hyper-responder to these sorts of injections into their knees, which is the most common place that these get injected. And you know, they're getting them maybe once or twice a year and they're like, it makes me feel great for the next six months. I can do everything I want and I don't care if it's placebo and blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, cool. All right, go on living your life and do your home roller. I don't tend to recommend those or perform those for patients right off the bat based on the evidence based for them. But little concern to be had with respect to lean body mass with those steroids that go into the joints. Yeah, just as a frequency and dose of solos. But if you have an autoimmune disease and you're on oral systemic steroids for a long time, then yeah, you're at high risk for osteoporosis, high risk for sarcopenia, high risk for sepsis, for death, for all kinds of things from them. But again, you're balancing risks and benefits compared to the actual condition that you're treating correct. So. Okay. Question number nine. Is there hope for porous bond or seps training? How can they keep from getting discouraged? So it's interesting. You probably, this question assumes that you would be able to tell if somebody is a porous bond or to training early on during their training career or before they've even started training at all, which I would strongly disagree with. And I like Austin is a good example for this, so I'll just again use you. I mentioned this during our, I don't know which lecture it was, but in any event, Austin to begin into his training, he did a novice linear progression. And at the end of his novice linear progression, he's quite a 285 pounds, three sets of five, that was where he ended up, which is a patently average response. And what's interesting is that despite that being an average response, the creator of that program would say that's a below average, you didn't do the program right, you didn't gain enough body weight, you know, right. But I'm just saying that's what would be said. That would be on the outset that would be looked at being a below average response, even though, according to the average, it is the average based on the data collected on that free on that program. So in any event, that being said, five years removed from being what we would, what, the creator of that program would be in a low responder and what the data would say to be an average response, you squatted 625, which is elite level relative to your cohort. That is a great, massive squat. So we were unable to tell early on in his training career, whether or not he was actually a poor responder, average responder or a high responder to training. In fact, I would say that you're unable to tell if somebody is a poor responder to training based on the first dose of training you give them or even the second dose, because you may have messed up the formulation, right. If the type of training and type of stress that you've given them is wrong at each step of the way, you don't know if they're actually poor responders or if the stress to adaptation ratio is just off based on the wrong formulation. So I don't know that you'd be able to like chalk up that somebody is a poor responder training until they've been training for some period of time. So the most important things with early training early on that the people enjoy the process, they understand what they're supposed to be getting out of it, things that they're supposed to be learning from a self-efficacy standpoint. Okay, here's how I do the exercises, here's in general what the training goals are, here's in general how I should load the ball, like the you know, they're the gaining skills, right. And they're having fun doing it. That's what they're supposed to be learning early on. You don't again care like what is your max squat at 12 weeks. Like if that's the benchmark of success, I think that you know that's very short-sighted. Yes, jinx. And yeah, and I just don't care about that. So for people who have gone through maybe a year or two years of training and they think I'm a poor responder, I would wonder about the actual like types of training you've been exposed to because you might need a different formulation. Consistency. Yeah. And how often have you actually been engaged in training and what have been your barriers to like having consistent training. And then if all of those things check out, I'm like wow, it looks like you've actually tried a lot of things and you've actually been super consistent and your nutrition's been on point and all this other stuff. You're just not getting it done. It's like what are you going to do, not train? Well, how can we make this enjoyable for you to train, right? What sort of things are meaningful to you? How can we make this enjoyable to you? If somebody who comes in after two years of training, they have a 10 inch vertical as a male and like after squatting consistently for two years, two, 25 is their 1-rm and they're like the only way that I'll enjoy training is if I win USAPL Run Nationals. Well, it's like expectation managed. Yeah, exactly. So why is that important to you? And is there anything else that would make training rewarding for you? So I think the role of a coach is to identify people's talents and divert them into different directions where they can be super, very successful, right? So somebody might say, I just want to be basketball player, basketball is my jam, I love it so much. It's like, yeah, but your world class track athlete so let's push you into that sport. Same thing. So I want to be a power-lifter, I love power-lifter, I love power-lifter, so much and you're like, look man, you really don't want to do this. So I believe me. You push them into a place where they can be successful and I think that if you look hard enough and you have enough resources that you can probably find a place to push somebody towards. Yeah, yeah. So those are the last few examples of funny because I grew up playing multiple sports and played baseball for a bit and I was actually pretty good defensively, but I could not hit for shit. And I think it's probably because I have part of it outside of all the factors that go into it, but I have like as bismally poor vision. Yeah. My visual acuity is really, really bad. Notice he didn't say I hand coordination because that's not actually the thing, it's having above average visions. Yeah. And by the third grade, I was wearing like high-powered contact lenses. He's actually on his real eyeballs. He's weird. And you know, at that age, that was the only sport I knew and I was like, I want to grow up and be a really good baseball player or something. And I had to reframe my expectations as I grew up realizing like, yeah, it's not really going to work out. So then I got in the pool and I was like a little better at swimming. Maybe able to get myself into college swimming, but I was still not awesome at it. It wasn't like national level caliber at that sport. Then I find lifting and I'm like, oh, I'm like actually, decent at this, right? Until nowadays, when everybody else is getting so strong and I'm like, well, I'm not that good anymore, but I guess I'll keep training. Yeah. Well, that's the thing though. But so if I would have asked you three years ago, maybe even in his recent years, two years ago, hey, you think you're a better swimmer than a weightlifter, you'd be like, yeah. But now, you'd be like, I think I'm better lifted than swimmer. Yeah. So really, you should have just played, you know, like, lacrosse, probably. Something. OK. Question number 10. Can you speak on a posture syndrome as a relates to training other people? And not feeling qualified enough. Sure. I mean, I don't know the clinical, you know, or like, Wikipedia, the self-declimbing. Yeah. I'm a posture syndrome, just for people who are not familiar with it, refers to this feeling among individuals who are actually like, reasonably well trained in a particular area, or like who are practicing in a particular setting. Having this feeling that they're inadequate, not good enough, that they don't know enough, relative to their peers, even if they may actually possess all the wreck was it skill and training and characteristics and knowledge base and something like that. Oh, it's at that definition. This is in contrast to like expert beginner syndrome, where the opposite of like, done the done in crew of perfect. So sure, I think this is very common. Now, I can only speak from my experience and then my experience training other coaches, because that I used to have that job where I was actually educating other coaches. Nobody feels ready to coach people based on having a certain certification or a certain, accreditation after the name or a certain stamp of approval. I mean, when I first started training in 2007, you know, and I was like CSCS, ACSM, I got, I ended up getting my USAW club coach. Like I had all these letters right and I'd also been strength training myself for all decent period of time. Like I was fairly strong person. And I was like, you know, I've got the credentials and I've got the experience from at least on my own and I should feel somewhat comfortable like teaching somebody else how to do this. But I was asking the most basic of questions like, well, how many sets really should they be doing? Well, like, what exercises should they be doing? And that comes from just a lack of like wanting some deterministic answer. Like I want somebody to tell me, this is the answer. And have a firm thing. But what we know, what I know now is that there is no firm answer. I'm more comfortable now with being with the uncertainty of it all. But in the beginning, I wanted a definitive answer. So I think in Poster syndrome, in this particular case, people want to feel like I have the answers that they're very solid and they're all evidence based and that there's not a lot of squish there. But in the reality is you have to be very comfortable being uncertain with these things. But you just couch things appropriately. So to speak on a Poster syndrome, I think most people experience it. I don't think you should let it diswage you. And I think the biggest step that you can make towards getting rid of it or not having it, impair your workflow anymore is just trying to get more comfortable being uncertain and not having the answer. That's things you can be able to say that I don't know, I'll find out or I'm not sure. So even now, if someone is like, what is the best rep range for getting strong? Like, who doesn't exist? I don't know. I don't think that it exists based on present evidence. And they're like, that's not a very solid answer, Dr. Faganbaum. And it's like, best I can do right now. But in 2007, I'd be like, well, let me think about it. And then I'd try to come to some long-winded answer and then I'd feel even worse at the end. But I really don't know why am I taking people's money. Really what you're trying to do, especially as a newer coach or trainee, is you're trying to get more people to be physically active. You're trying to get more people to change their nutrition. You're trying to spread knowledge in your community, right? And not hurt people along the way. It's going to be really hard to hurt people unless you hold really strange opinions on exercise and nutrition. You're like, don't resistance trained, for instance, or never eat carbohydrates. Like, that's, again, having very strange opinions are the only way that you can really like mess people up. But as far as benefiting folks, you can do a lot without necessarily knowing the answers to all these questions. You just have to be okay, saying, I don't know. I'm not sure, or I haven't learned that yet, which is fine, which is fine. The main skills you need is a new coach, R2, to be able to coach movement and program. In a way that generally comports with what we know right now to be useful. And so everybody in here right now could program for a beginner, right? And has some sense of how to program for a more advanced lifter, right? As far as knowing exactly what changes to make and this time the other, that's an experienced thing. And even I don't have the answers there. I just have general sense of things. So yeah, I think a lot of that sort of feeling of imposter syndrome gets augmented if you are surrounded by other colleagues or professionals who appear to have everything perfectly down. They know everything about training, right? Fortunately, that is not the case. And those people are sharing you, faking it, right? Or they are inappropriately confident, right? And so recognizing that when somebody makes extremely, extremely confident claims about things that it is probably not appropriate for them to be that confident and that there is much more uncertainty as Jordan was saying than sometimes conveyed when these people make their claims or give their advice that might help with your feeling that. Because you might feel like I'm the only person who doesn't know the answer to this where is this guy saying, oh, no, you have to do it this way. This is the correct way to do things and everything else is incorrect based on my expensive experience. Well, fortunately, you can go to the research evidence on most things and use that to support your answer and support your knowledge base, which is the way we do things. Or at least generate a hypothesis whether it's not direct data on something. I would say that probably about, I don't know, maybe monthly, maybe more frequent, give or take. Jordan or I will find our way down some new rabbit hole of research or knowledge or some new topic area. And we'll send like one review article on the topic to the other and we're like, well, shit, here we go. There's this entire field that people have been researching for the past 30, 40, 50 years or something like that. We didn't even know this shit existed. And we're just like dipping our toe in right now. Right. And this is with our knowledge base and you guys, you know, how we have developed a pretty solid handle we think on the material we presented to you this weekend. But this again, involved like enormous, enormous amounts of reading and synthesizing this stuff and putting it together. And we're doing this entirely new areas that we know literally nothing about on a near weekly to a monthly basis. So we could feel in post-resendrum about every new topic area we get into. It's completely normal, right. But we just say rather than comparing ourselves to the way other people are behaving because they can behave inappropriately, faking it or being overly confident, we're just going to go with what the research evidence says on this or go to the scientific literature on a matter and fill out our knowledge from there as much as we can. What's the last thing you change your mind on? I'm not good at remembering these things. You know, what the last thing you change your mind on? Met's maybe. Um, I mean, that's one thing. Sure. Anything. That's anything we change our mind on. Once that, once that other paper came out that I said, yeah, yeah. So previously we thought, I told you guys this during the programming lecture where I was like, previously we thought eight meds just like cut off above that. You weren't going to get any additional like, uh, disease, uh, burden of disease reduction or mortality improvement, uh, with higher degrees of cardiovascular sporey fitness. But new review came out suggesting that there is a continued improvement after this eight meds of cardiovascular capacity. So the funny thing is after after we talked about that, like what's it like? Well, the, yeah, we were kind of stupid that we actually thought that other thought that other thing was the case, right? Yeah, we wouldn't being in better shape continue to get you more improvements and we're like, well, yeah, I guess we're stupid. Well, our, but it's funny, it's funny is because our original bias would be like, the more fit that you are, the better you're going to do. But then he's looking at the data and you're like, well, I mean, I guess I got a temper that a little bit. And then it comes back and we're like, yes, my original bias was correct. Yeah. Yeah. I think getting that idea across of being okay with uncertainty and recognizing that most people who are overly confident are probably either faking it or wrong, uh, we'll make you feel better about yourself. Yep. It's okay. We all, we all are anxious about our own education levels and times. Uh, yeah, I mean, well, I'm just saying, it's like, you know, if you think you don't know enough, sure like, oh, this bothers me. It's like, yeah, I mean, I've told Jordan I've heard somebody say, I know everything there is to know about strengthening conditioning as a direct quote. Like, nope. That seems unlikely. Yeah. Citation. If I believe that, I would say, how can I get that, right? It's not possible. Yeah. Okay. What recommendations do you make for weight loss and nutrition for a patient several years post-op, Ruin Y? That's a, I guess you might have. Over time, how does your body adjust to those changes? Does it return to normal absorption, asking for a friend? Need O. Uh, so as far as what recommendations I would make for weight loss and nutrition for a patient several years post-op Ruin Y, I wouldn't. Outside of potentially supplementation with like vitamins, if there's evidence that this person has decreased absorption. But usually those folks are on, uh, vitamins for life. It's just part of their post-op care. Uh, I'm not aware of data suggesting that they stop at any particular interval of time. Uh, that being said, over time does your body adjust to those changes. Those changes, I assume you mean, again, surgical right? Uh, not really, especially in a Ruin Y situation because there's not like an expandable, you know, or, or, or, or deflatedable or any other device. It's just, it's just, it's, you had surgery. Uh, does it return to normal absorption? So it's not that your absorption was, uh, necessarily like, it was diminished because of the surgical procedure. And because it was changed, it's not going to like come back. You've taken areas of the intestine that are involved in absorption and you've removed them and they're not coming back. Uh, so in that case, the vitamin supplementation is usually needed indefinitely. Um, I, again, outside of that though, I wouldn't make any specific recommendations like all you need more protein and more carbohydrates and any more fat, any more this and more that. Rather, you're managing based on results like how's your weight changing? How's your waist or conference changing, et cetera, et cetera? Um, at what your risk factors and what do you need to do? But it wouldn't be, I wouldn't take into account the ruin why procedure outside of like making sure that you're doing your post-op care as needed. Yeah, I agree. I think they need to make sure that they're not getting deficient in anything and then the rest is based on results. Like you said, there actually may be some sort of adaptive changes on shows. Sure, there's really a lot of things. Yeah, yeah. Um, in my mind, it's perfectly, I'm, you're plausible that somebody might have some adaptive changes to their new anatomy. However, I actually don't know what that is. So I guess imposter syndrome at work. Yeah, it wouldn't be surprising if there were adaptive. It would be more surprising that there weren't any adaptive changes. Yeah, I expect maybe some of the colonic mucosa or the small intestinal mucosa changes to the adaptive. That's a good thing. But I just don't know what happens. I haven't read that. That would be interesting to know. Last couple questions here. Sure. Given the current data and other observations, what is your stance on the validity and prevalence of non-cyliet gluten intolerance? My stance on the validity of it that people believe in that they have a gluten intolerance is clearly real. Like that happens. That's in, in reality. As far as what to do about that, I don't know that just telling them like, hey, you don't really have a siliac. I don't think that's the answer. And I don't know that we should actively be managing this because they have a belief system that's already in place that's part of their identity and how they eat, which is a huge like social cultural sort of input into their lifestyle. I would want to change that. People who are siliac and people in general who don't even have higher risk, cardiovascular disease, period. This is thought to be due to less intake of whole grains. I know the paleo crowd is going to roast me for this one. But even like the guy who brought most of the siliac research to the United States is like, you don't want this. You don't want to go gluten free. This is a bad diet. You shouldn't do this. Not only is it more expensive, it's less nutritious. So people think they're doing this for their health. It's not healthy to avoid gluten in any event. I don't know that we can run like a PSA, you know, sort of campaign where it's like gluten is your friend. And it's like, you know, there's a mascot and he's like, this pro-lamin protein. It's like in a bread, making things like chewy. I don't think that's going to work. But the data on it currently suggests that if people believe that they have this non-cylic gluten intolerance and they believe that they're getting gluten free food, they do better. If it has gluten in it, compared to, I think there's a few, I'm going to break this down a little further. I think there's a few different cohorts to consider here. So there's obviously the ClearCut Siliac disease individuals, those who have proven, you know, disease based on papsy or that's the gold standard for diagnosis of this. There is a cohort of people who believe they are sensitive to gluten. In fact, have no actual gastrointestinal disorder whatsoever. That's the other end of the spectrum. These are the people who have been purely no seabed by the internet or by paleopod casts and the like, people who, again, when I was talking about inflammatory diseases for sarcopenia or inflammation in the context of lipid disorders, I'm about real inflammation versus not real inflammation, people who eat a piece of toast and they claim that all their whole body feels terrible, but when they get evaluated and biopsied and things like that, there's no evidence of any problems whatsoever. There is a no, an established, no seabot-type mechanism for, so-called gluten intolerance in the certain subset of these individuals. I think there's likely to be, or there is a cohort in between where this non-cylic gluten sensitivity is not purely no seaboma mediated. However, what exactly they are sensitive to is unclear. There's some evidence suggesting that people in this, in between where when you do the removal of those types of foods from the diet, they actually get better, even in a placebo-controlled fashion, they may be more sensitive to what this so-called fog maps in the diet. So, the proteins, oligo, and polysaccharides, I think, is that cover-out? There's a particular subset of types of carbohydrates in the diet that they're made, they may be more sensitive to rather than a gluten itself. Just happens that some of those things coexist in a bunch of different foods. So, I think that there are basically two subsets of the non-cylic, gluten sensitivity people, the people who are legitimately sensitive to certain elements in the diet, that are probably not gluten that are probably other molecules in the food that they may actually legitimately benefit from moving as well as those who are not sensitive to anything biologically, but have been no seabowed purely and they tend to maybe they become hyper-visulant after they eat a piece of toast. How does my stomach feel? How does my stomach feel? How does my stomach feel? And as soon as there's like an abnormal girl feel like there it is. It's acting up on me. Yeah, it'll be a hyper-visulant. And so, yeah, I think. Can you think about our ancestors, like just looking, like if they can, if you're in a like, this guy has indoor, running water, electricity, what are these lights, unlimited food supply and can't eat toast? But bread is taking them out? Super-resilient bro. Yeah. And then the second part of this is, so think about it like this. You have a person who has four years felt like at certain different times of the year they've had an upset stomach. Which is the normal human experience. But when asked, yeah, I think that I've had upset stomach sometimes over the past few years. And my doctor doesn't understand me. They're always in and out super fast, they don't care. Then I went and saw my natural path, my chiropractor, or whatever. And they said, maybe you're sensitive to gluten, and they spent 90 minutes with me. And they listened to me and they understood all of my problems. And I'm not saying that this is bad, right? I'm not saying that you shouldn't spend as much time as you can with patients, but I also understand why this becomes so seductive. And then they say, I think you're gluten sensitive. Just stop eating gluten. Here's what has gluten in it. I'll see you in three days for your follow-up. Also, we're going to run this proprietary blood test. I mean anything, but anyway, moving on. And then the person reports, I cut out gluten. I feel way way better. See, it was the gluten. That's partly this placebo mechanism. And partly a failure to sort of accurately diagnose potentially a sensitivity to fondmaps. And it's partly a placebo mechanism. They don't expect patients and they're trusting that person. Correct. Do that. Yes. Multiple levels of psychiatric sorcery. Which, again, it's not all bad. We could learn a lot from being able to spend more time with patients and accurately hearing their concerns and communicating with them effectively. And I say that what we, the Alephatic Medical Community is just run a place under different time constraints, which is very, very difficult. And I am thighs with our provider friends. That being said, that's one of the ways that this happens. It's tough to deal with. So anyway, going forward, if you feel like you're this person, like I'm gluten intolerant, but I don't have Silly Act, I would challenge you. Half a piece of bread. Half a piece. See what happens. Don't pay attention. Don't like focus on it. Don't like put out your journal and your library. Quirtie. Time. Zero. Ingested. 120 grams of bread. Time. Zero point zero. One. Drink of water. Like, you know, don't do that. Just go on living your life. And if you notice something that caught, you know, brings this to the forefront. If declares itself, quote unquote, then, hey, follow up with, you know, your doctor, your real doctor, you know, the one who went to medical school. And go from there. But other than that, I don't think that people should be actively trying to go gluten free. Okay. Last question. This is my favorite question. Who would win in a fight, Dr. Fagan Mom or Dr. Barackie? And I would just like to say, there's a reason. So here's the thing. Dr. Barackie and I are both nonviolent. Individuals, Dr. Barackie is more of a nihilist than I am, though. He doesn't get sucked into as many internet arguments as I do. I'm more aggressive. So for that reason, I think Austin would win. I would get fatigued more quickly. He's got an endurance background. Also his low bar back squat without knee wraps is stronger than mine. So he would probably just hit Barackie as way to success. Yes. Yes. Who's the smartest? So we have objective metrics on this, right? We have objective metrics on this. So in medical school, Austin, you're your number one in your class? I don't know. I don't think they did class rank. Yeah, it wasn't like, but you were in the top probably three years. So I know that I was in the top percentage. We got the award, right? Percentage. So you had your junior, junior anyway. Yeah. Yeah. So I know that. Now let on our step one, which is like the stratification exam that you take to get into different residences, Austin got a 265 and I got a 257. So again, I have to concede to Austin this now. I've been my defense. I did start a business during that. I said a top 20 all time. Powerlifting total during that time as well. In Austin, he got married, engaged another interpersonal relationships with him, seemed to be important to him. So I think seem to be, well, nothing's real. So I think it's a draw is what I'm getting at, even though objectively, I think you'd beat me into fight. Do you think so? I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't like, we're nonviolent. Yeah, that's part of the problem is that I don't think either of us had actually been into fight. Oh, yeah. I got jumped once. Yeah. I remember, I think it was like second or third grade. Wait, I was like, I was like, right in the, I was right in the school, but hold on. This is, this is, is it real? Yeah. And, and some kid was getting on the bus and passing. And I don't know, I don't remember who it was, or if we had a beef at that time. But he, if you pass a note to his girlfriend. He, punch, that, he punched me straight in the stomach as hard as he could. That was not the wind out of me for like, you know, for a long time after. That was literally like in second grade at this time. I was like severely jacked up by this. I don't know. I don't get it over to this guy. He just punched you. And then we both went on living our lives. I don't know who he is anymore. He probably doesn't squat 625 though. It's unlikely. You met him now. I can, I can hit driving out of the reach. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't know. I thought about having us on our muscle, but I don't want to do that. Because I have a meet coming up and then like the wood thing. Yeah, my elbows. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Talk away. Yeah. All right. All right. So, hey. Thank you. Thanks for watching on YouTube. You guys are great. See you guys next time. Thanks. With the way protein, people kept asking us which protein should I take, what do you recommend? And when we looked into it, we didn't really feel comfortable recommending any protein. So, we just made our own. So, we got four ingredients. The essential amino acid and BCA contents are very high. This is exactly what you want out of a way protein. Thank you.

=== FILE: 2019 Brooklyn Q⧸A： How Strong is Strong Enough For Sports, HDL Cholesterol, SARMS, and more! [1ZPWsX6RHZc].txt ===

Alright, thank you guys for watching here on YouTube. We're at the barbell medicine seminar here in Brooklyn, New York. Thank you. Yeah, Rupon. Places. Places. I don't have my timelins. Okay, so we're gonna do a Q&A. We're gonna do a Q&A. This is a new way that we've been doing these where we have curated questions that have been submitted over the weekend and we'll try to answer then best of our ability. If questions not selected, and you guys submitted to us, please go to our forum, it's barbell, medicine.com, it's barom link. We'll try to answer those pretty regularly. We'll get to it. Don't DM us about it. Okay, let's get into some questions. So for non-strength athletes like basketball, volleyball, baseball, every sport that's not powerlifting or weightlifting, how strong is strong enough? How do you determine if and when devoting training resources to maximal force output outweighs the benefits to on-feel performance? You want me to start? Sure. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I think that first you'd have to kind of look at the sport by sport. So there's not one answer that is universally applicable here from like a, you know, how much, how much of somebody's total training resources should be devoted towards training with, like resistance training? The other thing is if a sport has a high, places a high sort of importance on high velocity force production, I probably wouldn't spend a ton of time doing low velocity force production. So training at maximal weights where the bar velocity is slow. There's a lot of muscle fiber type conversion that goes on there. So for instance, if you had a sprinter who trained only using very heavy sets of five, the muscle fiber type conversion that goes on there's from type 2b muscle fibers to type 2a muscle fibers, which are lower velocity high force producing muscle fibers. But that's not what they want as a sprinter. They want the type 2b fibers that are high velocity force producing muscle fibers. So you wouldn't want to do maybe any of that or certainly not a lot of it. I think that there's an inflection point with how between where you spend so much time in the gym lifting weights that you compromises your ability to either recover from or participate in higher volumes of your sport practice or things dedicated to your to your sport or even sampling other sports that are not resistance training. So like a basketball player, if they told me that they were training with weights more than three times a week, I'd be asked them why. And in season, it might be twice a week. I think that a basketball player should be obviously practicing the sport engaged in getting stronger across multiple different intensities and training their conditioning up to a point that's consistent with their sport specific needs. And then if they have additional time after that, I probably wouldn't do more barbell training. I'd have them try to play another sport or study art history or some other sort of sampling with their life. Yeah, live their life, right. So yeah, I think if you're going to try to answer this question again, generalizing it across multiple sports is probably a fool's errand and kind of can't be done. The question would be why would why should an athlete in another sport perform resistance training? And in our opinion, there's probably two compelling arguments to be made. Number one is for reduction in injury risk. We have a pretty solid evidence based on this and multiple sporting context that getting these athletes stronger can reduce their injury risk. However, I think that the amount of strength that they actually need to be able to demonstrate to achieve that risk reduction is not super super high. In other words, I can't say that if I take a soccer player's squat from 315 for 5 to 365 for 5, that they're going to get injured way less frequently on the field, right. So I don't think I think they definitely should be strength training for the purpose of injury risk reduction, but I don't think they need to get power lifting strong. They don't really need to get super strong. The other argument is from a performance standpoint. And that is where the so-called carryover from their strength training into their performance is going to be very strongly related to their actual sporting demands. And so that's where you need to look sport by sport. What are the force production demands of this sport? So if I had a track and field athlete who wanted to go do, won't you shot putting or something? It's like, yeah, they need to be pretty strong, right. But if I had like a bad mitten player or something, right, how strong do they need to be to jack up their performance? And I'm going to try to get them to squat 500 for their sport. Am I going to get them to squat 400 for their sport? Do you get them to squat 300 for their sport? Do you care if they're not particularly care? Or do I care whether they're squatting versus doing some other type of resistance training? Exactly. That's, yeah. Can I make a very, very clear strong argument for that over other types of resistance training? I don't have the evidence base to say something like that. And I know that I would like for them to be stronger if they're completely untrained and you know, can barely do a sit-to-stand. If a chair but then they're sarcophene, can we got bigger problems, right? So definitely based on sporting demands for performance and then the risk reduction for injury is pretty compelling argument, although you don't again need to be a power lifter to achieve that. Yeah. Arguably that would set you back more if you train like a power lifter while they're trying to compete for in another sport. Well, yeah, and again, because you're just making, if you're training like a power lifter, then you're making compromises that you don't need to make it with respect to exercise, selection, intensities that you're using and sort of lack of conditioning that you're going to not engage in because you're training like a power lifter, right? Anyway, I think it was really elegant what you said. Thank you. Because our confidence in what we say in the context of this particular question gets worse, the more like specific the recommendations get as far as like how strong should you be, which exercises should you be using, what reps like, you know, the confidence intervals get wider. Yeah, yeah, where we say, yeah, you should be stronger in general for injury, risk reduction and that in general, these are some training philosophies that have evidence to support these certain training adaptations, which we think would likely be useful to certain sporting applications. But to be like, yeah, you should use this squat variation, this reps gain, this average intense like a need to do double body weight for it. Like, that's just made up. It's just made up. Yeah, it doesn't mean that we don't think that people should get stronger. It just means that we can't say that very confidently, you know, because we don't have evidence there. Yeah, elegant. Hey, that's right. Hey, how do you hold the athlete accountable and improve resilience and avoid letting them off the hook or coddling too much based on their feelings or excuses? I don't know that I do that. What I mean is that it just depends on the context, because I don't know that I care enough to fight them on a particular thing. Rather, I want to know why they're issues, because I'm not looking to manage this symptomatically like, oh, you don't want to squat today. Or you don't want to do this at a five or you're avoiding, you know, doing a set that scares or of rep that scares you because you think you might fail. Like, well, why does it scare you? How do we, like, let's get to the root of it and manage that. If you're having a bunch of internal load, you know, anxiety and stress about completing certain tasks, I want to know why. And then maybe we can find a way to work around that versus just laying, I don't do it. So I'm not saying just skip it, but I want to know why more than just saying don't do it or hey, come on, if you don't do this, you're a bad human. Yeah, where's my rest? Where's the boat? Yeah, brother, you're a bad human. Yeah, I agree if if if things in training are not going as expected, or there are issues coming up and excuses and things like that definitely getting to the root of it and asking why is probably the first big step. Just like with behavior change, you're trying to identify barriers and work through them. And so if there are barriers present to successful training that have not been identified, then that's a situation where they might come out where financially it is consistently having issues adhering to the program, for example, right? Trying to identify why is probably the biggest factor to start working around that and knocking that barrier down versus saying, that's okay, that you skipped two out of your four sessions this week, or something like that. Yeah, that's really, of course. And the only thing I would add here is that how do you hold the athlete accountable and improve resilience, et cetera? Part of this needs to be captioning the context of their goals, right? So if they say they want to win nationals, right? And yet they're skipping sessions or they're skipping sets or they're making certain excuses or they're not adding weight to the bar when they clearly were able to or something like that. You have to ask them, yeah, I often times ask that in the context of their goals. It's like, how bad do you actually want to do this thing? Your behavior would suggest that maybe you don't, or there's something else that we have that has not come up yet in our conversations that is influencing your ability to adhere to the plan towards this thing, right? Because people will say all kinds of things, right? I want to win the cross against. Yeah, I mean, I've talked about we interviewed Sam, Calvin, who is one of my trainees who is USAPL national champion from last year in the six to three kilo weight class. And when she first contacted me, which was approaching three years ago, or something like that, and she said, so I want to win nationals. And this was when she was fairly early on in the competitive game, and we had big names like Jennifer Thompson, things like that in the sport, and she was like, I don't know when nationals. And I was like, all right, we got some work to do. And every single day ever since then, she has done a hundred percent of what she needs to do to be able to accomplish that with not a shred of excuse or skipping anything or not adhering to the plan or doing something like that, right? Because she is probably hungrier than anyone I've ever seen to accomplish that. And for that she did that goal, for that particular goal, right? And if she had been doing other things, skipping sets or sessions or something like that, then that would have maybe question is something going on, maybe in life or relationships or something like that that's interfering, or are you maybe not quite, maybe you don't actually understand what is required to accomplish this particular thing, right? So looking at the individual's goals and how serious they are about them as another thing to look at here. Yeah, I think about you do. So for instance, you recently had to change or training in secondary to motivational issues, which have stemmed from having pain and discomfort, doing certain things. So if I was actively coaching you and you sent me a text like, yo dude, I don't want to squat today because, you know, it hurts when I do this and I'm frustrated and annoying blah, blah. And my response was, just do it. I would have missed the opportunity to find out context for why you were feeling this way, right? And so it's like, you want to get to the root of the thing to figure out, okay, is the person hurt, do they have a much of extra stress going on in a life? Do they not understand all the things that need to go into this? Like, where is the disconnect, right? Or alternatively, they may be like, I don't actually believe that what I'm doing is going to get me to my goal. So for instance, if you program for Sam Calhoun, like a bunch of like running, you're like, yeah, first thing in the morning wake up, fasted, you know, 10 mile run, builds stamina and you need stamina for those nine attempts, you spread out by eight minutes at a time. Or is that? Well, yeah, that's what you have. And then, you know, a couple months in, she's like, no. But you know, that might be a lack of, you know, understanding like, why you're doing what you're doing inside into the process, right? So there's just, it's just missing an opportunity to identify what's going on and like be a better coach. Yeah. All right, well, three. Yeah. All right. Why is HDL cholesterol? HDL cholesterol value of less than 60 considered a negative risk factor in the Frammingham risk score for heart disease if the effects are relatively unknown? So the risks are actually a little bit lower than that. If things are 60 or higher, we're generally feeling pretty good, even if in their 50s, particularly for for a male, we're feeling pretty good about that too. But the idea of the question here is that if low HDL cholesterol levels are considered to be a negative or a risk factor, meaning that they reflect a higher degree of risk for cardiovascular disease, how is that the case if based on what I said in the lecture, we don't really understand a ton about HDL in particular, which is true. We know a good amount, but it's still probably the most mysterious of the lipoproteins that I mentioned. The idea here is that it appears to be more kind of a biomarker or a correlate for risk rather than a causative driver of the risk. So this is what I was getting at when I mentioned how we've tried. We've tried all the number of medications that are specifically designed to drive up HDL cholesterol, make that number go up, thinking that hey, that should improve outcomes, and then it turns out that it doesn't work. But it's definitely clear from the data that when those numbers are higher, those people are at lower risk. And so it appears to be more of a correlation than it appears to be a causation. There have been historically a number of theories as to how it might work, for example, that it might have this mechanism where it collects a bunch of cholesterol, extra stuff from the peripheral tissues and brings it back to the liver, things like that, as well as a bunch of other anti-inflammatory effects and things like that, which again have not paned out entirely the way we would like when we actually try to test treatments designed to raise the levels. So that's why I said that I wouldn't do anything specifically to try to raise that number in practice rather I would try to do things to lower that APOB level or lower levels of the low density lipoproteins themselves. So somebody had a stone-cold normal lipid panel, but their HDL was 50. You would be like, I need to do X, Y, Z to get your, because we just don't know that that'll do anything positive and that even if we did get the thing up, we don't know that that would be better. Yeah, I had a patient recently actually who saw who's lipid panel was one of the most whacked out that I've seen in a while and his low density life-oprotein levels were in the or his LDL levels were about in the 400s and his high density lipoprotein levels were zero completely undetectable. The so-called good stuff was like not present. What? I told you about the context team. So this individual was taking three different sarm medications at the same time. Kind of these selective androgen receptor modulator, pseudo-anabolic steroid type chemicals who's taking three of them at the same time. So I told him I said, I suspect this is probably related to you taking three of these even one of them can cause harm from the standpoint. So why don't we stop these things as well as reduce the dose of testosterone that he was taking? I remember an end and a few months later, now his numbers are back up to around 50 or so. Pretty substantial improvement, even just by taking off the medication. So I didn't do something in particular to raise that number, but it improved as a result of changing this other harmful thing that he was doing. So would not take those either. So the sarm things are interesting. So the sarm-sense for selective androgen receptor modulators. There's a handful of ones that have recently hit the black market in the past few years. None of them are currently available to use pharmaceuticals because they're all in either Stage 2 clinical trials or prior. They've not made it even into like being tested at the Stage 3 level and none of them are on the market. But that being said, the chemical structures have been available for people to create and they do that and you can buy them, although none of them are like these is like pharmaceutical grade stuff because the only pharmaceutical companies that are making them have patented these things. You can't just make that and it'd be and then sell them and it'd be okay. That's a patent violation. So in any event, the sarms right now that have been studied, that we do have data on, have either no improvement in things like musculoskeletal strength or lean body mass or very small improvements. Now granted, they're only been tested in older populations the longest study right now is like 24 weeks and they did not improve the time to up and go test in the elderly population, even though there was a small increase in their lean body mass. But here's the thing, you're taking something that's banned in all tested sports that we don't know have long-term safety data on. We don't know the potential side effects because they haven't been around that long and it's not even available on the market right now that you could get like without going through black market channels. Okay, people still take them. But people still take them and so you don't know what you're getting. So this particular instance, he's like, I'm on three sarms. Well, you're on three things that you thought were sarms, but maybe cut with all sorts of different things because you know, your drug dealer friend is maybe not the most ethical person that you've ever met. You know, so people ask you to ask us all the time back in the shirt list of Instagram live days, we're like, what do you think of sarms? Well, there's another question submitted today so you're touching on that anyway. Oh, should I just keep going or stop? Yeah. Oh. Well, so my thing is this. So if you compete in a drug test at sport, don't take sarms because you know, that's like cheating if you're agreeing to play by the arbitrary set of rules like don't do that, just find it other than a Federation. The other thing is because we don't have this long term safety data, we don't have long term. We don't even have like performance data suggesting these are like super beneficial outside of like anecdotes posted on forums that are supported by the sarm companies themselves. I don't think that I would take them from a performance enhancing standpoint. If you want to take illegal substances that you have to get from the black market, just take the rig, the antabolic steroids. I'm not telling you to take antibiotics steroids, but I'm just saying I wouldn't take sarms. Don't have. Yeah, again, most antibiotics steroids have we have better characterized their side effects, their risks, you know, pinchal benefits, dosene schedules, such as there's more history and data on those things, particularly in humans. We don't have that in sarms yet and again where you're buying them from, you know, that leaves a lot to be desired. That's case scenario for antibiotics steroids that your doctor would be prescribing them to you. Well, disayin, that's case. Or maybe in a very long time. Yeah, yeah, for a soccer peanut patients. Correct, but from a sarm's though, like you can't get them, you're getting them from somebody who made them in a bathtub or, you know, or is it just substituting something else? So I don't think that I could recommend them. Nope. All right. For long-term achievement and increasing lean body mask, do you recommend cycling weight loss, maintenance, and massing phases? If so, what are your recommendations for each phase or is this timeline simply based on specific individuals, goals, and or response? Yes. So yes, it depends. Yes. Yes, no, it is. Correct. So yeah, I think that the general process of gaining lean body mask will involve periods of gaining weight, maintaining weight, and reducing weight. So yes, like cutting, bulking, and then maintenance, that because you can't just gain lean body mask forever and it not get to a point where it becomes very inefficient. Like it will become very inefficient. At different points, this is a whole another area of like a research where they talk about these things called a P ratio, so how you partition nutrients into different tissues in the body, and any event, the length duration is going to depend on the individual and the response to training, which can be nutritionally, using the techniques he mentioned in the weight gain, lecture, yesterday monitoring their waste measurement, for example. Yes. So when the waste circumference starts increasing out of proportion to the body weight, then you're like, we have a problem. This is becoming very inefficient. Now, if that's just one measurement, that's the first abnormal measurement that you've gotten, maybe you stay the course for another week, and things will, you know, it was a measurement area or just an aberration. And so you can kind of go from there. But if you see somebody's waste or conference start to go up, go up, go up, go up, go up, faster than they're weight or out of control, then you're like, hey, things have become very inefficient. It's time to reduce calories and either enter a maintenance phase or weight loss reduction phase depending on what you want to do. Ultimately, this is guided by personal goals. It'd be very difficult for me to make a strong case. So for you, for instance, if you were like, should I gain weight? And I'm like, I don't know, dude, you want to. You're like, I don't know, should I? And I'm like, oh, make a decision. It's your life. It's not my life. You know? So, you know, from a coaching standpoint, if you're like, I want to be the strongest person I can be, you'd be like, okay, well, I know that increasing muscle cross-sectional areas likely to improve your strength. I know that potentially moving up a weight class would allow you to carry more lean body mass, maybe that improves your performance to a level that is consistent with your life goals, your set of goals, et cetera. I think I could make a case there. But for somebody who's very ambivalent, like us, yeah. That's what it is. Yeah, that's what it is. We need to get away all the time. It's don't care. What if we don't care? Yeah, so if I move to the, like, so if I went up to the next weight class, 105 kilo class, and I squatted more and deadlifted more and bench press more, my life doesn't change. I just have worse sleep apnea. All right. Like, you know, and it doesn't matter to me. If it did, we would have already taken the steps to do so. Yeah. So, same thing with being lean, like getting leaner, right? So if you're like, should I lose weight? And I'm like, I don't know, what do you want to do? And you're like, you know, just like, go on to live my life? I'm like, well, okay, is your weights are comforts for the normal range? Is you, you know, are you carrying enough lean body mass? Are you, you know, enjoying your training, all this other stuff? And you have any additional set of goals if the answer for health conditions related to body fat? Yeah, correct. So if you're doing fine, then I can't make a strong case for you losing body fat. Unless it's just your personal goal, like, I want to be leaner in which case, cool. Let's do that. Yep. I agree. Do you have anything else to do? No. Nothing. No, it's, what do you say that my answer is elegant? elegant? A, all right. Is this question five? Yes, it is. Question number five. With respect to patients getting too much information and no seabulling themselves? You thought we made it the whole thing. Carry on. With respect to patients, it getting too much information and no seabulling themselves. In retail pharmacy where's supposed to counsel patients on certain interactions, and the computer does not allow bypassing these without the pharmacist coming to the counter when patients pick up medications. IE increased risk of rabidomyelizes with statin and clendomize in or QTC prolongation with selects and zo-friend. Do you think these force councils are helpful for patients? How would you approach the patient? So, all right. So this question's saying, basically when the computer forces the pharmacist to talk to the patient about the side effects, if that is helpful to them. In an ideal world, the physician prescribing the medication should have already addressed that issue. For the two specific examples here, I'll say that with statins and clendomize in, I actually am not aware of a significant interaction there. With the QTC prolongation with selects and zo-friend, there is an interaction there, but it's probably not a huge deal, so for an in general, not a huge deal. But that's just these specific examples. In general, I think the physician should have already made the decision. Is this a clinically significant thing that I need to be concerned about and oftentimes, if we feel that it's not super significant, then we'll bypass it. However, in the real world, oftentimes people just bypass shit that pops up on the computer no matter what. He just clicked through it and sometimes the real legitimate interactions get through. I think the most severe interactions that can happen are things that we are very appreciative that pharmacists catch for us, particularly life-threatening ones. I think that for severe interactions like that that need to be that a pharmacist catches in as forced to discuss with a patient, I don't really have a huge problem with that. Again, because of the potential gravity of the situation, the potential risk associated with it. I would not have the pharmacists say, oh, I'm going to not tell the patient about this potential risk interaction between their two medications because I don't want to know Sebo them, for example, because I think the risk again, this should only be reserved for severe interactions. If they're like, oh, I didn't want to tell the patient about that their tummy might get upset by this medication. Like, yeah, I'm okay with that. You say tummy? Yes. I'm trying to. Yeah, I see. You get it. Yeah, I get it. But for severe things, I think if you got a tellin' then you got to tellin' I'd be like, this would have been done before this got to you. But I know that in the real world, that's not always the way it works and sometimes people just click through things. It's like a legal thing. That's why this is what I'm saying. Yeah, that's why this exists. Right? So it's like, no, we told you. Yeah, we told you. But yeah, ideally this would have happened before and the, at the pharmacist level, this wouldn't have to happen, but it's just a, it's a redundant see sort of thing. And for these severe, more severe interactions like for getting rabdo from your drug interactions, like, nobody's going to know Sebo you into getting rabdo. Right? That doesn't happen. Nobody's going to know Sebo you into your QT hitting 600 and you going into, you know, dying from all of you to delete it. So, so Noesimo effects with respect to these more severe ones is less of a concern for me, compared to the more mild side effects that are best avoided when the benefit of the medication outweighs the risk. Yeah, like ED, muscle pain. Yeah, stuff like that. With the way protein, people kept asking us which protein should I take, what do you recommend? And when we looked into it, we didn't really feel comfortable recommending any protein. So we just made our own. So we got four ingredients. The essential amino acid and BCA contents are very high. This is exactly what you want out of a way protein. Do you think I should do like a disclaimer when I send out training to people? Like, you may get too jacked. Black box warning. That's right. That was on our bridge. Yeah. 70,000 downloads was so humble, brug. All right. If a person can't complete a set of five, but you don't think they mean 200 squats. I think they made 200 pounds. I see. Okay. Portulo. Five by 200 squats. It's like five sets of 200 at RPE 8. So they know they only have two reps left in the 10th. Yeah. Two or two was there. Two or two. Two or three was in politics. If a person can't complete a set of five sets of 200 pounds squats at RPE 8 without preparatory arousal and a set of five at 210 pounds, also at RPE 8 with preparatory arousal, is the internal load the same. No. Is the trainer response? No. If so, it doesn't matter which strategy one uses for daily training. Maybe. Okay. So the way I think about this. So as far as is the internal load the same, well, no, because you've had to use more of your resources, your mental resources to get up for the set. Okay. So how big of a difference? I don't know. I can't quantify it. We don't have like units. You know, it's almost your, you have, if you had a training history that suggested that your session RPE was way higher every time that you got hyped up to do a bunch of sets. Right? So you used caffeine, you played Slayer, like you called your ex girlfriend, like, I don't know, like if all of the things. I don't know. But if, but on the other hand, if you had training history where you did all of that and your session RPE was no different, then maybe you get it hyped up for a single set or few sets, doesn't matter. That's going to be depend on the individuals. So I can't say, but my gestalt would be that, yeah, maybe that maybe there's a little bit of difference. As far as as the training response, well, one is heavier, like in absolute intensity, but since the relative intensity was the same, I don't think that you're going to get a better training response just from five more pounds on the bar. It's the same relative intensity, you know, still five sets at RPE, still the same relative intensity. Five reps, I think it was five reps, five reps at RPE. And so it's still the same relative intensity. So from a training outcomes standpoint, I don't know that that matters. What I would want to know more is like, were they able to do more sets, more reps, like total volume, for instance, or were they able to translate a five-pound heavier set of five into a better one RM? Like, I don't know. I don't think the trainer response would be markedly different. And then finally, if so, does that matter, which strategy you one uses for daily training? So if there are differences in those things, which can only be assessed retrospectively, then sure, you might want to pick a different strategy based on how you, you know, how you respond in. So for instance, if gyms like liftman, I like Taylor Swift, gives me height to train, right? Like I take a shot of gym being every time before I deadlift, like that's my gym, and he's able to perform better, right? And he sees his estimated one on our inference is going up. All of his working sets going up, his trainer response, improving overall, he has that sort of history, okay? Then maybe that is something that he chooses to use when strength is the most important goal for him, right? On the other hand, right? If he says, hey, whatever I do that, I'm good for one session, but then the next two or three weeks on average are bad, okay? Then he doesn't choose that, but you can only figure this stuff out after, like, kind of trying it out a little bit, trying it on for size, and keeping notes, which again is why you have an objective sort of metric of effort, weight, and then you subjective effort, rating of your effort with RPE, RIR, something like that. Yeah, so I discussed a little bit about how RP is actually a metric, a metric of internal load. And so from that standpoint, if we're saying we have two different sets, again, that minor difference in load that are at the same RPE is the internal load the same. Well, the internal load has measured by RP in that situation is the same, right? But if I had some sort of like biochemical test that was super sensitive enough to differentiate some difference in outcome from that metric during the activity, because that's, you know, when the internal load kind of thing happens, then I may indeed find a difference. I just don't think that it's super useful to get down to this like super hyper granular level of trying to differentiate these things. And I think that looking the last thing you said was what I was kind of getting at with the idea of following this stuff over a longer period of time rather than saying like 200 versus 210 in the session is there a difference. It's like thinking to short term to like more sessions for the trees versus thinking over a longer term sort of a deal is the way that I would think about it. Yeah. And yeah, if you're getting hyped out of your mind for every single session, for most people who have seen do that, doesn't tend to work out for them for too long. They tend to psychologically get spent and burnout rather quickly. Yeah, that was my experience on a certain program a few years ago, around just have to get super super hyped to be able to accomplish the daily task didn't work out great until I moved on from that approach to training. So I don't think it's a sustainable thing. I think that we in our in our training for ourselves, we probably tend to reserve that sort of preparatory arousal getting hyped up for particularly high priority sets or sessions. So our competition, if we have a session where we're doing our competition, squat, bench, or deadlift, and we're working up to a heavy single then yeah, we'll use a little bit of that to focus for that particular thing. There's a top work set for whatever reason matters to us. Then we'll do it there whereas like if it's our tertiary lift where we're doing like you know, if I'm doing like a set of 10 on the high bar squat or something, no, I'm not getting hyped up for that at all. Do you remember to remember Brendan? Yes. Among you. It was like it was like a gatlin gun of like ammonia stuffed into his shorts and it would be like curls. It's crazy. Yeah. That's how you live doing that. Yeah, the interesting thing. Yeah, so I think in practice how this works is whatever a high priority work out or session or something you use more tools in your bag to get to perform optimally for that. Right. So not every session can be a priority session. If every session is a high priority, the no sessions are a high priority. Right. You have to pick and choose. So for instance, I have a meet in two weeks. Right. And I'm like, all right, well, once the next time I'm going to squat with my belt, like you know, once the next time I'm going to deadlift my belt, when like my my competition lifts because I want to perform well on those on these last few weeks of training. So that way I would have a good psychological status going into my meet. But, you know, by the time it gets to the last lift of the day, those aren't important anymore. And if I was like, you know, months out from a meet, then maybe I care a little less. Cool. Yeah. All right. 100% of my clinical experience, including clinical evaluation, treatment modalities, etc. in athletic training school has been thoroughly debunked. What do I do now? And how do I go about introducing these pain science concepts to my colleagues? Love it. Wow. Uh, I'm going to start. Well, yeah. Okay. So you have to be, you are going to leave here with quite a bit of enthusiasm for these new things that you have learned. You have to be careful how you bring these things to other individuals in your social circles. Uh, not everybody is ready to hear these things. Some people are going to be very entrenched in their way of thinking about things or their way of doing things. So if you show up to your athletic training school class or clinic tomorrow morning and you say, here's all this information you guys are idiots getting ready for the knowledge training coming. Get ready for the knowledge we're about to drop it. You can't do that. Yeah. You are unlikely to be successful in delivering this information to your colleagues. Uh, so you know, I work alongside a whole bunch of other staff doctors at the hospital where I work, but I don't go around telling them you're wrong, you're wrong. You don't know this. Here's what you need to know. He actually does. So for example, on the Sarkapini peace, I gave one of those lectures similar to the one that we put on our YouTube channel at a different time at our institution and a bunch of my colleagues were there and the back listening and that afterwards they were all coming up to me very curious about it wanting to learn. So I knew that I had an opportunity to provide them with resources to go further with this stuff, right? Um, but I didn't go out and force this stuff down everybody's throats and you have to be kind of diplomatic with how you do it. Um, otherwise again, you're going to get potentially something like a backfire effect or you're just going to, you know, you're going to lose your entire chance of succeeding with this. Um, I think that's, from the pain science stuff, I included some resources and you guys books resources for patients, for professionals and then a bunch of actual papers from literature, um, on the topic. And so if you, you know, there's multiple ways to introduce this stuff. You could just strike up a conversation about what you learned, ask them if they're interested in learning about what some of the research has shown or send them a YouTube link to one of the lectures that would, you know, in our group when people ask about this stuff, we share them a bunch of, you know, or we pick a good lecture from Dr. Mosley from Australia, who talks about this stuff. He's one of the best at delivering this stuff at a kind of a late public level. And, you know, a non-confrontational way of doing it to an individual who is open to learning more is your best shot at getting through to somebody. If somebody is not interested in learning more, then just move on, continue living your life, or if you do it in a very confrontational way, you're likely to not succeed. So I think that informing yourself with a lot of these ideas from a social psychology standpoint about belief change, I like all the content that is on those micro-inies, you are not so smart podcasts about belief change. If you can understand familiarize yourself with that kind of stuff, then you'll have more success interacting with people on this stuff. But really just assessing whether somebody is open to learning more, set open to changing their mind about things potentially, exposing themselves to other ways of thinking about things. And then if you find that that is present, getting your foot in the door, and sending them resources that can hook people. You don't just say, hey, buy this 500 page book and read it and we'll talk about it, because nobody's going to do that. Send them a more accessible introductory resource where you can hook them and then you can start to reel them in from there. That's usually the way I go about it. Particularly using a 15 minute YouTube video or something like that, which is probably pushing the limits of some people's attention span. But if it's engaging which mostly stuff is super engaging, you can tell he tells great stories and gets people hooked on this stuff. Then you can reel them in. So. Yeah, I think from a practice standpoint, you're going to end up doing what you feel like is best and you're going to use evidence that you have been exposed to and your own experience. And you can't separate those things, right? So part of this is evidence based behavioral practice. So trying to expose yourself to more more evidence helps get you closer and closer to what we actually have research on. And that being said, if you, or someone you know, doesn't have the mental model to like understand pain, pain science, the hate current pain science, current management strategies, all other stuff, then you just telling them about it, it's going to miss them. It might be even a fendom, you know, you get that backfire effect. So, you know, I don't know, yeah, just similar to what Austin said that somebody asks you about it, you can provide resources and I think, or you know, entry level resources, you should have those on the ready if you actually want to be a sort of subject matter expert on this. On the other hand, if you don't want to do that, you just want to go on practicing, disinfecting, affecting as many patients as possible. I don't know that that's your role. You say, you know, hey, there's this whole like realm of pain science, like Google it. And then you focus on how to best manage your patients, you know, like peer-to-peer learning is super important, but I'm not going to pretend that everybody is responsible for that. All right, very cool. All right, so hey, thank you guys so much for coming out. Really enjoyed having you. Thanks for watching on YouTube. You guys are great. See you guys next time. The problem with P protein compared to a really high quality way protein is that it doesn't have all the essential amino acids that a way protein has. One of the biggest benefits of a way protein is that it has a huge, huge concentration of essential amino acids. So what we did is we used to P protein, we took all the essential amino acids and up to them to the same level of way. So the essential amino acid content in our vegan protein is the same as a way protein isolate. So if you are vegan and you're one in a high quality protein, this is the one for you.

=== FILE: 2019 Chicago Q⧸A： Drs. Baraki and Feigenbaum discuss SUGAR, risks of training, menopause, and more! [czhZDNSJd-U].txt ===

Hey YouTube, Chicago folks. Thank you for joining us here. Thank you for coming this weekend. We are in, well, it's Evan Stan, Illinois. But we're going to do a Q&A. We've curated some questions, curated questions. We're going to get into the same way we normally do with the laptop. Okay, let's go to the first question. How do you deal with people with very low self-efficacy? Do you get to a point where you've dismissed a patient because they're unwilling to change this? Dr. Baroque. So, this is a good question because a lot of people, this is an issue that a lot of people have in terms of having low self-efficacy and a lot of it has to do with social, cultural understandings of health and health promotion and health care. These are people who end up being, they end up utilizing a lot of health care in general. For almost any symptom that they have, they may end up making an appointment or coming in or going to the ER or the hospital or something like that. And it's out of their own concern of what does this mean and I need treatment for this or I need, you know, experiencing a symptom means something is wrong and that means that something needs to be fixed. That is something that is very difficult to assess or manage or kind of work on. So to speak, in that particular setting, in that acute setting, like if they come to the hospital, that's not the place or the time to do that, mainly because they're so worried about what they came in for. But for somebody who has a longer term relationship with this individual, be it a primary care doctor or a coach or if it's a relative or a friend or something like that, I think the main thing that I would try to do is try, like we do with behavior change in general, is try to educate, try to identify barriers and try to knock down those barriers as much as possible. In other words, you try to get them a win with something. And once you get a win with something that they may be successfully been able to self-manage the first time, they're able to work through their own back to week, for example, that's a win. And then that can start to build some positive momentum for these people because their entire cultural understanding, the way they've been taught about this stuff, too date, has revolved around needing other people to fix them. And if you can kind of violate that expectation, that expectancy violation is a principle we use when we're treating issues related to pain. If you can violate that expectation once, you might be able to break the cycle and start to build some positive momentum and get some wins for the individual. So I think identifying barriers, breaking them down, educating, and then getting your first win is a big part of this process and trying to build momentum from there. I've never dismissed a patient because they're unwilling to change this because if they are coming in because they feel they need help, that would be profoundly unethical to say, well, you're unwilling to help yourself get out of here. So I have a certain ethical duty to that individual. Obviously, I might feel that this individual may be able to manage certain things on their own if provided the skills and the resources and the tools and the education, that's something that ends up being a long-term process. But no, I have never and probably will never dismiss somebody or refuse to work with somebody on that basis alone. Yeah, not a patient. Actually, I don't think I've done that to a client. Like there's certainly been clients that I probably should have adjusted our coaching and client relationship early on. Earlier on, so that we could have a more productive relationship. That being said, how do I deal with people with very low self-efficacy? So a lot of the stuff goes back to the behavioral change lecture we talk about identifying where somebody is on that trans-theoretical model of behavioral change and providing the right resources to them at that time. So again, most people with low self-efficacy, it can stem from a wide variety of different deficiencies. So if somebody's in that pre-confrontation state, they might lack the actual insight into, well, here's why this is a problem. And so again, providing education at that point may be very useful. If somebody's like, yeah, I know that it's a problem. I just don't feel like I have the actual practical tools and skills to make an action plan. So again, you're just addressing, many people were there at and addressing what they need at the time. I don't know that I've had anybody that I've been working with for a substantial period time, have that long-term relationship. That's just been like, nope, you still bad, still terrible. And we have a selected population if they come to support this in a sense. They're selected for people who are motivated enough to buy into this. 100%. Like Australian. The main thing is that you can't, I guess you're putting it under, under pressure on yourself if you're trying to fix this in five minutes, can't do it. Or one visit, can't do it. It's not possible. So I think if that's your expectation, then you probably, unlikely. Yeah. Gary. Question number two, I have many pre-menopausal and menopausal athletes in my gym. This article sent to me. It's article from, was that JCI? Yeah, Greensdale, Greendale, 2019 for people who don't want to look it up. Yep. I believe it essentially states that in the pre-menopausal stage, lean body mass decreases and body fat increases and then sticks during menopausal. Yep. Is this article supported by data? What would you suggest to help people keep as much lean body mass as women age? So yeah, that's definitely the general trend that is reported in the data, suggesting that people who are either perimenopausal like they're very close to going through menopausal or they've gone through menopausal will lose lean body mass and gain fat mass and that is very difficult to get rid of. But these are untrained individuals, thing one, thing two, you would expect due to the relative anabolic nature of testosterone and now that they've lost a significant amount of estrogen that they would be in a better position to put on lean body mass, but it's not in fact case. There are other factors that play, including just increasing age and general which is anabolic resistant type of situation. So yeah, right now as far as the actual resistance training and data in older and post-metapausal women suggest that they can in fact lose body fat and put on lean body mass and there's scores of weight loss data in this population too. So how would you as a gym owner as a coach as a healthcare professional counsel somebody on, you know, increasing lean body mass and decreasing fat mass? So it's not different than what you would do for somebody who's not perimenopausal or post-metapausal. It would be the same. It would be a calorie restriction for fat loss. It would be engaged in irregular resistance training with progressive overload, you know, and meeting the least, the physical activity guideline minimums, right, and going up over time because there's this dose response relationship between training volume, strength and high-perch fee and a preventative weight regain, particularly in folks who lose weight. So I don't know that I would change and just like we said in the female under chronology lecture, I don't know that I would change any of my management based on the fact that somebody's perimenopausal or post-metapausal other than like noting it, noted and then moving forward. So and this article, you imagine if you read that and you were post-metapausal or like getting cl- not you. Peri. Oh, yeah. And you're like, no, I'm going to lose all my gains. Yeah. I guess people could respond to it in two different ways. Sure. I agree. Most of this is in untrained people and that is the trend. And of course, the important thing to remember is that when we use the term lean body mass, that also includes bone. And so in this situation, that perimenopausal transition is actually a good amount of it, actually occurs due to decrease in bone mass, particularly in untrained individuals. The paper they sent actually intelligently, they did not include bone mass changes in their analysis that showed some decrease in lean body mass attribute of the things like muscle mass water, things like that, and increase in body fat. But again, those changes can be attenuated or minimized by actively training throughout that period. And I agree on the other side of the transition, we still don't view that as a quote unquote special population in the sense that they need some sort of special training approach. We still approach them and treat them from a training or a programming standpoint similar to. Yep. All right, move it on. Question number three, assume in a person who's taking an adequate fiber, adequate servings of fruits and vegetables and is eating within maintenance calories. Is there any reason to limit the intake of simple sugars added or otherwise? What would be otherwise? Added or included in the food. Yeah, right, or other ones. Sure. Within the confines of maintenance calories. My response to this is it depends because there's a handful of medical conditions that have a fairly tight relationship with total sugar intake and worsening of that particular disease hyper-triculist or idiness, one of them. I still think though if you're maintaining weight and you're an appropriate body weight and body fat level and you're getting in the recommended amount of fiber and you're getting in, you're one of the 25% of Americans who are even meeting their fruit and vegetable intake goals per day, which puts you in rarefire air. That you're probably okay, right? And I don't think I can make a strong argument to the contrary. That being said, I think that if you need to lose weight, you know, so this would take this out of the context of maintenance calories, then I think reducing added sugars and simple sugars would be a good idea. The other thing I'll say is most of the time added sugars, particularly in the American diet, Western diets, and particularly in America. It's from sugars we can beverages. And the problem is with liquid calories, we don't really compensate very well. So if you take in 300 calories of liquid beverage, you're unlikely to compensate, if it's a sugar sweetened beverage, you're unlikely to compensate by eating less whole foods later on. We're just not very well set up to do that. So I think in a weight loss situation, I feel much more strongly about people avoiding sugar in the form of sugar sweetened beverages. That's like one of the first targets I look at in a weight loss situation for some people from a dietary change standpoint. Yeah. But like in this question. It's not a strange question. It'd be like you ask him, you're like Jordan Lovman. Okay, my macro is now. He finally convinced me to count my macros. And I'm wondering, what is the safe upper limit of sugar intake? I'd be like, you're fine, dude. I just do whatever. Hit your macros, hit your fiber intake. Right? And make sure that you get in your vegetable food servings in. It all turns to glucose or some sort of simple sugar anyway in the gut. So, yeah. So, I'll cut it. Today's biochemistry take. Alright, question number four. Once the patient has lost 10% of their body weight, what is the value of further weight loss, on text or something to loss about 30 pounds, be in my one from 35 to 31, should I be more aggressive about further weight loss? That's a good question. And so if you check out the American Academy of Clinical Necronologists obesity guidelines, which I, again, think are like the best obesity guidelines we have that are published and they're free, which is neat. There are some conditions that are obesity related health conditions that do respond to further weight loss. So the range that they'll advise between 5 to 15% or even greater. So, there's, again, some health conditions that have this dose response relationship to weight loss and health improvement. So it really depends on what your health status is right now. If you still are suffering or a burden of disease related to carrying too much fat mass, then I would encourage further, probably worth pushing on. Yeah, I agree. On the other hand, if you have no medical problems, your waste or conferences within check, you're very active, meaning the, again, physical activity guidelines, minimums, and I don't know that can make a case for further weight loss unless you have significant risk factors or if you just want to. Yeah, if you want to. So people like, should I get abs? I'm like, I don't know if you want to. I don't care. That's what Austin's texts that I wake up to. Should I get it? No, excuse me. You guys know that's a lie. I can only do so many hypothetical Austin news for them. Okay, question number five. Do the doctors have any experience or data to share reacute neurovascular events or injuries from training? For context, I've seen a handful of patients with concern for Sentinel, Aneurysmol, hemorrhages or reversible vasoconstriction syndrome. How would you counsel these patients? I think I can narrow down where this question came from in our audience. Oh, geez. Oh, geez. Yeah, it's neurologist. It's a nerve, it's a nerve, it's a nerve, it's a nerve specialist here. So yeah, risks of resistance training is an excellent question and it's a topic we've actually been considering adding a new lecture to the seminar on that particular topic. We just have to figure out where it's going to go. Yeah, it turns out we're a short on time here, you didn't notice. So when we wrote the initial up-to-date article, you know, of course they wanted us to include a section there on risks of resistance training. And the biggest risk that they were concerned about us risks that they wanted us to talk about were cardiovascular risk with resistance training, musculoskeletal risk with resistance training were like the big ones. And so we didn't actually, they didn't actually ask us to do stuff with respect to nerve ascose stuff like stroke and your ismal hemorrhage or RVCS, which I've only seen a couple times, I'm sure you see it much more, much more than I do. But so while Jordan was lecturing, I actually dug in a little bit to see what I could find. And there's actually not surprisingly very little on this with respect to resistance training in particular and risk of and your ismal hemorrhage and stroke. I did find one paper from fan and colleagues from 2000, published in British Journal Sports Medicine and the title is Physical Activity and Subaract Noid Hemorrhage, a population based case control study. And so in that paper they said four of the 149 subaract noid hemorrhages in that paper 2.7% were associated with vigorous activity. They said that after their case control analysis, the risk of subaract noid hemorrhages increased during vigorous physical activity. However, they said that higher levels of long-term regular physical activity over the past year were associated with a lower but not statistically significant risk of subaract noid hemorrhage. So they were able to show that chronic levels of training were protective against risk of hemorrhage, stroke, but that during probably and shortly after the episode of vigorous activity, your risk goes up by some non-zero amount. And that's the reason I brought up the up-to-date articles because that's exactly what we ended up finding in the cardiovascular risk literature. In the sense that when you do this sort of training, you are accepting some degree of increased risk of things like sudden cardiac death. Every time one of us comes to train or do anything, there is some non-zero increase in risk for something like sudden cardiac death. They said that in the absence of like unstable chest pain symptoms, people who either have stable coronary disease or no-known coronary disease, that the risks of resistance-based exercise and vigorous physical activity in general, vigorous in this context being defined as greater than six myths, which is like jogging, running, not that vigorous really. The benefits significantly outweigh the risks. And that's kind of what I would come back to here is suggesting that the benefits of exercise likely outweigh this risk. And of course you are among these few people out there who end up seeing these complications, which is unfortunate, I don't think that we can necessarily advise widespread population-based screening for something like this or intervention upon that. For reasons we discussed for our videos in our screening podcast, we went into that in detail. So we are accepting some degree of risk every time we do anything pretty much. And so just like everything else, there's trade-offs like Tom was saying all weekend. So from this standpoint, based on the little data we have, most of which is not based in resistance training, we can attempt to generalize and say that the benefits of this are not based on the risk of being able to do this stuff likely outweigh the risks. And that's probably the only way that I would be able to frame it when counseling a patient on this is the risks of training, which are likely present and non-zero compared to the risks of not training. And of course, it doesn't necessarily have to be that kind of dichotomy, right? So patients may say, well, can I just do a lower intensity type of exercise instead? I'm like, well, you could. I can't tell you based on evidence that that is actually reducing your risk any further. If that would make you feel safer or less afraid, because if I know that I know that if somebody told me that I had an aneurysm in my brain and that I was at increased risk of something terrible happening with vigorous activity, that would probably be on my mind when I went to go, you know, coal 700, right? Yes, yes. So there is some risk, you know, the overall data suggests that the benefits likely outweigh the risks, but of course that is hard to convey to an individual. They're like, but I'm not the population. I'm an individual. What is my risk? And I'm like, which I could tell you, there's probably so many people that we train who have undiagnosed aneurysms in their brain and they go their whole life and then you find or they end up dying of something else or maybe they one day they do die that. And so that's probably the best we can do in the same way that that's the best we can do from a cardiovascular risk standpoint. There was a 2017 meta-analysis we cited in the up-to-date article where they were saying that like these specific risks with respect to resistance training from a cardiovascular standpoint are likely under-reported and generally not specific to resistance training. So it's like it's very hard to draw confident conclusions. And so the best we can hope to do is present some of this information to people and say, yeah, there's a risk. There's a risk to not doing this as well. Best, you know, data we can we have right now. Best we can generalize. We can say that it's probably, you're probably better off if you train than if you don't. But there's some risk, sorry, you know. Yeah, stuff. The overall risk for resistance training from like an, like an in, a musket of skeletal injury standpoint for all types of resistance training. So like CrossFit, strongman, highland games, powerlifting, bodybuilding, Olympic weightlifting is very, very low. The average two to four injuries per year, per athlete or 0.5 to two injuries per thousand participation hours, which is nearly the same as walking, which is 0.3 to 1.5 injuries per thousand participation hours in walking. If you add gardening into the mix, they nearly completely overlap. So watch out for that garden bro. Like the musket of skeletal injury stuff is really low. But when we did our training podcast, I looked up resistance training injuries, resistance training induced cardiovascular events. So like for, and this for for men, for instance, it's one in every like one and a half million individuals. So the acute risk of having a cardiovascular event. And women is one in every 34 million individuals, something like that. But the overall paper and the and the studies that are based off of suggests, yes, this risk is in the acute like early stage like you're never trained before. This is an un un, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you're you're not accommodated to this level of stress. So yes, there's a non zero risk to begin with. But the chronic benefits of exercise are, you know, well established. And they reduce that risk over exactly exactly. It's just that acute sort of risk. The second part of this is as far as like screening goes. So like what sort of screening is recommended in exercise. So if you're a personal trainer, if you're a healthcare professional, you're like, well, can this person train? So I'm a client like the patient level, a client level. What they can do is take the pre-participation activity, uh, uh, uh, screener, the park you, people are cue from ACSM. That's freely available. And if there's a positive screen in there, they get referred. They should be referred to a either sports medicine professional or doctors familiar with it. There's a paramedics, which sounds awesome. And there are specific paramedics for different healthcare conditions. Like cardiovascular disease, pregnancy, things of that nature, that helped God the clinician. So those are the actual like takeaways. If you're personal trainer, your coaching, you're like, you know, I don't know what all this stroke stuff is about. So we'll just, I'll just pretend that I'm listening. That's, uh, that would be the take home from that. Okay. Oh, is this the question? This is the question. What is the current evidence of reduction in knee pain from gel injections? But you mean like hair gel? No, this is the highly ironic acid. I, J, or Visco supplementation. Did I tell you something? My first coach that I ever had. So this guy, he was in my brother's PA class. Okay. A little bit of a nut. You know, I think you know that this is well, I don't want to drop names. Okay. Because the tubes. This guy was like, yeah, I've been injecting hyaluronic acid into my hip. I was like, you wait, you've been injecting yourself because, well, yeah, I just want to see if it works. And I was like, what? He did not have a good outcome from that. But I think that mirror is the actual evidence on this overall in the, yeah, like, actually, I don't, um, just, by your tone. I mean, people do hip injections of like the, the trochanteric bursts out and stuff like that, but like an intraroticular hip injection. I know it is challenging enough to access without like, there's some things. X-ray guidance or something. He's doing this to himself. Anyway, okay. So, hyaluronic acid is this, it is a molecule that is used as part of the synthesis of collagen. It's involved in collagen synthesis and some of the other connective tissues in the need. Not collagen. Cartilage. Excuse me, I said that wrong. Um, and so the thinking was, oh, this is a part, a building block for cartilage. If we inject this building block into the knee, the knee will take it up and know what to do with it. And things will get better. And so it's been tried. It's actually quite expensive. People get this sin-visk injection, uh, usually it's a series of like three injections over a course of a few weeks. And, um, so to quote, the evidence from large double-blinded and high-quality trials indicates that intraroticular hyaluronic acid has a small clinically irrelevant benefit over intraroticular placebo. So, of course, I've seen lots of patients who say, yeah, they get the gel injections. Once a year or something like that, and it makes their knees feel great. Wonderful. Um, all the high-quality, you know, adequately controlled evidence that we have on this suggests that those benefits that they receive are contextual effects placebo effects, meaning, meaning responses like I described in the placebo lecture where, you know, they're sitting there. They have these achy knees and the doctor who has, you know, counseled them and told them about this material, how it's part of cartilage and how their knee is bone on bone. And this is going to help to restore the lubrication and help their knee move nice and smoothly. Preps them sterilizes their knee and they get to watch this needle going their knee and this syringe full of this fluid that they know is going to make their knee move nice and smooth. Get their oil change for their knee gets injected slowly into their knee space and like, oh, I can't wait for that to be in there afterwards. They're moving around. Like, yeah, that feels awesome, right? And then you do the same procedure with a placebo injection. Weirdly enough, they get the same response. So I do not recommend people get highly organic acid injections. I think the cost for the small clinically irrelevant benefit that you get from it is wildly unfavorable. And I think that most people in practice mismanaged knee oste arthritis and this has been echoed not just by me, but some of the recent publications and British Journal Sports Medicine, whether they've talked about, you know, evidence-based guidelines for managing musculoskeletal pain and oste arthritis, which echo a lot of the things that I presented in the pain injury and rehab kind of talk earlier today for people who want references on this stuff. There's a paper by RUTJES as the author from 2012, Anos of Internal Medicine and Jeves of R in 2015, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. And so that's the extra effort that I put in to look this stuff up while Jordan was lecturing to give you guys some sources. I guess I almost wore the citation separately. I guess we need it here today, but there's your citations. Yes, Smith was off for the study. Who's Smith? I don't know, but RUTJES sounds like, yeah. Sorry, would not do. Would you do PRP? Nope. Would you do cortisol injections? So cortisol injections, I generally don't recommend, but to the extent that they have evidence, it probably beats out a hyaluronic acid injections. I still don't tend to have people. I was trained to perform them and every time I performed them, I was like, hey, I'm doing this right now. Yes, sure. Yeah, what I would do is just bring in a big needle and then like drape, effectively drape. And then be like, yeah, no, I just anesthetized you very well. You didn't even feel like going, yeah, get that placebo. Okay, with programming, nutrition or training, is there any evidence that shows that weekly follow-up is more advantageous than daily, twice per month, et cetera. Do you see some clients require more frequent touch points based on their experience levels? I knew clients needing more contact than a client of 40 years, for example. The data on this is actually interesting. So there's a lot of data that's been emerging due to online apps, for instance, and different online sort of health services, stuff like particularly luck and few other entities. So effectively, the more touch points that you have with individuals engaged in weight loss, for instance, the more professional touch points, the better they do. It's not perfectly linear, but that's just a general rule. And I don't know if I've seen enough data to have a good opinion on the granularity of that, one-time per week, first twice per week, first three times per week, first, once every six, you know, six days or 12 days. Rather, I do know that most of the recommendations suggest at least weekly follow-up, at least weekly follow-up for people actively engaged in behavioral change. So the way that I've seen this work practically in my own sort of practice with individuals who I'm following up with is that initially, the weekly follow-up turns into usually twice weekly, because it's usually, here's my check-in, here's what's been going on, then I provide feedback and ask additional questions, and they give me another answer, and then I give them an email. So it's usually twice per week, maybe even three times a week, initially, and then that just goes down and down and down and down until it's just once per week. Where people, not, it's not that they don't have questions anymore, but they're, they don't need as much acute management. Their questions are more like theoreticals or philosophical, or they're like coaching, and they're like, well, what should I do in this situation, right? It's not a personal question about how they, you know, something they should do that week. So that's been my experience, and again, I know the data suggests from this professional effect, sort of standpoint, like people have more touch points on average do better than those who have less touch points, and as soon as the study ends, for instance, for a weight loss deal, when people go from seeing people either once a month or once every two weeks to seeing nobody, they do worse. The weight regain rate is very, very high post the study ending. Give me any else? No. Yeah. I mean, frequency tends to go down a bit over time from the rank beginner to, I think that's intuitive. The training thing is actually interesting because I have not seen any data on like physical activity compliance with either online sort of health services or like frequency of follow-ups. I'm sure that something's out there. I just haven't seen it yet, as far as with my own sort of practice. Again, like it starts out hot and heavy at the beginning and then just gets, gets more spread out at the end. Okay. Knowing what we know about the bio-sicososium oil, hey, did Daniel do the rap about the bio-sicososium oil to you? Yes, it was excellent. It was excellent. It was the best one he's ever done. We're going to put that. He posted it on his, uh, Peter. We'll share it. Peter, yeah. Did you focus to uproar? We'll get you crispy. I'm not the one. Mmmmm, yeah. down. It's gonna be okay. It's not the love down. It's got a three-to-slope range. Yes, I'll cut the weight down. Step forward. Rage motion. Can't get down. That's down. It's slow down. Put it up. Put it down. All the time. You're not a machine. It's gonna break down. You'll hide it down to the ornaments. Hope that's the break. And... Knowing what we know about the Cycle Social Model at what point does a certain movement pose an injury risk? And when should that person seek intervention from a qualified professional? So I think there's two questions. Let's answer the first question first. All right. Knowing what you know. Probably. About the... Well, knowing what you know you... Yes, right. A Pistumol... Knowing what you think you know about the Biocycle Social Model, what point does a certain movement pose an injury risk? I think that a way to succinctly kind of summarize the point there is that certain movement poses an injury risk at the point when you are... You've been... You're not adequately prepared for that movement. Sure. That's the way out summarizing. Right. So people like to dichotomize good movement and bad movement as if there's some universally like correct way to move or a universally incorrect or dangerous way to move. Again, this is stuff we see. That gets shared to us, but we get tagged in this stuff all the time, somebody's like, oh, if you just lift your arm like this, that's like, you know, red X for bad for your shoulder or something like that. We don't agree that there are inherently harmful movements. We think the body is very robust. Resilient can execute a wide variety of movements, can tolerate and adapt to a wide variety of movements. However, when somebody undertakes some sort of a movement that they are unadapted to handle, they're not adequately prepared to... That's when there is likely some increase in risk. And that may be, you know, in the sporting world like field sports where you're competing with other people. And there's a lot of, you know, that's where a lot of ACL injuries happen. For example, planting and twisting and dodging around other people, where the environment is much less predictable and it's kind of... To an extent hard to prepare for something like that, outside of general strength training and the other evidence-based ways we have to reduce injury risk in field sports. And in the gym, you know, we don't tend to be very, very perfectionist with our movements. We like to promote the same sense of resilience, but we like to say that, hey, you know, whatever movement style you end up kind of gravitating towards. If you train that for a very long time, you know, that's fine. That's why we see people who round back deadlift 900 pounds without evidence of issues because they've been round back deadlifting since they were very beginning. The gym probably added five pounds. Well, that's oftentimes, you know, the way it goes. So they've adapted to that movement strategy and that's probably the way that I would summarize the ideas about like movement and injury risk. There aren't really concrete, you know, high risk particular movements that I can point to particularly in the gym context. Of course, in field sports, again, certain types of planting and twisting and stuff like that are going to pose you to certain risk, which we may be able to reduce certain interventions. But for our populations training in the gym, you know, you can move a whole bunch of ways and be fine. It's just the loading, the progression, the adaptation that matters. You wouldn't suggest that people take a lateral blow to the knee with the helmet. I would not suggest that. Yes. Yeah, I agree that I don't think there are any like unique exercises that we can perform in the gym that are uniquely injured like have a unique injury potential. Unless you're unprepared to perform those exercises, not from like a skills standpoint, but mainly from like a workload tolerance. Loading stance. So that being said, I don't think that again, performing any exercise in particular is necessarily dangerous unless you do too much of it compared to your previous workload. You know, towards too heavy, which yeah. So the interesting thing is like people say you should never do an upright row because you'll saw your super-subinatus tendon in the half. Yeah, I mean, there are lists of these things behind the necklaces that are even squatting. Yeah, it's like you've just tried to harm people. You've just posted an article that's hurting people, which is ironic because you're, you wrote the article to try to help people, but what you're doing is hurting people. By putting this negative expectation, this hyper vigilance, this exercise of witness in their head, got forbid somebody reads this upright row, and ever has to lift like groceries up like this and like, oh no, my super-subinatus tendon. Oh gosh, I need an MRI immediately. Some hyaluronic acid. So yeah, I think that you summarized it perfectly. I wouldn't suggest that any exercise is injurious, just like any particular technique during an exercise is particularly injurious unless it violates that acute on chronic workload or somebody else like hit you. There's uncontrolled ballistic movements. Unproductive stuff, traumatic stuff. Yeah, all this stuff goes out the window, but in a controlled training environment, you can adapt to all kinds of crazy stuff. I mean, if you look in other sports too, right, you look at gymnasts, you know, you look at various other types of sports. Like, people can do all kinds of crazy amazing stuff with their bodies, right, when it's properly dose progressed and, you know, adapted to overtime. And again, the injury rate for resistance training at large is lower than a lot of those other. Yeah, so like body building, for instance, has the lowest injury rate of any resistance training modality of power lifting's right after that, which again, if you look at that specific data, you're looking at less than two injuries per thousand participation hours. Now, if you look at just strong manner, high-ling games on their own, you're looking at like five and a half injuries per thousand participation hours, which may owe themselves to the movements not being able to be scaled quite as linearly, right. So like you go to a strong, if you're competing strong man, right, then you have to like subject yourself to a lot of exercise that you might not be able to train at your particular gym. Just use you lack the implements or the specific thing. You can do at the competition, which is bad deal. You want to comment on the last part, like when you've answered that one, but if you don't want the professional deal, we've answered that one. Okay. If you're concerned, you can see, you know, I mean, we can't tell you to not go see somebody for something, so if you're concerned, what do you go get not recommended somebody to do? Yeah, but we can't guarantee whether this person who you're seeing knows what they're doing. So it's kind of an unfortunate thing. So that's why I don't really have much to say on that. Yeah, if you're worried, I would recommend seeing a professional, if you were asking for a particular professional to see, I think Derek and Mike. Yeah, I would recommend that. If it's a musculoskeletal injury, pharmacist and training, those guys, I don't know if people do an a better job than they are. So anyway, okay. Moving on, what happens if you replace saturated fatty acids with proteins instead of carbs or other types of fats? Okay, so I talked about this in the lipid lecture where we talked about was saturated fatty acid intake, the role of replacing it with other types of nutrients, whether that be other types of fatty acids, unsaturated types, polyunsaturated fats where we have randomized control trial level evidence that that type of replacement reduces cardiovascular risk. The mono-insaturated fatty acids where we have evidence suggesting that it reduces cardiovascular risk, although not super super high quality randomized control trial evidence. And with carbohydrates where we said that replacing it with refined carbohydrates either has no effect or increases cardiovascular risk and replacing it with more complex or whole-grain carbohydrates tends to decrease cardiovascular risk. When replacing saturated fatty acid intake calories from that type of intake with dietary protein, there is also no randomized control trial evidence on that with respect to cardiovascular risk death things like that. However, there is evidence that with respect to certain cardiovascular risk factors that it generates an improvement in those things. I think it is likely that you would get an improvement from something like that, but I don't have clear like RCT evidence to point to on that. A good reference to look at for all of the stuff that I just said, if that was like a blur, is this paper by flock FLOCK and colleagues in 2014 titled macronutrient replacement options for saturated fat effects on cardiovascular health. Yeah. The way I like to think about that is if you're trying to reduce saturated fat intake, as long as you're not replacing it with either trotter or sugar, like trans fats, you're probably okay. Yeah. Yeah. But if you need to lose weight, like I just wouldn't replace them. You just go into the calorie deficit. Just lose some weight. Okay. In a classroom situation where a professor either teaching a regular exercise science or health course or a professional medical class, when they teach information that's related to pain or injury that is not supported by evidence, and it's potentially harmful to the people listening who don't know any better, is there a place as a student to talk to the professor about this if so how should it be done? You want to start? Yeah. One of our clients and PT students who is in our Facebook group posted about this recently and he was like losing his mind because he tried this and got a massive backfire effect. So it may or may not be worth your time. It's important to get if that you have a sense of the extent to which this professor who is in a position of authority over you who is a lowly student, who doesn't know anything from their perspective, how receptive they may be to some sort of evidence. If you think they may be, then the way I would do it is just, hey, have you seen this evidence? What do you think of this? Now they may well say, I don't like it for whatever confirmation bias reason that leads me to reject evidence that I don't like. If that's the case, then just move on with your life. If they say, you know, that's interesting and look more into it and it spurs some discussion, then that's a huge win. But I think that you cannot put too much emotional investment into this thing. You may be able to, you know, introduce them to something that they've never heard of or read before, which would be impressive. If you manage the pull that off, I think it's unlikely if you're say like the first year post grad student or something and you have a PhD that you're presenting this stuff to. Just recognize that yes, the information that you may be receiving is net is is incorrect or harmful and you may be seeing this as like the end of the world because all of your classmates are taking this information and they're going to go out and spread this harmful information. And while probably true, the world is very large place. So, you know, if you're unable to impact that person, you cannot, you know, hang your personal self worth on your ability to influence this and just move on with your life and try to influence those who are more open to this stuff. I think that's the biggest thing that I've kind of had to learn over time was just to detach myself emotionally from some of this stuff because some people just you're not going to get through to and the world's going to keep on turning. All of the back of the has no feelings. Yeah, it's a weird one. A little known fact. 17 years. Yeah. Yeah, which is while we have people claiming that they're, you know, ahead of the evidence, especially in the rehab world and they say they're practicing ahead of the, they're just waiting for all the literature on their favorite modality. The favorite modality to catch up. Meanwhile, the evidence suggests that they are in fact 17 years behind. Yes, correct. Yeah, it's what's it just. You know, the interesting thing was this, so like an arm medical education like our neuronatomy professor Dr. Aravich, shout out to PFA, you won't watch this, but maybe he did. And he made it this far. And he's still watching. He actually taught us a lot of this pain science stuff. Like it was there. Now, every presentation that he ever did to us was like hundreds of slides and say you're just like, okay, and this is in medical school order and other classes that are also hundreds of slides. Yeah, and you're like, okay, but he it was all there, right? And the interesting thing was like, see, you would expect as somebody who's now up on pain science because it's been communicated to you in a way that's successful digestible and something you understand. You're like, you guys probably eaten it up, weren't you? No, we were stupid. We couldn't. It wasn't available. We didn't have a mental model to like for that to work within everything else that we knew. And even then amongst other professors, they weren't necessarily saying that either. So it's not like we were getting beat over the head with this every single time we just missed it. There was just too much information and we were unable to process it in the way that hopefully you guys have now processed it after it was presented here this weekend. This stuff was told to us in that school and it just. Yeah, because we were too busy trying to memorize everything else we had to memorize. Yeah, but you went back and saw him. Can you imagine if you were like, told him with his pain science stuff he goes, yeah, so I just got PRP injections. Oh, you're like, no. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. Last few questions. Yeah. To clarify, is there no additional benefit to higher repetitions as recommended in the star rehab protocol? Is it the load reduction that is helpful to the rehab process, not the higher reps and metabolic fatigue? As the movement in and of itself and load reduction, the key factor in reducing healing time. Question mark? I really had to like go up. It's like stoop. Yeah. Working on a little nomm? A little beginning, middle of the night? Are you? Yeah. No, no, no. You deserve a break. Okay. That's my best doing. So this question has a number of assumptions that I think I would just get out of the way. So the star rehab protocol, just for you guys don't know, is that if you whatever movement you injured yourself on, let's say that you hurt your hamstring, right? This is for muscle belly. It's supposed to be for a muscle belly tear. You tore a hamstring during the squat. Whatever. The first person's ever done that. No, let's say that happened. Then you would use the squat and do five sets of 20. The next day at a very lightweight, maybe the empty bar. And then you would add 10 pounds and continue to do that until it got heavy enough for you had to do sets of 10. And you would do in five sets of 10. You do in nothing else besides squatting on a daily basis to reduce scar tissue, apparently to encourage blood flow to the area. I know like look. Okay. All these things are supposed to be happening. A few things. The star rehab protocol is not evidence based. Meaning that for muscle belly tears, resistance training in that fashion has not been shown to like in reduce time to recovery. That being said, being sedentary has been shown to reduce our to to encourage increase the time. It takes you to come back to your previous form. So yes, we would encourage activity. But we would not necessarily recommend the star rehab protocol. So if you're asking like, should you do the star rehab protocol full stop? No, I wouldn't do it for anything. I would not recommend that's not wouldn't be my recommended rehab protocol. The second part of this is asking are there a benefit to doing higher petitions during times of if you have an injury. And I think that is a reasonable sort of program modification because it reduces the load that you're going to be working with. You have less expectations about how much weight you can handle. So you're not going to take it up to RPE 11. You're not going to turn your amp up to 11. You're going to be like, I have to do such a 15. That sounds terrible. I'm going to go to a more moderate load. So in fact, if you look at our knee rehab template, our low beat, low back rehab template. All of these things start at higher repetitions. And then work their way back to normal training. Okay. Also helps improve like sort of strength, a force production endurance. So strength endurance sort of deal also gives you a little bit extra volume to build your sort of tolerance to training back up before you return to your normal training. So high repetitions can be very useful. Okay. That being said, it doesn't like shorten the window to recovery of performance. The last thing I would say on this, the load reduction is certainly a part of being able to participate in activity when you have an injury. Particularly in this in the theoretical context where this is supposedly applicable. If you have a muscle tear and for some reason you decided to not reduce the load. Right. If you could, right. That would not be particularly intelligent thing to do. Yeah. You almost have no choice but to lower the load. And if you want to get a training stimulus from it, then yep, reps are probably going to go up. Yeah. The way I think this happens is like, star was asked by somebody to be like, hey, what should I do if I have a torn hamstring? And he's like, um, I'm going to make this up. Just do this. Maybe like, let's, let's start rehab protocol. Bill Star was a great lifter, which is true. Great lifter. But I wouldn't recommend that for any rehab of anything, even a muscle belly tear. What would I recommend? Let depends on a muscle belly tear. I don't think I would recommend five sets of 20. That's a hundred reps. The hundred reps. It's a lot. Um, you know, it would probably be sets in the 10 to 15 range of exercise that you can tolerate that, you know, work a full range of motion and potentially the injured tissue. And if you can't work that injured area, because it's just too sensitive, too painful, whatever, then I would do other exercises that don't work that area, yet allows you to continue being physically active. I know this crazy stuff. Well, it's kind of like when I presented the approach to injury and I was talking about like the load increment. And I said like a five to 10 percent load increment. For example, as our usual approach, particularly early on in the rehab phase, and I added the caveat that this is made up. And it's not evidence based. And I fully admit that, and that's just our general recommendation. I mean, this is the same thing. This rehab protocol is also just made up. And certain people have had good experiences with it, which is fine. Um, I'll also probably take a different approach to rehabilitating these sorts of injuries, but fortunately, we don't see these sorts of injuries all that often. Yeah. But it'd be definitely a tears. Yeah, just don't happen all that often. So what would you do if you rupture your biceps tendon? Uh, I would get surgery. Oh, really? Because you're that concerned about these statics? I knew that your bodybuilder heart. Yeah. As you can tell by my, you know, enormous digestive zones. Yeah, exactly. The YouTube's gonna have a field there. Right. Yeah. All right. What's the intensity break point between the 150 to 300 minutes of modern intensity activity per week? Verse, the 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous intensity activity per week with regards to the physical activity guidelines for adults? Uh, so you look this up. You can go ahead and do this. Well, I just wanted us to give specific answers. So in that literature in these specific guidelines, they define moderate intensity activity is something that is between three to six Metz, Jordan talked about in Metz in his lecture referring to metabolic equivalents. It has to do with a metric of kind of energy expenditure and examples of activities that fall in that three to six met range would be something like walking. Somewhere at least three miles per hour. Light cycling would be in that three to six met range versus vigorous in this literature greater than six metz of activity would be something like running. And so the idea is that from the physical activity guidelines from 2018, they suggest that you can do either or or combination of the two in order to achieve a target of 500 to 1000 met minutes in a given week. In a met minute, you would basically take how many metz you're expanding and a given activity times how many minutes you're doing it. So if you have five met activity for 30 minutes, you just multiply the two and that gives you a measure of how many met minutes you expanded. You want to get a total of 500 to 1000 met minutes. Now, most people out there and we certainly don't expect you guys are going to be tracking this and calculating your met minutes per week, right? They have to give us something specific to counsel people on. So moderate activity three to six met range, vigorous greater than six. They're met, you know, met about equivalent charts that can give you ideas of how vigorous of activity we're talking about here. So either or or combination to hit that target is the goal. Yeah, the way I actually do this like practically is if for moderate intensity stuff, it's RPE six or lower, which is more boring than hard. You can talk in complete sentences. You can't sing though. It's like a little harder than singing. And then for high intensity stuff, you cannot talk in complete sentences, just short stances. Kind of this respiratory RPE, if you will. Restart RPE. What if I do a thousand met in one minute? It's a one arm deadlift. Maybe. Maybe. All right, last question. Okay, do you have any suggestions on how to collaborate between doctors and trainers? I guess it depends on like who you are. And actually, I think if you're a doctor, it's going to be easier to collaborate with a trainer. Yes. If you're a doctor and you walk into a gym, like a black iron gym, or someone you have great coach. And you say, hey, I am a primary care physician or an internist or whatever. And I have a lot of patients I'd like to refer to you or like to collaborate with you so that we can, you know, help reduce all these diseases of Western civilization. And then the guy's like, oh, like, I don't know what you just said, but I've been to squats and you're like, cool. Not that bad coach, they know, build what insane. Build what they're like. Build what insane. Build what insane that. So I think it's much easier for the doctor to actually take the initiative on this one. I probably wouldn't necessarily recommend that a trainer try to take this on their own accord and be like, reach out to a bunch of doctors. Because I think it's, yeah, well, so the deal is because I think it's almost a waste of resources. What I would rather have them do is hook up a physical therapist and other sort of care providers like that so that you can transition people from. People are being discharged from rehab. Correct. Exactly. And at that point, then the, just trickle up effect. Right. Yeah, that's what I think has a higher success rate. I mean, when I was coaching full time like that, that was my, that's what I ended up doing with PT's and Powerpractors in the area. And then I ended up getting hooked up with a few internists who also wanted to refer me to people. But I already had this sort of cache a where I was like, oh, yeah, I'm working with Dr. Soinso and his patients or her patients. And I kind of had that already. The other thing is if you're a trainer, this is the interesting deal. Like the ACSM call American College of Sports Medicine, that certification, the health and fitness specialist carries so much weight in the medical community for no reason. The certification is not great. It's not great. But they're like, oh, you're ACS of certified. I've heard of them. They did the sports medicine fellowship. They do all these other guidelines like this. Great. And you're like, cool. It's the cheapest main certification that I can get. So thanks for recognizing. So I think that's useful. As far as how to sort of do this collaboration though, the way that I envision this, the way that I envision this and the future is that People like trainers and doctors are working together seamlessly. Meaning that doctors like, yeah, I have this patient in my primary care practice and I'm sending them to you for therapeutic exercise. Well, I'm sending them to you so that you can get them up to meeting her exercise guidelines. There if you got to be clinically relevant. Yes, there if you're a little more specific. And also engaging in nutritional changes that I've recommended. And now you have more time to counsel them. Sure. And I think doing that instead of like the diabetic education program, for instance, I would rather have people do that. Yeah. That's it. Thank you. Thank you.

=== FILE: 2019 St. Louis Q⧸A Part 1： Training Sensitivity, More Pain Science, and How to Press Big Weights! [YukTQPHRii0].txt ===

Hey everybody, thank you guys so much for coming. We're at the St. Louis seminar, my hometown. If you have to leave early, we understand. And for questions that we didn't get to, that you don't see on this YouTube video, you can ask it on our forums. And we'll try to answer it there. Also, Sliding Austin's DM's, he loves that. Yeah, I look at all the DM's I get on every day and make sure I'm fully caught up all the time on all the DM's I get. So yes, Austin first, then the forums. Okay. We're going to go through these curated questions and try to provide some nuanced answers. Yeah. Okay. Do you think that the model of training sensitivity is more static over a career that can't change? Or is it more dynamic depending on other factors that are determining responsiveness at that particular time? Kind of have an difficult time understanding. I think they're asking if your training responsiveness is variable over time, or if it's pretty much static, over the course of a training career. Oh, I just thought it was kind of an interesting thing to think about. Sure. I don't know. I think that your training responsiveness does and in fact change both in the acute setting and then chronically, acutely like when your environment and psychosocial inputs change dramatically. So again, periods of high stress or supersprim below stress, higher motivation, low motivation. I think all of that portends change in outcomes for how much training adaptation you get from a given level of training stress. Because the internal load is likely changing and it's trying to load drives adaptation. Since I didn't say that like 45 times. Yes, Chris. The important takeaway from that. But then chronically, your training adaptation is likely as you near your peak, your training adaptation is going to get smaller and smaller and smaller from more progressively, more and more training stress. And then as you start detraining, your really going to reverse roles a little bit. As you become less and less trained, your adaptations actually might increase magnitude, but you're still trying to hang on. Yeah, I think that we've distrust before how from a training sensitivity standpoint or training resistance being a spectrum of the same phenomenon. The more trained you get, the more training resistant, you become, right? Meaning that a given dose of training stimulus does less and less for you. That's why we PR maybe once a year or something. Like a true one RM effort if we're we have to put in a ton of training to realize that sort of an adaptation and performance, a huge amount of training compared to when we were in our earlier more training sensitive days getting big adaptations per unit of training stimulus. But I definitely think that on a shorter time scale, say day to day, month to month, week to week, whatever that it's likely variable depending on all these other factors that can influence internal load. Yeah, I would also just not think about training response on this industry like vouts. Meaning that, like for instance, I don't think that you have a stress or recovery and an adaptation that are all separate from each other. Rather, you have accumulated stresses and recoveries taking place 24-7 and adaptations are taking place 24-7. And then what you get, again, that balance shift from the negative fatigue, more that shift more towards positive fitness adaptations use are able to realize potentially realize the improvement of performance from those fitness adaptations. And it's always occurring all the time. So it's not like one workout generated x amount of fitness adaptation and then you're able to realize that at some discrete point in the future, more likely that a series of workouts has generated a series of stress that has all culminated to drive a certain fitness adaptation. So I just don't think about it as this. That's completely. OK, do you find that physicians are less receptive to the idea of sarcopenia in patients with obesity? Yes. Do you remember? Oh, no. Anne, it totally, I get a lot of funny looks from physicians when the patient is obese. This would also be true of hey, this patient meets Aspen criteria for malnutrition. Yeah, yes, to both. So the sarcopenia obesity is a big subcategory within sarcopenia and technically obesity. But it's under diagnosed and then under treated as a secondary to that. And then I think people are more dismissive of that as well. So when you look, not just look at somebody visually, but even on a chart, you look at a person's BMI and there's BMI's 35, 40 or something like that. But they have obvious muscle loss in their appendicular skeleton. And their function is very, very low secondary to just being weak, having low amounts of lean body mass. So you're saying, well, this person would benefit from losing body fat, but also benefit from gaining muscle mass. That's hard to square in your mind for a lot of physicians who are unfamiliar with the term sarcopenia obesity. And then the prevalence incidence, all that other stuff. The Aspen guidelines actually talk about this in particular and recommend a high protein diet, resistance training, as well. And then they also do recommend, obviously, body fat reduction, bio calorie reduction in this as well. So I think what you're, but that's not obviously happening in a hospitalized setting. Yeah, I definitely think that physicians, I mean, even having these discussions among my colleague colleagues, they're generally, we can pretty easily recognize somebody who is truly what we call a cacetic, meaning like their skin and bones, like the end stages of certain types of conditions, like end stage of cancer or heart failure, COPD, sarosis, chronic kidney disease, many of these, and some autoimmune conditions can result in just muscle wasting, but cacaxia in particular is refers to a situation where there's a loss of muscle mass and a loss of fat mass. So you're basically like actually skin and bones, right? Sarcopenia specifically refers to the muscle mass loss. And you can have sarcopenia with an excess of body fat. So that's kind of a slightly different situation from cacaxia where that's just total energy and muscle wasting, low body fat, low muscle mass. Now we're talking low muscle mass, high body fat, is sarcopenia obesity. And there are, basically, strata of risk that increase between normal kind of lean body mass and normal fat mass or increased fat mass compared to sarcopenic patients do worse. And then sarcopenic obese patients do even worse and just the sarcopenic patients do, because not only do they have the complications from sarcopenia, but they can have the metabolic complications from having obesity, metabolic complications referring to the cholesterol problems, insulin problems, high blood pressure problems, diabetes, things like that that also bring in their own risk into the equation. And then you can get even more granular with this. And if you've measured bone mass and the bone mass is low, you can have something called osteosarcopenic obesity. Where you have low bone mass, low muscle mass, because remember I described how those tend to track together, so somebody has a lot of lean body mass, probably it includes their bone, but you can have low muscle mass, low bone mass, and excess body fat. That's a common situation that's really quite dangerous, because you have all the complications of sarcopenia. If you're to suffer a fall related to that, you're more risk of having a fracture, because you have osteopenia, and you have the metabolic complications of obesity. So that's a bad combination to have, and those are the people who above all else, more important than it is for anybody else, need to train. Sure, yeah, you recommend lentils. Lentils, they're great. Yeah. All right, question number three. What does the process look like for people who carry bad narratives with them into your consultations? How do you redirect them into what the evidence actually says? Yeah, that's a great question. A lot of this has to do with the motivational interviewing skills, and I don't, that doesn't just mean like listening to people, and being nice. There are active skills that have proven benefits in these sort of clinical counseling realm, trying to explore these different ideas and narratives that people have. So in particular, what I like to do, because this happens with clients that I work with, that I'm not even working with, and I go, they don't come to be from pain rehab consultation, because you think about the people coming to Barbell Medicine for pain rehab consultation, I do think Derek and Mike are some of the best in the industry doing this. But there are already sold on this. We don't have to like sometimes. Yeah, that's all. Not all of them. What I would say, most of their experiences with people who know who we are, what we do, and kind of our methods, rather the people that I coach, not all of them are up to speed, necessarily on our pain science stuff, and our message, and stuff. So that's a little bit more unique situation. So a lot of times that I start by trying to get the individuals to tell me what they think is going on, why they're afraid or what they're afraid of happening, what they expect to kind of happen, just elicit, all of these sort of, this narrative, and then go from there by trying to not correct because I don't want the writing reflects to come up where I tell them something, and then immediately a challenge is there like core beliefs, something and they want to tell me that I'm wrong or otherwise dismissed what I have to say, but rather try to lead them in a different direction. You're trying to lead them through this conversation in a very nice way that doesn't challenge their beliefs directly, but rather gives them thoughtful questions to sort of allow the possibility of them being they're preconceived expectation and notions to be wrong without them appearing to be wrong directly. Sure, because it's basically a less confrontational way of leading them through the evidence rather than the opposite example is, yeah, actually, even if you do have a horneation, doesn't matter because in the next six to nine months, it's going to resort anyway, that's probably actually not even a horneated disc type symptomology because those are unreliable findings, and so you'll be fine. Not only does a person not feel like you heard them, but they also don't feel like they were able to express themselves and all of the things that are going into their thought process, so they're not even in a position for you to tell them, like actually there might be a different side to the story. So building that narrative initially, like eliciting that and then kind of walking them through in a step-by-step process that doesn't directly confront maybe some of their beliefs and beliefs systems is a straddle, one strategy that I like to use for motivational interviewing, and this is just a sign I'll let Austin take the reins up to this, the role that can mill their book is pretty good. We got that in medical school, actually, I forgot about it, and somebody was like, you guys should up your motivational interviewing game, read this book, and I was like, how to have this book? I feel like I read it at some point, or was supposed to read it, and so I got to sit down and reread it. And there's just a lot of cool nugget pearls in there that I do intuitively, because I either I was exposed to it, or this part of my communication style, but I think people who haven't had that sort of experience in the professional setting would benefit. Even if you're not a doctor and you're a trainer, or you're a coach or something like that, these skills are useful, so it's just a book called motivational interviewing. Yep, but you guys would recommend. Yeah. Yeah, my process for this is in some times, it's similar. So the question was, what does it look like to deal with these kind of harmful or bad or incorrect narratives and how do you redirect them to what the evidence actually says? I don't always, I mean, I frequently don't try to like bring scientific evidence into the discussion with the individual, because again, they want to feel heard, and if you start throwing like research at them, that's not gonna get you anywhere. It's good for us to know the research, but we don't need to just throw PubMed at people, that's not gonna do anything. My approach to this probably looks a little bit different than what Jordan described in their some situations where I might bring in evidence like the discussion of a substantial proportion of herniated discs heal on their own in a few months. Yeah, that's a good little tidbit to have to tell people, right? I think that more often what I'll do for in this situation is either find aspects of their history that conflict with their understanding or their belief or have them do things that then conflict with their expectations, that's called expectancy violation, in other words, so to give some examples. Somebody might say that they have severe knee pain due to bone-on-bone arthritis in their knee, for example, right? Or they have back pain due to a herniated disc that they feel like has been there for a long time and is never gonna heal. Well, a simple question that you might ask is do you ever have days where your symptoms are better and symptoms are worse? Like, do your symptoms ever fluctuate? Because of course they do for all the reasons that I described in my lecture. And say, yeah, I have some days where I don't feel any pain at all and some days where it's excruciating and I can't get out of bed. And it's like, well, I have a hard time understanding how that might happen or how can you explain how your symptoms fluctuate if you have bone-on-bone all the time or if you're disc because herniated and pressing on that nerve all the time. How is that possible? Shouldn't you be having symptoms all the time or do you think that something else might be affecting your symptoms? And they're like, you know, I guess there could be something else that might influence my symptoms having better on some days than another. Maybe we can work through this and figure out. What are the patterns that are more consistent on days when you have better symptoms? And there may be like, well, it feels better when I'm doing this particular activity, which is always some activity that they, you know, really enjoy or are looking forward to doing or something like that. And it's much worse on days when I've had horrible sleep or I have a ton of stress or something with my family or whatever, you know, other factors that can influence that kind of experience. And so I've found something that conflicts with their understanding and that can get my foot in the door to, hey, maybe it's not all about the tissues here. Maybe there's something else besides just the bone and the bone in your knee or the disc and your neuroferent mental space in your spine or something like that. So that would be one thing from like a historical discussion perspective or alternatively from an experience situation. Somebody might say, I have back pain and I'm afraid that if I bend over, that something horrible is going to happen. Well, I might coach them into gradually bending over and getting them to the point where they can do an activity and prove to themselves that what they expected was going to happen does not in fact happen, right? That might require a lot of coaching and reassurance and working through the process. But if I can get somebody to, you know, with knee osteoarthritis to sit down and stand up out of a chair a few times and their symptoms don't get wildly worse and maybe that violates their expectations to the point where I can start to build some positive momentum from there. So I really like the expectancy violation piece here to try to just plant a seed of doubt about their existing understanding of things and then that can blossom into this new narrative that I'm trying to build up in their minds to get them engaged in the process of working towards recovery. Yeah, I actually think that's an important point also that what we do here, like it's not like we narrowize the person and then as soon as the end of that, you know, like from men and black, that thing and then afterwards they're paying free and they're just like, wow, I never experienced that after you explained the bio-cyclist social to model, I had to make. Okay. Yeah. But rather, and this is, it's more like the plot of the movie inception. Right, it's evidence by the expectation violation thing that once you've planted the seed of doubt and you get somebody to break this idea like, oh, that's supposed to be bad. I had these fears. This, you know, making things worse that they're more accepting of like, yeah, like I have some pain right now. I'm gonna get better. I know the steps that I need to take to get better and I'm actively involved in that process. And so that process, both gets to start and then subsequently end sooner because they're actively involved and you've broken that cycle. It's not again like boom, you're paying free. You know, here's the invoice. Yeah. But it just does difficult a process of behavior change. It's all the stuff you discussed on day one with obesity and stuff like that. But I think probably the theme of this weekend is behavior change in self-efficacy. Right? When you say, if we had to distill it down, yeah, just like it's hard to do. But sometimes it'd be like that. Sometimes it'd be like that though. But you know, you're resilient human, you're powerful, yeah, and capable of change. Yeah. All right. Question number four. That was like really home, like, like meaningful. Yeah, man. All right. Is there a correlation between oral contraceptives and tendon or ligamentous ruptures? I see that you have, yeah, I wanted to ask curious about this. I thought it was a good question. So I went out and did some scouring. Sure. And it was lecturing. So I had never heard of any association between oral contraceptives and tendon or ligamentous ruptures. The theory or the concern behind it has to do with the idea that certain female hormones like progesterone, for example, can induce laxity in some of these connective tissue structures. And if they induce laxity, then you may be at an increased risk of some sort of an injury, a rupture or tendonopthier or something like that. And so it turns out that females, in general, there's pretty consistent evidence, particularly in the realm of ACL ruptures. For example, that females are way higher risk than males of experiencing ACL rupture upwards of eight times greater risk in sports that are somewhat demanding on the ACL, for example. Strength training is definitely among our biggest tools in mitigating this problem, getting both men and women to train. Strength training is one of our biggest tools for reducing the risk of ACL rupture here. But the question had to do with correlation between oral contraceptives and these sorts of injuries. And so found some data. One was from a paper by Canopa in 2019. This was a systematic review. I think they looked at 29 studies. And they ended up pulling out a subset of them. Two or three were like soup was fairly high quality. The rest were of mixed or lower quality. They said that the higher quality studies suggest that oral contraceptives decrease a female patient's risk of ACL injuries in ACL laxity. The strength of these findings however is weak. So they found some evidence to suggest that actually oral contraceptives may decrease the risk of some of these things. And the thinking or the proposed mechanism was that when you have a combinerial contraceptive, which again contains estrogen and progesterone, it tends to actually shut down the full dynamic flux of the full kind of hormonal cycle over the menstrual cycle. And so if to whatever extent those hormonal fluctuations have a role in these risk of these injuries, shutting down that cycle by the use of oral contraceptives may mitigate that risk. So overall, I'm not sure how confident we should be that they decrease the risk because some of that evidence is a bit weak. But I definitely don't think we have evidence to say that oral contraceptives increase the risk of these things. And that would not be anywhere on my radar as far as a concern if a woman was on oral contraceptive and was playing a sport or resistance trainer or something like that. And that's not something that I'd be concerned about. Compared to something like, oh, this person is on a Cipro antibiotic for a prolonged period of time for something. That's a medication where it's like, yeah, that antibiotic definitely has a risk of tendon rupture. And that's something that I would be a bit more concerned about. Whereas oral contraceptives, not really an issue. You work in for big pharma? On the side. On the side. Yes. So here's the real question. I work for big generic. Big generic. Yes. Yeah, big, big Walmart. Yeah. What do you think a bigger problem is, with respect to women in strain training, the risks of oral contraceptives induced gains attenuation or unwanted pregnancy? Yeah, probably a ladder. Yeah, just from a population-based, probably the ladder. So like telling people to stop taking oral contraceptives, when you are not the prescribed in position, seems just like a bad move, bad juju. So maybe stop doing that on the internet. It's you. Stop it. Question number five, what is Austin's favorite whiskey? Is oddly specific. Yeah, people want to know. All right, what's your favorite whiskey? So I'm a rai in general, more often. I like bourbon too, but I rai more often. So the Thomas A. Chandy rai is my favorite rai. Excellent. Question answered. Yep, boom. Next time. I've been really liking that CYPB. Oh yeah, from a weller. This story is, so this is funny. My friend Daniel J, who owns a gym in Santa Cruz. He picked us up three bottles. He kept two from himself. Got me one. You can think he paid $39 for these bottles of weller, create your own bourbon, create your perfect bourbon. Create your perfect bourbon, yeah. And anyway, and as soon as, like when you brought it to me, I feel like this is way more expensive than $40. I'm just going to Google, like what's this going for now? Well, that's though that would be the retailer of the MSRP, but whiskey, secondary market is just insanely expensive. Yeah, the bottle probably goes for $700. And I go and literally had just opened mine. Like I just opened it. Like, do you want me to put this label back on? Like, yeah. And he goes, no, man, it's for you. It's a mouthful. All right. How would you handle a patient who's very, very dependent, or possibly even reluctant towards increasing self-efficacy? Actually have a few clients that are within this realm, but it's fine, because our relationship is still appropriate for the type of relationship that I'm willing to engage in. Now, you may have different values, different availability, different wants needs, et cetera, and a person who's very, very dependent, may even more than what I'm willing to offer right now. So what do you do in that case? So you have a few options. One, setting the expectations about what you are and are not willing to do and how you are and are not willing to engage. So for instance, if a client were really one in my personal cell phone number, that's a no for me. It just don't do it, because I don't want to engage in that type of personal connection, while I may or may not be available for providing coaching insight, but I'm very responsive to emails and very responsive to Instagram messages. So, and they know that. This is all some expectations that have been set. On the other hand, you may be totally fine with that. So again, different values, you have to draw different boundaries. But what I found is when it's compromising their ability to actually see progress, because they're so, so dependent, is actually very similar to your expectation violation thing, because they almost feel paralyzed. I need you to tell me what to do. And instead of just enabling them and say, fine, I'm going to do it, it's just a deeper conversation. I'm like, what do you think you should do? And they'll say something like, I don't know. And you're like, okay, well, let's bracket this. So for instance, the person I'm thinking of in particular was like, I cannot pick my weights. I need you to tell me exactly what weights to lift. Every single session, that's what I would prefer. And I'm like, I understand that, whoever, because I know that your performance level on a given day is 100% guaranteed to be in flux. And I will not always be there to tell you, I feel like we need to develop these skills. So if I was trying to pick a set of five repetitions at RPE9, what is a good range for you? What is the best on your best day do you think you could do for a set of five on a squat? And then she gave me a number. I said, I'm on your worst day. What do you think you would do for a set of five in that same intensity range? And she gave me another number. And I go, great. That's your bracket. That's where you're going to start. Start on the low end. And then you're able to add weight to you, hit that high end. She goes, OK, I can do that. Because again, you've literally just worked through that single problem. And you've given them a tool and a sort of way to view the problem that they thought was insurmountable. So it challenges again, that what they initially had. On the other hand, people may have unrealistic just expectations about what the coaching relationship looks like. And I think that you have to determine what type of coach you're going to be, what type of interaction you're going to have with them. And then start that from the beginning. And so if you're three or four months in and you haven't done that, well, you got to do it now. But I do like that expectation violation for this particular situation. Yeah. And that's a good example. I mean, the theme of behavior change continues here. And within the world of behavior change, if you're having difficulty with behavior change, the number one thing that you need to do and the number one thing that we identified and point out in the lecture is you need to identify the barriers. So he identified the barrier in this particular situation. Where was this person having difficulty? And how to do it selecting weights. And he proposed a skill or a strategy to work around that barrier. This is the case for every single type of behavior change. If somebody is having difficulty, your task is to identify the barrier. And then try to develop a skill or a strategy to work around it. Now, you may be able, you may have the knowledge, the experience you may have some skills and strategies in your tool bag that you can offer this person. Or it may be a situation that maybe you've never experienced before. Maybe you don't know how to work around this. And your options are to either provide your best guess and experiment with this individual. And then you could learn from the experience too, or you may refer to somebody who you trust to help somebody work around some of these issues who may have more of a knowledge base, more of an experience base, maybe an expert in that particular field. So if you're like a coach, and you have somebody who is dealing with severely disordered eating, we need to develop some behavior change. Maybe you don't have the skills, the strategies, the knowledge, the understanding base, to actually help somebody work through that, which is probably the case. So a good option would be to refer that person to somebody who does have the kind of base of experience and knowledge and skills to help somebody work through that. But again, all of this is identifying barriers, developing skills and strategies to work around them so that we can build the self-efficacy so that people can self-manage. That's been the theme from the first five minutes of this weekend when I was talking, is the idea of self-managing around these things. The opposite of this is dependency, where he could have just fed off of that person and said, yeah, you definitely need me to pick your weights every session. You need me to watch every rep that you do. Otherwise, you're going to hurt yourself. And you're going to need me to do this for you for the rest of your life. Keep paying me. Yeah. Can't give you the keys to the castle. Right. But this is like protected knowledge. That's not what we want. So open source. Yeah. Thanks. How would you, oh, same question. You talked about the best predictor for improving the function of fast switch and slow switch, much of muscle fibers is training history. That's not true. So it sounds like you can change them over time. Yes, you can. If someone genetically has more of one of the, or one, if someone genetically has more of one or the other, can you change that through training? No. OK. So I answered all that. Moving on. So what I said was the clear file. Yes. Well, the best predictor for portion the proportion of fast switch to slow switch muscle fibers is the sport and level of that sport that people participate in. Meaning that if it is a power dominant sport, like Olympic weightlifting, and you participate at the international level, you're very much more likely to have a high percentage of fast switch muscle fibers than somebody who participates in as a marathon at the regional level or local level. So it doesn't mean that you can shift between type 1 and type 2 fibers. That's not been shown unless you actually literally cut the nerve and then re-intervate the nerve into a different motor unit. You actually do see that change in experimental models. What we see, what we do see in vivo in the human body, it's sponsored training, is that you get a switch between type 2A and type 2B muscle fibers. Type 2A muscle fibers being low velocity, high force production, somewhat fatigue resistant. Muscle fibers is as a general kind of description and type 2B muscle fibers being high velocity, high force, not fatigue resistant at all. So if you're in sports that involve sprinting, jumping, punching, kicking, high rates of force production, high velocities, you would want those type 2B fibers to be selected for. So your training should reflect that. So for example, if you had a sprinter 100 meter sprinter, and you were in charge of training, then most of their training should be done at high velocities. Heavy sets of five or six or whatever reference all our retreats made up. At heavy heavy weights with low bar speeds would be deleterious to their progress. Because you're then inducing a change from those fast high velocity force-rucine muscle fibers to the low velocity muscle fibers or in other words, type 2B to type 2A. And you wouldn't want that. Also, things you might include would be maybe some of the Olympic lifts for that population or jumping or plyometrics, stuff like that. So it's just going to be specific to the type of training and tight end goals that you have for the person. As far as what if you should include high velocity work or not. Now, I made a case during the programming lecture that I would prefer for non-specialized athletes to incorporate a wide range of training, intensities, exercise variations, and rep ranges. So then the logical question that is, what about speedwork? If you're going on and on about this high velocity force production stuff, why doesn't the average Joe get trained for high velocity force production? And my answer to you is, if he or she is not involved in a sport in some sort of competitive level that's meaningful to them, that I think it's a waste of training time for them from a health standpoint. Meaning that they're going to get all the benefits they need from resistance training with respect to improvements in strength, power, and lean body mass without ever having to focus and sacrifice, therefore sacrifice training time for high velocity training. That being said, if they were like, look, man, I play in this softball league, and I really need to increase my bad speed. OK, we can do some high velocity work then, or somebody who's like, I'm MMA curious and want to get better at MMA. I may include some high velocity work for them, even if they're only rolling twice a week, even if they're not technically specializing for that sport. On the other hand, if the person doesn't care enough to really compete at any sort of level, then I'm just not going to sacrifice their training time for what I would consider to be a really not useful training goal for them. You guys notice how he just had an entire back and forth between himself for the past 10 minutes? I do that. You did the, on the other hand, like, four times. So four minutes. He does that. Well, somebody asked you, they were like, who would win an argument? You were Jordan. And then your response was, well, Jordan would disarguate with himself. Yeah, so an Arnold Kerenha, Jordan. True. All right, resistance training is great in all, but what would you suggest for patients who present with chronic pain and notes are to train with weights? Obviously, there are benefits outside of pain to train, but what other modalities interventions have been found to be effective? Yeah. So I don't think that the context of this question is exercise for the treatment or improvement of chronic or persistent pain states. And for that purpose, I don't think that these individuals have to lift weights. You just don't. Obviously, that's our bias as we like people to do that, but you don't have to. You can get a quival, we have no evidence to suggest that you can get better outcomes from resistance training, lifting weights compared to any other form of exercise for pain related conditions. Of course, as I mentioned, you'll hear people say, oh, you have pain because you're weak, and you need to get strong, and that's why your pain will go away. That's not the case, and that's not how this works. There are so many different levels of changes in the individual, at the individual level from their neurological states, psychological state, biological things that can change over the course of training that might result in an improvement in pain if they resistance trained, but that doesn't mean that the mechanism of pain improvement was an increase in strength. So really, what we aim to do for people who have chronic or persistent pain states is, typically, these people are coming in. There's evidence to suggest that when they come in for consultation, the primary reason is not the pain itself. The reason why they come in for evaluation, for consultation, is because it is preventing them from doing something that they want to be able to do. The pain itself is not usually the reason why they come in. And so our job is to identify, hey, what do you want to be able to do? And so they'll offer whatever that is for them. And then our job is to develop some sort of a physical strategy to work them back towards being able to do what they want to do. That is important above all else for this population. Get them back to doing what they want to do. Once they're at that stage, then we can say, hey, have you heard of these general physical activity guidelines that we like to try to get everybody working towards doing resistance training, doing a row of training, because of all these benefits. But when they're coming in disabled from their persistent pain, that's not really the time to be throwing this other stuff at them. Unless they already want to lift weights, which I would say is likely uncommon. But prevalent in some an hour selected population who come to us. So key number one is definitely finding out what is important to them to be able to do. And then developing a strategy that they can buy into to work towards that. Sometimes, one of our, a friend of mine who I've met to is a clinician in the space he travels around and does seminars on this. His name has been Kormack. He's a funny guy and he is big on a bioscicial approach to exercise prescription for individuals with pain. And he talks about this a lot. And I went to his course and hung out with him and we talked about this stuff a lot. And he demonstrated a lot of his strategies and his approaches to this. He tries to make it not feel like exercise to the individual. He tries to get them to do activities that feel more like play, like actually for adults to like play in the clinic and do certain things that again have some expectancy violation to them that maybe they didn't think that they were able to do. So somebody who has chronic back pain, he would have them maybe, you know, they would get literally like a boosubal or something and they would bend over and grab it and then roll it to him across the floor and then roll it back and forth. Meanwhile, demonstrating to themselves that they can bend over and roll this ball and it's okay. And that's the first step again to getting your foot in the door and finding some method for progression. So sometimes for some people, it's about making it not feel like exercise. Particularly if they're not interested in exercise. But finding out what they want to be able to do and finding out a physical strategy that they can buy into to work towards that. And sometimes, sorry, then core-mic. Oh yeah, core-mic. Yeah, yeah, he's a funny guy. So that's a good resource in terms of exercise prescription for patients with persistent pain. He's a good guy. But definitely have to find out what activities are meaningful to the individual, what matters to them and then how can I help you get there? What kind of things do you think would help you get there? You notice how with our behavior change approaches, we are asking a lot of questions of the individual to elicit this stuff from them rather than top-down saying, oh, you just need to deadly. You know, let's go. No, they don't necessarily need to deadly. And in order to improve their pain, we would like them to in the long term. But everybody needs to deadly. Yeah, eventually that would be nice. But they still don't have. I think Magnuson said that if you cannot deadly life is not worth living. Yeah. Well, it seems like they seem to be a little restricted. Yeah. It's for abuse, little restricted. All right. Does motor control training matter are gross movements greater than smaller more controlled movements, especially in the beginner? IE if someone is struggling with driving the knees out in the squat, do you train with smaller movements, such as clamshells, et cetera? So does motor training matter? Motor control? Motor control? Yeah. Does motor control training matter in isolation? I mean, it can be beneficial, particularly for individuals who are unable to have a sort of framework for contracting a certain set of muscles or moving in a certain way. So for example, somebody, when you say, yeah, yeah, it can squeeze your lower back into extension. And they have no idea how to do that. And you're like, no, no, what's your lower back? Squeeze it. Please. I think, can't do it. So you put your hand on their back. Come on, right against my hand, squeeze there, nothing. So then you put them on the floor, they do some superman's, and they can, you got a lot of flies. You're like pig pen right now. It's not me, bro. It's us. No, no, no. I noticed that there are distinctly on the side. So and you put them on the floor, and they do some superman's. So you put them on a back extension bench, and they get some blood pumped in the area, and then now they can all of some feel that with that area, and they're able to contract it. Well, that's one type of motor control training. I don't think that that is something that we use frequently. Mainly, I think our idea of technique, particularly in the large, the compound movements, is this sort of self resolving type of technique improvement. Meaning that you take somebody who's very new to training, and you try to teach them out of bench press, for example. And you show them all the main pillars of the bench press. And when they're actually benching the bars all over the place, you know, you kind of say, hey, I would do it this way, you know, work on this. But you're not going to hammer it all out on the first session. The second session, they've got some take home homework, cues to work on, it gets a little bit better. Third session, a little bit better, four session, a little bit better, 40-its session. They benched like a seasoned veteran. You got to give them kind of this leeway to practice, experiment, get their cerebellum, say, melt, that's not the way you do it. Nope, that's not the way you do it. Ooh, that's better. And then it's a build this motor pattern, or supplementary motor cortex, which is in your cerebral cortex. But the cerebellum, tell them, that was wrong, do it differently. All right, thank you, motor learning. So I don't think that I would automatically move to a smaller movement in order to correct one of these things, unless it's like this long standing persistent issue that is causing sort of either reduction in performance, or I perceive to be reducing a person's ability participating in recreational or competitive pursuits. But otherwise, if somebody's knee's are caving in on the squat, there's some weight that they can squat and keep their knees out, or I need to adjust the stance, because it's too wide, and they like actually can't, or just their to-put position, or the weight, and usually there's something that I can address there, rather than switching to clam shells. Because I just don't know about the transfer in between clam shells and squats. But to suggest that all motor control training movements are essentially useless for essentially everyone would be a gross overseen, and I don't think that would make that. Yeah, my question here would be to define what motor control training is. All right, so what about superman's for lower back extension? I say that's just a movement, right? I would view the squat as a motor control exercise. Well, you have to be motor control. Sure, I would view the deadlift as a motor control exercise. I would view whatever goal movement you're trying to train towards, just an exercise in motor control to execute said movement. Sure. But there are categorically unique motor control exercises that we can like deploy. Well, that's needed for this kind of thing. Do you think that there's an exercise that requires no motor control? No. That's kind of the point. Kind of the point here, right? And so just reflexive. Yeah. So I don't know that I can't think of a situation really almost never have had to regress to some sort of very, very non-specific movement, like a clam shell or something, to get somebody to be able to squat the way I would like them to squat. And that's not patting myself on the back for like remarkable coach skills. But rather that, again, within our view and model of the significance of technique and things like that, and also recognizing that in the world of motor learning, allowing for greater movement variability, we have pretty clear evidence that allowing for more movement variability can actually improve motor learning. Meaning that if I'm introducing you to a new movement, rigidly restricting you to only be able to move in a particular way, actually makes it take longer for you to learn how to do that and to urge to allowing you to explore different strategies to execute the movement. So allowing for movement variability has been shown to accelerate motor learning. And so I tend to not be super nitpicky on some of this stuff. And in fact, sometimes we had somebody this weekend who I was coaching on a squat, and he had an issue with consistently getting on his toes when he was getting in the bottom. And I was queuing him off his toes, off his toes, and he wouldn't really come off of his toes. And so we had talked about the use of certain movement variations on the squat in order to expose him to alternative ways of executing the squat as potentially a way to acquire new strategies to stay off of his toes, maybe instead of low bar squatting, all the time, introduces a high bar squat, change a few variables in the picture and find new some new strategies to execute this movement. So all of this is an exercise in motor control. I think that, you know, demanding, I would again caution the question asker here, a way from perfectionism, of course. But of course, we also want to acquire the skills to execute these movements. And I think that, you know, it doesn't take a ton of coaching to get people within a reasonable degree of acceptableness that then refines itself on its own. So on my deadlift platform this weekend, had a trainee who was having a lot of just kind of slop and wiggling around during the movement. I told her I said, this is not something that I can really coach, just something that's going to work itself out as you continue to practice this movement. Because the wiggling around is different on every single rep. So it's not like one cue that I can use for this. That's typical. That's like, you know, when you're an infant and you stand up for the first time, you're deciding how to take your first few steps, they all look different, right? As you gain your bearings about, hey, how does the world work? Here you're gaining bearings on how the deadlift works, or how the squat works. So allowing for motor variability in the early stages of motor learning, I think, is actually useful. And another case for using variation a bit earlier, rather than rigidly, prescribing, you know, a single perfect way to move right from day one. Would you say that it increases the learning curve? Or it is. We're not going to go there. I'm just want to say for the record that if you increase the learning curve, it's a deeper, deeper, then you are achieving mastery that you're learning faster. All right, compared to a sustained, we'll agree to disagree. Yeah. They're a grass from PC, Godships, the inventor of DC blocks. Well, one of the theories about DC blocks are very versatile. I mean, I'd be recycled plastics, 100% recycled plastics here in the United States. They're two inches tall, and they're only 10 pounds, the weight in each one, you can stack them up, as high as you want. You can do weight, they're originally, they are designed for weight, lifting exercises, to train high block or little block snatch, pools, and clean and jerk pools. However, you can do all-grain squats with them various plant metrics. Get a giant out of the 101 uses for using blocks. Depth of slip lifts, depsy, dead lifts, locked dead lifts, step ups about going to the... Yeah, they're great. I've definitely, I've done a bunch of pulls off them. I've done use them for splitsquats, and everything else. The best thing is they're much lighter than like a traditional set of jerk blocks. Which, yeah, it's, you can actually move them around your gym. And then where can people find out more about them? You guys have a website at ISEU. First of all, you can find more on it. WDU.dcblocks.usa.com. Now, Derek, take us through, just give us a brief synopsis of your weightlifting history. So we're gonna ask you a weightlifting history question. I want people to know if they're not familiar with you, where you come from and what you've accomplished. I started back with those about 16 years old, I watched a couple of... Where the thing was very big on television, back in the days of what they've seen, why I've watched sports. So, and I played football, and I was very small, but fast. So, like high school, where the program was just for bigger stroke, half squats, dead lifts, bench press, and things like that. That was doing, back then you can find magazines on the grocery store shelves, about where the muscle of fitness, strength and health. Iron man magazine. Right figure, oh, I see these guys put them in the right-s over there. What's this about? Ask my net. If you knew anybody coaching that, it just so happens, the best bread was coaching in Belville at the time. He took me down there, when I was 16, and I had a talk, Ted Frank, taught me the clean and jerk. Dad, I just fell in love with her. That's all I wanted to do, right? That's all I wanted to do. Yeah, and then you've had quite a story career. So you ended up going to Olympics twice. Ninety-dated four, Ninety-dated. Was the Nailup Games, Ninety-dated, I qualified for my junior world championships, and junior Pan America championships got third there. And then several World Championships, a Civil National Championships, and several European and Asian different championships, and Australia, Australia, you're basically like that. Very cool, very cool. Now, so this is important to give people context. So we're going to ask you, how you were around when people were training the press during the heyday, when it was still a contested lift. How did people press so much weight overhead? How did people do this? Well, to be true, I think they did. I did beat the press I've never made a little bit of water. But I started in 76 and then was right after they got rid of the press of 72, however. The guys I drank with were very good. The press and they still did the press. Got it. And so I was always amazed, because my daughter knows that we have a terrible family history. I've become from descendants of T-REFs. Big legs, big butt, big back. But little spiny arms. We can only feed ourselves. We don't like to do push-ups, and you don't like to do presses. Yeah, so what would be, so I was, they taught me a little bit about the press. And when you power clean, you're supposed to catch the parkly with nice posture. Maybe you go for a jumping position to the right to a swap position. feet, which you catch for a nice and high. Well, the Olympic press was a power, essentially a power clean of the tie or split clean. Then you sit, so catch it here. Right from the jerk. You catch it immediately, sit back. Right. That's your position for the press. And that becomes, I don't know if this looks little bit back, so I won't do it just like you're sitting back like this as opposed to here. Then you can throw it to give you the command to press, just like you do, and power the thing. And you put it up. And then you put it back. And then you sit and up. So you're saying that you should catch it while you're laid back. Ideally, that's how you would start the press. The accuracy of the start command for the press is you catch it with just your stand there and then I'm not. Right. If you look at no nonsense, old school, the way that they're on Facebook, you guys really post great videos of people press it. And it becomes, oh, that's pretty apparent, how they just, they can just follow not this and like this. Yep. And then they launch it. From the front, then once you're like you're fine, you're pretty, pretty upright. Because the referee's rational order, then you hit like you're on the stage. Right. Thought it there. And then also, you're not supposed to reinvent your three-pender feet. But how can they see that? You're supposed to have these at least straight. Well, sort of politics got into things you could have a little bit of a knee bit. Oh, maybe they can see that. Maybe they know maybe the soil is blood. The referee doesn't see the disease of America. It doesn't see the soil being guy. Right. And then vice versa, same with Soviet, you know, you America judges. Now it's a disqualified, a Soviet lift or versa, no whole course now. Yeah. Let's really insightful, Derek. Thank you so much for taking the time. Really appreciate it. Thanks for your attention. See you this guy. See the clouds amongst the sun. See the day for everything that could be. Stop training on that smooth button. Run. We are. Open your eyes and see everything it was. And isn't will.

=== FILE: 2019 St. Louis Q⧸A Part II： LBM and Health, Genetics, and Arguing on the Internet! [x9XChHwbnUc].txt ===

Alright, it was stated that intermittent fasting has little to no long-term health benefits. I thought that it has been confirmed to improve insulin and proof sensitivity to insulin and the problem of insulin resistance is a big topic. So I was surprised to hear that intermittent fasting wasn't more accepted this weekend. So what I said was that there are no unique benefits to intermittent fasting over any other type of diet that's matched for calories or weight loss purposes for weight loss purposes for at which extends to things like insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, etc. There are no unique health benefits associated with intermittent fasting over the same type of diet or the different type of diet with the same amount of calories. Suggesting that there's nothing uniquely beneficial to intermittent fasting. Now the people on the internet will say, but you are telomeres or you're growth hormone or you're this or you're that. And it's like that's great idea. Okay, I'm glad that you read it physiology textbook. That's great. Where the citation suggesting is actually moves the needle forward with respect to human health because we don't have those studies right now. The latest two meta-analysis, one came out in 2019, one came out in 2018, suggests that there's no benefit for weight loss and no objective health benefit that's unique to intermittent fasting. It doesn't mean that intermittent fasting is bad. If that's your jam, if you're like, look man, I get up, have coffee, roll out the door, go to work, don't eat till lunch and then I eat until 9 p.m. and then I stop eating again and that allows me to be adherent with the correct calorie level, hit my 10 servings of fruit and vegetables per day, hit my fiber goal, maintain enough lean body mass that concourse with long-term health outcomes, train appropriately live, unactive and fulfilling life. Then, woo, rocked on. On the other hand, suggesting that more individuals switch to an intermittent fasting diet to achieve those goals is not incorrect too. If it is, in fact, you're a bag baby, like switch, or continue. But if it's not, there's no unique benefits there either. So I'm not against intermittent fasting anymore that I'm in support of intermittent fasting. That makes sense? All right. All right. We will find out. I'll be curious to see what comes to this chrono nutrition stuff. I agree. As of now, I've been a reason to recommend it over anything else. Sure, yeah. I like Boston Powers reference. Are you welcome? Austin, speed of Austin Powers, discussed the processes, the processes of primary and secondary pain sensitization of an area to an acute injury. Is there any evidence that secondary stress, process, persist, well after the injury is healed, and is there any tendency for the secondary process to de-localize? I.e. lead to increased pain response in areas other than where the original injury occurred. Yep. That's exactly what happens. So the question here is about secondary or central sensitization, which is somewhat of a poorly understood process, but in general, remember I described how acute sudden injuries tend to heal in a matter of days to weeks. But this process of sensitization, both at the tissue level and in the nervous system, the secondary sensitization process, begins at the time of an injury. Now in some people, this sensitization resolves as the injury heals and you go back to normal and you have no residual effects. In some other people, the local sensitivate sensitization improves, resolves, but the secondary sensitization persists or even worsens over time. So their nervous system gets kind of ramped up, gets into a wired up state where they're generally more sensitive. And the hallmarks of this are two phenomena, one called aladinia, which refers to when you have pain and response to non-noxious stimuli, meaning that things that are not normally painful are now painful to you. And another would be hyper-algizia. Hyper-algizia was described as a situation where things that are typically painful are more painful than they would otherwise be. And it's not just restricted to the local area of the initial insult to the initial injury, or more pain, more tender everywhere. So those are hallmarks of secondary or central sensitization. What we don't know is why this happens to some people and not others, why this progression tends to happen. We also don't have very clear mechanisms of resolving it outside of what we typically do to treat individuals who have chronic persistent pain through education, exercise, and working the back-to-normal function, somehow, some magic happens, and people can kind of ramp back down over time. But it is a relatively poorly understood process. There's tons of research going into this research in the level of the spinal cord, or at the level of the brain, and pharmacology research, and psychology research. I think that as of now, if I had an individual who had a sudden new onset pain, an assessment of their pain self-efficacy, and there's a validated questionnaire for this for pain self-efficacy. If I could assess that right off the bat, that's going to be probably my misch predictor of their likelihood to progressing to chronic pain, or a persistent pain state. And so that's the main thing that I'd be working on is trying to beef that up and get them engaging in activity and addressing their thoughts and fears and beliefs and things like that. But I don't have any medications that can prevent this. I don't have any surgeries or injections that can fix this. I don't have anything else. It's a really bizarre process. And eventually maybe in a few years or a few decades, if we're still doing this, seven-harrin, we're talking about some of the things that they should have a better idea of what's going on then. But yeah. Uh, Jordan, that's me. Yeah. Do you say Panera or Breadco? I say neither because we don't have those in San Diego. No, I say St. Louis Breadco to anyone who listen to me because... Yeah. I'm representing, yeah, I'm six, three, six. I'm from the county. All right? What? A little more in a race to St. Louis, I was here for 24, 25 years in my life. I love this place. I introduce these folks to Square Bionca pair, Emos Pisa. So these jokers did not believe me when I ordered this. So the record I ordered three X-Law to pieces, one Law to pieces, the three X-Law to the brooding, one Law to pieces, because often has peculiar tastes and pizza. I'm just wondering if you get them. But here's the thing, these are practicing pizzas right in. All of us are going to eat the substantial amount man. The worst thing is you run out of pizza. So, not in my watch. I'm gonna get ahead and guess your score, but... Thank you. Is it five stars? Yeah. So most people either hate it or love it. It's very polarizing. Polarizing pizza, Austin, what do you think? It's acceptable? All right. All right. So I'm happy to report that all of them said that it was great pizza, which is not the typical response. Because people have different expectations, but I think what it is is I inculcated their subconsciousness. I was like, hey, look, you set certain expectations. I did set it. It's like cracker thin. We have Provel Cheese. Here's what Provel Cheese is. It's got careaway seeds on there. This is great. It's my favorite. You're got a like it. I bet you're got a like it aren't you. People see photos. I did. I did. No, it was great. So I say something was bread companies from here. Love this place. But I will say this. Living San Diego is awesome. Okay. So yeah. All right. In Austin's sarcopenia lecture, he made the point that he wouldn't be as worried about a 75-year-old Jack dude who presented with the flu, but would be worried more about a 74-year-old who just lost a bunch of lean body mass. What does the mechanism by which increased levels of lean body mass protect the older people against things like flu or pneumonia? Can I just say that you're not sane? You're not sane necessarily. They protect them from the actual infectious ideology. You're insane. And what you did say they protect them from a bad outcome. Secondary to that infectious. Sure. 80-ology. Yeah. The best way to prevent that stuff is to get your immunizations. But you know, like vaccines. But you know, big vaccine is so, you know, paying us hand some leave. I'll expect that check. You know, from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Big newme of X. That's how I threw. You imagine? I'm getting prevenor and newme of X chicks. Yeah. All right. So the mechanisms of frailty of sarcopeneal of caceccia, all these kind of categories of a decrease in lean body mass, or really complicated, has to do with inflammatory processes, immune processes, endocrine hormone related processes, processes related to your kind of your energy, metabolic status. So there's a tons of things that when sarcopenec, sarcopenec, it can be a reflection of those bad things going on, meaning it can be a proxy or a surrogate marker of a whole bunch of bad stuff going on underneath. Then reflects an increased risk for bad things happening. But in addition to that, remember how I mentioned that lean body mass, particular muscle mass, is a storage site for immunosens. And that serves as a reservoir for these immunosens in periods of high stress, of fasting, of illness, things like that for your critical organs that actually need these immunosens, we're able to do their normal functions, do what they need to do. So it's a two-pronged thing. One is that the sarcopeneal reflects all these other bad things going on under the hood that leave you more susceptible to complications from these things, whether it's to flu, pneumonia, or even increased risk of like post-operative complications, if you're to undergo surgery or something like that. So if I admit an 85-year-old person to the hospital and somebody's suggesting that they need to undergo surgery, I'm like, they're pretty high risk of having some complications likely of dying from this, from undergoing this surgery because of bad things happening because of all this other evidence that I have to suggest that. But also if they're sarcopeneic, they have low lean body mass, low skeletal muscle mass. They have relatively little physical, what we call a physiologic reserve. This reserve that under periods of stress, they cannot tolerate it as well, and they're at risk of various complications. Whether that be a cardiovascular complication or they go in a renal failure, they have. Some other horrible complication that can ultimately result in worse things happening or end or death. But unfortunately I see this nearly every day because in most of the patients that I see are frail and some fashion, whether they're cakedic or sarcopeneic obese or they're just sarcopeneic on its own. And all these things are just increased risk for bad things happening. So that means that when I'm doing things two people act to be very cautious about what I'm doing, particularly to these older people that I see most of the time. So if I have somebody who's really enthusiastic about some interventions, I'm going to say, hey, let's re, you know, rein in the excitement about doing this thing to this person, because there are some significant risks that we could call some harm here, right? And we have to be cognizant of that, particularly because they're thin and frail and weak. Maybe if they really need this, maybe we can get them to a better nutritional status, better strength. State before we do this, if it's more of an elective thing, if it's an emergency, you do what you got to do, or you figure out how necessary it is for them. They're current situation. But one really cool thing that I think it's overlooked with respect to muscle mass is that when you train it and you engage it in like heart efforts on a regular basis, it actually releases hormones that act locally and also systemically to do really awesome things like decrease inflammation, decrease pain, for example, improve immunological function, etc. They're called myocines, these little muscle derived hormones, and they do a bunch of really awesome things. And failure to actually use your musculoskeletal system to do to engage in regular, you know, vigorous physical activity, I think, is one of the big big problems. I mean, it is, in fact, one of the big big problems of modern society. And it's funny, we did last night we recorded this little segment called this or that, where people asked us questions, it was this or that. And so one of the questions was like, would you rather all doctors know about the physical activity guidelines, specifically recommend resistance training, or would you recommend that all doctors know about the nutrition nutrition guidelines and recommend those? And we're like, unanimously, physical activity guidelines. So we think it's a bigger, bigger biological level to pull. And so if you want to help your parents, your grandparents, family members, other family friends, etc. Age gracefully have a good high quality life, get them to train, get them to train, take them to the gym with you. Okay. Three more questions left. One of three. You are both very specific with your language. Does this stem from med school, legal ramifications in business, or have you both always been like that? Definitely haven't been like that. Yeah, so I don't, not necessarily legal ramifications either. I don't think either of us have this like preconceived thought we're like, this could get me in trouble. Haven't been sued a whole bunch. But I think we're both very clear on the extent of how confident we can be in saying certain things. And we want to say things that are, you know, as clear as possible and as accessible as possible and stated in a way that's also true. So we have to say them in a way that is very carefully selected. And so neither of us wants to be wrong and neither of us wants to be misunderstood. So we try to use very careful wording to accomplish all of those tasks and be succinct. Wait, even though I fail miserably. Yeah, you do. This is succinctness, yeah. It's fine. You leave out the nuance. That's why I edit your stuff. By bringing the nuance. You leave out the nuance. And I got to bring, yeah. Yeah, I agree. I'm not a ton to add. I mean, I think it's just, I would, the things that I say, the claims that I make out, pretty be able to defend and not necessarily in a legal sense, but I'd like to be able to support what I say. And that means that I can only go so far as what I'm able to defend. If, you know, I'm not a fan of just making shit up, which a lot of people are fans of making shit up. That's easier. It's certainly easier. Do you want, you know, especially if you can just ignore block whatever people who can you imagine what we could do. We could do so much if we just decided to make stuff up. Yeah, say things very confidently because the public prefers concrete answers. Yeah. Right. And then we just, we're doctors. So yeah. Also, like, super strong. So check that. Modern, it was wrong. Well, yes. Yes, right. And the grand scheme of things moderately strong, unoppressive. Also, it's powerlifting to one cares. But yeah. We could do a lot with that. And it would be so much faster and easier to do. Yeah, we wouldn't have to read anything. You just say things. Yeah. All your pains from intentions. I can fix them. Yeah. Pay me. Sure. The reason why you're not your training, you know, is not going well. It's because you're not following my nutrition plan. My top secret, you know, gains, you know, master 3000 nutrition plan. You have to sign up for my eight week course and tomorrow. All right. Second last question. You are both big on saying that if you read something online that is demonstrably false or an accurate experience, just move on with your life and not engage. Have you always been this wise or was this learned from experience? It's definitely learned from experience. And probably for me. Yes. I like it. I like argue with these idiots because it's fun. It's just fun to see the mental masturbation that they have to do to maintain their own personality. Right. Like they are their personal view of themselves. It's like they have to go through all these hoops just to maintain, confirm their own previous view of themselves of the world. And it's like you have no expertise in this. All right. But I just to watch people squirm. It's so much fun for me. But here's the old one. So I'm like, you're the question said. I do it less. I do it less. But because I only engage in ones that I think that. The question said why don't you do that. Yeah. So here's why it's awesome. It's different. Yeah. Right. Oh, the difference is between us. Yes. But when I engage, it's only in a situation that's either highly public where everybody's going to see. And I think that I'm going to get some social experience out of the deal. Or that I control the playing field. Meaning you can't delete your thread. For example, or I could just block you or kick you out of the group. If you start being very, very aggressive and breaking the rules of the group. That being said in the last week, I've dealt with anti-vaxxers. I've dealt with lipid, cardiovascular health deniers. I've dealt with people suggesting that barbell training is dangerous. And particularly for the back and the joints just bad under joints. And also people that said that I wasn't doing enough for the vegan community because you owe it to them. And you know, so yeah, I've been in some arguments recently. But I think the reason why I engage in less of these now is because I've been just sucked in and wasted so much time. And ultimately it doesn't matter because nobody else is reading these things. Nobody is talking at a level where you're going to understand the other person's point of view. You're going to change the opinion. And then it's just one person. One person who if they have that much time to engage with you, it's just not important. Just let them go on living their life too. Yeah. Yeah. My indifference in these matters knows no bounds. Yeah. So I am a big fan of doing no harm and helping people who want to be helped. Sure. And so I tend to not get sucked into these things or if somebody tags me in one of these stupid posts and is like thoughts. Yeah. We don't respond to those. I don't really have thoughts until we're blocked. Yeah. Right. We found out we were blocked by the functional patterns guy, which is unsurprising. Yeah. If you've blocked us on social media like your accounts trash. That's 100% correlation. A lot of this has come from just the things that I've learned about social psychology. Yeah. And stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. So I believe belief change and stuff like that. But likelihood that I'm going to actually change somebody's mind is vanishingly small. And the impact that that would have is similarly vanishingly small. So I just don't bother because I have bigger places where I could put my time efforts and generate better outcomes. So yeah. I just don't care enough to deal with these people. Yeah. It's interesting knowing all the traps psychology stuff and social psychology things. I think it does actually make us a little more amenable to change because we're like consciously trying to not be that way. Yes. And all sorts of having insight. Yeah. I mean like you're doing that thing again with the stuff. Yeah. So if you don't listen to the you are not so smart podcast, I would recommend listening to as many episodes of it as you can so that you can recognize how you're being stupid and consciously try to not be stupid. You got to see your blind on blind spots. Yeah. Sometimes you have a spouse for that. Big fan of that. Podcast. I prefer podcasts. Fine. All right. To each thorough. A. Yeah. Last question. When discussing non-modifiable things like genetics is there a percentage or way to measure just how much of your genetics are responsible for in terms of training outcomes. Can you ever truly overcome something that is genetic? Example someone with a tendency to carry excess abdominal weight will they ever have a six pack. So is there a way for you to measure this? No. We have rough estimates of like how much of certain different training outcomes are related to genetics. So for instance we think like strength high-perch fee outcomes like 50% weight at related outcomes higher than that. Some some people will say up to 70% but we're still trying to parse that out. But you can't measure it. Can't like take a blood test and be like actually you're at 65% yeah. So we don't know that. Even if you had a full on like genome sequencing of your own genome. So we can't really tell you. And then can you ever truly overcome something that is genetic? There are some things yes through heroic measures or ultimately a change behavioral changes that are in line with that goal. For instance losing body fat. Yeah. You could have a person who was born to overweight parents has been overweight their whole life. You know who ultimately achieves a loan of body fat to have visible six pack. And they could maintain that for the rest of their life. I could happen. It's certainly not the norm but the RPU will be high. Yeah. It could be high for a period of time. But it's a positive change. Sure. On the other hand things like a person who's got a 16 inch vertical jump who wants to turn that into a 35 inch vertical jump. You mean like you? Yeah. Yeah. It's not going to happen. But you could still lift a lot of weight. Yeah. That's true. That's right. So it just depends on some things have a little bit more ability. The greater ability to be modified. Then other things. Things like height for instance. If you want to play in the NBA and that's your outcome that you're really getting gun and for about your five foot five. You know. Unlikely to happen in the cards. You know, you could be mugsy bugs. The next, you know, the second coming. Yes. But it seems unlikely. Yeah. There are no pigneys that have ever made. And it made it to the NBA. They got a plastic door. Yeah. Yeah. On the other hand, if you're seven foot tall and between the ages of 25 and 45, you're probably in the NBA. You have a one and five chance of actively being in the NBA right. So if you know somebody's a true son, butter debt. Yeah. The only thing I would add to this is the first part of the question. Is there any way to measure it through testing? And there we go. Testing. It comes up once again. Here we go. Should you get tested? Do you want to know? And very often the answer is no. You don't want to know. So I put out some recommendations in terms of the things that we recommend prioritized for health purposes. The tests you should or shouldn't yet. Things like that. There's a really interesting paper I reviewed it for our first research review. They had to do with genetic testing. And what they did was they performed a bunch of genetic testing on these individuals in two reports of individuals. And the first cohort, they did some genetic testing related to their genes as they try and remember that the outcomes. One had to do with like their aerobic kind of predisposition for aerobic performance. And the other one, they were testing for a particular gene, the FTO gene that has something to do with satiety after a meal. So they did testing on these individuals. And what they did, the clever part of the experiment was when they delivered the results of the testing to these individuals. They randomized the results that they got to either the true result or they made up the, not the made up of the gave them the alternative. And then they did some repeat testing on these individuals. So for example, in the individuals with respect to the aerobic performing performance, gene that they tested, they were either told that they had the gene that would improve their performance or decrease their performance. And then they were randomized in terms of the results to either be told that they had the good gene that would improve your performance or the one that would decrease it. And then when they got the FTO gene tested that had to do with satiety, how full you get after a meal, they were randomized to be told. You have the version of the gene that will make you super full after a meal, make it super easy to, you know, be full and lose weight and things like that. Or to be told that they had the other version where they wouldn't have that. And in fact, it was glucagon, was the hormone I think, right? Well, they measured growling, G has one example. And they measured GLP one and they measured growling as outcome measures of their satiety. And in fact, what they found was that the hormone measures after a standardized meal, they gave them a standardized meal and measured how full these individuals got. And the level of the satiety hormones, the fullness that they experienced, was in line with what they were told their genetics were not what their actual genes would have predicted. Super weird. One of the coolest studies I've ever seen. And suggesting that knowing learning about your genetics can influence your actual physiology in the situation. So that would lead me to, yes, in this situation, how much your genetics are responsible for in terms of training outcomes. Can you ever truly overcome something that is genetic? If you were to go and get your genetics tested and they said, however they would determine this, your genes suggest that you will never squat more than 2.25. Your genes suggest that you will never get below 20% body fat. How much that would then influence what ultimately becomes reality for you? From a no-cibo standpoint. There is a substantial potential for harm there. I recognize there is a potential for benefit. Somehow, I guess if it tells you that you have a genetic predisposition to be superjacked, but that seems unlikely. So actually starting genetic testing. So what we'll do. You've got to submit my resignation to my medicine. No no, so you're not necessary. Testing. You send us a saliva sample and all of the results that go out is you're going to be superjacked. Super lean. Yeah, super self-efficacy. Yes, yes. I'm going to bore with that. Yeah, it's just placebo everybody. That's right. So we'll see about testing again. I caution everybody. I don't know how many more times I'm going to end up talking about this. Probably for the rest of my career. Caution people against testing that is not indicated. Because sometimes you don't want to know. Sometimes you don't want to know. Yeah, but anything is good old Leah back there. The longest time was like, I'm not a genetic outlier. I'm not a freak. And I was like, you've been to IPF worlds, the highest level competition after not really a long time of training. I think by definition, the U.R. outlier, she goes, I'm not. I'm going to get genetic test. Prove you wrong. And there's a particular gene, a CTN3, which if you have two copies of that, means that you're like super fast-twitch. You're supposed to be the powerlifter or the sprinter, you know, that's your jam. And lo and behold, who comes back, homozygous for ACT and 3. Lealance. Maybe I do have a genetic leg up on the competition. Yeah, so are you sure? Of course you do. You're going to hear a set of back to the non-leg. She does sound like that. Yeah. Yeah. How else? There's a way to win a eye next to another way. You can talk to you for a minute. So that's fine. Yeah. That's not getting tested. What does it matter? Well, how would it change what you do? Yeah. The only thing to do is hurt you. Yeah. So we have, I recently put up a post about my top recommendations for things that matter from a health standpoint. Yeah. It came to testing. I think there are relatively few things that we recommend, and they tend to be demographic or individual specific. Yeah. So there's a resource. I primarily direct this to clinicians to our medical students who are here. Go to the AHRQ agency for healthcare research and quality. They're EPSS tool, electronic preventive services, something, selectors and something like that. And you can put in your patients' demographics. Their sex age. They're smoking history. And whether they're sexually active or not. And that can tell you the screening recommendations that you would recommend for the individual. Greated by level of evidence according to the USPSTF, US preventive services task force, level A, level B, level C, whatever. Based on how confident we are from the evidence that this is a screening test that you should perform, whether there's evidence against it, or whether it's indeterminate. It was relatively few. The things that we can say for the overwhelming majority of people is a blood pressure check. Yeah. Right. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. Waste of the way. You should serve an example, be prepared tonight for the financial success list before going. food allergy testing, generally don't recommend it. What about vitamin deficiency testing? Nope. Also don't recommend it. What about reverse T3? Don't get that done. Ever. What about my hormones? That's not a thing. Oh, what about gut health testing? Also not a thing. Okay, I think we've rented them. Yeah. So there. So if an individual, again, to echo what I described in the testosterone lecture, if there are signs, symptoms, reasons to pursue certain testing as a diagnostic process, then sure that makes a ton of sense. I would have tests all the time because I admit patients in the hospital who have signs, symptoms, or complaints that would suggest a certain pathology that I need to be looking for to diagnose. But a lot of people say, oh, I just want to get all the tests done just to know where I'm at. Right? I just want to get a total of no. Yeah, I just want to know. I just want to know. I just want to just do all the things for me. And like, you probably don't actually want that. Yeah. Right. It could lead to a whole bunch of unnecessary subsequent testing, subsequent procedures, subsequent interventions, or psychological harm that you're best off, just live your life. Just right? It's a nice way. It's a nice way that would. You don't need to know. We did it. Did it. Thank you guys so much for coming out. I'm going to great.

Welcome back to Barbell Medicine YouTube channel, where we bring modern medicine this is Dr. Jordan Fagmum, Dr. Austin Barraki. He's the second most handsome doctor in the world. We're in San Diego. Thank you guys so much for joining us. This is a question and answer session. Thank you so much for coming. If you have to leave, we understand. And if we don't get to your question, you should post it on the forum. It's at forum.barbellmedicine.com. Also, if it doesn't get approved there because it is moderated for him, you should first try Austin, his DMs, direct messages, he's very responsive. He doesn't respond and I would move to Tom, Tom's also, again, great with DMs. Then slide into Lee as DMs. And if none of those work, then we recommend following a different fitness outlet for your questions. Good. We just can't be bothered. So, we're going to get into these questions. Question number one, if an elderly individual who is at a healthy weight, but under a muscle starts resistance training, should they be eating a caloric surplus to build muscle, given that they are eating enough protein? Uh, well, okay. This is a good question. In general, I don't know that I recommend anybody for weight gain, unless they want to. So, if their personal preference is, I'd like to gain weight for whatever reason. Either strength is the most important thing to them, and they have a, they have their room to grow. That's fine. If they want to gain more muscle mass, just for their own accord, that's fine. But just for like reducing the potential of bad health outcomes from happening, you can do that without gaining a substantial amount of body weight. And a person new to resistance training is has a high likelihood of building a lot of lean body mass without increasing their body weight. We see that all the time in individuals with obesity. They simultaneously reduce their waste or comfort and body fat, while increasing their lean body mass. And in particular, I don't know that gaining a bunch of weight at an elderly age is likely to be a great idea. Just because if they're already in a healthy, healthy weight as is kind of a qualifier in the question, I mean, I see a lot of elderly folks who are extremely underweight. It's not often that I see individuals who are like have made it into their 80s with morbid obesity. Oftentimes they don't, they get kind of selected out a little bit earlier than that for through various mechanisms, things that we've talked about this weekend, the medical conditions that can arise. So oftentimes the people who make it that far tend to be pretty thin and frail on the other end of this spectrum. And those situations, then getting adequate nutrition and putting them into a calorie surplus if we can, does become a priority. But if somebody is already at a healthy weight, then I would just lean on getting them to train rather than worrying about getting them in a calorie surplus. But you know what the internet's going to say. What? Don't you know that in elderly population that class 1,0,B3 has the lowest all-cosm mortality rates? How do you explain that? The question is saying that they're at a healthy weight. So then I would ask how we're defining healthy weight here. Sure. Well, what I'm getting is that. It's that explanation. It basically ignores, again, a few things that Dr. Baraki said. So individuals who tend to carry a lot of excess adipose tissue tend to be a lot of tissue tend to get filtered out when we get to that elderly population. So they tend to not make it that far. And those who do, then obviously there's a survivor bias there. And in addition, once you become elderly having a low BMI, so like in normal or particularly underweight represents either chronic illness or increase in frailty. And so both of those things, portend bad outcomes. We wouldn't necessarily want somebody who's got a normal BMI or slightly in the lower realms of the overweight BMI range to necessarily say, I got to get my BMI to over 30 because that's going to reduce my risk of premature mortality or reduce disease burden. Yep. All right. See, if we took on the internet. There you go. Boom. What is something you wish you better prepared for during medical school? Like, are we restricting this to just academic topics? Open-ended. I don't know. Like, potentially interesting. Yeah. I actually had a pretty unique path into medical school. It's like I was the worst applicant with respect to getting into med school. So when I applied the average GPA for people getting in, to med school is 3.6. Average Mcat was 31. Right. I had a 2.9 GPA and a 31 on the Mcat. So acceptable Mcat terrible GPA. So I went to, I got a master's degree, right, to shore up my resume. The problem is most medical schools don't care about your masters because they don't know how rigorous your master's was unless they have a similar program at their school. So in any event, I'd just scramble just to get into a medical school. I almost didn't make it. In any event, what I would, what I learned during my master's program was how to study. So for me, I learned that like space repetition learning. So again, just seeing stuff on a regular basis, things that I was more familiar with, seeing less often, but still reminding myself, seeing stuff I was less familiar with, more frequently, and asking myself questions about those topics really helped me learn this stuff. But I learned how to study during my master's program. A lot of my colleagues that I went to medical school with had problems learning because they had taken that leap from undergrad to medical school yet. And so they spent a lot of excess time trying to figure out how to study. So if I was making a recommendation for people like what you need to do before medical school, my only recommendation to you is to learn how to study for yourself. You don't need to read all these medical textbooks or like, you know, try to take these classes and undergrad so you get a leg up because it's not a leg up. It's totally different. But you need to learn how to study. Take a developed good study habits. So for me, personally, what would I have done differently? I would have actually gone to Norfolk and picked out a living situation that was a little bit better. So I looked in that retirement home thing, just the leg towers. Which was fine because it was real quiet, you know, because retirement. But the problem was they whenever they got rain, the whole parking lot just completely flooded. So I just got in this new car, right? I felt like I was on top of the world. And we got this Norreaster, which I don't know what that is because I'm from the Midwest. We have tornadoes and floods, but when they say noreaster, I'm like, I don't know Easter egg and whatever. It's like the, it's a party. I parked my car in this, you know, surprisingly barren parking lot. Nobody was around me. I was like, oh man, I got a sweet parking spot and everybody's, there's nobody's here. Interesting. There was no standing water in the parking lot, but it was raining. And then I come out two and a half hours later, the water, no joke is up to my side view mirror. Yeah. So then I'm totally in the car. So I wish that I would have known one like, let's go not live in retirement homes. I've been living in my social, you know, sort of circle for a year. And then I also would have like not apart to my car there on that particular day. Regrets. Regrets. Yeah. Yes. I have them. Yeah. My trajectory into medical school was very different. And I did know how to study before I got there. And that set me up for a different experience along the way. I'll take a different spin on this, I guess. Better prepared for during medical school with something I wish I had learned. Maybe a bit more effectively over the course of medical school is a lot of the messages that we deliver to you guys this weekend. Particularly a lot of the stuff about the behavior change and how to talk to people and how to make it happen and how important of a skill it is to be able to have these difficult conversations. Because, you know, I teach residents and medical students on a daily basis on in the hospital. When I do feedback with them at the end of their rotations, you know, I always tell them like anybody can teach you the medicine here. Anybody can teach you how the kidneys work or how the heart pumps and stuff like that. But I think far fewer people are going to teach you how to have these conversations with people, how to have these, you know, illicit the information you need, how to provide the reassurance that people who are in a sick, you know, frail vulnerable situation need to hear. And so that's something that I had to learn partially. I mean, we got some exposure to that kind of stuff. But I in retrospect know that it was not as much as we actually need. And I think that the emphasis is obviously you have to learn a lot of detail physiology by chemistry a lot of stuff like that. But I think the degree to which being able to have these like social skills is important as being a doctor at the bedside with a patient. I don't think it receives as much emphasis as it deserves in pre-clinical education. And so that's something I wish I would have gotten more of, I think. Yeah, to their credit, they did do a substantial amount of pain. Yeah, we're just too stupid. Yeah, I just think it needs to be even more. Yeah, we're just too dumb. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. As long as we agree that we're dumb. Everybody stupid. Alright, including us. Question number three, the notes refer to more than two standard drinks of alcohol as a risk factor for high blood pressure. That's true. Could you please clarify what you mean by a standard drink? Yes, this is, there's a wide variety between different countries. Do you actually printed this out? So effectively in the US, we're talking like 14 grams of pure alcohol, which I know that you guys are, carrying your scales when you have to the bar. Yeah, we're carrying measuring grams. Yeah, but in other countries, it's 10 grams. US and general, we talk about this like one beer, 12 ounce beer, or one glass of wine, but again, how big is your glass? So that's problematic. It's five ounces on average and then one and a half ounces of like a hard alcohol. That's a standard drink in the United States. Assuming it's 80 proof. Because you'll have more grams of alcohol on a higher proof spirit. So like, if I, this is about 60 proof, I think. All right. That's, or no, not 60%. That's 10%. Yeah, so it's 120. Yeah. So more grams of alcohol. Are you sure math isn't the thing that you wanted to learn to learn. Yes. All right. Suggestions for isometric core work. I've seen Planks mentioned in your content, but try steps seem to be the limit on those for me. Oh, yeah, I see. So if you're having, so the reason, I guess I'll start over. The reason why I prefer isometric sort of ab direct ab training. If you're going to do it for strength training purposes, that's really their kind of role in the big for that we tend to get asked. The most questions about also this is barbell medicine, not like functional fitness medicine. Kettle bill medicine is also taken. So like we have to like form our niche somewhere. So it's barbell medicine. So in general, the role of the ab's during those movement tend to be isometric. So I like Planks. I like pal off presses. I like ab wheel roll out. See there from kneeling ab wheel roll out. So if you can do them from your toes, that's cool. I also like sort of v-sit progressions. L-l-sit progressions are usually beyond most individuals. But so I think most folks can do Planks. You can't do those. Then the pal off presses tend to be pretty pretty good. And I know it's about a home sitting on a couch saying Planks. I don't need a plank. Doesn't do anything. I'll just low bar backs, squat my way to top tier high level, a dominal strength. Well guy at home. The recent research on this suggests that a plank in a six Rm backsquat have about the same amount of abdominal activation. Which means that a plank is like pretty good because it's not the same level of fatigue that you get from a six Rm squat. Right, six at RP-10 would be substantially fatiguing set for most individuals compared to just doing a 30 second plank. So I'm not saying that you should do Planks instead of squats, but in addition to, be fine. The other hand, if you said, I don't want to do any additional direct ab training because I find it boring and whatever. That's fine too. Who would say something? Austin does a yearly GP-P session. He's just living off previously developed cardiovascular fitness from swimming. And at some point he'll do it. It'll be by yearly and then you'll just keep titan-titraining it up. Yeah, I mean you're free to edit this out, but yeah, I don't do ab work. Yeah. I'm fine with this, buddy. Yeah, that's fine. I think though if people are asking about it, I'm happy with you doing more physical activity and I want it to be the correct fatigue stimulus to fatigue ratios. That's fair. I... Is non-HDL cholesterol in the 20 to 40 range still considered okay for someone on statins? Yep. That's a question. No. So that assuming that they may have 20 to 40 milligrams per desoliter, I'm wondering if the question is phrase this way because that's a very low level for a non-HDL cholesterol level. And so a lot of times there's concerns about can these numbers get too low? There's a lot of fear out there about pushing these numbers too low being associated with cognitive issues. That's been studied and hasn't really been shown convincingly, theoretically about risk for hemorrhage extroke. Also been studied not really shown super convincingly. And then a number of other outcomes such that now the argument or the idea has been that in general lower is better. And we don't see a threshold where pushing these not these blood lipid numbers, particularly the blood lipids that tend to be associated with cardiovascular disease, pushing them lower increases risk. So in general, lower is fine that doesn't necessarily concern me. What I would say though is that if somebody's levels are that low, my question is why are they on the medication? Because if they're on the medicine because they've had a bunch of heart attacks before, then I'm like, cool, okay, that makes sense. I want to push them as low as possible because they're super high risk because they've had heart attacks and strokes before. If they've never had heart attack or a stroke before and they're on one of these medicines for what we call primary prevention, preventing one of these if we're reducing the risk of these events, I should say, when they've never had one before. Maybe they'd already be below that target threshold without the medicine in which case I'm wondering do they actually need it. So I'm fine with pushing these numbers that low in somebody who's very high risk. If they're not super super high risk, then like, they're below 130 on that non HDL, then I'm not worried about it unless they have other reasons to have really high risk. Like they're smokers, diabetics, high blood pressure, things like that that would alter my decision making. How much did a Pfizer pay you to say that? Just the shielding for statins, right? Yeah, right. Speaking of statins and cholesterol and other other fun stuff, red meat, chicken, fish, are all frequently cited when discussing diet. What about pork or other poultry? Yeah, what about them? This is a kosher establishment, okay? We don't talk about pork. No. So in general, with respect to red meat, so we're talking about pork, veal, obviously beef. There's actually a pretty expanded topic that includes our expanded category that all includes those foods and others if for red meat. With respect to chicken, fish, other lean protein sources, I'm cool with all of them. There's not really a lean protein source that I'm not like willing to give you the thumbs up on. My, the caveat that I'll give you is that for red meat, which again includes this sort of veal, beef, pork, awful, is it awful? Well, I am sure. Yeah, whatever. All that stuff, I would recommend limiting that to three times per week, just based on the current guidelines for red meat intake. And we discussed that thoroughly in the article, the signs of red meat intake. So effectively, it'd be difficult to eat more red meat than that, more often. And also stay out of that 10% of total daily calories from saturated fat, recommendation that we think is actually important. Okay, and if you want more information on that, read the signs of red meat intake article, we go into the, into the weeds there on that stuff. Anything else? I don't think so. What's your favorite protein? It's favorite. I mean, there's only one answer. What do you want me to say chicken? No, that's for all the answer. I'd stay. Yeah. Yeah. So mine's bacon. Okay. This is not a coach. What is the mechanism for the inflammatory process and autoimmune diseases contributing to muscle protein breakdown? Do you have references? Always. Would reducing inflammation first have increased the metabolic impact? Reducing inflammation before wood? Not sure about the last part. The question has to do with the inflammation, the real inflammation, as I said, that's present in autoimmune conditions. Why does it contribute to muscle protein breakdown? What is the mechanism for muscle protein? So, what do you want to do with the muscle protein? The mechanism has to do with these chemicals that are called inflammatory cytokines. It's a fancy word describing inflammatory signaling molecules that circulate around in the blood. They're at elevated levels and almost all of these inflammatory conditions, both autoimmune disease as well as cancer as well as a bunch of other things. And at the end stage of this inflammatory process, you can get to this point that where somebody might be called cachecca. If you have a cachecca, you have a lot of body mass and you have lost a lot of fat mass. And I see that frequently in patients who have been chronically very ill from one of these conditions. They're just skin and bones, no lean body mass and no fat mass. Super high risk situation. Those are patients again who I mentioned having that low lean body mass low functional status. Even if they might not even be deemed eligible for treatment because they're too weak and frail and risk for having really bad outcomes. The treatment is more likely to kill you sooner than the condition itself. So it's these circulating inflammatory molecules. One example for the biochemistry folks is like a TNF alpha and some of the interlucin molecules. As far as references, I give a lecture on this topic signaling, molecular signaling with muscle protein synthesis and breakdown. In the past, one of the best papers that I referenced on it was called molecular networks in skeletal muscle plasticity. So it's written by Hopler and his colleagues, or you can just Google anything about Kixia and inflammation. CACHEXIA and that's an inflammation and you'll basically go down that rabbit hole of why chronic systemic inflammation can contribute to muscle protein breakdown. You can see how these signaling molecules directly block anabolic signaling and they contribute to atrophy. So they block building and they promote atrophy which is bad news, obviously. So and treating the inflammation can improve antibiotics sensitivity. So if you get the inflammation under control, they're more likely to respond to antibiotics, stimuli training exercise nutrition. Yeah, that's what's getting with the last part. So like reducing inflammation will that improve antibiotic impact. Yeah, treating the condition. Yes, and these actual inflammatory cases. Yes, that typically need medical management. Yes, that will improve things like muscle mass gain and muscle protein synthesis. On the other hand, lowering your, you know, inflammation when you don't have one of these medical conditions from a little to very little does nothing. Yeah. That's twad. What strategies do you use in your approach to correcting misinformation or misunderstanding in various settings? Uh, wow. Okay. So what strategy will start with the first one and then, yeah, so other than holding barbell medicine seminars and all the information that is already being disseminated through barbell medicine of course. Let me tell you a story. So stories about my life. Um, I previously, particularly early on at barbell medicine, I thought it was my job to police the internet to make sure that no BS was being written anywhere that could potentially harm anyone and I needed to correct everybody. Uh, that's a fool's errand because not only can you never get anywhere close to all of it, you're not actually changing anyone's mind. Um, I still do this from time to time because I'm not very smart. I told you my GPA earlier, so you guys should be well aware of like my ability to like learn things so not high. So I still do this at times because either I am a glutton for punishment or just again, not smart and learn a lesson. But one thing I realize is that more productive use of my time our time is to actually just create more information. So effectively like if somebody's saying something silly on the internet, like I can't stop them from saying that and me directly challenging them is unlikely to work out in my favor. But if I write an article about that particular thing or make like a long, you know, series like a tutorial or like a Instagram story, you know, rant thing. That'll reach way more people help more people, whatever. I particularly like writing stuff or making a YouTube video or whatever stuff that doesn't disappear as long lasting content. That tends to be good because a lot of people are going to see it. Then it's there. I can refer people to it and then allows me to really flesh out my ideas. The cool thing is if I can find some common ground with that person who I originally disagreed with on occasion, you can sort of strike up a conversation based on that. It's rare, but it has happened before where I end up agreeing with people that I've initially been like, Oh no, this makes me angry because you're wrong. But it's possible. So my recommendation is for like how to go about this is not correcting people that writing reflects a can occur. I do think in professional settings, it's a little different because usually if you come in guns ablasing with a bunch of evidence that you're willing to just give people and say, Hey, if you have some time, check this out, read it, particularly if they're guidelines or like, you know, all of the things that you're going to do is to make sure that you're not going to be able to do that. So I think you can do that in professional settings, but in more social settings or like on social media or amongst friends, I probably just wouldn't do that and I'd focus on putting that creating original content that would be my take. Yeah, I agree. The context matters a whole lot here. And so within the public sphere, the social media sphere, things like that, I'll go ahead and say, I'm smarter than Jordan. And then I just don't do it. I don't care to engage with people or argue people with people or try to go out and correct misinformation. I'm happy to just hear my recommendations. Here's why these are my recommendations and you people out there are free to take them or not. And that's kind of your decision. And so I actually take a similar approach with with patients even because sometimes clinicians, doctors, healthcare professionals, can get really, really, really overly invested in like paternalistic and like feel excessively responsible for this stuff and assuming that I have discussed with somebody and feel like I've gotten them adequately educated. And I can and I know that I've gotten through to them and my message is clear and been understood. And if they choose to pursue a different route with things, then fine, I feel like I've done my job. Whereas sometimes people might take offense to it. If somebody doesn't follow their advice or they might really beat themselves up or get to, you don't work up about it. I see this more often when patients say they want to leave the hospital during the course of my treatment. And I go and educate them about why I'm recommending maybe they stay. And if I have more work to do or whatever. And if I say no, I'm leaving then okay, you know, I can't really beat myself up too much about that. And in social media, I ignore all of that stuff. I definitely don't go down the rabbit hole of arguing with people or I get tagged every day in things. People like here, look at this. What are your thoughts? I don't have thoughts. My thoughts have been expressed elsewhere and you can again take my recommendations or not. And that's fine. One day we're all gonna die and things are gonna be just fine. So that doesn't bother me. In the professional setting, among other doctors, among other clinicians, I know or at least I like to think that I'm among peers who are going to be more receptive to evidence. And so if you've watched any of my lectures that I've given to other doctors on sarcopenia or the cancer lecture or really any of my talks that I've given. My slides are just littered with references and graphs and data and things like that. And that's something that I, it's, it's, it's obviously important for how we practice, but it's also a strategy to actually convince people that hey, I actually, you know, know what I'm talking about here. And here's my justification for my belief, whereas in society, for a lot of this stuff, you don't necessarily need to have a really strong justification for your belief. You can just have beliefs. So if you listen to our last rehab podcast from Reno's Q&A, Michael Ray talked about this YouTube channel. That we all, that me and him, he introduced me to called a street epistemology. And it's a guy who is actually in San Antonio, and he goes around and he'll meet somebody and he'll talk to him a little bit and he'll elicities like tries to get them to make a claim about something that they believe. And then very gently kindly he'll start to delve into this belief and ask them just kind of pointed questions to try to get at the heart of why they believe what they believe. What they believe often times it ends up going down until like religion and things like that. But he's very good at it in terms of getting to why people believe what they believe, but overwhelmingly what he ends up showing is, people can't justify, oftentimes what they believe. They just make sure it up and they just believe what they believe. And we're very, we're very stupid creatures. And so like Jordan said, it's a fool's air into go out and try to save the world and correct everything that's wrong out there. So I just don't do it and wouldn't recommend it. Have you been in an argument in the last week? Have you been in an argument in the last week? No. I've been into you been into. Well, to be fair, it's not my fault. One of them was like a scheduled podcast on like injury and technique. Sure. Yes. So that I did that to myself. Yes. The second one, this guy was making the claim that because doctors don't receive like advanced nutrition training during medical school, that they should not be counseling patients on dietary changes. To which my reply is, why do you need to know all these intricacies to do that behavioral change counseling? You don't. Just like you don't need to be a programming whiz or like a high level coach in order to help people in, you know, achieve these physical activity guidelines, minimums. You don't need that. You need to be experienced to know what to do for trouble shooting for like performance, right? Or have a big toolbox for cueing people in real time. Sure. But to the extent that you need this huge fund of knowledge just to like be able to draw up some initial recommendations, like I don't think you need that. Or to act, I would prefer that in fact, your tool kit was more robustly stocked with behavioral counseling techniques. Yeah, I mean, most of you guys who are here this weekend, you probably are now feeling a little bit more comfortable at what the basic outlines of what we would recommend as a healthy dietary pattern might look like, right? So energy intake and protein, fiber, how the fat distribution looks like and then within that there's tons of latitude. So cool. You don't need to have hyper advanced training to be able to counsel somebody on some of that stuff. But having those conversations is the hard part. Under what clinical cases are you using the advanced lipid testing? Does it change counseling efficacy outcomes in the setting of mild to moderate elevated non HDL to change lifestyle behaviors? Let's back up. What is advanced lipid testing? So the basic lipid panel as I discussed in the lecture involved measuring total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and then off of that is oftentimes calculated in an LDL cholesterol level. And then the best metric again off of that is to take the total subtract HDL get a non HDL cholesterol level. That's the best metric off of the standard lipid panel. Non advanced. What is what are some examples of advanced lipid testing? So advanced lipid testing would involve things like measuring what we call an apob level. And apolipoproutine B level would be one example. Others would be direct particle measurement. So measuring not the cholesterol on the particles, but the particles themselves. So LDL particle concentration, for example, the lipoprofile, the NMR, things like that are advanced lipid testing. So the main situation where I'd order one of these advanced tests is if I have somebody who I have been treating them, I have their blood lipids where I want them to be. And yet they're still having cardiovascular problems. For example, somebody's blood lipids look great and they're coming in and they're still having they just had a new heart attack. Well, we got a problem, right? Because I have you where I think I would like you to be, but you just had another event in a heart attack or a stroke or something like that. So there are sometimes situations where the standard lipid test might not tell us all the information we need. So somebody who's having these sorts of events, heart attacks or strokes with blood lipids, otherwise look good. Then I'd probably measure an apob level, measure a lipoproutine A level, and I'd start treating things more aggressively from there to get their risk down further. Otherwise I don't really measure them. And does having all this information like chain child patients respond to your counseling techniques? No. Okay. Yes. Wouldn't check it otherwise. Yeah. More information is not always better. Any tips or techniques you find generally helpful for increasing motivation or discipline in training. I mean, it's a tough one. It is a tough one, but I think I go back to some of the stuff we talked about during the behavioral change lecture. And then additionally we kept sprinkling in like, I think you should enjoy this. So I think you should enjoy not only the training you're doing, but the components of that, but the actual process. So like your goal oriented training. So I think if somebody's like really having a hard time like sticking to it, I'd wonder like, do you like what you're doing? Is this enjoyable for you? And if it is, great. So what's holding you back? Because there are some things that come up that people generally respond to in a way where they might need some additional counseling. So like for instance, if somebody misses day one of the workout, I've seen it a lot of times where people will just not work out. The rest of the week, they're like, I missed my first day, this week's off. I'm just going to repeat this week next week. They say it's like all they're not in for nominant. And it's like, no, don't do that. Or like, or like, no, but if I don't work out today, then tomorrow's my scheduled rest day. Then I'll have to work out tomorrow and then have to work out the back to back. And that's like bad because I need to perform optimally on all these days. And it's like, no, just put all the workouts together. We have a literally a litany of different questions on our form that's like, hey, I'm leaving town for the week. On Thursday, on Friday, and I have four workouts to do this week, what new? And it's like workout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, going your vacation. And I don't say that like to be dismissive, right? But it's like the actual acute performance during your workout doesn't really matter as much as you get into the total training. So that's just one common thing that I see all the time and people are struggling for time resources in order to train. And I think working around that can help people stay adherent to the training program provided they like with the training program. But if someone hates what they're doing, right, or is fearful of what they're doing, that's problematic. The third thing that I find really important is the social aspect here. So if people are doing this by themselves, so like they have a home gym and they're the only one in their house that uses the home gym. Or if not of their family members workout, even immediate or extended. None of their friends workout. They're just effectively leaving their social circle. They're saying, I'm going to leave my family, I got to leave all my friends. And I go to the gym where I don't know the many people. That's a hard sell for a lot of people. And so I think to the degree you can leverage social support, you can make things more effect. A second, a second, a second, a second, a second, a second, a second, a second, a second, a second, a second, a second. And then make it enjoyable, those are my big sort of things that you can practically apply to the programming and the social sport network to get people to adhere to training. But as far as actually finding motivation and people, that's stuff. You got to give them the old Gipper talk. What do you want to do with this? What do you want to get out of this? Where do you want to be in three months, six months, 12 months? How do your actions on a daily basis lead you closer to or further away from that particular goal? Something. Yeah. Yeah. I don't love the... I don't love centering this discussion around the idea of discipline at all. We've talked in some of our previous Q&A's and on podcasts and stuff like that that, you know, in the past decade, we can count how many workouts we've missed on one hand or less. Even last week when I was laid up with the flu, I still went out and did my deadlift day on Tuesday. And like I said, I almost passed out trying to pull 405 and people might say, you're an idiot, you're crazy for trying to go do that. And I was like, well, I think back to that day, right? I'm having like coughing and chills and sweats on the couch and I feel like shit. Why did I go out to the gym and try to do that? Was it because I'm just like a total badass and more disciplined than anyone else on earth? No, it's because I actually enjoy training. And I got up that day and I was like, well, today would normally be a training day and I like training. So it would make me feel better. Maybe if I went out and tried to do something. Now, I probably tried to pull more than I was ready for on that day, right? But I did it because I actually enjoy training. If I'd loathed training, if I hated training and I felt that sick, that's like double barrier to try to go out and do that thing. Right? So I look back to why have we not missed a training session in the past decade, basically, or a couple, right? Because we actually enjoy training. And to the extent that maybe we've both definitely like skipped out on certain like, say, social engagements or something. Because we, because training was more important to us, it's because we enjoy doing that. Right? So the enjoyment piece, I think, is under-emphasized underrated. It's not that, you know, we're just like, better than you because we can do this thing that we hate. Right? Even when we don't want to, hey, we actually enjoy doing this thing. So I think finding that like why you're doing this and trying to play that up is a bigger piece there than just saying, you're not disciplined enough to do this, right? You're a bad person because you didn't do this session because you're not just pulling enough, I don't think that that's a good way to view human behavior really in general. Also Rick Ross helps always. Instant PR. Instant PR, yes. All right. Let's see if butter is to be limited in a healthy diet. Where do you rank other dairy products with high fat content? Cream, certain cheeses, certain brands of whole milk with 4% to 5% milk fat? Yeah. So Austin, I know you mentioned this. Um, just, and we got, we get a lot of questions about this. We got one recently in our group. Yeah. So, sorry. So just to go back to the kind of beginning of this, the overall recommendation with respect to saturated fat intake is to keep it less than 10% of total daily calories. In particular, the main focus there is going to be saturated fat from red meat. It appears that dairy, like saturated fat from dairy does not appear to have the same deleterious effect that red meat does. In fact, there may actually be some like beneficial effects from dairy consumption. That being said, the recommendation still is less than 10% of your total daily calories from saturated fat. To the degree you can fit butter in their cream, milk with 5% fat, which probably tastes great. It's probably, but you have to probably drink it with a spoon. You can't even, like, you have to like, it's fine. But I think, again, if we start with the 10% saturated fat from total of total daily calories, that's like the initial start. And then most of that, the biggest concern there is red meat intake. Yeah, I think that, you know, when I talk about dairy with people, it tends to be limited to non butter dairy sources. There's actually some evidence that there are some like, there's this concept that we didn't even touch on because again, everything is way more complicated. And even what we delivered to you guys this weekend was like, market-ly simplified. There's this concept called the food matrix. And it has to do with kind of like the chemical structure of the food and the proteins and other molecules that are involved in it. And those can alter the physiological effects of a given food. And so in the course of processing a dairy type food into butter, for example, it actually removes some factors that end up ultimately being quite protective. And so when I'm talking about dairy, I tend to limit it to non butter dairy sources. And so saturated fats from non butter dairy sources, I tend to actually not sweat that much. But the processing that ends up producing butter out of it tends to remove a lot of these protective factors that result in butter being somewhat being more deleterious and more harmful from bloodlipid cardiovascular risk standpoint. So I tend to not sweat the non buttered dairy sources. There's saturated fat from those sources. Very much. Do you put butter in your coffee? Never, whatever do that. Do you put coconut oil in your coffee? That sounds awful. Do you brush your teeth with coconut oil? Jordan said, boy, anytime I see that in a question, I just like, I probably didn't say that. Yeah, probably. Here we are. Jordan said during the seminar that enjoyment and exercise has the biggest impact on adherence. Oh, that's true. I did say that. Coming back to lifting after a long layoff, I found it difficult to find enjoyment with weights that are so far below when I used to be able to do. Any suggestions or resources on how to start enjoying training again? I don't have any resources on this. It'd be great if we had a book. It was like enjoying training. Like, just like a whole book and like how to make starting enjoyment. Yeah, starting starting, starting pleasure. You know, just, yes. The lifting weights is very pleasurable. Yeah, that's gross. So this is a... Yeah, starting hedonism. Starting hedonism. Yeah, a way to use my weights too. Yeah. All right. I actually do have a strategy for this because this has happened to me. I did cross it for like eight months. Yeah, I experimented with the dark, dark arts. And I lost a substantial amount of weight in a substantial amount of strength. I'm not sure those two things were related because I wasn't really lifting weights during that time. I was doing a bunch of Olympic lifts. And it just, I wasn't squatting, benching or deadlifting. And yeah, I'm a weight went down as well. So when I came back, I remember I squatted. I used Leah's belt. This is how like... Yeah, kick kick. Yes. Yes. This is how... This is how like, kick kick kick I was. That was a hundred... I remember I came back from Australia. And I was 84 kilos, 85 kilos, which is like all of 185 pounds or something like that. And I usually as belt and I squatted 180 kilos, which is 396 for a hard triple, a hard triple. To be clear, I've benched that before for a triple. So like, things were bad. And I was like, uh... What? So I'd recently decided to like quit doing CrossFit because I didn't like it. And then, yeah, so enjoyment was low. And I was like, I was going back to powerlifting, so I love that. And then I did powerlifting for one day. And I was like, nooo, where is all my strength? Um, so the strategy that I used... On the exercises that I had a lot of history with, so squat bench deadlift. I changed the rep range to things I didn't have experience with. So for example, I'd never really done squats or bench or deadlift for sets of eight and ten. I stuck, I stuck to mostly those. And I picked different exercise variations that I had very little experience with. And previously, so that I didn't have this like historical like performance, uh, uh, barometer that I kept going up against. Um, and so I did that. And honestly, I remember it was like six to eight weeks after I came back. I was within about 10% of my normal strength levels. And so I was happy again and could train like relatively regularly. Benefits of this are kind of twofold. One, you don't hate yourself every time you go to the gym and think, what was me? This is the worst I've ever performed in my whole life. And then benefit number two is that your sort of slow, gradually retraining yourself to do a different thing. So remember, I'd been doing CrossFit for eight months. I was not squatting, benching and deadlifting like I was during my normal powerlifting training. Had I just switched back to powerlifting with no sort of bridge in between. That could have potentially been problematic for me. I've never had this sort of on ramp where I was able to sort of get back to the normal training. And so that worked out pretty well for me. So generally that's how I recommend folks do that. If they have a specific goal that's different than their normal that we've been training for for a while. And then they want to go back to a previous type of training. I put program this like GPP related bridge where the rep ranges are different. The exercise selections different. So they don't have this like, again, historical thing that they're comparing themselves against each single time. You can do that a lot of different ways. You can do that with rep ranges. You can do it with adding chains or bands or different barbells or different sort of range of motion or tempo. There's a whole different things. A lot of different things you can use. I just actually dealt with this very scenario although not entirely due to a lift off. I had a patient of mine who I have been working with for a little while who was recently diagnosed with cancer. And specifically he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. And one of the standard treatments for prostate cancer is what's called Androgen deprivation therapy where you basically get put on testosterone blockers. You can think of it like that. You get like chemically castrated basically to prevent androgen stimulating the prostate cancer from growing anymore. So we're intentionally making him hypogonaddle. And he was observing that his performance was going down in the gym. When you're truly hypogonaddle, then sure we would expect that your performance is going to be altered with that. And he was having some distress over this because he pulled 500 at Nationals last year. And now he's like I'm seeing my numbers start to change. And so what should I do? I'm not really loving training when now that I'm weaker. And that's just said, we need to change the metrics of performance here. We need to pick some different exercises, right? Rather than a competition squat and a competition deadlift than a pause bench press. We need to pick some other things that you haven't done before. Give you some new opportunities to PR, right? So now that if you're going to be doing pause squats and deficit deadlifts and stuff like that, every time you train is going to be a PR. And so we change the strategy and he's now fully on board with that idea and training with some different things. So again, same deal so that he doesn't have this constant prior performance to compare himself to. So that's what we did with him. So effectively the same thing, just do different things. And you'll have less of a metric of comparison. Yeah, just change your goalposts. Boom. All right. Two cool workers were discussing their supposed back problems together. Both were told by their doctors that they have permanent life altering conditions with their backs. These sedentary office workers are convinced that they are disabled, handicapped, parking spots and all. However, they're visibly fine as they get around the office with no issues. Without them asking for my help, how can I address this without scarring or an oscarine or insulting them if it all possible? In general, they are stubborn just like the rest of us. I don't think there's anything you can do to be frank. Well, I'm Jordan, but to be frank. I don't think there's anything you can do. And the doctors right, they have permanent life altering conditions in their backs. Just like all of us do having a back, having a back. Yeah. Yeah. And things change over time. You know, I don't I'm not sure the medical legal process that you have to go through to get a handicapped parking spot. You need to get a doctor to sign your form. Right, correct. So that's probably probably there. And you know, maybe this is all just a toy for the handicapped sign. You know, maybe they go swing dancing every Friday night. You don't know. But the point is, you're asking, how can you get somebody to change their behavior without being able to engage them and then go through the rest of those steps. So focusing, evoking and then planning together. You guys don't have that relationship. You have an established it. So you can't. The simple answer is you can't. And I don't mean that to say you shouldn't even try and it's not worth trying. Everything's meaningless. We're all going to eventually re-enter the carbon cycle. Although that's true. I think that because you can't establish any sort of relationship with the person that you probably best suited by directing your efforts towards other things. Yeah. Yeah. I would say two things here. I would say number one. I would caution you against making assumptions about what's actually going on with this person. It may seem like they're getting, you know, it says they're visibly fine as they get around the office, but just making assumptions is generally problematic. So you don't actually know what's going on with them. What their history is what they actually have going on. But number two, you know, we know that actually one of the big predictors of long-term disability from Backpain is actually the potential for some sort of positive gain like monetary compensation, for example. I've dealt with this before when working in the military system or in the VA system, for example, where getting your level of disability upgraded can result in higher levels of monetary compensation or other sorts of like secondary benefits. And that is not my favorite way of a system being set up because it incentivizes disability, basically, right? There are benefits to being disabled so that rather than there being benefits are incentivizing people to improve and return to their normal function. So you're up against a really tough situation here and kind of like we were talking about earlier as far as addressing this information. I think you're best spending that time and effort not doing that, not really addressing that and letting that person live their life. And if they approach you and say, man, I see what you're doing in the gym and living your life and I'm interested in that, then there you go. Your foot has been firmly put in the door and you can you can start to have that conversation. But otherwise, I probably wouldn't go out of my way. Sometimes we have to we all have to accept that we can't save the world and that's just kind of the way it is. What's that phrase? It's like, it's not the live-life love, but it's like, please grant me this opportunity to accept the things that I don't know. It's like, it's like, it's right after live-life love. It's like the second. Yeah, basically, you know, focusing on the things that you can control and letting go of the things you can. One of these stoic philosophy things. Yes, sure. Sure, I'm going to get that tattooed on my ankle. All right. All right. Last question. Based on the nutrition lecture, it seems that there isn't any significance placed on timing of macro consumption over the course of a day. Is that for simplicity or because there's really no evidence to support its importance? I put this in there specifically to trigger you. Who are you about Crono nutrition? Yeah. So if you keep your ear to the ground and you're on the interwebs, then you're likely aware of this emerging science about Crono nutrition. It's effectively like where and you what time during the day you end up consuming the bulk of your nutrition. It's an emerging area of research and there's some evidence suggesting that individuals who consume the bulk of their calories earlier in the day may have better outcomes with respect to weight loss and body composition stuff like that. Then if you consume the bulk of your calories later on in the day. A couple of problems with this. The control of like these studies is is pretty pretty rough meaning that they're not keeping these people under like lock and key and saying, you guys are all going to eat the same amount of calories. It's basically free living individuals. So it's likely the individuals who did not lose as much weight or who had worse body composition likely consumed more calories. That's the most likely explanation, but I'm not ready to write this often say there's nothing there. I think a lot of this has to do with adherence and I know that there's additional data corroborating this idea of eating during a certain time of the day. Based on how consistent you are with eating the similar meals at a given time during the day. I also know that working out what time you work out might have an impact on your chrono nutrition. So for example, if you work out in the evening, then it doesn't really matter as much that you can see the bulk of your nutrition early on in the day versus later on in the day. So where do I stand on this right now? I think that we would like to develop a dietary plan that you can adhere to long term that you can consistently hit day in and day out, right, and that ultimately supports whatever you need to do with respect to your weight, whether it be lose weight, maintain weight, gain weight, and supports your physical activity levels. Should you bias the bulk of your nutrition to earlier in the day? If you work out earlier in the day, I'd be more comfortable saying that, rather, and I don't think that I could say that you should bias your nutrition any which any particular place outside of something that improves adherence with the actual diet. I don't know if you have anything that you want to. Not much else. I just know that the chrono nutrition topic gets you going. It doesn't trigger me. It's just I think that people in general with respect to medical research. There are people who like read either biomedical research or nutrition research, and as soon as they see it, they're like, yep, that's a new thing. I want it. That's my that is my jam. I'm going to you know, make an Instagram infographic about it, and then I'm going to be the guru on this. Even though even if there's not enough information to know about this stuff right now, that's like the people who say they're gut biome experts, right, and they don't have a PhD MD after their name, right, you are not a gut microbiome expert. You're you know, a YouTuber who are something, right, and you're selling poop teas and waste trainers. It's problematic, okay. With respect to chrono nutrition, I know of two experts on this right now. One is Alan Flanagan. You can read more about this at his website, which is called alinea.com, or he's also on sick lung nutrition. So if you're interested in this stuff, you can check out both of those places, but I don't necessarily have a firm opinion on how we should structure our meals through the day outside of and proven adherence. I agree overall, and I think that to your last point, there's an excellent article that I'd recommend that anybody who's a clinician probably read, and to the extent that it's accessible to non-collegations, if you're a coach, it's an article by some bright folks called the case for being a medical conservative. And basically, it's along the lines of what Jordan was just saying, where there's tons of like latest, greatest, you know, like new hotness that comes out, about medical literature. And in general, it's a full's air into immediately take up this stuff, and be like, you know, 100% on the train for things, because most things don't work when it comes down to it. Most things that we do don't work. So there's a case for being a medical conservative, and so far as you are kind of a late adopter of things, once a sufficient body of evidence is accumulated to support a particular idea, belief, or kind of treatment approach. And so I think that's probably where we are right now, in terms of where our emphasis is, with respect to nutrition, we are probably not at the point where we're micromanaging when people eat compared to what they're eating. But if more evidence comes out, I know that Flanagan, who I coach, and I get very amusing check-ins from about, he's like plant-powered and things like that in his powerlifting training. He's doing some of his PhD research on this stuff. They're actually locking some people in a lab and doing some like jet lag effects on how that influences their metabolic processes and things like that. Maybe we will be convinced by more of this stuff to emphasize it more. But as of now, I think the nutrition guidelines that we laid out with respect to, you know, energy intake, protein, fiber, fat proportions, things like that. And then outside of that, the beauty of that having such limited recommendations is that there's tons of room for individualization, preference, variability outside of that. So if people like to fast or they don't, people like certain foods or other foods within those guidelines, there's tons of room and they have tons of options to you. And that's a good thing. The more recommendations and restrictions limitations, it's just going to become harder to adhere to. So let's, you know, stick with what we have really good evidence for. And then I'm fine with once somebody is meeting those things if we want to manipulate the timing, then cool. But that's not my first priority with people. People always want like the like eight more rules. Yeah, we all this stuff in order to be adherent. Yeah, and you have to be super disciplined to do it, right? Because that makes you a good person. Well, right, it's the most like you do like a samurai. Right. Okay. There we did it. Hey, we did it. All right, San Diego. Thank you so much for coming out. See you in a review. Thank you so much for coming. See you guys later on. Hey, we thank you. Yeah, we thank you. Yeah, we thank you. Yeah, we thank you. Yeah, we thank you. But I want to feel that everything.

=== FILE: 2020 Virginia Beach Question and Answer (Full) [nXeMddBdefA].txt ===

Music There's so much for joining us here at our first seminar back since COVID-19. We're here in Norfolk, Virginia, Ireland, asylum gym. Thank you so much for coming out. Nobody clap this time. Yeah, all right. Thanks. Thank you for watching on YouTube. If you're checking this out, we're going to answer some questions that were submitted during our seminar. Thank you for doing that. If you're question, does not get answered here. Sorry. Go to our forum. We'll answer it there. And if that doesn't work, you should hop on one of my Instagram lives every Wednesday, 5 30 PM to 60 in a time. I'll try to answer it there. If that doesn't work, DM Austin. No, he's very active and responsive to DM's. Particularly ones that go to his unread folder. He's just, yeah, he's on it. So that works. Okay. Let's go through our questions. Question one. Does intro work out nutrition make a difference, such as gauge rate or other simple carbohydrates during a workout? You want to start with us? You got it. All right. I mean, I don't know if you have thoughts. I have some. Okay. Let's start with your thoughts. So I think we're talking about two different things with those examples. For example, if you're talking about Gatorade versus or like Gatorade 0, for example, or simple carbohydrates because there's some difference with respect to electrolyte content there. And I think for most people who are pursuing regular, just simple resistance training, barbell training, the type of exercise that that is, the demands of the exercise typically are not going to make intro work out carbohydrate supplementation really necessary. I would say a similar thing with respect to the electrolyte concentration for people who are doing right, just routine barbell base resistance training like in a gym like this. I think there can be some considerations depending on the environment that the person is in. That would be one thing and then other specific aspect of their training. So environment, I'll give you myself as an example who routinely trains in an outdoor garage in South Texas upwards of 110 degree temperatures 90 minute to two hour session losing substantial or not insignificant amounts of sweat. You could make a point for comparing, if I was just drinking lots and lots and lots of plain water during that session, let's say I ended up needing to drink, you know, two liters of plain water during that session versus something that had some electrolyte concentration in it, like a gatorate although I would also argue that the electrolyte concentration of gatorate is probably too low for that purpose. I could make a case for using something that had some added electrolytes, some added sodium, potassium, etc. during that session would be reasonable knowing that I'm not like measuring my blood levels throughout this session. But losing tons of sweat and I would prefer to replace a similar type of fluid compared to plain water if I'm going to need to use a lot of it. The consequence to drinking lots and lots of plain water is you can dilute your blood sodium levels down, condition called hyponectremia, a few other consequences that are best avoided. Of course, in the course of somebody who's training doing that, it's not necessarily going to be life-threatening in most typical training situations, but you hear new stories every year about, you know, college kids who go through hazing rituals and they drink tons of water until some kid dies or something like that. And so, hyponectremia is real and potentially risky. So that would be the point I would make on the electrolyte front for carbohydrate consumption, again, for regular routine like our type of parboil training, I think for most people it's not necessary, assuming that you're eating reasonably the rest of the day. You haven't been, you know, fasted for 24 hours when you go to lift in which case, yeah, you should probably get something in you if you want to perform well during the session. But, you know, myself, I typically eat anywhere from 90 minutes to three hours somewhere in that range before I train or consume something in that period of time. So I don't find for myself that consuming carbohydrate stir in the session is necessary. I think probably some folks who do extremely high volume bodybuilding training or something, they may have different opinions on this, but that's kind of outside my scope or put out what I would want to manage myself. Yeah, yeah, I think for resistance training, when considering adding an electrolyte drink, electrolyte replacement drink, one, the evidence on this is very underwhelming as far as suggesting any performance improvement, yeah, they're in the short term or like your next session being better. So I don't think I could recommend it based on current evidence. If you prefer the pallidability that way it tastes, right, and you're going to be consuming a lot of fluid because you train in somewhere that's very hot or humid or both or you sweat a lot. That seems totally reasonable to me, but I don't know that you need to do that routinely. Main thing that's going to predict how well you do in those situations is what you aid in drink leading up to that and not just that day, but also the series of days and weeks before that. So, there currently the best fluid intake guidelines we have for athletes or the NATA North America Training Association guidelines. You guys can check those out if you're watching this online, put them in the description below about kind of outline with the complexities here. Basically people sweat at different rates, different concentrations of electrolytes are in different environments, trained for different iterations of time, so making it like again a specific hydration sort of recommendation is impossible. But with respective performance improvement, like if you drink and get your aid, well, you're bench-press-go-up, like probably not. And then as far as carbohydrates or otherwise eating food during a workout. So again, the data right now on resistance training is not impressive at all. So from a performance standpoint, would not necessarily recommend consuming food during a workout unless you personally prefer it, which is the same way I feel about timing of a pre-workout meal. I personally like eating about two hours before I workout, but I don't like set a stopwatch after I finished my last fight to say, two hours, it's now time to live. That's just how it ends up working on my daily schedule. Other people like to eat a little closer to their workout or even a little further apart. I agree with Austin as long as you're not fasted. It's a good idea. And then that all kind of goes out the window when we start talking about endurance training, particularly endurance training that's lasting for over 90 minutes, two hours or longer than that. There's actually recommendations from the International Sports Society of Nutrition, talking about a actual carbohydrate recommendations per duration of time. I don't remember what they are off hand, but they actually give a carbohydrate recommendation. And I think that would be a good place to start. If you're an endurance-minded individual, but then I'd have to ask you like, why are you watching the Marvel Medicine YouTube channel? It's a wrong channel for you. They still want to get jacked. Yeah, no, it's fine. So in relation to your resistance training, like you don't need any goopacks or like, you know, what else would you would you have? If you were running a marathon and you knew that you needed to snack in the middle, what would be your snack? I know a mine is, but you go first, because I know you like answering stuff on the spot. Well, if you're going to have to consume it while you're running, then I kind of tend to agree that those kind of gel pack things are fairly quick and convenient and easy to throw down instead of something you need to chew. Sure. Well, one, I'm not a very fast runner. I know this surprised you. And certainly from running a marathon, I'm not moving very quickly. Okay. So you're going to sit down and have a meal because you may as well. Yeah, I'm not winning. I'm definitely not winning. The whole idea is to finish. And I think, you know, I don't want, but I don't want to get sick later either. Okay. So for me, it's going to be an Elvis Presley, which is a grilled peanut butter in jelly sandwich with a banana. And that's delicious. Yeah, that will work well. I'm not going to run with it, but I wasn't running in the first place. I was already walking. Okay. Yeah. And then, you know, probably a beer. It's got a bunch of electrolytes in it. Get a re-hydrating and also takes the edge off because I'm like, should I really keep going? Fair enough. Yep. Prodo. All right. Question number two. If hospitalized, should I have somebody bring me way protein? You know, this is a fine. Not a silly question. I like it. Yeah. I mean, so when I was an intern, I did try to routinely order people double protein when I was putting in their nutrition like Rex. So you have to put in orders for every patient you admit. And I'm in for diet. You know, you pick, oh, they end PO. So they can't eat anything. It's just, you know, liquids or whatever. I would routinely put in double protein. And every time I would get a page, they'd be like, the lie tissue and ask you why? Why? And I'm like, I mean, look, they're risk or sarcopenia. Oh, like, I feel like this is not like, no, this is wrong. Yeah. I mean, if I was hospitalized, I would try to eat more dietary protein. And I'm not saying that just because I'm like protein or gains. It's just the thing is, the risk of like critical illness, myopathy, bed rest, and it's effect on your antibiotic resistance, all those sort of factors, in addition to not training, would all put you up much higher risk for losing muscle tissue. And for most folks, especially those who don't have like a profound amount of extra muscle tissue to lose, having a concentrated source of dietary protein that is available to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. And there's also relatively low in calories and it's easy to consume, seems like a good deal. So, you don't, I mean, if you can't get it in the hospital, because they would give you insure or something or boost or something like that. Yep, there's effectively a protein shake that is low in protein. Well, with plenty of sugar in it. Yeah, yeah, I mean, look, it's got calories and so people can consume that and I'm not saying that it's bad universally. I'm just saying that if you're, you know, if you're going to have the insure, like I want the extra 20 grams of protein too, so get you, get you some way. Yeah, I mean, I think that's reasonable. On the other hand, the counter argument that I make frequently when we're talking about in hospital diets, because I am involved in making these decisions frequently, sure, is that it's unlikely to make a big difference on people's long-term outcomes when most hospital stays are not going to be particularly long. Sure, if you're in an unfortunate situation where you're in the hospital for like three months, then sure, I can make an argument that it's going to make a big difference there. But, you know, I'll frequently, majority of the patients that I admit to the hospital are going to be in the hospital for, you know, three days or less, most of them, and fewer are going to be a lot there longer than that, and then the fewest are going to be there for like weeks to months on end. So, somebody who's going to be in the hospital for a day or two days or three days, we're going to say, oh, they have heart disease, so we're going to put them on a heart healthy diet for a day in the hospital. Like, it doesn't really do anything. So, I tend to not be super picky about that because ultimately what it ends up doing is just restricting the patient's choices when they're in the hospital and they're already miserable enough. And there's no sense in my mind torturing them for something to give them like two meals that fit this criteria that really. So, the bigger deal would be if we could get them to consume sufficient dietary protein in the weeks, months, and years leading up to the hospitalization. So, they're super jacked when they go to the hospital and they're at lower risk of in-hospital mortality, and arguably they don't need to potentially go into the hospital all if the condition could have been averted. So, I think that's far more important than worrying about an in-hospital diet because most hospital stays are relatively short. But, to the extent they're going to be there for a while, as long as you don't have any reasons not to feed somebody's get, then sure you can give some protein if they're going to be there for a while. If you were going to be in the hospital for seven days, you take it some way. Maybe I'm not going to be going out of my way to get it now, but you know the range of ringy somewhere. Yeah, we're probably that strawberry junk that I keep to the back of your head. Yeah, I know. What would you recommend for managing such receiving feedback on pain in the clinical world so it's not to ignore patients' perceptions, but still maximize the rehab process. I can start. All right. So, this was the reference where I was talking about how if you're a coach and your coach and somebody who has some discomfort, say in their back, after every rep or after every set and you're asking how's your back feeling, how's your back feel, has your back feel constantly drawing more attention to that area? Because we know that attentional focus plays a big role in people's experience of pain. And so, I would make the recommendation to not do that when you're coaching people. This isn't to swing the other way and to say just to ignore any symptom that they report, but you don't necessarily need to go fishing for that. In a rehab context, if you are a skilled clinician and observer and communicator with your patient, then you can observe what they're doing and then just ask them what their thoughts are. After a given set, how that go, do you feel comfortable increasing the load, something like that, and given that you've had the discussion, the education process ahead of time, saying we're going to work in a range of tolerable symptoms and aim to progress gradually from there, then you can get that feedback. They can volunteer it to you rather than you go and fishing for it from them. So, to the point where if they're feeling comfortable and okay, then you can celebrate that and say, that's awesome, that's great news. You're feeling good, that's a good sign. We can keep progressing in this process. Whereas if they volunteer that this is pretty uncomfortable or I'm concerned about this or this is freaking me out or I don't want to go up anymore, then you can respect that and maybe have a discussion around it and modify the plan accordingly rather than constantly going again fishing and drawing their attention to an area that their attention may not necessarily be on. Focusing their attention more on the task and celebrating the victory of that went well, I think is probably the way that I would go in a clinical context. I recognize, however, that in the clinical world, there's some tendency and potentially even rules and requirements to get patients pain scores on a scale of 1 to 10 and that can be annoying, but you don't need to do a pain score on a scale of 1 to 10 after every set either. So, I would do the bare minimum on that front as far as getting your pain scores and then just focusing on the task and not unnecessarily drawing attention to where it doesn't need to be. I think the only just a practical sense actually don't recommend that most coaches ask about it. If you notice somebody who's demonstrating pain-related behavior which during a lift would be some sort of slow down that occurs during the descent of a squat, for example, or like hesitation during a particular that is abnormal because you've worked with this person before, you can ask like, hey, was that painful for you or you can ask them even a more open-ended question like what's going on? This is to get them to start talking about it, but my general recommendation is to not ask, does that hurt after any set? The only time I think that's appropriate is if you're trying new stuff, to try to work around an existing injury and you're kind of like literally on the fly, trying new things to see if they're still sensitive to that particular movement. So someone had low back pain like Leah when we were trying to gather and stand a cruise quite frequently. If she had like a low back pain, we do like a mid-shin rack pull and I would after she did a set of like how that feel, how that feel is the right question there. Yeah. And then if that didn't you know, she said, I still, I still, you know, still pretty sensitive, it's still a pretty good. We try another thing and I would say again, how does that feel? Something like that. I think, you know, the big thing that people, I don't know if they feel this way, but I certainly think it gets perceived this way. It's like you have to be perfect with this pain stuff. Like and if you mess up, like dang it, just I ruined it. Yeah, that's not the case. Like we're all humans, we all make mistakes, we all say the wrong things sometimes. The important part is the important part is to not compound an error with another error. Like, oh, did that hurt? You're like, oh, no, I said it. I said the H word. I'm saying, now you're freaking out about it. And then they're like, what? And so some of that actually gets transferred to them. And they're like, they start feeling guilty about having pain. The normal human experience. And then the stuff can start kind of snowballing. And so I think it's just like, yeah, look, we all make mistakes. And don't use the right language all the time. We have certain goals for how we communicate and let's try to do the best we can. But in the coaching setting, I think it just plan on saying how does that feel. If you notice something strange, is it ever, ever? This was an interesting one. worthwhile to seek treatment for chronic non-specific pain. Yes. Well, I think it's worthwhile to seek treatment for pain period. I assume this question probably means like use of pain medications, but I'm not going to say that that means treatment. So a treatment would be seen a clinician being evaluated for potential causes of pain involving the patient exploring this bio-psychosocial model together coming up the shared management plan and moving forward from there. So I would say if a person has pain and they're concerned about it, see your medical professional. If it's from training, my caveat would be hopefully they're very familiar with pain science. And unfortunately, I don't feel confident that that is the case. I'm not trying to throw shade at the medical establishment. It's just look, I'm in the medical establishment and I know that that's the case right now. So I think like our pain and rehab specialist team, those guys are the best in the business and that would be my general recommendation for somebody who's got pain from training and they're like, I need some professional help. But I think if somebody has pain that concerns them, they're worried about specific thing. They're like, oh, I have this low back pain and I'm worried it could be cancer. It sounds crazy, but you know, that's not an unusual sort of report. It's like, oh yeah, my dad had the same sort of pain and he had cancer and that's why I'm afraid. Yeah, seeking treatment because you're going to be evaluated and then treated based on findings and then again, you as the complex patient, ideally, that would be a net benefit. I don't know that you need pain medications necessarily, which I assume is again, what this question actually meant. I don't know what it implied when I read the question. I said, I hope I didn't convey the message during my lecture that it's not worth seeking help for pain related issues because that's certainly not the case. Yeah, in fact, the opposite. Yeah, it's very common for people to need help. I think that we definitely provided you with information education, hopefully empower you to self-manage many of your like common routine day to day aches and pains type situations. But to the extent that you're dealing with something, a pain related, you know, issue that maybe you don't fully know what to do or you've tried what you've learned and you can't make progress, then seeking out some consultation, evaluations, some assistance from somebody you trust would be a fantastic idea. Now, we cannot guarantee that that person will do will offer you will recommend to you unless it's somebody from our own rehab team. You know, I've definitely seen patients who end up seeing a pain specialist or something and, you know, bad things end up getting rolled out and they get a prescription for an opioid. That probably wouldn't be the case that I would go with this myself. Nor would it be the way that our rehab team would go. So we have a resource that we can offer that we trust and recommend without reservation. But if you are struggling with with an issue like this, then seeking help is definitely the way to go. Would recommend? Would recommend? Yes. All right. How can we do a better job of framing exercise and diet and a positive life for our youth? For example, it's somewhat common practice for parents to not let their children leave the dinner table until they've finished all their vegetables. Another example of this would be coaches making their athletes run as a form of punishment. These experiences may frame healthy eating and exercise as a way that a synonymous with suffering and discomfort. How can we improve these psychosocial variables? Nice. Early and or address them with adults that have already met these experiences or lived these experiences. Excuse me. I picked some hard ones this time. I mean, it's not, it's just that it's so, I don't necessarily agree with the, like, the premises. So for example, like, I don't know that one may necessarily associate this with a form of punishment. Like, you might, but depends on other stuff. Like, I don't know, was your parent, you know, yelling, you go run, because you know, whatever. Or like, hey, let's go run around the house. Like, let's go do a lap. So maybe that's your suggestion. Is the way that the recommendation or the way it's going to be. Yes, yes. So it, yes. It does exactly. So for example, and I'm not pretending to give anybody parenting advice, like there's very, there's a few either of us should do that. Parenting advice, relationship advice, like, look, I'm not, I'm not your doctor for that. Like, I think, so one, I always think that the parents leading by example probably makes for a better environment, especially for making recommendations or suggestions to their kids, because mom and dad are already doing it, you know, and so you should do too. And then also if you're going, if the, you know, needing to modify some of the behaviors that the child is engaging in, especially with respect to the diet or activity, the way that you're recommending them should be ideally into a form of positive way or affirming way rather than like do this, you know, in a negative, in a negative light, because I think it just too many risks there with potentially future psychological distress around those actions. But, you know, trying to get kids to eat vegetables, for example. So one, like, you should guys, as a family should be eating vegetables regularly, and involve the kid in preparing the vegetables, and picking the vegetables, and how to, you know, which way will she'll you prepare them? Like, all that stuff is useful, because then the kids got a buy-in to these vegetables, like, look, I help make these, and then they're probably going to eat them. You know, with respect to being active, like, hey, do you, most, especially, I know the parents, I know that train, if they train at home, their kids want to come out into the gym and play around with mom and dad who are lifting the gym. And so exposing them rather early on, can't be a positive experience rather than say, hey, get out of my hair, go run around the house. Not saying that that's how people do it, but I think that, leading by example, and then also involving the kid in the process, like, whatever process can be useful, because then they have a bigger buy-in. Oh, you just got a home gym, or you're building home gym, like, yeah, let's set it up together. You know, where should this go? All the stuff, all the stuff that's sort of stuff can be useful, as far as adults that have already had these experiences. I think you're going to sus that out during this, like, the sort of interview process, you know, when you're taking any new client, asking them, you know, what sort of barriers do they have, or feelings, or thoughts do they have about changing the dietary patterns, and if something specific comes up, that's when you're going to get there. But I don't routinely see that to be honest. The closest I get is people say, I don't like vegetables. Yeah, and then when I explore that, it's usually due to, like, I don't like the way they taste, I don't, you know, and then I'm not really sure how to prepare them in a way that tastes, tastey, and so we just go down and kind of try things. If I could give advice to parents who have kids, it would be to get them to be an active and is many different ways as possible, and the best way to do that is not only giving them choices and opportunities, but also leading by example. So if mom and dad lift, or, or, or otherwise, are active, like, they're, you know, slightly likely the kids are going to want to join in on that. It's just the normal thing to do. Yeah, I don't have a ton to add to that. I was going to say, I mean, that's kind of why I included this question, is mainly to convey the message of leading by example, is going to be kind of the main thing that I would suggest here. For adults who have already been through this, refer back to the standard behavior change talk that we did, all the same things, what apply there, as far as how you work with people to change their behaviors. That's the idea. Did you're dead, live? No. You know, where my, my dad and my mom met at the gym. Yep. There you go. My mom was in a rubyx instructor. My dad was playing Rocket Ball and apparently short shorts meets short shorts. Nice. Yeah, that's how I came to be. Okay. Should the elderly be prescribed animal extarruids? So there are actually some situations where animal extarruids have been researched for medical use. This includes severe burns, because burn patients, whole body burns and things like that, is a major hyper-catholic state. So there's some research in that world. And other syndromes where there is severe muscle and fat wasting, a syndrome called keksia. So animal extarruids have also been researched in like HIV-AIDS related keksia, where these patients are just literally skin and bones. They've wasted away. So this is being looked at. I think part of the reason outside of the obvious like social stigma around this stuff that they're not kind of used more liberally in practice is actually when you look at the available research that we have on this stuff in elderly patients, the outcomes are actually not like mind-blowingly good. And so I think that until such point as that evidence would emerge where we put an elderly individual presumably sarcopenic individual, not just somebody who's elderly for the sake of it, on antibiotics if we see fantastic results in terms of quality of life or other kind of positive outcome measures, then I wouldn't expect medical societies or organizations to recommend this stuff until we have a solid evidence based to stand on. I think a big part of it is that that doesn't actually exist yet. And I'm actually open to the possibility that they may not deliver the benefits that we all assume. They would. Rather, I think that we should pull the levers that we'd know work right now, getting physical activity up. And getting the nutritional intake to where it should be. And I definitely think it's reasonable for us to research this stuff. But going back to the root of the question, should it should the elderly be prescribed antibiotics derriots? At this time, no, that's not wouldn't be my recommendation because we don't have clear evidence of consistent benefit whereas there is some potential for harm, particularly in elderly who, again, remember the number one calls death in the U.S. in the world that I talked about on day one yesterday's cardiovascular disease. And there are cardiovascular risks associated with these medications. If you were to give them the patients. So we're giving them medications with some known risk from a cardiovascular standpoint and potentially other organ systems that can be evolved. They're involved. There can be side effects on the liver depending on the type of antibiotics derriot and the route of administration as well as on the kidneys. And a few other kind of potential side effects and complications for unclear benefit. So we need research to demonstrate clear benefit before we're going to comfortably prescribe it. And that really stands, in my opinion, for any medical intervention that we're going to do, I would prefer to have good evidence of benefit before I do it. And that has been particularly relevant recently with COVID when it comes to deciding how we're going to treat these patients. Yeah, I want good evidence before I decide to give somebody particularly medication that has known risks and unknown benefits. Yeah, I feel similarly mainly with respect to the, obviously, the risk benefit analysis. But with the existing data on this, if there was robust data showing like, yeah, when you give elderly patients testosterone, they grow huge muscles and their quality life improves and all this other stuff improves, then I think it already be widely adopted. Right now you have, you know, a relatively few amount of studies, particularly looking at muscle wasting and muscle in fact combined wasting diseases. So like Austin said, HIV burn patients, other diseases that causes a kexie like liver disease, etc. And then a few like fringe papers that like randomly pop up like using testosterone and women who have chest pain like angina. Pretty you same with that one. Yes, we were. Or now the most recent paper that came out of this is testosterone use and depression. And there's other papers obviously out there on testosterone, but much fewer on other antibiotic agents, right? So people are talking about like, oxandrolone or anovar, decandurable and or whatever. This is the same case that Psalms the selective androgen receptor modulators, these are the new drugs that are on the street, well they're on the street right now, but they're being researched. These are effectively they're supposed to be like steroid analogs like work like steroids, but have none of the side effects because they're selective for the receptors that they actually bind to. But unfortunately during the phase two clinical trials when they're doing using them on these older people, they're not getting the benefits that are purported like bigger muscles, stronger muscles, being able to, you know, be more active or anything like that. And so when you have this data that like over all suggests, not a reliable benefit and then there are known risk factors, it makes sense that the medical community is kind of like, even during our board's prep, I remember on like step one, there was a question about using anabolic steroid like a patient who was using anabolic steroids and then like one of the lines was, data that at present does not show or shows that antiboxaris don't provide a performance benefit in sport, please counsel the patient accordingly. And I was like, uh, Vinny down the street at gold might have been a video. So as far as how this works in the future, I think if better data comes out, that'll be useful in order to get that better data, we need to do more studies. And I think that in general medicine is fairly liberally leaning, you know, liberal leaning. And so as new data emerges, I don't know that any stigma is going to prevent us from like adopting the latest practices provided ample evidence exists. There was a big series of studies that came out, uh, think maybe last year or two years ago called the testosterone trials. It was a big set of multiple studies on testosterone for various outcomes. So if you're interested in this topic, I'll just look up, look, thumbs up, and get some results. Yep. All right, related does a strength athlete ever achieve enough hypertrophy. Is there a point in the athletes development whether there is no longer a need to make the muscle larger and only to make them stronger? It's a complicated question. Um, so enough hypertrophy. I mean, that's like saying, you know, you ever get jacked enough. You ever make too much money? I mean, I don't know that you can say yes to that. So as far as in an athletes development where they no longer need to make the muscles larger and only need to make them stronger, that assumes that these happen like independently. And I don't know that I view them as like to independent processes. I think that the amount of muscle mass increase that occurs, that co-ocurs with strength increase, particularly at high level strength athletes is much smaller than when a person like physique athletes, bodybuilders, et cetera, who are primarily just training for size increases and not at all for strength increases. But I think that there's still some hypertrophy occurring, uh, nonetheless, even if it's relatively small. Now that being said, the actual hypertrophy process is rather complicated as far as like does the myophibrular hypertrophy just the contractile protein? Is that preceded some of the sarcoplasma hypertrophy, which tends to create a more substantial increase in muscle cross sectional area or does the one, you know, precede the other. That stuff's still being assessed out. Um, and so this is still an active area of research, but for my, from a practical standpoint, I think trying to get as jacked as possible, using, uh, what while still doing the specific exercises, the specific for your sport, and the correct intensity ranges to make them go up would be the, would be the goal. I don't ever think you say, I'm jacked enough. I'm going to cut the volume down. Yeah, this part, last part of this question, or it says, there's no longer a need to make the muscles larger and only to make them stronger. I think that creates an, kind of an artificial dichotomy or separation between those two things when really, at least there's, there is to be fair some debate in the research world about how much hypertrophy contributes to strength development and performance, but I tend to lean on the side, and I think you probably do too, that, um, strength performance of a particular muscle, one of the contributing factors to that strength potential is muscle size. Um, the other major contributor would be the neurological, like the skill, the recruitment, uh, kind of, kind of aspect of it. And so you can't really say, I don't need to make the muscle larger and only to make it stronger when muscle size is probably a contributor to muscle strength. Uh, and so I think that to the extent that you want to continue making your muscle stronger, uh, you should strive to make them larger as well. And I don't think there's actually a way for you to aim to make them stronger without generating some amount of hypertrophy along the way in the process. Number seven is liposuction ever a good idea. And I think a context for this question, you can view this question in a couple different contexts. One is in the context of our discussions all weekend here with respect to health. So I would kind of think back to when we talked about obesity and the situations where carrying excess body fat can be problematic. And in particular, we talked about how type of a relationship there is with the abdominal, waist or conference and medical complications. And the reason why that there's such a close relationship there is because that measurement reflects intrabdominal, or what we call visceral body fat accumulation. Inside the abdomen, inside the organs, inside the liver, for example, which is different visceral body fat or out of post-acumulations a bit different than subcutaneous or body fat that accumulates under the skin. And so the body fat or out of post is infiltrating your abdominal organs, your liver, your pancreas, things like that. That's when we see big time increases in diabetes risk, cardiovascular risk, things like that. Whereas liposuction as a treatment primarily removes subcutaneous body fat, not the kind that's inside, not the kind that's in the liver. So there's actually some data on this. There's a small study that I found while I was prepping for this where they took a group of women, some of whom had diabetes and some of whom did not all of whom had excess body fat and they performed serial large volume liposuction, removing large amounts of subcutaneous body fat. You're going to say something? What did you just move it? Put it someplace else? Yeah. No, why you would do that? Okay. Right. And they severely removed this subcutaneous body fat. And then when they looked at how they did afterwards, they did find that their waste circumference went down as a result of removing body fat. Obviously, their leptin levels went down and leptin is a hormone that is high when you have lots of body fat and low when you have less body fat. So that obviously went down. That all makes sense. When they measured their actual levels of insulin resistance and their cardiovascular risk factors, things like blood lipids and things like that, there's no change. So from a health standpoint, do not have a good case to make for liposuction. If you say, is it ever a good idea? Well, that's strictly up to you from a cosmetic standpoint. You know, at that point, I would not recommend it for medical benefits. If there is excess body fat that needs to be dealt with invasively or surgically and there are medical issues going on or even if there aren't and you meet criteria based on the criteria that we talked about yesterday, I would say real bariatric surgery is far more beneficial from a health standpoint than liposuction would be because we talked about how the long term 20, 25 year follow up a patient who get bariatric surgery. They have much greater and much more sustained weight loss and health benefits. Like you can cure diabetes in like a couple days after getting bariatric surgery. It just like goes away, which is pretty wild. Whereas liposuction does not have any of those benefits outside of cosmetic effects. Yeah, I think if for whatever reason you're getting like this rural liposuction, don't think that liposuction. Maybe that or if the liposuction would somehow improve adherence to other lifestyle changes, if you felt like I'm going to pay for this procedure from an aesthetic standpoint or because I feel like it's going to jump start my progress. That's really going to help keep me motivated and it does as far as improving adherence to a health promoting dietary pattern and exercise like cool. But if you're just like moving it around, from like front to back, I don't know that that's the move. How do you guys personally take care of your mental emotional energy? I think that anybody who's involved, particularly the healthcare fields, you know, has there's a difficult balance between like taking care of yourself, the person and then carrying for others, but you went into this field to take care of others and some days are harder than others and you give more than you get and other days you get more than you give as far as how an individual needs to approach their own particular needs for a mental health standpoint. I think services that are underutilized or mental health services if you feel better talking to a counselor or some sort of psychiatrist that can all be useful. Me personally, I have found reasonably good sort of balance if you will by trying to maintain a set of boundaries that works for me. Meaning that I can it's pretty easy to get kind of really involved in somebody else's sort of like this is their journey and this is how I'm helping them and these are all their issues that we're kind of working out but I have to also step back and understand that's not my particular situation and in addition it's maybe not okay if they're emailing me five or six times a day and so creating those boundaries where hey this is the expectations that we're setting as far as communication like frequency, so what I can be responsible for but I think overall having some sort of boundaries as the professionals and boundaries are useful. I think also kind of understanding the field that you're getting into kind of expect some of this and then using like mental health services would also be useful like people need counselors need counselors it's very underutil this is underutilized and then I don't know that there's any reliable like a specific approach that I think universally works for all folks so finding your kind of stuff that that makes it viable for you can be useful. I mean burnout is super common in medicine and for you know among some specialties more than others I get to see horrible things very frequently and it burnout is common around me as well among kind of fellow fellow clinicians so I definitely agree with everything that Jordan said with respect to professional boundaries outside of work for example if you feel like you're having issues from a mental health standpoint using those kind of resources as far as my own personal habits on this front this is a big part of why you know people say how is it that you've gone like a decade and missed one week of training it's like well this is why I make sure that I train because for me personally that is my most useful way to maintain some kind of control over my life some aspect of consistency something that I enjoy that I can look forward to whenever I do end up getting out of the hospital whether it's earlier late I plan to train regardless and don't skip that session even you know if it's 10 or 11 at night and did that plenty of times in residency because that gave me a sense of continued control over my life that's a big part is if you feel like you're not in control right so loss of self efficacy over your situation loss of autonomy that can be a big deal and then similarly you know if you you know if you're a coach biting off more than you can chew can be a big problem right in terms of your client load for example something that you actually do have control over there was a period of time when I was in residency where I was doing similarly like multiple jobs like I do right now but with respect to residency I did not have control over my life I had to be in the hospital certain times and responsible for whatever was going on there at that particular time and then I had these other things coaching and you know some telemedicine stuff I was doing outside that I did have some control over but I definitely bit off more than I could chew and I like cracked pretty hard around that period of time recognized that I'd been off way more than I could chew but at the same time I knew that I was still training and I knew that it was temporary and that it wasn't going to be like that forever right and so ultimately fortunately I was able to get through that and have other things that I can kind of look forward to and enjoy but I've definitely am currently in a period of time where I'm actually trying to scale back a little bit of how much I'm doing because like do I really need to be doing this much right now as far as all the things that I tackle and work on at the same time and the very clear and obvious answer is no despite the fact that I still do them so so definitely easier said than done and I don't have it perfect at either but everything Jordan said as well as paying you know paying attention to you know your workload to the extent that you have control over it if you have more control over it that's awesome and and scaling back if you need to and my bias is definitely training as far as a some measure of consistency and consistency and something I do have control over that maybe something different for you take advantage of that whatever that maybe how our lipid panels affected by dieting so in general let's talk about after you've lost weight right so you've died it and lost weight and then we'll talk about what happens while you're actively dieting so after you lost weight usually a five to ten percent weight loss produces a about ten to 15 percent reduction in LDL and maybe a little bit greater reduction in triglycerides which can be useful particularly if you were carrying too much body fat before if you lose more weight you can see a greater decrease in those numbers right so if you lost 20 percent body weight you may see a given greater decrease in your LDL and your triglycerides and in general HDL tends to stay the same if you start exercise at the same time HDL may even increase overall good now the nuance here is that if you were a candidate for statins prior to losing weight meaning that your 10 year risk of having a bad outcome so you're a 10 year risk of having a heart attack or stroke or something like that was high and you were you know a good candidate for statins the treatment goal for LDL reduction is 50 percent five zero reduce your LDL by 50 percent and so if the you know the average amount of LDL reduction you can expect by reducing your body weight five to ten percent which is a pretty substantial weight loss right is you know 10 to 15 percent you're not getting there you're less than three less than this sort of that minimum threshold so it doesn't mean that you shouldn't even try to lose weight just take the statins for big pharma not what I'm saying it's just that we should not avoid medications when they provide clear benefit and it doesn't mean that the person maybe necessary really needs to be on a statin forever it's just to reduce that risk substantially going forward maybe that's the initial initial movement what happens to the lipid panel while you're actually you think about this as the body fat you're actually liberating a lot of stored fat into the bloodstream and you're using it for fuel and so a blood test particularly a cholesterol test is a snapshot in time of how much fat is in your blood how much fat is being carried around by certain proteins in your blood and so let's say then you stick the needle in vain pull out the blood oh crap there's way more fat in your blood at this particular time it's like well yeah it's on its way to the muscle tissue to be oxidized for fuel for example and so you see that all the time that people their triglyceride levels will be significantly elevated while they're losing weight sometimes even their LDL will be elevated while they're losing weight it usually doesn't happen after you've lost weight and your weight is plateaued but certainly during weight loss so the recommendation for lipid panel intervals is about is every six months I believe after you've initiated it all of some clinicians will do three month intervals I when I was actively seeing patients and somebody was trying to lose weight for lifestyle we were trying lifestyle recommendations initially I would effectively try to schedule that second lipid test till after a period of time we're giving them to lose weight and then maintain it meaning that if it's going to take you more than three months to kind of lose the weight I would extend the interval time so that you are weight neutral maintaining your weight your new lower weight before I tested got another lipid test yeah I don't think there's a great reason to check lipid panel super frequently regardless I mean I definitely every three months is I think too frequent to be super useful I would just not check blood tests while you are actively aggressively trying to lose weight and then check things you know like that after things have stayed less so good the new client reports eating below their total daily energy expenditure but isn't losing weight what do I imagine we can't instantly correct under reporting specifically do you still prescribe an amount of calories that should result in weight loss per the NIH if they report a total daily energy intake lower than the prescription so basically somebody saying I'm eating these calories we're not losing weight what do so just like I was talking about in the nutrition lecture yesterday if the first you check the adherence right so it's like hey look are you sticking to this plan they say yes and you're like okay cool and you're taking them at their word and they're not losing weight at that calorie level I would reduce calories and the story if you do that again and they're still not losing weight I kind of go through the same process again we've just reduced another 250 to 500 calories the reporting being very adherent and still not losing weight at that point when I check for adherence so let's say two weeks have gone by they still have a loss weight asking them hey how's your adherence been any issues we talk about it I usually ask for proof not into what like I'm being an investigator here interrogating them but I want to see like their my fitness path log or however they're tracking their food or something like that just kind of make sure like you know that they're counting things correctly there's not some sort of error I also check for things that people don't tend to count certain condiments sugar sweeten beverages alcohol stuff like that issues things that people have trouble logging they're like yeah I don't log any of my coax because it's liquid so you'd be surprised and I'm you know this obviously happened sometimes otherwise it wouldn't have the story but that alcohol and condiments tend to be like the three biggest offenders they're first things that people don't track and then snacks so it's like you know are you snacking on stuff in between meals and you know again this is all in the context of somebody who's trying to lose weight and we've just lowered calories and it still doesn't work and so if nothing appears odd there then I lower I lower calories again I'm not averse to continue to lower calories unless I suspect there's this really big adherence issue you know now obviously we had a client for a while who was you know over 200 pounds and then was reporting not losing weight at 1200 calories but reported 7 out of 7 every day she was very adherent I was like well let me see I'd love to see them I fitness pal you know reports I was like oh yeah they're they're on my phone I don't know how to get them to you and I was like whoa yeah you just take them screenshots and just let the CM see what you're eating it's like it seems like a long process like I don't know that I can get them to they was some resistance and I got it and so the whole thing wasn't be like gotcha ha ha ha you know this is the issue the thing was like well let's address the actual problem right what are the issue you know what sort of barriers do we have to adherence and we had an even barrier to admitting there was a problem with adherence and so again the thing isn't gotcha the thing is all right we have an issue here what's how do we address the communication thing first and then figure out strategies to overcome the adherence issue so that's how I address the issue and just some common things that I've seen over time uh Austin you have anything to add I don't have anything to add to that all right how can you best mitigate the effect of shift work like 24 hour shifts such as naps to catch up on sleep uh and then how do you not know Cbo yourself into thinking you'll have a bad day because you didn't get enough sleep or some other factor that is far from ideal I can start so this is something that I think both of us have some experience with uh having been through periods of time already did 24 28 hour shifts um somewhat regularly and there's not a great way to get you know quality sleep during that period of time particularly when those shifts can be unpredictable so there may have been some of those shifts where I was able to get some sleep during the shift there's somewhere I had to be awake, alert and doing things the entire time and obviously there ends up being a consequence afterwards some of those days after the shift will crash harder than others or if you end up getting some sleep on the shift maybe you don't sleep as much and so the unpredictability the variability is problematic it results in you generally not feeling awesome and I think that is unfortunately probably part of the deal with doing 24 hour shifts with any degree of regularity is you're not going to feel completely awesome or completely normal all the time if they're more spaced out and relatively infrequent then you can try to get on as consistent of a sleep schedule as you can in between and that overstores some semblance of normal sleep um but just the idea was sleep in general and that this should be the takeaway if you listen to our podcast on sleep that we did with our friend Dr Gordon is that consistency is kind of what tends to be the name of the game here in particular if we can get like our patients who we have with the with insomnia if we can get them waking up at the same time every single day then that ends up resulting in developing sufficient sleep drive over time such that they end up kind of falling into a more normal sleep a sleep wake cycle rhythm but obviously this is a big barrier to having a consistent sleep schedule you just have to do the best you can in terms of consistency as far as the other part of the question where it had to do with not kind of crushing yourself by thinking you're going to have a bad session just because you didn't get enough sleep or some other factor I think this comes into the discussion I had earlier comparing external versus internal load so external load being the absolute weight on the bar whereas internal load describes the response to that training stimulus that we measure using RPE I think that if people who have excessive focus on the importance or the significance of the external load they put all their value and self-worth on the absolute weight on the bar I think you're going to have some trouble with this situation right because you're going to put so much value on lifting a particular weight on a particular particular data particular time and your life the cards are just not going to fall that way you're going to get to that day that time go to lift that weight and maybe it doesn't go right and that's tough that's why we like having more as Jordan said maliability flexibility in your training program where you view the training process differently you don't view the training process is something where you have to lift a specific weight rather you're saying I'm the weight the weight on the bar the rep I'm doing is merely a strategy to elicit this response that I'm trying to get right and in that sense you can change the weight on the bar and not freak out about it rather you can pack yourself on the back for saying I got the desired stimulus for where I am today at this particular time based on how I'm performing at this moment given everything else in my life that I may or may not have control over right so it can almost become a win when you go into that session you use your auto regulation strategy like RPE you adjust the load accordingly you complete the whole session that's awesome that's a win you're doing more than just about anybody else out there who is doing 24 hour shifts guaranteed instead of viewing it as I was supposed to squat 500 today right but I could only squat 455 I suck big difference in how you view that in terms of the training process so this has a lot to do with kind of how if we're going to be goal oriented the nature of goals that we use or the goals we use performance based right where you insist on performing lifting a particular weight are they outcome based like I'm lifting to win only if you ain't first your last right or are they process based goals right where I'm going to train all four sessions that I supposed to do I'm going to get my conditioning in etc and that's my win for the week because my life is crazy like this so that's the way I view this is just reframing how I view the training process in general yeah I think the only thing I have to add is like if you if you were trying to set yourself up for success you would want to control the or maximize the variables that are under your control as much as possible so for example you're on 24 hour shift that doesn't you know that doesn't mean yeah I'm going to skip three different meals and just have you know breakfast for example before leaving the hospital and three red bulls yeah exactly right yeah that's going to be so you know if you have your nutrition relatively under control with the health promoting dietary pattern you know your training is set up to allow some flexibility rather than having very rigid processes and then again ultimately a scribing less sort of importance to any single session any single exercise or any single sort of even input into your training I mean I would just assume that you're going to PR anyway for example yeah like if it's me if I mean I don't work outside of barbell medicine anymore this is my main baby but I wish I could get a sign to a night shift because if I go on night shift I'm going to PR historically whenever I'm on night shift PR start raining out of nowhere I have no idea why I have no reason to stay up at night now I'm not into generate so I can't do it but yeah I would just I would just assume all of the things be equal that you're going to do great so having that positive kind of outlook on stuff uh good nutrition and then I don't know that I would recommend naps because I just feel like that's not really going to help it's like it could help acute performance but if it to the extent of compromise is sleep drive later on it's probably net negative so probably wouldn't do that we just go in and train and go on with my life because that's a good summary of you know this whole deal that's right train and go on with your life yeah exactly very cool well thank you so much for coming out here Norfolk for our first time in our back really appreciate it

=== FILE: A Doctor Weighs In On Caffeine for Health And Performance [7TD0khFEIXo].txt ===

Hey everyone, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel where we bring modern medicine to strength conditioning and strength conditioning to modern medicine under host doctor Jordan Vaganbaum and this episode is all about caffeine. Caffeine is widely used in United States as a recent survey reports that 85% of the population consumes at least one caffeinated beverage per day. The average intake is about 165 milligrams per day, which is about 2 cups of coffee or 4 cups of tea, whereas the 90th percentile for caffeine intake is reported to be about 380 milligrams per day or 4 cups of coffee. Given the prevalence of caffeine use, it should come as no surprise. There's a ton of research out there that's going to help answer our questions on this particular topic. Caffeine works in multiple ways, many of which haven't been fully fleshed out. For example, there are a number of findings from animal models and isolated tissue studies, which is basically looking at how caffeine works on single muscle fibers that really haven't been replicated in human studies. In any case, based on existing evidence, we can only say that caffeine tends to do the following things in humans. So, thing 1. It increases calcium release in the muscle tissue, so that's cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle and smooth muscle, which result in a number of actions such as increased muscle contraction, force potential and increased muscle excitability. It also inhibits phosphodiesterase enzymes to increase intracellular, cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, which basically have many different actions or secondary messengers, and it changes the cells excitability and function. It also blocks adenosine receptors, with varying potency at each receptor. Increases nor epinephrine release from the sympathetic nervous system, basically your fire flight, catecholomines, overall there are a number of mechanisms that caffeine uses, though again, they're not fully understood. At present, the increase in excitability of the muscle tissue via caffeine-induced calcium increase, appear to play a significant role. The current recommendation regarding safety of caffeine intake basically states that caffeine intakes up to 400 milligrams per day, which is about 4 to 5 cups of coffee is safe for healthy, non-pregnant adults, and generally does not produce negative side effects. To that end, regular caffeine ingestion appears to be well tolerated, and does not appear to be reliably-relinked to disease. Sodosis are exceedingly rare, as well as the LD50, which stands for the lethal dose 50, the dose needed to kill about 50% of the test population, is about 150 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight, or 75 to 100 cups of coffee for 70 kilo, 154 pound adult, depending on individual sensitivities. A few important things to note regarding caffeine and health. So first off, caffeine intake does increase the force of each heartbeat, but tends to not actually increase heart rate in most individuals. With respect to blood pressure, many folks will say that drinking caffeine or coffee increases blood pressure, although we don't see that in habitual consumers, so people who drink caffeine or consume coffee regularly, although you do tend to see a small increase in it in caffeine, naive individuals, and those who are very, very sensitive to it. In case you were wondering, yes, coffee does tend to increase your own production, and your infrequency if dose of 250 to 300 milligrams of coffee per day, and same thing with gut motility. So you might have to go. Respect to specific diseases. There are a number of studies suggesting that regular coffee intake may reduce the risk of heart attack, also diabetes, and some cancers, even at relatively high intake, greater than four cups per day. In that same breath, however, there are also other studies suggesting no risk reduction with these diseases with regular coffee consumption. Though, again, there aren't really studies showing an increased risk with increased coffee consumption. And again, not all caffeine comes from coffee, which makes it hard to confidently describe the relationship of caffeine intake with all these potential disease states. So overall, the existing literature suggests that moderate to even high intakes of caffeine 400 to 600 milligrams of caffeine per day is not associated with any increase in cardiovascular disease risk, cardiac rhythmia, any increased risk of heart failure, or pie blood pressure, or even blood pressure changes, and those who regularly consume caffeine. As mentioned before, consumption of moderate amounts of caffeine is associated with an actual reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease, although that is complicated because again, coffee and caffeine are not the same thing. There might be multiple things at play there. Taken together, I feel pretty comfortable in saying that habitual caffeine or coffee intake is unlikely to be the smoking gun with respect to developing any particular disease, like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, etc. Provided the person tolerates it well, but it's probably not saving anyone's life either. I think the biggest potential health risk from caffeine intake or coffee intake probably has to do with individuals sleep patterns. This is a very complex relationship when you actually look at the literature. There are unreliable findings with respect to caffeine intake dosing and timing relative to time to sleep and how that actually affects sleep. So I don't want to say that there's any one particular sort of relationship here. It does appear that in Westernized societies that timing people's caffeine intake very close to bedtime, so even up to six hours before bed may negatively impact their sleep that night. They call it this coffee cycle, so effectively drink coffee because it improves your performance, which we'll talk about shortly. Then you go through a period of coffee deprivation, which is during the day and during sleep. That actually may be affects your sleep overnight in a negative way and you wake up in the morning and you're more fatigued and so you drink more coffee. That relationship again is very complex, however. It appears that many individuals can consume coffee with really no impact on their sleep. It also appears that you might need some additional triggers to reduce your actual sleep quality or sleep quantity. So overall I think there needs to be this sort of individual assessment based on how folks actually respond to caffeine. My general advice is to avoid anything with caffeine in it about six to eight hours prior to bed unless you've again previously tolerated it well and it doesn't affect your sleep quantity. So how much you're sleeping and sleep quality. Again, this is really complex, so I wouldn't go around saying that caffeine negatively affects your sleep. I think it's highly individualized and very, very complex. Check out the study by Ocaligan about sleep and caffeine intake and you can start to get a better appreciation of just how complex this issue is. There are many different ways to administer a deliver caffeine, so let's talk about the different ways. First up is caffeine gum. There is a markedly faster rate of absorption with gum compared to other ways of administering caffeine. For example, when you use a 200mg dose, they see a very large increase in plasma caffeine concentration, so caffeine in your blood between five and 15 minutes after ingesting it. Capsules. Basically, the largest increase in caffeine concentration seen in the blood is seen about 25 to 45 minutes after consumption. So slower than gum. You can also do mouth rinse in, so swish and spit of caffeine is relatively new. You don't actually swallow the solution, but you kind of swirl around your mouth for about five to 20 seconds. Unfortunately, data looking at blood levels of caffeine, report no increases in blood caffeine concentration, so it doesn't actually appear that this necessarily works, although people are trying this. Energy drinks, this is a huge topic and people are very, very interested. A number of studies have actually investigated the effects of commercially available energy drinks, such as red bull, which basically contains 160mg of caffeine, 2000mg of touring, and about 10 grams of glucose per five-hour GCs. While caffeine is shown to potentially improve performance and isolation, the current report on energy drinks, shoulder shrug, because it has all these different things in it, and it doesn't appear to actually work as well as caffeine. Interestingly, the blood concentration of caffeine appears to rise more slowly and are overall lower in when caffeine is obtained from energy drinks than compared to when drinking warm coffee. And the last way that people are administering caffeine is through the nose via an intranasal spray 20 seconds. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually increase blood levels of caffeine and doesn't appear to actually improve performance when tested. So there are many different ways to administer caffeine. Overall, oral caffeine is rapidly and completely absorbed. About 99% is absorbed within 45 minutes of ingestion, provided it's not taken via this swishenspit, like oral rinse or nasal misting. Caffeine metabolism is actually increased, meaning caffeine is broken down faster by individuals who smoke, if they're fasting or vigorous exercise, whereas metabolism is actually slowed down, perhaps to a clinically insignificant degree by grapefruit. An important note is that repeated administration of caffeine doesn't really change its pharmacokinetics, so it's absorption and time to peak in the body. What people commonly talk about with respect to caffeine is tolerance, but tolerance is not observed for all effects of caffeine, such as the cognitive and physical performance improvements, those seem to persist, even though you're getting some tolerance effect. You've mostly become tolerant to physiological changes like changes in heart rate and blood pressure that only occur in caffeine naive individuals, but not necessarily in those who are official consumers. That being said, there are withdrawal symptoms, sometimes seen following caffeine cessation. Symptoms include headache, irritability, nervousness, and a reduction in energy, and at this time, the physiological basis for these symptoms are unknown. Although the development of withdrawal symptoms might indicate an addictive property, caffeine does not actually have a convincing profile as an addictive drug. Dozing caffeine can get a little bit complicated, but let's start out with what the evidence says. A number of recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis indicate that the urgogenic or performance enhancing dose of caffeine falls somewhere in this 3-9 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight range. However, the correct dose for an individual is going to differ based on the source of caffeine, the specific exercise test, and likely further vary between individuals based on their individual physiology, preferences, et cetera. From our practical standpoint, I like when individuals start on the lower end that 3 milligrams per kilogram. So if you have a 70 kilo or 154 pound individual, and coffee has 100 milligrams, we'll say of caffeine per cup. Two cups of coffee gives you 200 milligrams of caffeine, and that's right at that 3 milligrams per kilo level. They might need more than that to actually see a performance benefit. But in any case, that's a good place to start on the low end and take about 60 minutes prior to exercise, and that should give most folks an urgogenic or performance enhancing benefit. Individual preferences with respect to caffeine source, sensitivity, et cetera, should always be taken in a consideration, and the dose should be tailored appropriately. So overall, I like starting at the low end of the range, 3 milligrams per kilo body weight, and seeing how folks do, if they see a performance improvement there, that's great. If they don't see a performance improvement, and they don't have any untoward side effects based on their preferences, and their individual physiology might increase that dose a little bit working up until we see an effect. Again, with respect to tolerance, the main thing that we see is a reduction or attenuation of the physiological side effects, heart rate, blood pressure, increases, and stuff like that. We don't really see the reduction in cognitive or performance benefits, which is good. Which means you don't necessarily need a caffeine holiday unless you're trying to sort of assess out some maybe sleep issue that you feel like you're having from this, or others sort of side effect that you feel like it's due to caffeine. That's probably not worth doing from a performance improvement standpoint, meaning if you take a break from caffeine for a week, you're probably not going to come back and have improved results when you start using caffeine again in the gym. You might feel a little bit more amped up, but as far as the actual data on physical performance probably not. Saying all of that, I don't know that every single workout is the most important work out of your life, and you actually need a performance improving performance enhancing sort of substance every single time. My personal opinion is that the most important workouts that you do should probably, you could reason to take caffeine before them. That's fine. And again, not every workout is the most important workout of your life. So for me, days one and two, I usually take caffeine beforehand, and then on days three and four, I typically don't unless I'm tired, in which case I do. Because that happens. The main thing is I try to avoid taking caffeine within that six to eight hour range before it's time to go to bed. Based on the most recent systematic reviews and meta analyses, caffeine ingestion does appear to improve both cognitive and physical performance. With specific physical performance, we're talking about aerobic endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, power, jumping performance, et cetera. But how much does caffeine actually move the needle? So for aerobic endurance, when you pull all the studies together, you see about an average of 16% increase until the time to exhaustion on tasks like run or cycle to exhaustion at 80% of the VO2 max. So, there's back to muscular strength. We tend to see a 3% increase in 1 RM and vertical jump when you, again, you pull all the studies testing this sort of stuff together. When we look at how fast individuals can actually complete an aerobic task, specifically in the 45 second to eight minute range, we typically see that they're about one to two percent faster with caffeine. In general, there's a larger effect. The shorter the event is, even though there is data showing improvements in endurance and long distance events, but with respect to speed, we're talking about one to two percent improvements in that 45 second to eight minute range with potentially a bigger effect in the shorter distance. Also, again, improves things like power, jumping. And as we mentioned earlier, cognitive functions such as vigilance, so your alertness, reaction time, memory, reasoning, learning, decision making, and reduces errors in both folks who had a good night asleep and who are sleep deprived. Overall, the data is pretty robust supporting an improvement. Although one caveat, most of the studies are performed in men only. There are a handful of studies on women, specifically with respect to physical performance and shows an improvement there as well. Although when they use lower doses, so one point five milligrams per kilo body weight, it appears to only be in muscular strength, not necessarily muscular endurance, but again, there are other studies which are all linked in the description below. Alright, so that's a wrap on caffeine. In summary, caffeine is super common. 85 percent of individuals in the United States consume at least one caffeinated beverage per day. It works via a bunch of different mechanisms. Ultimately, with respect to physical performance, probably just increasing the muscles excitability as far as dosine. We're looking at three to nine milligrams per kilogram body weight, start on the lower and work up over time. As far as the type of caffeine, would prefer a liquid beverage. Coffee is great. Should you prefer that, but other other sources as well. Probably avoid the switch and spit and the intranasal administration. With respect to health, there does seem to be a net benefit with respect to caffeine intake. Particularly if it comes from coffee, although individuals who are very sensitive to it are not taller at well, obviously should avoid it. With respect to sleep, would recommend avoiding caffeine intake about six to eight hours prior to sleep if you find your more sensitive to that. You can even push that back further, although again, the relationship between sleep and caffeine intake is very, very complicated. And then finally, caffeine does appear to have a pretty good size effect on a bunch of different physical and cognitive performance tasks. So if you're looking to improve your performance, you're looking for a little leg up, caffeine pre-workout about 60 minutes or pre-test perhaps about 60 minutes may improve your performance. So that's it on caffeine. Thank you guys so much for watching. Make sure you subscribe to get updates on all the latest content. Make sure you hit the like button if you did indeed like the video.

=== FILE: A Full Day of Eating to Gain Muscle w⧸ Dr. Jordan Feigenbaum [O2lxBRCaHKk].txt ===

Good morning everybody and welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel, we bring modern medicine to strengthening and strengthening to modern medicine. I'm your host Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum today. It is a diet vlog. If you guys don't know, I am moving up a weight class to 105 kilo class. It's 231 pounds. I normally sit at 1.98 or the 205 is a penultimate federation. I'm competing in, but I decided to take a plunge, move up a weight class, have some numbers I want to hit and I feel like I'm kind of out growing the 90 kilo with a 93 kilo weight class. So I'm going to take you guys through a day of eating, now that I'm trying to gain weight. So yeah, this is what I eat on a normal basis. Let's get right into it with my favorite meal of the day breakfast. All right, so as you guys can see, it's going to be an omelet and oatmeal. I'm trying to hit a specific amount of macros per day in order to gain weight. So right now my numbers are 200 grams of protein, 500 grams of carbohydrates and 100 grams of fat per day in total. I generally eat 45 meals a day. So this is meal number one and then we'll probably try to split up the protein throughout all of those meals. And because reading so many carbohydrates, it's going to look like a lot less animal source protein. Totally fine because the essential amino acid content is still going to be pretty high per meal. So I'm not worried at all about micro managing my essential amino acid intake. All right, so let's get to cooking. Okay, started with the bacon. I don't have bacon every day of the week. Usually three times a week or less just kind of keep my process needed to take in check. On days that I don't have bacon, I usually add an extra egg yolk to make up for the fat that's in this glorious goodness. So that's my bacon. I'm going to cook that first and then add some egg to it. Now because my carbohydrates are so high, I'm actually going to have end up having a lot less protein from like animal sources that you guys think just do to those trace proteins and those carbohydrates. So yeah, 17 grams of protein from egg. We've got six grams from the bacon for one serving of that. So that puts us at 23 grams of protein. Then we're going to have seven grams here from one serving of cheese. So now we're 30 grams of protein and then I'm going to do three servings of oatmeal this morning. And that's going to be another 15 grams. So that puts us at 45 grams of protein for the meal, which is going to be totally sufficient for my total essential amino acid needs per meal. And then my protein goal per meal is right around that 40 to 50 grams of protein. Just depending on how many meals I end up having during the day. So good start to the morning and then I also have some blueberries that I'm going to end up having two servings of to get my total fruit and vegetable servings in the morning. So another question is going to be about the egg situation here. So why egg whites over whole eggs? Why did you have only one whole egg? Is it about dietary cholesterol? Not really. I don't think dietary cholesterol tends to be a big predictor of blood cholesterol levels. Except in folks who are either really good at absorbing dietary cholesterol or people with other sort of congenital issues with cholesterol production or removal. So some folks will have to cut their dietary cholesterol down in order to reduce cholesterol levels. I think one thing we can do to promote health with respect to cholesterol levels is actually keep in our total dietary saturated fat intake down to less than 10% of total daily calories. And so I'll show you guys how I do that. But I wouldn't really worry about dietary cholesterol unless you're in one of those categories to either absorb very, very efficiently or has some other congenital disorder like familial hyper cholesterol, theemia or something like that. All right, bacon's cooks. We're going to add the egg to that. And I left this cook. Hopefully I get a good armlet turn out today. It would be my luck that Juan Filme and I would be not so great. Yeah, and so the other thing I do to make sure that I'm getting the right amount of carbohydrates and calories, et cetera, if I'm making something in my kitchen, I'm just going to measure it because it's already here, right? I'm not going to try to eyeball it too much, especially if it's a change from my norm. Now, when I was maintaining weight, so it would be three servings here that's 120 grams. When I was maintaining weight, I could like eyeball stuff very, very accurately. But since I've made this dietary change, I know that I'm going to have to take more specific changes here. So I've got three servings here, oatmeal, add a little bit of water, cook that. Same thing with the cheese. Just turn the scale on. Just do one serving of cheese here. Easy way for pork and control. A lot of times when people like, oh, I'm eating this much. I'm not gaining weight or I'm eating this much. I'm not losing weight. First thing we want to make sure is that adherence is good and they're actually taking the numbers. They say they are. And then overcoming those obstacles that are preventing them from hitting the correct numbers. So first thing first is just making sure that the numbers are accurate. This looks good. Fold number one. It's a little diner style omelet. I'm kind of bummed because all week I've been having really good looking omelets. Now of course, with the camera roll, and this is very average looking, but we'll play it. All of my other car and protein sources, I'm about 25 grams of fat. I'll get you the final numbers. Let me look at the whole meal. So I'm not going to add any more fat to the oatmeal, but I will add some blueberries. So wash these blueberries. Yes, today. I'm going to add about 150 grams, 160 grams rather, which would be about two servings. You can use a cup of measuring cup for this, but since I have the scale out, I just use that. That looks pretty good. All right. Add a little Stivia little cinnamon. Mix it up. We'll have breakfast. All right, so this is breakfast. Got the tri-fold omelet. We'll bake it in it. Got the massive serving of oatmeal this morning. It's not my best work aesthetically, but I'm not a gourmet chef. This one would be eating or not going to make you guys wash me eat, but here's the macros for this meal. And we'll catch you at the next meal. All right, what's up? We're back with meal number two. This is usually something that's grab and go for me. Usually in between getting worked on. And then it's also my pre-workout meal. Now general rules for me when I talk to people about pre-imposed work out nutrition, I typically say, hey, we should have more carbohydrates in those meals and less fat. The idea is that if your calorie restricted at all satiety or feelings of fullness are really really important in order to improve adherence. And so what I'd like to do is if we're going to have a lot of carbohydrates or more carbohydrates in particular meals, I think if we put the fat in the other meals, that might improve satiety, might improve adherence. Additionally, increasing the fat content or the fiber content of a meal tends to make it take longer to get from mouth through the digestive system and into the bloodstream. So those are more considerations when we don't either have a lot of time between the meal and when you're training or if somebody's in a calorie restricted state. If you are on a calorie surplus, I don't know that you need to take those steps. And additionally, if you have enough time between the meal you're consuming and when you're going to train or exercise, I don't think that you need to take those steps. So this is going to be a pretty balanced meal for me. Again, I pretty much eat four or five pretty similar meals similar from my macronutrant and total calorie perspective. Maybe a little bit more carbohydrates in this meal and my postwork out meal, but nothing crazy. And I am going to have some fat with this meal. So I know people are going to go, what the heck, man, why are you in fat? And your pre-imposed work out meal. It just doesn't matter. I don't know that we need to micro-manage things that much. The broader dietary pattern is probably more important. And then yeah, adherence. So if we're going to do something pretty quick, I'm not going to have to cook hardly anything and I'll take you guys through it. Greed yogurt, two servings of fruit in this one. So we're going to have all stew of banana. So again, I'm trying to get somewhere like ten total servings of fruit and vegetables. So this will be three and four. Maybe close to five because this is a fairly large apple. I'm going to add some honey to the yogurt because I want that. Would you some more oatmeal? Because I like oats and I'll put some peanut butter in there. That'll be pretty good. So the only thing that I actually need to make is going to be the oatmeal. And again, just one strategy that I have for making sure that I'm getting the right amount of carbohydrates in this case. I'm just going to weigh it. I mean, my kitchen doesn't really add too much time. Three servings, 120. There you go, 120 grams. So most of the oats that I make end up being from the microwave, Tom, the amally disagrees with me on that these are actually quality oats. He prefers the slow cooked on the oven oats. I don't know. I don't have a preference. I don't want to make that big of a mess. So microwave oats for me. Now the reason I put it back on the scales because I'm actually going to measure out my peanut butter that I'm going to put in here. Somebody do one serving. I think nut butter is another sort of untracked calorie dense foods or hard to hard or to track calorie dense foods tend to be problematic for those who are in a calorie-restricted state or trying to lose weight. So they'll just eyeball, like, oh, those two tablespoons and then they'll end up lick in the lid or have an extra half a serving or something. There's just too many calories for them to deal with and actually push them over their calorie goal. So I just put it on the scale. I'm going to measure it out. This is 32 grams for serving. I would do the same thing if I was like, put it on bread or toast or anything like that. I would literally just measure it out. And if that's not something that you want to do, I just, these foods are harder to track than something like almonds where you could literally count out or just weigh the actual mass of the, I take the mass of the almonds based on the serving size. So 32 grams will just do this little spoon. The cool thing is it turns to like this, like, molten peanut butter, which I really do like. So this is tear it out. So that's 24 grams. So I have a little bit more dirty almost there. Perfect. Okay. So I'll add a little bit of cinnamon to this and that'll be the meal. All right. So this is definitely not high class dining, but this is what I'm eating during a normal work day. So you've got the serving of yogurt, a little bit of honey in there, two and a half servings of fruit, three servings of oatmeal, plus some peanut butter. And then yeah, wait about two hours after this before I go train. And that's totally personal preference. Some people like training on a full stomach, some people like training on a empty stomach, but for me, about two hours is a nice sweet spot. All right, just got back home, took a shower, changed. It is time for meal number three, post workout meal. What I like to do is actually make my last two meals together and then I split them. So we're going to do the bro dinner. This is again, not going to make cooking, but this is just what I eat on a regular basis. We're going to make some chicken using the suvi. We're going to make a rice and the rice maker and then also some vegetables. Make sure that I get my greens in as well. Let's go ahead and make dinner. All right, so the suvi is coming up to temperature. So basically what this is, the water immersion cooker. Mine is from a no-bub, had this thing for like two years. I use it all the time for food prep because it is amazing. So effectively, this keeps this water bath at the exact temperature. I set it to for chicken. I usually like 150-5 degrees in order to chicken the proper temperature for it to be done is like a 165 internal temperature. So what I do is I cook it in here first up to 155 degrees for an hour. And basically it's ready to go at that point to finish. And so how I finish is going to be either on a cast iron, a pan which will do tonight or on a grill or something. Because basically food coming out of the suvi, if you're going to eat it right out of the suvi, it's you want to do like a shredding chicken or something like that because it's missing. Those really tasty bits on the outside of the meat, which is due to what's called the myard reaction. Myard was a French chemist and any event, the cross-linking of the proteins on the surface of the meat effectively make for these really tasty what are called ketosamines. And so in any event you can cook it first here in the suvi which I think for the price, these things are really really amazing. You can really make a lot of cool stuff. Not only just meat, you can make really good sweet potatoes, you can make yogurt, you can make the best poached eggs ever with this thing really, really simply and there's a bunch of cool recipes. But so yeah, we'll cook this for an hour, the chicken for an hour and here once this comes up to temperature, 155 degrees. We'll finish it on the cast iron, skill it in order to get that myard reaction that is nice browning on the actual chicken so it's tasty. And then while that's cooking, we'll also make some rice. So I'll get the rice going, well this is coming up to temperature and then get the chicken ready to cook in here. So for the rice, I just use a rice cooker. That's probably the cheapest rice cooker I found on Amazon again. I've had it for, I don't know, two years or something like that and it still works great. So what I'm going to do is actually make enough rice for this meal and the next meal, it's typically how I do my last two meals of the day. I just eat the same thing twice or similar thing twice. It's a really easy way to go about your food prep if you're kind of doing this on the go, just make a little bit more or double what you're normally going to consume. And so that way you'll have leftovers free to the next meal or the next day, really easy way if you don't want to do a whole bunch of meal prep at once. So we're going to do five and a half servings here, which we'll split that up. I'll probably have two-thirds here, this is a post workout meal, so I'll have a little more carbs and then one-third of it after it's cooked for the last meal of the day, the fourth meal of the day. So while this is heating up, I'm actually going to get the chicken prepared in that back in the sealed bag. I don't typically weigh the chicken per portion before I cook it. I do it afterwards. I know that most of the ways that I cook it, so I do a sous-vee in the oven, using a cast iron pan or grill in it or whatever the chicken is going to lose about the same amount of weight when I cook it. So I'm looking for about 30 grams of chicken, 30 grams of protein from the chicken, which is going to be just under four ounces of cooked chicken in this manner. So you can use the USDA food database and kind of look up the way you're cooking it and see what the cooked portion is. Otherwise you can weigh it raw and figure out the protein from that. So usually a palm-sized portion, a little palm-sized portion of chicken, cooked chicken is about four ounces, which is like 35 grams. I'm looking for just under that, so just under four ounces, about 3.7 ounces of cooked chicken or so. So in any event, get the chicken ready for this guy here. Alright, so the rice is done cooking. It is going off right now. The chicken, I pulled out of the sous-vee, it is resting over there. It doesn't quite look like it's perfectly done because the outside again is not brown, there's no myriad of reaction, no those tasty ketosamines there, waiting for me so I'm going to finish it on the cast iron grill. Now I've got to add a little butter to it and this actually brings up a good point. What do you do about added cooking fats if you're using them when you're counting your macros? Do you need to weigh it out or how do you kind of calculate these in? So I think here's a good point to make that I'm not necessarily concerned with people being accurate, make it sure they get every gram, every calorie accounted for, as long as they're doing it the same way each time, as long as they're precise. So I want you to do it the same way every single time and that'll allow you to make adjustments based on what you're actually doing. So for me I actually tend to count the cooking fats that I do cook with, even if some of it ends up still in the pan or some of it I don't actually consume. That's just the way I do it but if I didn't count it then when I made my adjustments to my macros later on, as long as they do the same way each time that would be okay. Alright, so the chickens almost done here. Easy to actually check if the internal temperature is up to the desired amount, so 165 for chicken to use a thermopens. So I'm going to check the internal temp, just stick it in, 165, 165, good, 65, good. Alright, so we're all good. So we'll pull this off, cut it up and then play it for you guys. Alright, so here is dinner number one post workout meals, four ounces cooked chicken, four servings of white rice, two servings of broccoli, a little bit of teriyaki there in the background and yeah, I feel the same way about sauces I do, about cooking fats. If you need to accurately measure everything because you're trying to limit something like saturated fat, like any other sort of dietary component in particular, then sure, measure them. But otherwise I'm more concerned with precision and consistency than I am with absolute accuracy. So if you're going to count them, just always count them. If you're not going to count them, don't count them and just make sure you're using the same amount when a regular basis. Alright, so this is the fourth meal. I'm going to eat this, read a little bit and yeah, let's do it. So this is the last meal of the day. It's just pretty much like the third meal set for where we've got edamame and a little bit less rice because this is not a post workout meal. So carbohydrates are a little bit less on this one than they were on the last meal. Let me show you guys, can you see that? We got a little more fat there. So we've got two servings of almonds. We've got two servings of edamame, one and a half servings of rice and then about four ounces cooked of chicken. And then that is all I'm going to eat for today. So I just want to go over some of the kind of finer points of the diet because everyone's going to ask, hey, how do I figure out how to do this myself? Like, okay, where's all this information? So I think the easiest way to start is figuring out your total daily calorie intake. What do you need? So you can use any one of the calculators online, they'll all give you a little bit different numbers. The ones that I prefer are the NIH, the National Institute of Health Body Planner. I'll link that in the description below or the Mifflim St. Geor equation. The NIH Body Planner is really cool. You can plug in a bunch of extra data. It's free and it's based on some really sound science. So that science and some additional data has what's helped build our nutrition template. That'll be all pretty soon, but yeah, it's a really cool little body planner if you put it on expert mode and show some of the advanced controls. So that's fun. But that just gives you a calorie number, right? So from there, you want to figure out if you're actually going to take the steps to kind of track like this, what should your macro's be? So first thing you figure out is your protein intake. And our general recommendation is 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day on the low end, 1.6. And then the high end is 3.1. If you're maintaining weight or gaining weight, you can be towards the lower end, towards the upper end, you'd be actively losing weight and very, very lean already and training hard. It's a little like that person, you know, getting ready for a bodybuilding show or somebody who's anoballically resistant. So if they're older than a medical condition or something else that makes them more anoballically resistant, most people get away between that 1.6 to 2.1.6 to 2.5 grams per kilo per day, that would be fine and you can do animal sources that could be plant-based sources as long as you're getting that much protein in per day, I would not micro-manor stats. So that's your protein intake and then the rest of your sort of energy intake. So carbs and fat should be basically up to personal preference. With the caveat that we think you should limit your saturated fat intake to 10% of your total daily calories or less. And if you want more information on that, you should read the science of red meat. So you can take an article that I wrote that's in the description below as well. How many carbs should you have? It's really in personal preference. I think a good place to start would be somewhere in that 3 gram of carbs per kilo per day. You know, if you have that many carbs available to you, you can go a little bit less than that. If you don't, if you're a calorie restricted diet or if you prefer to have more fat to the diet, again, keeping that saturated fat intake kind of rule if you will. In mind, and then of those carbohydrates, we think you should be getting trying to aim for 10 servings of fruit and vegetables per day. It could be 5 and 5, it could be 4 and 6, whatever way you want to slice it. I think today got pretty close. That's pretty normal day. So 8 to 10 servings a day is what I get. So it would encourage you to do the same. And then from there, you need to adjust your nutrition intake based on results. So if you're trying to lose weight, are you losing weight? Or if you're not, you need to reduce energy intake, usually from carbs and fat. If you're trying to gain weight, and then you know, your weekly average weight, for example, is not to go in up. You need to add fuel and get it should probably be carbs and fat. And if you're not into tracking like this, that's fine. There are other strategies that you can employ to get results. They could be meal plans, time restricted feeding windows. So not just one way to get any of that. This is the way that I like. And I think anytime that's always making a really significant change from their baseline diet and they're trying to actively gain weight or lose weight, then you probably need to take the few extra steps as far as measuring quantity. But yeah, this is my diet. Let's actually check. Let's look at my fitness pal. So I use this app. They're not paying me to say this. I don't even buy the subscription. So I'm just using the free one that I've been using for almost a decade now. Let's check out my macro. I got 203 grams, protein, 501 grams of carbohydrates, 100 grams of fat. So anything within plus or minus 5 grams, that's usually, I'm aiming for that's like good adherence. Let's see, 5 or intake. 58 grams, I recommend folks get between 3035 grams of fiber on a minimum. So 58 grams. I did that. A saturated fat intake was well under that 10% mark. I don't get any extra points for being well under 10%, but 10% is kind of like my upper mark. Yeah, I wouldn't really worry about that. And sodium, it's fine. It's just the stuff that's in food. I do add a little bit of salt to my food, but well under the recommendation of being less than 2400 milligrams per day. And yeah, so that is my diet for a day. You guys may ask in. I delivered.

=== FILE: At What Age Are You The Strongest？ [NqxKtTubqaQ].txt ===

Music Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum. We have Dr. Awesome Rocky in the studio live in the flesh. That's real. He's in town this week and we decided to answer some questions from the internet. Next question. This is actually a long question that I got. I try to make these questions as generalizable as possible so the most amount of people can get something out of it versus one individual person says, I have this very specific case getting answer my question. That's probably better suited for a console because there's probably more information than we need to get anyway. The thrust of this question was, what would be your estimation at what age that I will set my all-time one rep max PRs? With the idea of being like, I am this certain age, this guy was in his 30s for example. He was recently started training and he's like, you know, how long till I hit my lifetime best PRs. And like, is that different from, you know, based on his gender, right, man versus woman? Is it different based on his age? Like, if he was started earlier, is there a different trajectory? And the way I kind of answered this question is, I don't know how long that's going to take for you to reach your peak performance, but it is likely to be many, many years after you start training, unless something else outside of your control happens. Yeah. So, like something tragic, the car accident or you're otherwise stop training and, you know, are unable to actually continue on your upper trajectory. I don't think that there's a big difference in age or gender as far as what that trajectory looks like. I would expect people who are outside of the exception if someone was very, very young, like, pre-pubescent. I wouldn't expect like that trajectory to look the same as somebody who started, you know, in their mid teens. Sure. But I would expect a similar trajectory from somebody in their mid teens or twenties as somebody in their forties who, they both started training at the same time. The absolute amount of weight that they end up lifting may be different, but the relative improvement that's probably going to track similarly, and doesn't really matter if they're a matter woman either, at least as far as me predicting how they're going to do. And just, because I always have to drop David Ricks in here. There's lots of people that we could drop, like him as one, as one very good example. 58 years old, currently holds the all-time world record squat at 700, and I think it's 7-11 or 17 or something. I'm the only 25th of my life. I'm the only one who's been here. At the 93 kilo weight class, and I've seen him set or attempt a world record squat every year, seemingly since 2013 or his 53. And it's like, he's a machine. Yeah, he's, like, he's just a machine. Actually, that math doesn't really check out. If he's 53 so next, he's 52 59. Anyway, you guys can do the math at home. You have to calculate. We got too much technology here. But, but the whole point is like, I don't know where the peak is, and then where that falls off. Like, is it in your forties? If you started in your 20s, for example, is it in your 50s? At some point, it's going to happen. It just hasn't happened for that particular individual, and I don't know that I could predict that for somebody. Yeah, I think anybody who, you know, it's perfectly reasonable if you're watching this to hear the reference today and be like, yeah, well, he's a freak. He's all the way at one end of the bell curve of the population as far as strength content. And it's like, sure. But the point is that any one person could have submitted this question, and we cannot predict in advance where they are on the thing. Yeah. So you can go and you can find studies. You can find, you know, normative data on this, descriptive data sets that say, you know, in general peak strength for, you know, for men, because they're going to sex stratified is going to be in their mid 30s or something like that. And it's like, cool. Now, you're a person. You're not the mean of that study, sure. Yeah. Right. And so that number may be problematic for you, you know, because maybe you just started training, you know, in your mid 30s, and you're like, well, shit, there's no way now, because I'm already past this peak, and it's like, well, not really because that may not be you. Maybe you turn out to be the freak. And you should probably train as if you are the freak until proven otherwise. I still see other things. Yeah. Yeah. You may not have identified the right strategy to do so if you haven't. Yeah. I mean, we we talked about this all the time with my own, you know, start in in strength training. I had a relatively unremarkable, you know, the interface of training, and it took, you know, several more years, like, we you've you've referenced your, like, first year of training before a few times, right? So your first year was decidedly freaky. Sure. Right. Pulled 550 or something in your first year of training. That was definitely not the case for me. It took me, I don't know, maybe more like three years or something like that. And some people takes a decade. Some people, they're never able to do it. But then interestingly, despite that market difference in our first year of training, now our numbers are like, extremely similar, like within a, within a couple percent of one another on all three lifts. And so nobody could have predicted that from the way things started. And yeah, I mean, it remains to be seen what happens in the next decade. I'm sure. Yeah. And I guess the final point here is like, I don't know that it matters what your peak strength ends up being from like a health perspective. I know that it doesn't. Yeah. So actually, this is kind of a second. It's not part of this question. But we were asked, like, you got to come up with some strength standards for health, right? Yeah. And it's like, in both Austin, I were like, no, because we can't. And I keep thinking about this question. And my thought is like, I actually don't know that if it matters, if you actually get it's markedly stronger, because I actually think the participation in the exercise itself is probably like the more useful thing. It'd be very difficult to not actually gain strength, just by like participating. But what I'm getting at is that if somebody's like, I gained 20 percent on my squat any year and another person gained 2 percent on their squat any year. I'm like, I don't, that doesn't tell me whether there's any like health difference there based on your exercise participation. So I think they're about the same. If somebody was like, I, and I could go further, 100 percent, you doubled your squat versus 2 percent. I'm like, all I know for sure is that you can squat more than this person. But if you guys spent the same amount of time in the gym, same like exercise duration, etc. Like, I feel like the health benefits you're getting out of training are pretty similar. I, and then the programming and some other like outside the gym considerations like nutrition and sleep and stuff like that are going to really help me figure out like who's actually going to gain more muscle because I don't know that the person who's gained 100 percent on their squat actually is gained more lean body mass, which I also also think is important to like this health thing. So my strength standards like how strong do you actually have to get to be healthy? It's like, I think you just have to try. But you know, you just have to be actively participating in this stuff and to the extent you need to hit a certain number, I don't have those numbers. I'll, I refuse. So like, if those numbers, because I don't think that they're meaningful, they're literally just made up and have no evidence. I could tell you a hand grip dynamometer value that you need to achieve, right? And it's like, yeah, there are certain, if you look at like the sarcopenial literature, there are strength and lean body mass standards that you'll see described in terms of how strong your hand grip strength should be how much appendicular, you know, meaning lean body mass on your arms and your legs that you should have. But those are also correlational relationships. So it's like this correlates with better outcomes. We have less evidence on, okay, I'm going to take somebody with this lower hand grip strength to this standard of hand grip strength. And all of a sudden, thinking they're going to get much better. I do think, you know, we've talked about this when people were at about being non-responders to training and we've cited some of those papers on the more outcomes you measure from training, the fewer apparent non-responders there are, meaning that everybody improves in some fashion, just from participation in exercise or resistance exercise in particular. There probably are some health outcomes that are more heavily mediated by actually getting stronger or increasingly body mass, things like bone mineral density, things like that will be like maybe fall risk, fracture risk, although even then I imagine that, you know, things like fall risk, probably can improve just from like neuromuscular skill and performance, independent of actual strength and lean body mass. So this stuff gets kind of complicated. I think we will probably end up having to provide some sort of a standard, but I would be more willing to provide a standard in terms of relative strength and commitment. So a percent improvement from baseline and basically saying it would be reasonable to train somebody in order to achieve this relative improvement from baseline rather than saying everybody needs a squat, 225 or something like that because that's definitely not the case. Right. Yeah. And then the idea would be if you are not attaining this relative improvement, it's either underdosed or the wrong formulation. Yeah. So to me, it's more just like if you didn't actually get stronger, it's a programming issue rather than like, you know, some willpower or like in-her effect in somebody cool.

We're in a paradise that's furnished outside of the economicИ Cummero F schreiben this year. We have an interesting TV feature team to show your life in the world from how it can about anybody can picture in a world. So we look at the media forward because the creative show from all walks of life. We work with athletes, we work with general population, we work with people in the medical field and people who are totally new to all of it. So they can take away the safety of the team management luxury. There's a lot of that information out there and I'm glad I did this because I had learned more things than I had any idea. We have some people who come to our seminars that have never touched of our bill before and we teach them how to lift for the very first time on the seminar platform, which is pretty cool too. We take an approach where we educate people about these conditions from a biological standpoint, from a psychological standpoint and then also the social determinants that can influence people's health and disease outcomes. Our idea is to make the community a better place through these social change agents. Go through our seminar, you learn a lot, you get to go spread that into your community and we're trying to make the world a better place.

=== FILE: Can You Make the Same GainzZz Lifting Lighter Weights When Fatigued？ [mdfl8aUD844].txt ===

Music Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum. We have Dr. Awesome Rocky in the studio live in the flesh. That's real. He's in town this week and we decided to answer some questions from the internet. Can lower weights produce similar adaptations if pre-feteed when the RPE is the same? I think this question is like if you're fatigued, right, or otherwise your performance potential is lower on a given day, can reduce the reduced load that you're necessarily having to use to maintain RPE drive similar adaptations than if you had a high performance day, but RPE is still the same. My answer to that is yeah, I mean that's the whole point of using RPE is that you get the correct dose of training stress to drive the fitness adaptations that you want. And so you want something that's the same level of exertion at the same rep scheme, you know, same rest intervals because that's going to produce the same or similar adaptations. And when you go look in the literature there's a much wider range of acceptable training intensities that drive in this case strength adaptations. And when you talk about high-purchary adaptations, that gets even wider which is why you can have very rep schemes that will produce high-purchary fees. So I think the easiest way to think about this is to consider the converse scenario where you don't lower the weight when you're extremely fatigued, right? It stays real heavy and then it's just a lot harder. You're probably not able to do the same number of reps or if you are again the RPE maybe instead of being seven it's 11. That is very obviously going to generate different adaptations as well as generating way more of what we called previously the negative kind of consequences the fatigue cost and things like that. So if you just imagine the other scenario where you just ignore the effects of fatigue and you just throw the weight on the bar anyway that's obviously going to generate different adaptations and different costs compared to adjusting the weight based on where your performance is at that time. Yeah it's just putting too much of an emphasis on the absolute load because it's like the whole reason for using RPE is to effectively arrive at a similar intensity like relative intensity on a given day with changing performance. So it's like let's say that the RPE that you're using for the reps scheme is you know once you do use somewhere between 70 to 75% of your one-rette and on a day when you have high level of performance that happens to be heavier. Yeah but on a day when you have reduced level of performance it's lower. It's like okay it was still 70 to 75% just your one-art M change for the day.

=== FILE: Does Exercise Work For Everyone？ [2fIsCmTZtvU].txt ===

Alright, when discussing the Ateon in 2006 study, we saw people who did not respond to the training program, are there any follow-up studies that show that initial non-responders do in fact respond when presented with the appropriate stimulus? Yes, there are. There are a number of studies and this idea of non-response to exercise is pretty interesting. It's been discussed in the research world quite a bit. For anybody who's interested in the topic, probably the best paper to go to is from 2018 from Pickering and Kylie. The title of it is, do non-responders to exercise exist and if so, what should we do about this? It's like non-responders. It's perfect. It was a great, I remember reading it when it first came out, we circulated at a round-eyed group and a lot of the discussion there and in that kind of field informed a lot of the discussion that you guys heard from us this weekend, as far as how we presented it to you. Definitely, influence our thoughts on the matter. As it turns out, this concept of non-response to exercise is not really defined all that well because the idea is there are a whole host of different adaptations that you can get out of exercise. And the idea of non-response just means that there's no change in any measurable, physiologic variable whatsoever, which is pretty unlikely. In fact, they make a case and we agree with it that it doesn't basically happen again in living humans. As we made the case, during the seminar, we said, if you're alive, you have the capacity to adapt in some capacity. That means that there may be some variables that you adapt more to in a given program and some less and somebody else might respond in a different pattern across those kind of physiologic variables. They make the case that we should differentiate or not get away from using the term non-responder altogether and focus more on the term, did not respond, IE, to that particular program, which is exactly what we discussed this weekend, rather than labeling somebody OU or a non-responder like you're incapable of adapting. Rather, this program wasn't the right one for you and rather we need to find the right dose and formulation of stimulus for you. The other interesting aspect of this is they cite a whole bunch of the research in this realm and they found that rates of apparent non-response to exercise go down, meaning we see more and more people respond. The longer a study goes, so if you keep people training for longer, eventually you see some response, additionally with higher doses of training, which is exactly what we talked about this weekend, higher volumes or in some contexts, higher frequencies. So there are studies of people training twice a week and you see a parent, low responders in that study and they bump them up to four times a week and suddenly you see training responses, so increasing the dose of exercise. And then the other one is interesting and it pertains more to study methodology. It has to do with how many variables they actually measure. So if all you measure is like one RM strength, for example, then there may be more apparent non-responders compared to if you measured strength outcomes, hypertrophy outcomes, maybe body composition changes, maybe resting heart rate changes, maybe blood pressure, maybe blood lipids, the more things you measure, the more likely you are to actually end up detecting some adaptive response to exercise. So that part is like almost a study methodology issue where you can have higher rates of kind of apparent non-response. If you don't look at enough variables of adaptation that people can possibly respond to exercise with. So all of this stuff heavily informed the discussion that you guys heard during the lecture this weekend and the idea that if you're alive you can adapt in some capacity to something and we are job the coaches job is to find the right dose and formulation of exercise to help you generate their response that you're looking for. Yeah, do you imagine a situation where somebody told you that you were a non-responder to exercise? And then or like you had been training for a while, let's say like a year, and no program that you had done had worked well for you. Everything you felt like, at least relative to your expectations and then maybe the people who you were working out with or training with, they all did much better than you. So you were on the low and the accountant end of the scale, again, President Company excluded. Like what kind of psychological warfare would you have to endure to just persevere and then be like, it's going to be okay, I'm going to find this program, I'm going to identify this thing. But that happens all the time in sport where people don't do well at their self-selected sport or their second sport that they got exposed to or the third sport. But they keep trying different things and find the thing that they excel with. And I think that's how I view training. It's like even if you've been on five, six, whatever, different programs before and not done that well. My role is a coach is to identify the thing where things that allow you to develop yourself to your maximum potential. That's what I'm here for, ideally. So the idea that fitting people into this rigid like it's got to be this program, why does this program work all the time, for example, or because it's working the past with other people I've coached or it's my preference. Those things are holding coaches back. Those things are holding their clients back. And so the idea would be more malleable, be more open to trying different things. You're trying to find, again, the right dose, the right formulation and anything that stands in your way of doing that is basically limitation. And that could may include being told or sort of condition to be like, well, you're just not going to respond well. You're a woman. You can't respond well to training. Right? And it's like, what does that do at a society level? But that's for another YouTube video. So don't hate me in the comments. You'll hear similar discussions come up when people talk about weight loss and diets. There's discussion, you'll hear doctors, for example, or coaches say, this individual failed this diet, or they failed so many number of diets, or in medicine you'll hear people say, this patient, quote, failed physical therapy. I'd always correct that kind of language when we're talking about it because none of these things are like one monolithic intervention that we can do to people. And the person didn't fail the diet. That dietary approach did not work for them. And there is an approach that we can find, keep experimenting until we find something that worked similarly, the specific approach that was provided by the specific physical therapists that they saw may not have worked well for them. You don't know what the dose of exercise was, the formulation, maybe all they did was they went in and they got passive east in for the whole 12 weeks of their rehab. No shit, they didn't get better. Right? Because that doesn't work unless they were going to get better on their own anyway. So they didn't fail that physical therapy, that physical therapist, or more arguably failed the patient and we need to find a better way to get them to adapt. In that situation, in the same way, somebody training for performance needs to find the right formulation to adapt. Same way, somebody trying to find the right diet for weight loss, needs to find the right dietary setup that's going to work for them to let them achieve their goals. Yeah. The 35-year-old male failed exercise. Right. Wait, what? Yeah. Okay.

=== FILE: Does Intra-workout Nutrition Matter？ [jkKeTGswomM].txt ===

You guys so much for joining us here at our first seminar back since COVID-19. We're here in Norfolk, Virginia, Ireland, asylum gym. Thank you so much for coming out. Nobody clap this time. Yeah, all right. Thanks. Thank you for watching on YouTube. Check this out. We're going to answer some questions that were submitted during our seminar. Thank you for doing that. If you're a question, does not get answered here. Sorry. Go to our forum. We'll answer it there. And if that doesn't work, you should hop on one of my Instagram lives every Wednesday, 5 30 PM, 16 or time. I'll try to answer it there. If that doesn't work, DM Austin. No, he's very active and responsive to DM's. Particularly one that goes to his unread folder, he's just, yeah, he's on it. So that works. Okay. Let's go through our questions. Question one. Does intro work out nutrition make a difference, such as a gauge rate or other simple carbo hydrates during a workout? You want to start with this? Yeah, I mean, whatever. You got it. All right. I mean, I don't know if you have thoughts. I have some. Okay. Let's start with your thoughts. I think we're talking about two different things with those examples. For example, if you're talking about gatorade versus or like gatorade zero, for example, or simple carbo hydrates, because there's some difference with respect to electrolyte content. There. And I think for most people who are pursuing regular, just simple resistance training, barbell training, the type of exercise that that is, the demands of the exercise, typically are not going to make intro work out carbohydrate, supplementation, really necessary. I would say a similar thing with respect to the electrolyte concentration for people who are doing right, just routine, barbell base resistance training like in a gym like this. I think there can be some considerations depending on the environment that the person is in. That would be one thing. And then other specific aspects of their training. So environment, I'll give you myself as an example who routinely trains in an outdoor garage in South Texas, upwards of 110 degree temperatures, 90 minute to two hour session, losing substantial or not insignificant amounts of sweat. You could make a point for comparing, if I was just drinking lots and lots and lots of plain water during that session, let's say I ended up needing to drink, you know, two liters of plain water during that session versus something that had some electrolyte concentration in it, like, a gatorate although I would also argue that the electrolyte concentration to gatorate is probably too low for that purpose. I could make a case for using something that had some electrolytes, some added sodium, potassium, et cetera, during that session would be reasonable, knowing that I'm not like measuring my blood levels throughout this session. But losing tons of sweat and I would prefer to replace a similar type of fluid compared to plain water if I'm going to need to use a lot of it. The consequence to drinking lots and lots of plain water as you can actually dilute your blood sodium levels down, condition called hypoenetremia, a few other consequences that are best avoided. Of course, in the course of somebody who's training doing that, it's not necessarily going to be life-threatening in most typical training situations, but you hear new stories every year about, you know, college kids who go through hazing rituals and they drink tons of water until some kid dies or something like that. And so hypoenetremia is real and potentially risky. So that would be the point out, make on the electrolyte front for carbohydrate consumption, again, for regular routine like our type of parable training, I think for most people, it's not necessary, assuming that you're eating reasonably the rest of the day. You haven't been, you know, fasted for 24 hours when you go to lift in which case, yeah, you should probably get something in you if you want to perform well during the session. But, you know, myself, I typically eat anywhere from 90 minutes to three hours somewhere in that range before I train or consume something in that period of time. So I don't find for myself that consuming carbohydrates during the session is necessary. I think probably some folks who do extremely high volume bodybuilding training or something, they may have different opinions on this, but that's kind of outside my scope or what I would want to manage myself. Yeah, yeah, I think for resistance training, when considering adding an electrolyte drink, electrolyte replacement drink, one, the evidence on this is very underwhelming as far as suggesting any performance improvement, yeah, they're in the short term or like your next session being better. So I don't think I could recommend it based on current evidence. If you prefer the pallidability, that way it tastes, right, and you're going to be consuming a lot of fluid because you train in somewhere that's very hot or humid or both or you sweat a lot. That seems totally reasonable to me, but I don't know that you need to do that. Retainly, main thing that's going to predict how well you do in those situations is what you aid in drink leading up to that and not just that day, but also the series of days and weeks before that. So, there currently the best fluid intake guidelines we have for athletes or the NATA North America Training Association guidelines. You can check those out if you're watching this online, but I'm in the description below about kind of outline with the complexities here. Basically, people sweat at different rates, different concentrations of electrolytes are in different environments, trained for different durations of time, so making it like again a specific hydration sort of recommendation is impossible. But with respective performance improvement, like if you drink a gatorade, well, you're bench-brusco, probably not. And then as far as carbohydrates or otherwise eating food during a workout. So, again, the data right now on resistance training is not impressive at all, and so from a performance standpoint, would not necessarily recommend consuming food during a workout unless you personally prefer it, which is the same way I feel about timing of a pre-workout meal. I personally like eating about two hours before I workout, but I don't like setting a stopwatch after I finish my last flight to say, two hours, it's now time to live. That's just how it ends up working on my daily schedule. Other people like to eat a little closer to their workout or even a little further apart. I agree with Austin as long as you're not fasted. It's a good idea. And then that all kind of goes out the window when we start talking about endurance training, particularly endurance training that's lasting for over 90 minutes, two hours or longer than that. There's actually recommendations from the International Sports Society of Nutrition, talking about a actual carbohydrate recommendations per duration of time. I don't remember what they are off hand, but they actually give a carbohydrate recommendation. And I think that would be a good place to start. If you're an endurance-minded individual, but then I'd have to ask you like, why are you watching a marble medicine YouTube channel? It's a wrong channel for you. They still want to get jacked. Yeah, no, it's fine. So, in relation to your resistance training, like you don't need any goo packs or like, you know, what else would you would you have? If you were, if you were running a marathon and you knew that you needed a snack in the middle, what would be your snack? I know mine is the ego first, because I know you like answering stuff on the spot. Well, if you're going to have to consume it while you're running, then I kind of tend to agree that those kind of gel pack things are fairly quick and convenient and easy to throw down instead of something you need to chew. Sure? Well, one, I'm not a very fast runner. I know this surprised you. And certainly from my own marathon, I'm not moving very quickly. Okay? So, you're going to sit down and have a meal because you may as well. Yeah, 100% not winning. I'm definitely not winning. The whole idea is to finish. And I think, you know, I don't want but I don't want to get sick later either. Okay. So, for me, it's going to be an Elvis Presley, which is a grilled peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a banana. And that's delicious. Yeah, that will work. Well, I'm not going to run with it, but I wasn't running in the first place. I was already walking. Okay. Yeah. And then, you know, probably a beer. It's got a bunch of electrolytes in it. Get a re-hydrating and also takes the edge off because I'm like, should I really keep going? Fair enough? Yep. Pro-t it.

=== FILE: Does Lifting Increase the Risk of Hernias？ [E13KaMOiV6M].txt ===

Music Hey everyone, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. We'll be bringing modern medicine to strength conditioning and strength conditioning to modern medicine under host doctor Jordan Faganbaum and we are back I got a new white coat got some motivation and so what I've done is created a bunch of content that's going to be coming out every Tuesday here on the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel So make sure you subscribe to our channel to get all the latest updates. Make sure you like the video and also we want to hear what you want to see next on this channel so you can leave that in the comments below. We really love hearing from you. What are we talking about today? Hurnie is. Let's not waste any time. Let's dig into this. Music Hurnia is when an organ or part of an organ or tissue abnormally protrudes through the wall of the cavity that's normally contained in such as when a loop of bowel gets pushed through a weed point in the abdominal wall fascia. This weed point creates a defect in the fascia which is basically a band or sheet of connected tissue. It's primarily collagen that's beneath the skin and attaches stabilizes and closes and separates muscles and other organs. Alright next up how are hernias named and the reason I wanted to talk about this is because people read this diagnosis and they're like well what the heck does that mean? So hernias are typically classified by location and or cause. For example, hernias that develop from a prior surgical incision are called incisional hernias. Those that don't result from a surgical incision are called primary or acquired hernias. They're also named by location. So ventral hernias which occur anteriorly on the ventral side of the body can be epigastric in the epigastric area or umbilical in the region of the umbilicus et cetera. Similarly, growing hernias occur in the lower region of the abdomen, the groin where the thigh beats the hip and there are two major types femoral and ingwinnell. Ingwinnell occurs along the ingwinnell canal typically above. Whereas femoral hernias occur typically below the ingwinnell canal. There are many other types of hernias, but we're going to focus on ingwinnell hernias in this video. What other thing to say, sometimes the complications also make their way into the naming of the hernias or you might hear people describe these different terms such as reducible basically meaning you can push the hernia back in through the defect in the cavity that it normally was enclosed in or an incarcerated hernia which basically means the hernias trapped and it cannot be reduced which causes reduced blood flow. Also strangulation which basically leads to uh ischemia or lack of blood flow and necrosis or death of the contents of the hernia. Next up, who gets an ingwinnell hernia? So this is super common approximately 5 million Americans about 5% of the population have hernia. The majority of these hernias are located in the groin 96% of them are ingwinnell hernias which again is a subject of this video. This typically results in about 700,000 surgical repairs each year in the United States and it's the third most common reason for people to go see their doctor. Alright next up, getting to the meat of this, how do you know if you have hernia? So about 2-3rd, 66% of hernias are symptomatic meaning that you're going to have a dull vague pain usually in the lower groin or lower abdomen region. On the other hand, if you have moderate to severe pain that comes on with the quickness, it still could be due to hernia but probably not just your run in the middle hernia but perhaps it's incarcerated or strangulated and that warns emergent sort of evaluation from a physician. If it comes on quickly and it's not due to hernia it could also be to stick to the torsion, epididomytois, hydroceal, varicocel or a bunch of other different medical conditions that again need to be worked up by a doctor. So if 2-3rds are symptomatic, that means that 1-3rd are asymptomatic or without symptoms but typically there's a bulge that is present and that you can see and that the physician will be able to see. Typically that will be reducible again that you can actually push the contents of the hernia back through the wall where it was herniated from. This is diagnosed via physical examination and physical exams actually pretty good at picking this stuff up so it's 75% sensitive and 96% specific. Those are pretty good odds. Typically you have the patient standing an actively coughing or doing a valsalvo maneuver and should see a bulge above or below the inclinal ligament crease. So above's typically an inclinal hernia and below is typically a femoral hernia. Now the real reason why you all are here, what causes hernia. So there are a handful of things that we have a high degree of evidence for. So thing 1 inheritance. So basically give a first degree relative that's been diagnosed with an inclinal hernia that increases the likelihood that you will get an inclinal hernia. Gender also we've kind of discussed this before. This is way more common in men about eight times than there 20 times more likely to need a surgical repair. Age also appears to be a risk factor for developing an inclinal hernia and there appears to be this like buy modal distribution meaning there's one signal one peak very early age about five years old and then the next biggest peak occurs. When individuals are much older 60 to 74 years old now it does appear to increase over time as individuals get older and older. So individuals that are 24 to 39 tend to have a lower risk than individuals who are 40 to 59 and that again keeps increasing 60 to 74 and 75 plus other things that increase risk of inclinal hernias that we have high levels of evidence for. So connective tissue disorders typically that are inherited if you have prostate surgery history specifically prostatectomy so removal of the prostate either complete or partial. And there are handful of things that may increase risk although we don't really have great evidence for them so race may play a role. Inglinal hernias are significantly less common among black adults. For example chronic constipation may also increase inglinal herniar risk although the date is not great. Now a few of you are probably scratching your head thinking hey didn't you miss a few things like obesity don't individuals with obesity have higher risks of inclinal herniad development because we know that obesity or excess atopacity tends to be a risk factor for many different things. However in this case it actually appears that excess atopacity or individuals with obesity it might actually be protective in any case the data appears pretty clear that you know individuals who are overweight or who are obese tend to have lower incidences of inginal hernias another thing you'll notice that I didn't say increased risk of inginal hernia is tobacco use again if you asked doctors just in the street hey what increases risk of any disease most of the time they're going to say excess atopose tissue or obesity and then the next thing is going to be smoking or some some of that fortunately right now the data actually suggests that tobacco use is not a risk factor for developing inginal hernias factor some evidence showing it may reduce the risk not advising anybody to go start using tobacco because I don't think that data is very clear but the data is what it is right now and it doesn't appear that individuals who use tobacco have any higher risk of developing herniad now let's get to the good stuff the real reason that you guys are here at the barbell minutes and YouTube channels because you want to know does lifting actually increase the risk of inginal hernia development you know that you're going to get a hernia or maybe that was just my family but that is a question that we get all the time and so I dug into the research and there's a few different lines of converging evidence that also just probably not so thing one in guinalt hernia development is typically not due to a single event in fact the study I've linked in the description below is titled it is highly unlikely that the development of a dominal wall hernia can be attributable to a single strenuous event and effectively I'll read the exact quotation we conclude that we are unable to find any clinical evidence to support the hypothesis that a hernia might develop as the result of one single strenuous or traumatic event but we accept that this mechanism might still possibly occur we believe that at best it is extremely uncommon so what that means is that it's unlikely that a single event like lifting a heavy single on a squat or deadlift or doing a heavy set or hard workout increases your risk so what we have is secondly, you might think that have some some more头 and moreakes rather than very difficult understanding. heavy lifting, particularly because you have to hold your breath because you're doing a Valsalva maneuver. So the Valsalva maneuvers when you fill up your lungs with air so the lungs expand the diaphragm goes down and impart some pressure in the abdominal cavity, because the diaphragm goes down. You're contracting your abs which limits how far the internal organs can go forward so you create increased inter-abdominal pressure. You also also get increased intra-therasic pressure because you're not letting that air escape, basically you've closed your glottis so you have increased intra-therasic pressure appear and increased intra-abdominal pressure down there. The idea is all this increase in pressure is going to keep cumulatively cause a defect in the fascia, a defect in the musculature, something like that that's going to cause you to have a hernia. So let's take a look at what the data says. It doesn't appear that cumulative intra-abdominal pressure increases the risk of developing an inclinal hernia. So to better answer this question we can look at this Danish study where they took 18,000 men followed them for about 18 years to see if there was any correlation between the hours spent per day standing, walking or lifting loads greater than 20 kilos. Now if there was an issue with this cumulative intra-abdominal stress what you'd expect to see is way greater incidents of enguinal hernias in those who spent the most time lifting loads greater than 20 kilos. Right? However there was no significant difference in enguinal hernia cases between those who lifted the most wheat per day and those who didn't lift at all. In fact the only significant relationship that was found was that those individuals who were standing for greater than six hours per day had a 45% higher risk of having to have surgery to repair an enguinal hernia than those who were standing for less than four hours per day. But there was no association found with a amount of load lifted or frequency of load lifted. So that all suggests that lifting probably doesn't increase the risk of developing hernia. Rather the things that we referred to earlier, particularly the things that have high levels of evidence that they increase enguinal herniarisc. So inheritance, that familial predisposition, sex, so again males tend to have a much higher risk of developing enguinal hernia than women do age, that by-modeled distribution that we talked about, connect of tissue disorders, surgical histories, specifically prostatectomy. Those things probably contribute much, much more than any sort of sort of lifting based risk. All right, so now we get to talk about treatment. If you have an enguinal hernia, what do? If you're concerned that you have a hernia based on symptoms and or the presence of a bulge, you should be evaluated by a physician for diagnosis and management. Go get a check-out. Don't listen to me here on the internet to diagnose you. But if you get diagnosed, what can you expect? So from a treatment standpoint, most enguinal hernias are symptomatic and the definitive cure for asymptomatic growing hernia is surgery. asymptomatic are minimally symptomatic, male and glinal hernia patients may choose to use this watchful weight in approach since the risk of hernia-related emergencies is relatively low. Now there are some risks, so like complications of the hernia, the symptoms could worsen and they may be in need for emergency surgery. But again, that's relatively low. So basically a shared decision between the physician and the patient based on preferences, risks, they'd individual case and all that sort of stuff should be undertaken. So if you do need surgery, a mesh repair is recommended as the first choice. And the surgery can be performed by a number of different ways, which depends on the surgeon, their expertise, the patient and hernia-related characteristics and complications, the anatomy, and also the resources. Right now, one standard repair technique for all growing hernias does not exist. All right, you just had hernia repair surgery and you're trying to get back to lifting what do. So unfortunately, most surgeons' recommendations for physical activity restrictions are not evidence-based and they have the potential to greatly affect physical activity participation in their patients. The existing data on inguinal hernia repair indicates that most activities can be resumed within three to five days for those undergoing elective and glinal hernia repair. And in fact, when you look at the 2018 International Guidelines for Hernia Management, they actually say a period of rest or a lifting restriction is not necessary after an inguinal hernia operation. Patients can do what they feel capable of doing. So your surgeon may give you different advice and it's up to you to advocate for your own help and ask questions as to why because there might have been a complication or particular procedure used that increases your risk and then also just be upfront about what's your plan and undoing and try to come up with this sort of shared decision making plan with them. But that's what the data says. That's what the current guidelines are. So at least you have a few talking points to initiate that conversation and again, hopefully come up with a shared plan going forward. All right, that's a wrap on this video.

=== FILE: Does Liposuction Make You Healthier？ [5xyPfHUIWoY].txt ===

Number seven is liposuction ever a good idea. And I think context for this question, you can view this question in a couple different contexts. One is in the context of our discussions all weekend here with respect to health. So I would kind of think back to when we talked about obesity and the situations where carrying excess body fat can be problematic. And in particular, we talked about how tight of a relationship there is with the abdominal waste or comforts and medical complications. And the reason why there's such a close relationship there is because that measurement reflects intrabdominal or what we call visceral body fat accumulation. Inside the abdomen, inside the organs, inside the liver, for example, which is different visceral body fat or addopose accumulation is a bit different than subcutaneous or body fat that accumulates under the skin. And so the one body fat or addoposes infiltrating your abdominal organs, your liver, your pancreas, things like that. That's when we see big time increases in diabetes risk, cardiovascular risk, things like that. Whereas liposuction as a treatment primarily removes subcutaneous body fat, not the condits inside, not the condits in the liver. So there's actually some data on this. There's a small study that I found while I was prepping for this where they took a group of women, some of whom had diabetes and some of whom did not all of whom had excess body fat and they performed serial, large volume liposuction. Removing large amounts of subcutaneous body fat. You're going to say something? What did you just move it? Put it someplace else? Yeah. Now, why you would do that? Okay. And they severely removed this subcutaneous body fat. And then when they looked at how they did afterwards, they did find that their waste circumference went down as a result of removing body fat. Obviously, their leptin levels went down and leptin is a hormone that is high when you have lots of body fat and low when you have less body fat. So that obviously went down. That all makes sense. When they measured their actual levels of insulin resistance and their cardiovascular risk factors, things like blood lipids and things like that, there's no change. So from a health standpoint, I do not have a good case to make for liposuction. If you say, is it ever a good idea? Well, that's strictly up to you from a cosmetic standpoint, you know, at that point. I would not recommend it for medical benefits. If there is excess body fat that needs to be dealt with, invasively or surgically, and there are medical issues going on, or even if there aren't, and you meet criteria based on the criteria that we talked about. Today, I would say, real bariatric surgery is far more beneficial from a health standpoint than liposuction would be because we talked about how the long term 20, 25-year follow-up of patients who get bariatric surgery. They have much greater and much more sustained weight loss and health benefits. You can cure diabetes in a couple days after getting bariatric surgery. It just goes away, which is pretty wild. Whereas liposuction does not have any of those benefits outside of cosmetic effects. I think if for whatever reason you're getting like this rural liposuction, don't think that's that liposuction. Maybe that, or if the liposuction would somehow improve at hearings to other lifestyle changes, if you felt like, I'm going to pay for this procedure from an aesthetic standpoint, or because I feel like it's going to jump start my progress. That's really going to help keep me motivated and it does, as far as improving adherence to a health promoting dietary pattern and exercise like cool. But if you're just like moving it around, you know, from like front to back, I don't know that that's the move.

=== FILE: Does YOUR Anatomy Predict Your Lifting Technique？ [-fU859dMat4].txt ===

A side from a lifters preferences and goals is there anything anatomical that a coach could look at to determine if a lifter would have an advantageous leverage for a specific squat or deadlift style. This is an interesting question. We've kind of answered something like this before on our YouTube channel. There are anthropometric features that I can look at and have in a guess. I can hazard a guess that somebody would prefer a particular style or maybe do better at a particular style, but I won't know until after they've exposed themselves to regular training over a long period of time. So if we're just talking about like, let's see how much you can lift today, I would expect somebody with very short arms, for example, relative to their torso and lower extremities to might pull, they might be a better sumo deadlifter, right? Then a conventional pull, it provided no other training has taken place. Somebody, for example, with really, really long femurs might do better with a low bar back squat, provided that they can rack the bar and a secure position. So that's just me thinking about all the folks that I've coached and trained throughout my career. That assumes no like the experience or training by that person prior to that test. So I would feel very, very uncomfortable predicting like what type of style somebody should adopt based on their anthropometric measurements, particularly without seeing them lift, over a long period of time. Whatever style you adopt today is likely to change over the course of your training career, based on changing leverages, preferences, skill development, and this things you unlock from exposing yourself to different training variations. And I think any sort of prediction I can make is just going to be weak as far as it's predictive power. Yeah, nothing that I can measure on the person when they first come in is going to outweigh the combination of subjective athlete feedback over time as they train and then objective performance metrics. So I don't think it's important to even attempt to predict certainly everybody would look at somebody who has gigantic long arms and say, oh, they're probably going to be a good deadlifter. Doesn't take a genius to recognize that in most people. But as far as saying, I'm going to force you to pull in a certain way because I think that you're built to pull this way. Meanwhile, they may be subjectively telling me, I really don't like this. This is not comfortable. Okay, I need to recognize that and accommodate for it in the coaching or the programming plan. So subjective athlete feedback and objective performance metrics over, as you said, a long period of time are going to what will guide those decisions much more so than just looking at somebody and saying, yeah, I'm going to fit you in this box. Right. And that's even better than any sort of screening test that we could do. Okay, if you place your toe six inches from the wall while you're kneeling and try to shove your knee to the wall, can you touch your knee to the wall? Ooh, you're missing some ankle door selection. In that case, we needed to adopt this particular squat style, both the bar placement, death, tempo, etc. Otherwise, you're at increased risk of injury. So not only did I know Cibo, the crap out of that person, one that's all made up gibberish. Made up gibberish because it has never been validated in any particular type of controlled setting. And about a who uses that type of test to predict squat stance, style, etc. Whenever may occasionally get right, get that right, or at least to the extent that can be right. And then there's subsequently just self-congratulation. And like, yeah, see I did it. So the point then becomes, why would you try to do this predict via anthropometry or why would you screen somebody for if they can do an exercise without having them do the exercise? Is that suggest that the exercise itself, doing the movement itself is so risky, right? Or it's so important to get it right the first time that you have to do something beforehand. And none of that is true. Exercise, even resistance training, even heavy resistance training, even heavy resistance training with bad form, whatever that means, is very, very safe, very, very safe. Injury rate, injury incidence is very low. The duration of symptoms for people who do get injured is very, very short and self-limited. It's catastrophic injuries. In general, don't happen unless you happen to be a young kid, smash yourself over the head with the plate that you dropped. That happens sometimes. But so what I'm getting at is like, why would we do this? How many times do you screen somebody prior to exercise? Or they're like physical movement? Yeah, never. Yeah. Nope.

=== FILE: Does YOUR Hip Anatomy Determine YOUR Squat Stance？ Why Online ＂Movement＂ Gurus Are Wrong. [k_H6u_Cx4Oo].txt ===

Music Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum. We have Dr. Awesome Rocky in the studio live in the flesh. That's real. He's in town this week and we decided to answer some questions from the internet. Next question, I've recently watched a video from Squat about how the femurs sits on the hip will determine the optimal squat stance for individuals. Okay, so the first part of this is like that you would be able to tell prospectively without a person doing a squat going through any sort of training intervention you would be able to tell just by looking at them and measuring how their hips are anatomically to tell them what stance would be ideal, which is clearly complete made up bullsh**. The other part would be like actually being able to measure this stuff with any degree of accuracy, also complete fabric, completely fabricated. And then the third part of this is is there an optimal stance for an individual. And I think that gets more complex when you talk about their preferred style, bar placement. Like I don't want to reduce it down to just the stance because all of these other things matter, right? And including like what is their standard? What are their points of performance sure with a lift? Like does it just blow a parallel? Is it you know, asked to grasp squat? Is it a front squat to get ready for like Olympic weightlifting performance? So all of that stuff matters and would change the stance anyway. The idea that your hips are going to determine the one weird stance that is appropriate for you. Completely is a foreign concept to me. And I think that those types of narratives in the exercise, fitness, rehab, medical, you know, pseudo-medical provider work, like just get them out of here. I think they're trash and I think this particular individual doesn't necessarily audience. I agree with the fact that there's no optimal squat stance for individuals as a generalizable kind of idea, which then just kind of like obviates the need to even address the rest of the question. But let's grant that and let's say that there is such a thing. Sure. I think that it would be like you said determined by so many other factors or so many other factors would play a role in determining that that female position alone is like one very simple variable in this much more complex system. And then taking it even further down, yes, the ability to assess the specific femoral head relationship to the socket, the acetabulum, etc. is extremely limited, particularly in the absence of radiographic assessment. So x-rays and things like that, like certainly not by physical examination, can you tell that kind of thing. You know Tom, one of the most embarrassing moments that he's ever had around me. We're in Australia. Okay, we're talking about hips because you know what you do. Yeah. And he said acetybellum. Oh boy. And I was like, excuse me? You know, and it's the one with his whole thing. He was an acetylabulum. And then I had this moment. I was like, oh no, I've turned into one of those guys. Well, dynamic nerd straight up. And I had all these flashbacks every time I got corrected for like saying bicep, for example, or tricep, for example. Or saying, I used to say, uh, doodum. And then the anatomy professor would stick your head out of the door and say, it's duodenum. I'm like, okay. I know for one thing, it's not acetybellum. Yeah. It's acetabulum across the board. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah, I don't give this concept effectively any stock. And I don't think that you can predict any what the positions, the style, the technique that somebody is going to ultimately prefer based on any single variable, including, you know, one's hip positioning. The other thing is like both of our stance's movement patterns, technique, squat style has evolved over the years too. And so, you know, we could have gone to some sort of a guru when we first started and he could have done some sort of a hip exam and said, oh, you need to stand this far apart with your toes in this position. And this is perfect for you. And that would have not necessarily been, you know, held true over the course of a whole training career. Um, then includes many other changes, adaptations, structural adaptations, weight gain, weight loss, strength loss, like all kinds of stuff. So, I would just dismiss this concept. Anyway, it will also be bad too, because it's like, if you don't attain this particular width and toe angle, or whatever, then you're likely it increased risk of injury. Yeah. It's like, or reduce performance, imagine you make it to IPF worlds, right? And you're like walking out your third squat and your shoe gets like stuck on the carpet and you can't quite get that toe angle. And the only thing is, you know, if I just would have gotten the right toe angle, if I'm going to be charitable to the question and grant it some degree of, okay, I can see this point. Yeah. The, that that point would be to recognize that, um, there is substantial degree of inter-individual structural variation between people. Yeah. And that is a variable that can play a role in how people move and they're preferred squats to them. And they're preferred squats to, etc. So that would, you know, support the idea that when somebody comes in for coaching, you don't need to force them into a particular box of you need to stand like this with your toe angles like this. And this is the correct squat stance in general. So recognizing, yep, people are built differently. But I wouldn't use this concept to say, oh, there is a perfect way for you to stand and I can predict it based on knowing how your hips sits. Yeah, I would agree with that. And then just, when you add the hip part in there, it's like you lost me. Yeah, you lost me. It just means you don't understand the squat. You know, I tried. You tried to eat it.

=== FILE: Dr. Baraki on Low Back Pain at Fort Irwin (Part II) [JS5ZCCOv07c].txt ===

We're going to be able to make it to the talk this morning. I'm Austin Barakki. This is Jordan Fagan-Bomber. We're both physicians. We work for a company called Barbell Medicine where we go around and do a lot of education on topics related to physical training, fitness, lifestyle, medicine, so to speak as well as we do a lot with respect to pain and rehabilitation, which is kind of what led us to end up here. Jordan gave a talk this morning to the soldier's kind of a general overview of back pain, given how common of an issue it is for humans in general and for soldiers in particular. This talk is going to be a little different. It's going to cover this a lot of similar content, but it's going to be directed more for the clinician level, because my understanding is that we have mainly clinicians in the audience, physicians, and PSPAs, etc. So it's going to be at a bit of a different level of discussion as well as the main reason why I wanted to have slides to associate with this one is to actually show the evidence base behind the recommendations that we make and why we suggest that you practice in a particular way and why you not do certain other things in order to justify it rather than just saying here's what I think that you should do. So we're going to begin by establishing the scope of this problem and again some of these things are going to echo from what Jordan talked about this morning, but we should recognize that these data from the 2017 Lancet Global Burden of Disease study that they do periodically over time. And unfortunately with the colors you can't tell, but the overwhelming majority of the map in the world is shaded a deep purple on this map and that deep purple reflects low back pain. Countries where low back pain is the number one leading cause of years lived with disability in those countries. There are a few other countries with slightly different shading, several of them have depression also being a substantial contributor to that risk, which as you may know, intimately ties in with issues of low back pain. There are other areas on the map that are shaded a more of a pink color where opioid use issues are also fairly high up there, which also tie into this problem. So overall the scope of the problem is pretty enormous and the point prevalence i.e. the number of people in the world experiencing low back pain at any given time is quite high. Over 500 million people are experiencing this at any given time, meaning that, hey if you're having low back pain, you're definitely not alone. There are lots of people who are experiencing this statistically probably even somebody or a few people who are in this room right now. Which then raises the next question is are we at least getting better at treating this stuff? If it's so common, so prevalent, right? It's 2019. We have fancy technology. We have fancy medications, long acting meds. We have injections. We have MRIs, procedures, all kinds of things that we can do to people. And you would expect that with all these advances we should be putting a dent in this problem. Well here are the data going back to 1990 from the Lancet Global Burden of Disease Data, top and bottom reflecting women and men respectively here in terms of the top three contributors to years look with disability. That doesn't appear to be very reassuring, right? So over the same period if you look further down the list, you'll see all kinds of shuffling around some things increasing in terms of their contribution to disability other things going down as we get better and better at treating them. So maybe things like HIV infection, you'll see on that list goes substantially down because we've gotten, you know, modern medicine has been pretty amazing and how we've been able to screen for address treat HIV infection, right? Some of these other ones are shuffling around. You'll notice low back pain stays number one for quite a long time for decades. But then you might be like, well, yeah, but I imagine with all this stuff that we have nowadays, this fancy stuff that even though it's number one, it should probably be at least going down because we're getting a better handle on this, aren't we? Peers do not be the case. All the higher bar graphs here reflect 2015 prevalence and the lower are in 1990. So prevalence is increasing, not decreasing. A substantial portion of this is thought to be related to the growth in aging the population, but nevertheless, over this period of time where we have enormous advances in our abilities in terms of what we can do, we are failing to put a dent in this. So I hammer on this at the beginning because I'm trying to make the case that the established ways that we go about this problem are failing. And so I'm going to present some things at the end of the talk in terms of how we should be doing this and you might say, that's really impractical and my current practice set up. I don't think that I can do this feasibly. I don't have the time to do this, right, for example. But that is not an adequate response to this. In other words, as healthcare professionals, we need to be advocating for system-wide, socio-cultural change on this matter because we're failing our patients when it comes to the management of this stuff and continuing to do the same thing is not going to get us any better results. So one layer and other, something is going to have to change here and these data should motivate us to say, you know, there's not one magic thing that I'm going to be able to do to my patients to fix them all of this, right? It's a really complicated problem that's going to involve a lot of social, cultural change and even a perfect examples within the military as we started talking about this morning at our talk. There are lots of kind of specific factors within the military context that are going to need to be addressed one layer and other. And so maybe the healthcare professionals need to start kind of rattling the cage so to speak to try to bring this to people's attention who are in positions to where some of this stuff can be addressed in a more productive manner. Otherwise, we're not going anywhere. So I like this quote about back pain, confronted with such a multiplicity of symptoms and causes, the diagnosis is usually difficult or uncertain and consequently treatment is unsatisfactory. This resonate with anybody who sees patients experiencing back pain, yes, should be like vigorously nodding. I strongly agree with this sentiment and you'll note that it was said over about a hundred years ago, which should also make us feel not very good about where we are today since all of us are like yep, that sounds about right, right? With everything we've done, we've failed to make much progress on this problem. So this should make us question whether we've been approaching this problem all wrong. So this is a great paper on the history looking back on the 20th century in terms of how have we approached this problem? Where have we gone wrong? They go back to the late 1890s. Back then, some of the dominant explanations for low back pain, particularly like in women, for example, was this weird diagnosis of hysteria, blaming the uterus for various maladies. But around that time, at the end of the 1800s, early 1900s, we invented the x-ray. So then what happened when we started x-raying people? When we started finding things, that's what happens when you look. So we started finding all kinds of things on x-rays, changes, and we started saying, oh, well, that has to be, right? That appears to be abnormal. That has to be what's causing this individual's pain. So they have beautiful graphs showing how the dominant explanations of the time, the common diagnoses delivered overwhelmingly shifted now to like bone-related problems. Because that's what we could see on x-rays. Then you fast forward a little further and we invent my biography and then we get CT scans and then we get MRIs and with each new invention, we start to see the dominant explanation for back pain shift, right? Eventually, then it became, oh, we can find disks that are, you know, up here abnormal. So back pains all in your disc. That's the problem. Then later on, we get FMRI, we start measuring changes that are occurring in people's brains who deal with persistent pain related issues and then suddenly, oh, pains all in your brain, right? Because we can see all these changes on FMRI. We keep making the same mistake over and over and over again. Right? This paper, they have two quotes that we like to point out. Number one is that clinicians, like all of us, we have an inclination to trust the results of technical diagnostics more than our personal judgment and we have an unconscious preference to favor ideologies that are visible, organic, and removable. IE things that we can see. Things that we can do something to or about. And this is just a reflection of our training. So all of us are trained under this biomedical model when we go through medical school, PA school, et cetera. The idea here is that every symptom has an underlying cause. Right? We're trained that a patient presents with a symptom, boom, suddenly a broad differential diagnosis jumps into our brains and we start asking further questions because there has to be an explanation for this individual symptom. Because all symptoms are all diseases, are what cause symptoms. So that's the way we kind of think through this model. And if we remove or attenuate the underlying disease process, if we treat it, inject it, cut it out. Right? Then the reason for the symptoms will be gone and our symptoms will disappear. It's a nice linear model that seems to superficially make sense. And this leads us to basically constantly be in search of a singular problem to fix. Right? Patient presents with a symptom. We want to find a problem to fix. That's the way we're trained. In some contexts, this approach can be super effective. Right? There are certain medical situations where you can find a singular problem to fix. Yep. There's HIV in the blood of this patient. That's something that we can treat directly. Oh, there's a malignant tumor here. We can treat that directly. With pain related issues, this model fails spectacularly. As it has over and over and over again, since the beginning of time, effectively. We're constantly trying to find a singular cause of symptoms. So how does this play out in your typical, biometically oriented evaluation in a clinical setting? Well, first, we have to understand our baseline rates of issues, the pre test probabilities, our natural history, things like that. We need to have a good understanding of before we can start to talk about specific nuances of pathology evaluation and treatment. So you guys are probably already familiar with a lot of these data that 85% of adults are experienced low back pain throughout life. I tend to believe that this is an underestimate. Think real world probably even more. People tend to experience back pain throughout life. Upwards of 90% of cases are non-specific, not in the sense that we, that it's not a big deal, that we can brush it off, that we can ignore it. Rather, we cannot identify a singular cause of the symptoms that is directly treatable or reversible. Of course, there's a very good natural history here, the overwhelming majority, resolve in a matter of days to weeks. Unfortunately, on the other hand, about a third of people experience a recurrence. That's some point over the course of their life, which I also suspect is probably an underestimate. But this suggests that back pain is a normal experience. You'll note that the people who don't experience back pain throughout life, they are the exception. Right? It's everybody else. The norm, who experience back pain, and you'll notice that the statistics here closely resemble that of something like a common cold. Tons of people experience that. Most of the cases, if we went and hunting for a diagnosis, we would come up empty outside of maybe some viral PCR tests and things like that, and the overwhelming majority are going to resolve. Right? It's part of life. But of course, in your biomedical evaluation, you're going to be looking for red flags. Now, these are also, unfortunately, imperfect. A huge proportion of people with low back pain will present with at least one red flag sign or symptom that we all get taught in our training. Despite a very small minority actually having a serious underlying problem going on. So we're trying to search for them, but I think we also tend to put a lot more stock in their utility from a sensitivity specificity, kind of likelihood altering kind of diagnostic process. In other words, most of them don't actually change the post test probability of severe underlying causes all that much, or at least not nearly as much as we like to think. Right? So, having a history of cancer, major trauma, being on chronic asteroid, our situations that should get anybody's attention. Of course, we all need to be aware of not just the pre-test probabilities in general, but those in our particular clinical populations. So I work primarily in patient hospital medicine, which means I see all the zebras, right? The epidural abscesses, the vertebral osteo, all that kind of stuff, whereas in outpatient medicine, particularly in a generally young, healthy population, you guys pre-test probabilities even lower. So you need to have quite a lot of evidence to make a case that something horrifically wrong is going on with this individual. What about when we do our history and then we go to our physical exam? Everybody has physical exam nostalgia for the good old days where you could make really good diagnoses based on exam alone, until you actually look at the performance statistics of a lot of these tests. So there's been data on bony tenderness, soft tissue tenderness. We're all trained to put ground, oh, you're sore there. You probably have a muscle spasm. It's something that I hear people say all the time, or SI joint testing to localize that you have SI joint pain. Well, let's look at the interrader reliability. If we took all of you guys and had you examine the same patient using these techniques and we calculated cap of values based on interrader reliability. Let's see how these play out. Not very good. Nine out of ten doctors do not in fact agree that you have soft tissue tenderness at this particular spot. Muscle quote unquote spasm, nobody knows what the hell they're talking about when they detect that on exam. But then consider how this plays out in practice when you tell somebody or when that's the way you're trained to think. There's a muscle spasm which is made up. Nobody can agree on it, but then what's the next logical treatment step to offer somebody who has a muscle spasm? Or you offer them a muscle relaxer? Sure, it makes sense. Then you look at the mechanism of action of a muscle relaxer and they're centrally acting tranquilizers. They don't do anything at the muscle. You're not giving them sexual colean or vicaronyms to actually relax their muscles, right? Because that would be bad to actually block their muscles from contracting. So, think about the impact of the words that we used to diagnose, something and how that impacts your next step in terms of your treatment preferences. Because the same thing plays out with patients. The words we used to label these diagnoses then inform their treatment preferences as well. You tell somebody they have a particular medical diagnosis. Well, logically to them, the next step is that I need to get surgery. So, I'm going to keep coming back to this idea of language and the words we used to describe this because it has huge implications for how this stuff plays out in the real world. This in particular is just a point out that, hey, your physical exam, when it comes to back pain, probably not as good as you thought, maybe don't worry too much about these particular sorts of findings. They're not diagnosedically useful. Okay. What if we send them through the answer donut? Right? This thing tells us exactly what this patient has. Of course, many of you will probably have seen these sorts of data. This is from a 2015 paper. The columns across the top are ages and these are the incidents or the prevalence, excuse me, of these findings in asymptomatic people who have no symptoms whatsoever across the lifespan. So, you'll notice the prevalence of disc degeneration among 20 year olds. Almost 40 percent of people in their 20s have disc degeneration, quote unquote, sounds really bad. Sounds really scary. Right? These are individuals who have no symptoms, no problems, no disabilities, no impact on their physical function. And then you go all the way across to the people in their 80s and it says 96 percent of people in their 80s. Anybody here believe that or is it 100 percent? I know what I would think if I had spinal imaging on an 85 year old and it told me flawless, no degeneration whatsoever. I'd say wrong patient. This is not the scan that I thought that I'm looking at the wrong imaging result. The point being that you see how high the prevalence gets with age, which suggests that this is a normal age related change. Right? There are lots of other things that have that same sort of prevalence across the lifespan that we don't pathologize to the extent that we do degenerative disc disease. For example, few things that Jordan mentioned this morning, gray hair. You look at gray hair, incidents and prevalence across the lifespan. It probably follows a pretty similar trajectory. Right? Maybe a quarter, maybe a third of people, particularly in their late 20s. Right? Might be starting to sprout a few gray hairs. But then you go to somebody in their 80s, 96 percent. Okay. I'm going to say it's 100 percent. Right? Of people in their 80s are going to have some gray hairs. But we don't go around telling them that they have degenerative hair disease. Right? It's a big. We don't pathologize it because it's a normal age related change. It's not a big deal. Same thing with skin wrinkles. Right? People in the 30s might start to have a few skin wrinkles. Might have a little more skin wrinkles, say if they smoke or something like that. But then by the time somebody's in their 80s, it's a normal age related thing. They don't have degenerative skin disease. We don't need to pathologize it. So degenerative disc disease, we prefer the term age normal age related changes. I don't use it as an explanatory reason for why somebody has pain because I can't confidently link those two. And it's a scary diagnostic term. When you tell somebody who doesn't have any medical training, who doesn't understand this kind of prevalence that they have a degenerative disease. It's like, woo. You know? It's potentially really harmful because of how that might impact their subsequent behavior. Right? They might leave your office after you told them that they had a degenerative disease terrified to bend over, terrified to use their back to do their 80 else, to live their lives. So the words we use here matter quite a lot. And there are some interesting other data on a lot of these other findings, including things like discarnations. Right? Even in people in the 20s and 30s, 30 people, you'll find them. If you look, no symptoms, no functional impact whatsoever. Right? So the point of this is not to dismiss all of these things as never relevant ever. Right? But it should make you a little bit less confident if you are to pursue imaging in somebody. And you are to find things. How confident should you be in tying them together to explain this individual symptoms? Is it possible plausible or even likely that this finding was present long before they came to you with back pain? Right? And now that you looked, you're finding it. So we need to be careful how we frame these things to our patients. And indeed, there are data on what the effects are of radiologists rewarding their radiology reports to be less scary and threatening. Patients feel better about it. They feel more in control of the situation. Less fearful. Which is something that I think is starting to spread a little bit more. I think the last time I worked in a VA hospital a couple of years ago, I started to see radiologists including some of these data in their findings. They would say, you know, evidence of a hernetic disc, however, should be noted that the baseline prevalence of this in this cohort is x percent. So keep that in mind when you correlate clinically. Right? That was a common thing that they would add, which I found very useful. What about the predictability of these findings? We found a bunch of baseline asymptomatic findings, but you might be like, well, okay, but maybe if somebody has some of these findings on MRI, maybe they might be more likely to develop symptoms over time. Fortunately, we have some data on this as well. So to no sue in their colleagues, this was published two years ago, they took 91 individuals with a history of low back pain. They did MRIs on all of them at baseline. Checked in on them 10 years later, took kind of an interval history and repeated MRIs a decade later after their initial one. What were the findings? They found that neither the baseline MRI at the beginning nor the follow-up MRI findings 10 years later were associated with low back pain history during the intervening 10 years. The progression of any findings, IE if things looked worse on the second one from the first also didn't appear to be associated with low back pain, suggesting that maybe we're just seeing progression of normal age related changes. And they concluded that our data suggests that baseline MRI findings probably can't predict future low back pain. In other words, how much stock we should be putting in these incidental findings on baseline imaging, probably not a whole lot of stock that we should be putting in them. So this leads to choosing wisely guidelines from just about every pertinent organization you can think of on the matter, saying don't do imaging, particularly in the early phase with these patients, unless there is specific reasoning to suggest a sinister underlying ideology that needs to be diagnosed in order to alter management. In other words, if you were to find what you're worried about and you're still going to say, man, just go about, you know, try to stay active. I suspect this will get better with time than still no reason to do imaging in that case. Despite all of these guidelines and consensus statements from all these organizations, how well are we doing with this. This was published just last year. They looked at almost 20 million clinical encounters for low back pain over this time period because again, this is a very common problem. And they wanted to look at the incidence of imaging, a quarter of patients in primary care, a third of patients in emergency care received imaging. This is way higher than it should be given the nature of this problem. Did the guidelines make an impact on this? How good are clinicians that paying attention to this? Not very. Not very. The more access we have to fancy testing, the more fancy testing we end up ordering. Without recognizing what the consequences of this are on the other side. People like, well, it's just harmless to get, let's just get it. What could the harms be? The harms can be quite substantial. Even if individuals presented with ridiculous apathy symptoms, right, radiating pain symptoms down to the floor. Their outcomes were the same regardless of whether they got early MRI or not. They had much lower rates of going off disability, which should be a major concern for everybody, but in particular in the military context, right? We don't want people to be disabled. In any context, you guys have a particular interest in your soldiers being physically functional and able to do the jobs that they need to be able to do. But the problem is what happens when you get an MRI? You find things that suddenly medicalizes their experience. Suddenly, their pain is due to a disease. They have a condition. They have a disc. That plants a seed in the individuals' mind that impacts all their subsequent activity and their subsequent behaviors. Because pain is very poorly correlated with the current state of your tissues, particularly when pain has been around for a while. But in general, pain correlates poorly with the state of your tissues. It more is correlated with the perception of threat. It's more correlated with the perception of threat. So, the more threat and individual perceives about their symptoms, the greater their pain intensity and degree of disability is going to be. More fear, more anxiety, more canesia phobia, which is a term that means fear of movement and catastrophizing, meaning worst case scenario thinking. Suddenly, when we find things we attach diagnostic labels to it, give it an ominous meaning, associated with higher threat, higher emotional resonance and people are more fearful and more disabled, less likely to engage in normal physical activities. And of course, costs are higher, which is not great either. So, what does usual treatment look like in this context? Well, somebody has symptoms. We like to treat symptoms. We like to alleviate suffering. Right? Okay. So, how do medicines do? Well, a C-demonophane, paracetamal, Tylenol, placebo-controlled trials. We give it to anybody because it's generally safe, cheap, inexpensive, low-risk, etc. But no benefit, pretty high quality evidence that there's no benefit to its use in low back pain. What about insides? Average pain reduction of about 0.8 points out of 10 for low back pain, which is not nothing, something. This is particularly in the acute phase. Right? So, not as useful at all for more chronic longer term low back pain. Muscle relaxants, in quotes, because again, they don't relax your muscles. Two points in terms of pain reduction in the acute setting. So, very short-term use. That's something. There is, of course, an increased risk of adverse effects harms from this. But I understand the clinical population you guys work with might be a little different than the one that I see more often in terms of, I'm not going to be putting most of my 80-year-old people who are coming into the hospital on muscle relaxers. But in terms of very short-term use, there is some evidence for that. Again, very short-term use. This is, like, I would say, matter of, like, a couple days. No more than that because what do I actually want them to do? Be active. Right? Live their lives, as normally as they possibly can. Systemic steroids, terrible choice, used all the time, medrawal dose packs, way overused for this sort of situation, should not be used ever in this context. Opioids, we don't even need to go down that rabbit hole. Please don't. Gabba Pentin, pre-gablin. This one might be surprising to some individuals. Right? These neuropathic agents. This is another one where the language can be kind of interesting, right? Because sometimes patients come in and what do they say? I'm having nerve pain, doc. And you might not dig into that further. What do you mean when you say you have nerve pain? It might just be like, okay, I guess I give you gabapentin then. Right? It's like my knee jerk response to nerve pain is to give a neuropathic agent. But there's good evidence on these, as well as other anti-apalaptics that they don't work very well. And of course, they can cause harm. Right? DuLoxatine, which we're all trained in medical training is great for back pain, right? It's this weird side effect that we like to take advantage of. Yeah, okay. Like that's probably less than a minimum clinically important difference. If I had to look at that point six of a point out of 10, but it is what it is. And then other anti-depressants don't have any clear benefit for this, including tricyclics, which are used for pain issues all the time as well, as well in addition to all their additional anti-colleinurgic anti-histaminurgic side effects, things like that. So medications, unfortunately, not that helpful, which should make sense in the context of back pain being a exceedingly complex, multifactorial bioscicial problem, right? Hitting a few receptors here and there is unlikely to make a huge difference in this. And I would add that when it comes to acute back pain, we have very little evidence that anything we do can alter the clinical trajectory of acute low back pain, other than keeping people active. It's one way to cause harm, get recommending rest, but all the other things that we can do for acute low back pain don't seem to really alter the trajectory. It's going to get better on its own in the overwhelming majority of people, right? Medications for longer term use, not super effective. What about injecting them directly into the source into the spine, right? The quote unquote pain generator. Well, for a particular back pain, get seven, seven and a half points out of a hundred on average. So point seven point pain reduction, which is again, not nothing, but probably less than a minimum clinically important difference and no long-term benefits in this situation. Some people may on a case-by-case basis with a patient who has confirmed acute lumbus acroediculopathy, for example, end up choosing to pursue that, but in general, I have a hard time recommending this for broad use in this kind of a situation, not only non-zero risks associated with them, but to the extent, I mean, in spinal injections are known to have a substantial placebo response, right? And some people might say, that sounds great. The problem is you're conditioning somebody to a placebo response, and then we end up with patients like many of the folks who I used to see at the VA, for example, who would just come in acute three months for their routine injections, for the rest of their lives, for something that is non-efficacious as compared to placebo. That's not okay. We shouldn't be conditioning our patients to this stuff, particularly when there's non-zero risk. So, would not recommend. With all this said, usual care, quote-unquote, this was actually just published literally like, you know, two weeks ago, almost 200,000 patient encounters in family practice and emergency room settings. They found that less than 20% of patients in these settings received evidence-based information and advice from their family practitioner. Less than 20% received evidence-based advice. This is a big problem. Usual care included overuse of imaging and opioid prescription and underuse of advice and information. An advice and information is the number one thing that we can offer individuals in this situation to at least get them through the acute phase. Right? Longer term stuff gets even exceeding exponentially more complex, right? But just giving somebody a script for something and not giving them any information or advice on this situation is a huge problem. The way I like to frame this sort of situation is not unlike when you're say you're in the hospital and there are these things called universal precautions, where you have to wash your hands before in and out of every room or where contact stuff for patients with certain infection related issues. I prefer universal precautions for patients presenting with acute pain syndromes and I'm going to treat them as if they are at exceedingly high risk of progression to a chronic or persistent pain state. I'm going to treat them with as much education information advice, try to debunk myths, assuage their fears, get them active, things like that in order to minimize the risk that they're going to progress to a chronic pain situation. Do this with everybody up front and you'll be doing as much as you can in the acute phase. So universal precautions here. They are you that sub-optimal care as shown here may contribute to the massive burden of the condition worldwide that I showed you guys at the beginning. So this brings up language again. The enduring impact of language on patients. When survey, this is a group of about 150 patients with chronic low back pain when they were surveyed about their beliefs about low back pain, they said that they had very negative beliefs. They thought back pain was very negative, very complex. It was it was likely permanent. They viewed the body as like a broken machine. That was their conceptualization of this problem that they were broken. And when asked then where did you get these ideas from? Where did these beliefs come from? Almost 90% they said they came from healthcare professionals. The same healthcare professionals who took an oath to do no harm appear to be doing a whole lot of harm to their patients by giving them negative ideas beliefs about the nature of their pain, the meaning of their pain, the expected trajectory, the natural history of their pain. We're giving them really harmful negative ideas and beliefs either in the way we say things or by failing to give them advice in many situations. So chronic low back pain in some context has been argued to be an eye-atrogenic disorder from this perspective. There are a lot of things we could be doing that were not or things that were doing wrong that are harming patients. So keep that in mind. Expectations drive outcomes in the situation. So when patients come into us with low back pain, what do they want? Also this was just published within the past six months. They want clear, consistent and understandable information on all of these factors. Now you'll notice the first two a cause of pain and underlying pathology diagnosis and imaging. Those are tricky conversations to have. Right? It's tricky to help somebody understand that they have a symptom. There assumption is I have a symptom so something must be wrong. If nothing was wrong, I wouldn't have a symptom. That's this linear biomedical model of thinking but pain is really complicated. It doesn't fit this model. So that's a difficult conversation to have and is a lot of what Dr. Faggin-Mont talked about this morning with the soldiers in terms of how to frame this and we'll come back to this. But they also want information about the prognosis of their symptoms. The impact on their future disability, their ability to work, they want to know about precipitants of low back pain, i.e. flares and what they should do in those situations. How they should manage those. This is where we fall flat a lot. Again, failing to give information and advice to patients. It's underused in these situations. So what should we be doing? Not using a rigid linear biomedical approach for one. Falling into this trap of, oh, you have a symptom. There has to be a cause. Let me go searching for it with an MRI. For example, that's going to lead you down a path of causing substantial harm and finding a whole bunch of false positives and red herrings that are both unfruitful and increased risk of disability for our patients, which is not what we want to be doing. Furthermore, there are growing arguments in the literature on this that we should be in many most cases of possible shifting our therapeutic target away from the pain score itself. Sure, you all feel similarly to how I do about pain scores. But for many patients, zero pain may be an unrealistic goal. So what should we be focusing on? We should be focusing on optimizing physical function as much as possible. We are limited. Even with 2019 technologies, we're limited as far as how much of an impact we can have on pain. You can look at every possible intervention, even the stuff that we recommend. Education and exercise for this kind of thing has a modest, to moderate effect on pain intensity. I can't tell you what we can, of course, take people's pain down to zero with enough drugs, but that's not an ideal solution either. So sometimes reframing or shifting therapeutic targets to living as well as you can with some discomfort with some pain or optimizing physical function may be a more realistic goal or target to work towards. So what are some of these predictors of good physical function outcomes versus the opposite being more disabled? Well, low socioeconomic status, potential for compensation, which I know is an issue in military contexts. Psychological distress about the nature and meaning of pain and its potential impact on them, catastrophizing, again, referring to worst case scenario thinking. So somebody has a backache and it must mean that I fractured all my vertebra or all my discs are now herniated. That's like people sometimes people actually think like this. Fear avoidance behavior, the belief that because pain means damage, that means that anything that hurts, I should avoid it. That's a negative harmful kind of line of thinking and leads people to become more and more disabled as they withdraw from more and more activities that are associated with any discomfort. So whereas the classic joke about doctors where patient shows up and says this hurts and the doctor says, okay, don't do that. That's that advice, right? We want to get patients engaging this activity that is associated with potential threat. Pain, again, being threat perception, not tissue damage in terms of a one-to-one correlation there. And that might involve a bit of a conversation, a bit of education to say it's okay to work into a little bit of this comfort, right? We want to optimize your physical function here. And low self-efficacy is a big one. This is one of the biggest predictors of chronic kind of persistent pain related issues. Self-efficacy referring to the individual sense that they have a degree of control over the situation, that they have a role to play, that they have things that they can do about this. The opposite of this would be like a learned helplessness kind of scenario where they feel like there's nothing they can do to impact the situation. They need somebody else to fix them, to inject them, to medicate them, whatever, right? So low self-efficacy is a bad sign here. So we should one of the things we should be aiming for is trying to find ways to put the patient in the driver's seat on this. Get them to play a role in their own care, to understand that they have a role to play that there are things that they can do to optimize their physical function and potentially mitigate their symptoms, ideally. And not MRI findings, as I discussed earlier, are not going to be predictive of disability in the situation. So all of this is to say it's really, really, really complicated, right? Really complicated. I fully recognize that and that's part of why there's no easy answer here. It's part of why it's so prevalent in the world. I wish I could swoop in here and show you guys like a fancy manual therapy technique to like make pain disappear, but doesn't work like that. Never has worked like that and never will work like that. You have to treat the human. Treat the human not the disc, right? Because again, we are so tempted to find an isolated pathoanotomic cause of pain and treat that. This is what happens when you go, do we have any orthopedic surgeons in the audience? This is what happens when you go to the orthopedic surgeons office. You get a preclinic x-ray, which may or may not be indicated, but it's required to show up. And then they already know what your diagnosis is before you come in, right? Because they've looked at your picture. And if the picture doesn't show anything, then they probably don't need to see you because there's nothing to cut, right? That's the biomedical thinking in a nutshell, right? But we need to treat people, not their discs, not their susat joints, etc. Pain is really complicated. It impacts people in very, very complicated ways. So we need a bioseccial assessment of people, assess the biological risks. What are some of the biological risks that we might come across? Well, one is some of the red flag stuff that, of course we have to, we have to check for, we have to look for, right? But whether other biological factors we talk about some of them this morning with the soldiers, one might be their physical training load, right? How much physical load are they under in terms of their training, being out in the field, etc. Compared to how much training load are they prepared to handle? Have they been adequately trained up to handle the loads that we are putting upon them? Right? Fatigue state, sleep state, other concomitant illnesses, right? All of these things can feed into pain. Psychosocial stuff. So I'll get into that in a little bit. That assessment is what significantly under-underdone in practice when it comes to this stuff. This start-back tool is one. It's like a small questionnaire. I'm not a huge fan of these because everybody who comes to talk to you about a clinical problem, they have their own validated questionnaire that they want you to do with their patients. And I know that if I were in that situation, I'm not going to pull out a new questionnaire for every patient that sees me throughout the day. But if you're into that kind of thing, this is one that you can use to risk stratify your low-back pain patients in terms of how what intensity of intervention are they going to need? Are they high-risk of progressing to a chronic persistent pain issue? Perhaps because of really low expectations, fear avoidance type behavior, catastrophizing, low-self efficacy, things like that, that tool can help you risk stratify that. But I personally don't use it in practice. I just get to know the person. I ask them questions and I'm like, oh, this person's got a lot of problems that we're going to have to work on versus using a questionnaire. So assessing these things, which I just mentioned, and again, self-efficacy, getting a sense of how in-control do they feel? Do they feel like they have a role to play that there's anything they can do is really important because if they say no and no and I need you to fix me, that's a yellow flag up front, right? That's something that should get your attention and you need to work on that early. So current guidelines on this stuff suggest a few steps, listening, connecting to the person, tell me about your experience. There's some evidence even that just listening and data gathering, itself can improve outcomes. Even if you don't do anything else, just listening to people's story, data gathering can improve outcomes on this. What have you been told about your back before? One of the most useful questions that I find, you will be amazed at some of the things people have been told, right? I've been told that I have severe multi-level degenerative disc disease and I'm one wrong move away from being paralyzed. People have been told that, so how do you think that person is going to carry themselves, live their lives day to day? They're going to be like, yes, I better not bend the wrong way or I'm like, you know, toast. That's inducing disability, that is doing harm to a patient, right? Now we don't think about it as doing harm in the same way we think about harm from a wrong site surgery or a medication, you know, mess up or something like that, but in my mind, it can be at least as big of an error if not more because you're potentially disabling somebody for the rest of their life if these beliefs get too deeply ingrained. What are you most worried about? There's a question I ask every single person that I meet in the emergency room. I don't know why they came in. What are they most worried about? Maybe there's something easy that I can just give them reassurance on right off the bat, right? Also, it'll tell you what they're worried about so that you can focus some intervention on reducing their psychological distress anxiety and fear over the issue, which is a huge contributor to disability. These are very good questions to ask. Reassurance, resetting expectations, therapeutic targets and providing advice. Remember, usual care right now, less than 20% of patients are receiving evidence-based information and advice. Give patients information and advice on the matter. They should be recommended to stay active, remain at work. The more permission to be disabled, we give people the more disabled they tend to get. So staying at work, that even from a symbolic standpoint, has huge significance for people when they say, I can't work because of my symptoms. The second one is perhaps the biggest thing that we can convey to people. Remember how I'm making the case, the argument that pain is more reflective of threat perception as it is modulated by biological, psychological and social factors. And so if somebody is afraid to do something or if they experience pain with doing something that reflects a degree of threat perception, what we would like to do is de-threaten activity. We want bending over to be perceived as safe. You're safe to move. Exercise to be safe because it is, in fact, very safe. The risks of exercise are exceedingly low. All that stuff is social influences that are percolating into our brains and making us believe that our spines are fragile structures that need a whole lot of protection. When really, evolutionarily, they're there to protect one of the most important structures in our whole body or spinal cord that lets us move around. They're pretty robust structures. They're pretty resilient structures. They can adapt to load. Both our vertebra, our discs, our ligaments, all that stuff can adapt to load. So we need to get people to trust their backs rather than viewing them as fragile structures that need to be protected. Because catastrophic spinal failure doesn't really happen. Almost ever, outside of say somebody has severe end stage osteoporosis and they get in a highway car crash. Then you might have some significant tissue injury. That's a unique situation. In general, not a huge deal. So again, universal precautions with people. Debonking myths. In general, I don't like going out of my way to debunk myths like in the public sphere because it's difficult to change people's minds. But this is one where there can be some innate ingrained beliefs and people's minds that if left unaddressed, you will never make progress with the individual. So examples, the meaning of pain. People's belief that pain means damage. This is something that particularly in the osteoarthritis population leads to a huge amount of disability. Because they feel that any movement means they're like, you know, I can feel the snap crackles and pops in my joint. That means I'm doing damage. When what do we know about OA? Exercise, strength training, improve outcomes markedly, right? Which doesn't make a lot of sense if you're under the mindset of it's a wear entire kind of thing. Which is why I don't use those words with patience. You tell somebody you got wear and tear, but I want you to go lift weight. They're going to be like, that doesn't make sense. I'm not going to do that. So instead the way we frame these things, the way we explain them really matters. So the meaning of pain as threat rather than damage or injury is really important. Again, this idea that we should just avoid things that hurt. Not a fan of it. We have to engage the threatening activity. Perhaps it might need to be modified in some way. Perhaps the dosage of activity might matter. So if somebody has some back pain with bending over, I want them to bend to pick stuff up. Now I'm not going to say, yeah, you got a little back pain. I want you going deadlift 500 right now. If they're not prepared for that. But if there are a thousand pound deadlifter, then maybe I might say, yeah, go pick up 500. It'll be easy for you. Not a big deal. It's about what you're prepared for. Are you prepared to do what you're trying to do? Engage the threat. This idea of spinal fragility is one that should be challenged with people, because the spine is not fragile. The role of posture, asymmetries, any number of other explanations when it comes to back pain. If you go around to any different type of clinician, practitioner, lay person, a health care professional when you ask them about their explanation for why somebody has pain, you'll get like a million different explanations for this stuff. There's no correct or incorrect posture. You'll see lots of different postures in the room right now. We can occupy lots of different positions. We can do lots of different activities and the dosage of activity matters far more than the absolute positions that we occupy. How long are you trying to do this thing? How much are you trying to do? Are you doing too much too soon? So we don't demonize or vilify any particular position when it comes to posture. We're optimists when it comes to this stuff. You can do a whole lot of things and you can adapt to do a whole lot of things, which is good news. And of course the role of imaging is another one that is a big myth that needs to be addressed with patients. Lots of patients come in wanting it. That can be a challenging conversation to have, but it needs to be had. What's another example of a myth is that people feel that they might have a herniated disc and they're toast. That's it. Done for life. I had about two months ago, I had an inpatient. She was a 65-year-old woman who was admitted for a heart failure exacerbation and the residents were presenting this patient's case to me and they said, oh by the way, she's been bedbound for like 30 years. And I'm like, she's like in her 60s. What's the deal? Why is she bedbound? And we went an aster and she said, it's because I have a herniated disc that was diagnosed like 30 years ago. She's been in bed ever since. And you shake your heads, you're like that is insane as ridiculous. But who knows what she was told at the time. Maybe she was told and she had motor function in her legs. She was not actually paraplegic from this. Who knows what she was told. Maybe she thought that I have a herniated disc. My spine's done. My life is over. I can't move around. It's too dangerous. I could be paralyzed with any wrong move, something like that. I wonder how her life trajectory may have been different. If somebody pointed out to her that discs heal. And this is not just a case reportable event here, even though I'm pulling this from New England Journal, not a case reportable event. Look at the incidents of spontaneous healing of herniated discs. Particularly the worse the herniation, the higher the likelihood that it heals. Disculges, they're not even a problem in my opinion. So whatever, I don't care about that. But more severe down below extrusion, sequestrations of the discs, they're the most likely to heal of them all. What if she had been given that information 30 years ago when she presented with some back pain? Which may or may not have been related to the disc herniation they found on the image to get all? Maybe she would have been thriving for the past 30 years instead of being bedbound, becoming morbidly obese, developing heart failure, and then having the pleasure of seeing me in the hospital. Again, the impact that you have with the words you use with your patients is literally like life altering. I wish I can like emphasize this more in terms of the power that you have to either set patients up for success or do potentially irreparable harm to people, depending on how you discuss this stuff with your patients or just even in social contexts with one another. Right? Throughout a party and you're talking about back pain, how many people are willing to jump up with their idea about why you have back pain or what they did the last time they had back pain? Or they're dad who got spine surgery and he's been paralyzed ever since I'm like, I don't need to hear any of this. Right? So the psychosocial influences here are really, really, really, really critically important. So for this reason, it has been argued that mass media campaigns are needed to counter all of these misconceptions because they're out there. Jordan and I cannot do this on our own. Right? Even if we had a few of you guys jump on board, we're still hopeless against a lot of this stuff. That's why we're traveling around educating, inoculating, immunizing as many people against these problems as we can. But I recognize even from your situation, you're in clinic seeing a ton of patients short appointment times, lots of confounding issues, military hierarchies, incentives, disincentives, things like that that are really complicated. Right? So we need to get more people involved in this, higher up people involved in this. Mass media campaigns, maybe we need to start with a mass media campaign within the military show that we can get better outcomes than it jumps out to the real world. Who knows? Right? But this is not something that, again, can give you a magic fix for. It's a whole socio-cultural thing that needs to shift. It's going to take a long time to do. But that's why we're here. So in addition to listening and connecting with the person, listening their story, giving them information and advice, debunking myths, we should also be promoting shared goal-setting and self-efficacy. Again, putting the patient in the driver's seat with this stuff rather than setting the idea, the expectation, the narrative, that they need clinicians to fix them. Because we can't. Right? We'd like to think we can, but we can't. Even the surgeons, among us, in this situation. We can't fix them. So asking questions like, what would you like to be able to do the most? What do you feel? You can't do right now. What kind of steps do you think we can take to start working towards that? What do you think you can do in this situation to get closer to doing that? And they may have some ideas. Which maybe a great opportunity to say, yes, absolutely. Let's start with that. Or they might have no ideas because they have low self-efficacy and they don't believe they have a role to play. Well, you've just screened for caught that and you can start to work on it. Of course, this requires establishing some rapport and some trust with your patients. But of course, that's part of the process of treating a human rather than treating a disc. Right? You don't need a disc to trust you if you want to cut it out. Unfortunately, that doesn't work. So you have to treat the human. So our overarching goals, the two things that we are here to try to do or the two things that we try to do when we give these sorts of talks, is altar people's learned responses to pain and establish a plan for graded return to valued activities. Things that matter to that person. Now, altering learned responses, this is tricky, right? Because you guys are mostly dealing with adults who are having back pain. And these adults may have had a whole lifetime of accumulated learned responses to pain based on their understanding of what pain is, what it means, what should be done about it. Maybe they have, maybe they grew up, their whole childhood seeing a parent with a bad back, right? Who didn't move, who didn't exercise, who used a motorized wheelchair or something like that because of their back or like the patient who had in the hospital? How might that experience have impacted on her kids? And they are learned responses to pain, were they like, oh, my back hurts. I don't want to end up like my mom. Oh no, it's happening to me. Why me? So this is hard. So we have to evaluate. We have to get a sense of what people's history and experience has been with this stuff so that we can start to shift it so they can respond to pain in a more productive manner. Less fear of movement, more willing to engage in activity, particularly those activities that are deemed to be threatening, which may be a trap-mortead lift for your population. They may deem that profoundly threatening. So we need to de-threaten that activity. Altered people's learned response so that their anxiety and heart rate doesn't shoot sky high when they just see a trap-mortar lying on the floor in front of them. That's a profoundly threatening thing to some of them. Profound threat means higher risk for pain. So we need to steer that in the other direction. So what does this look like? Is there evidence for this sort of thing? In terms of combined shared goal setting on this stuff, plus giving people information and advice, compared to just giving them advice alone. Well, here's differences in disability outcomes when it comes to pain in this situation. Just giving people advice, modest effect, advice plus shared goal setting, regular follow-ups checking in on that. And here's pain intensity, differences. Notable differences, right? Again, we can't take pain to zero in everybody, but this is the best shot we have based on current guidelines, current evidence, and the fact that, again, less than 20% of patients are getting this stuff is a shame. So hopefully we can start to make some improvements on that front. So when we're going to recommend exercise to patients, what should that look like? What things should be emphasized, more or less? Well, here's what matters less. So I would not put tons of your emphasized here. There's no one specific type of exercise that's been demonstrated to give better outcomes than any other. The specific details of the exercise program, doing sets of six versus sets of eight versus sets of 12. In this in pain related issues, no evidence to believe that anyone is better than another prospectively. It'll just be based on how the individual feels about exercise, their perceptions, and what they're willing to engage in. Specific exercises. As well as we do not prefer putting in enormous, inordinate amount of emphasis on moving perfectly. There is no one perfect technique. People move in a variety of ways. They can adapt to move in a variety of ways. And additionally, constantly barraging people with narratives of you have to move perfectly. You have to do it this way. If you do it wrong, what happens? Your spine explodes. Bad things happen. That's counterproductive. That's increasing the threat associated with movement and exercise. So we teach people, we coach people ourselves, we teach them lifting technique and how to lift efficiently and how to lift the most weight because that's what a lot of people want to do. But we don't pair it with a narrative of pair it, not pair it like the bird. But pair it with a narrative of you must move this way. Otherwise, horrible things will happen. That's really harmful. Because again, then what happens? As you have somebody setting up for their deadlift and they are hyper-vigilant, focused on their low back. Like, if I feel anything wrong here, I need to stop and sprint out of the gym. Because this is a very, he told me I have to move perfectly. Because it's such a dangerous thing after all. It's like, no, it's not particularly dangerous. Resistance training is pretty safe. You can move it a whole lot of ways. If your spine flexes a little bit, it's actually not a huge deal. So we can coach people for movement efficiency. But again, be careful the narratives, the words that you craft around this stuff. We want to de-threaten movement. Not increase the threat value associated with movement. On the other hand, what matters more is people's perception of exercise. Is it threatening? Is it dangerous? Right? Most people out there, I won't say most because I don't have a reference for that. A lot of people view resistance exercise as dangerous, which does not have supporting evidence for it's quite safe. So we need to de-threaten this activity. You guys have no choice but to de-threaten it because your soldiers are going to have to do it. Right? I don't think they're going to go back on this plan. Right? At least I hope not. So because I think overall it's incentivizing good things. Getting people more trained. The question again is, are you prepared to do what you're being asked to do? Or have you never dead lifted before and now you're showing up to do a three-year-at-max? Yeah, that's silly. Right? So de-threatening, improving perception of exercise, increasing self-efficacy, showing people that they can do this, that they have a role to play, and the dosage of activity. The dosage of activity. How many sets reps, the absolute loads, things like that need to be start low, goes slow. Just like we do with medications or anything else in practice when we have time to work on things. So the ideal situation is people start training yesterday for their ACFT. That's coming up in six months. Not a week out. Right? There are lots of, I mean this all comes down to behavior change, which is like what family practice is, or primary care is, and it's hard. So just as hard as behavior change in obesity or any other kind of context. But again, you guys will have a choice. If we keep doing what we've been doing, we're going to get the same results we always got that I showed you at the beginning. Horrible outcomes, increasing prevalence, more disability. So one way or another, things are going to have to change on this front. Take home points. A cute, non-specific low-back pain has a very good prognosis. We should tell patients this. We should set these sorts of expectations that it has a good prognosis. Give information and advice. Specifically, that they should remain active. IE, not rest, bed rest, etc. Stay at work. We're trying to alter people's learned responses to pain. Right? So if somebody's learned response over a lifetime of having maybe recurrent episodes of low-back pain, I've heard this before, is, oh, I tweaked my back again. Last time I did this, I was laid up in bed for six weeks. What are they telling you? Their expectation is that they're going to be laid up in bed for another six weeks. We need to alter that learned response. Instead to say, oh, I tweaked my back, but I know nothing bad is going on. It's probably going to get better on it, so I'm just going to go on living my life. Right? That's the ideal situation here. In appropriate use of imaging causes real harm. Biomatically focused interventions, IE, those that are focused on finding, treating, removing a specific patho-initomic lesion are generally ineffective and low-value care. Versus a biosecsocial approach that emphasizes patient reassurance that promotes individual self-efficacy and that de-threatens movement. All of these things improves outcomes. So we want to provide reassurance, self-efficacy, and de-threaten movement. And language matters. Hopefully I made that point very clearly to you guys so that you were very aware of the words you use the narratives that you provide your patients in practice. And then if we can get that back up, that would be ideal. There's just a few references that you guys that I would recommend. For you guys, one is reference for clinicians. I consider it essential reading for anyone who is in primary care. It is the Lancet Low Back Pain series. It's two articles published in spring of 2018. It's just Lancet.com slash series slash low back pain. But like state-of-the-art top-notch, that they formed the structure for our talks, highest recommendation, and then resources for patients. There are a few, and these are more for persistent or chronic pain. Because again, acute pain, low back pain, there's little we can do to modify it other than staying active. One is a website called tamethebeast.org. And this is a website that is dedicated towards kind of reframing, rethinking persistent pain, and how we can approach that with patients. And then there's also a phone app. It's called curable, CURABELY. And this is effectively like CBT in a phone app for patients with persistent pain. It provides a lot of this education and reinforcement and lessons and stuff like that for people who are working through chronic persistent pain-related issues to educate them on this stuff. So it's called CURABELY. And tamethebeast is the website, Lancet series for clinicians. That's all I have. Thank you guys very much, and happy to take questions.

=== FILE: Dr. Feigenbaum on Low Back Pain at Fort Irwin (Part I) [l9poXGU11ms].txt ===

So, Mike's just introduced first our speakers here. Dr. Jordan Feinbaum on the left and Dr. Austin Baroque in the right. These guys are from a company called Barbell Medicine. And they are something most formalist and subject matter experts when it comes to strength of training, combining into with medicine, whether from a practical application or from, you know, having more stuff to do research and deciphering the literature. They've written publications for professionals, you need to read articles for professional publications that we as medical providers reference. And they themselves, I think, are one of the most important things they walk to walk, right? They're both left and not literally left, both competitive listeners and the computer. So, you know, they hit it for both the medical side and the, hey, we're actually withers and deepest for a living side as well. Dr. Fai-Mongon on the left is a family practice physician, lives in San Diego. And he started the company Barbell Medicine in 2012. I'm really to address this gap of, you know, hey, how we combine strength training with current medical practices. And I precise Dr. Barack Himmlerite, he's an internal medicine physician. And he actually currently works in teachers at San Antonio with a military medical center at 4th and he's the Texas. So, additionally, just as you guys know, we have a little question and answer box over the last months or months or so, we've collected questions from people coming into the clinics. We're sure we're going to the hospital about, you know, concerns they have. So, after the presentation today, we'd like to feel some of the questions with you guys or any additional questions you have. So, if that being said, Dr. Fai-Mongon will come on up and we'll start with you in my final class. Thank you. Thanks, man. Thank you. All right. Let's get this pulled up. How many in here have done the new ACFC already? Everybody? A lot of people. Okay, cool. Anybody nervous about it? Nobody. That was good. All right, cool. We're done. Okay, so what we're going to talk about, what I'm going to talk about today is low back pain. What it is, why it happens and what we can do about it to reduce the risk of it, to manage it, really try to build some stuff efficacy and your own personal knowledge base about how this applies to your life. So, just to give you an example of the scope, the size of this problem. This is the leading cause of disability in almost all high-income countries, including United States. It affects about 540 million people worldwide. The army actually has the highest incidence of low back pain amongst all military branches. So, Marines with the lowest, they're like the average, and the army has about double the incidence. We don't know why. Cut to the chase. I don't know why. That being said, from 2010 to 2014, there are about 6 million doctors visits for low back pain, for active duty military, about over 6 million. Okay. Of those over 6 million doctors visits, 91% of them are diagnosed as non-specific low back pain. So, about 91% of them, where diagnosis and non-specific low back pain, we'll talk about what that actually is, how about a place to you, and what we can do about it. But first we have to back up, what is pain? I know I'm not going to ask for a show of hand, how many of you have had pain, I assume it's everyone, it's part of the human existence. Okay. But what is it? The way I like to describe it is that pain is an experience. It's an experience that drives behavioral changes or actions in order to protect us from something that we think is threatening, something we perceive as a threat. So, anything that increases that threat, so fear, anxiety, learned experiences, people around you, increases the perception of pain. An interesting story happened while I was training at a gym, about two years ago, there was a pull-up bar, and a woman was doing toes to bar up there, so she's running her toes all the way up to the bar. She fell off, so about a 10-foot drop, landed right on her back. You walk or you are right, and then she started crying, and she started holding her back, and she refused to get up on her own after that. She had to go to the emergency room, where she was diagnosed with absolutely nothing. She went home. It doesn't mean that her experience of pain wasn't real, or that it was quote unquote all in her head. That was a real experience. She really felt the pain, but that was influenced by outside things outside of just biological and anatomical inputs. The people descending upon her and asking her, are you okay? Oh my gosh, lay down, I'm going to go to a webinar, what do you have? Oh my gosh, you might have fractured three vertebra. That sounds bad. Or a disc's secustration. What does that? I don't know, but it's the long word. It's probably bad. Probably didn't help her. Anything that increases that threat has a potential to influence or increase pain. So if it's not understanding what something means, having fear anxiety about it, or somebody previously close to you had the same thing, and they had a bad outcome. My dad had low back pain for 30 years. He would stay on the couch, for example. It's a learned response. One of the biggest take home points here is that pain is not attributed to just one thing. Rather, it is a combination of different things that are going on. So one, what's going on in your body from a biological or anatomical standpoint? I'm not going to tell you that what's going on inside your body has no influence on pain, but that's just one aspect of it. It's just one aspect. So what's going on biologically or anatomically? Second, psychologically. What's going on with your mood? Your thoughts, your feelings, your knowledge base of the experience that's happening. That can influence this perception of threat. And also socially, people around you. The environment, your education level. All of these things can inspire combined together to kind of generate this pain experience, or influence if you even have a pain experience in the beginning. To kind of make this more clear, I'd like to use this analogy to hunger. Hunger is another experience that drives behavioral change to protect us from starving. There are many different inputs. Some of these, you guys can probably relate to. So biological inputs for sure. Different hormones or metabolic signals can influence us to go seek food to eat. But how many of you have been upset or anxious and not felt like eating or have the alternative response where you over ate, because you felt sad. Maybe turn all the gray anatomy. Ice cream. Just me, okay. Alternatively, how many of you have been so busy right at you've missed multiple meals. And then you look at your watch, you look at your phone and say, oh gosh, I'm hungry now because you see what time it is. Or you weren't very hungry and a bunch of people around you started eating or you went to an event where everybody else was eating and you're like, oh, I should eat. I'm hungry now. Social inputs into your experience of hunger. So again, it's not to say that these things are all just made up or they're not real. These are real experiences. Hunger and pain are both real experiences. They're just multiple inputs that shape that experience. So in both cases, these experiences are not from a single thing. There's not a hunger generator in the brain, just one area that says, hey, be hungry now. Just like there's no pain generator, one area of the body that's ant hip, you're in pain now. Rather, these are experiences that come from a combination of different inputs. And they're both normal experiences in life. We wouldn't want you to live a life free from pain. People who have the disorder, this congenital pain and sensitivity syndrome, they tend to die early in childhood. From burns or traumas or other diseases. They just can't sense it. You wouldn't want to live a life free from pain. No more that you'd like to live a life free from hunger. You kind of want to be a little hungry, Thanksgiving just happen, sit down, crush some food, satisfying. To never have that feeling again. Man, wouldn't wish that about anybody. So we don't want you to live this or to expect even to have a pain free life after you leave this talk. Or Dr. Barackie's talk later on or after the Q&A. Rather, what we'd like to do, we'd like to do is to help the medical staff here to help you better understand what pain is, where it comes from. So it allows you to be to self-manage, to be self-sufficient. So you can figure out what to do to not only manage your own pain when you have it in data to life because you're going to have it. But also how to reduce the risk of having pain that interferes with your life. And also to pass the ACF to you. So let's move on. Let's talk about what low-back pain is specifically. I don't have to tell you guys where your low-back is. You guys all know where that is. But low-back pain itself is very, very common. Lifetime risk for this for adults is about 85%. So most people in here will have or have had low-back pain. And again, since we're on Army Base, you guys have almost double the risk of the Marines and you have the highest highest risk of all military ranges. Again, not sure why that is, but low-back pain is very, very common. 85% of all adults will have low-back pain in the life. In general, about 90% of this is called non-specific, where his diagnosis is non-specific low-back pain. And this isn't really a term that's used to, this is a term just for diagnostics, okay, to like code it medically. But it's not meant to minimize the experience of the person. So say, oh, it's just non-specific and brush it off. Rather, appropriately refers to the fact that there isn't a singular specific cause for this pain. It's not due to a herniated disc. It's not due to a torn ligament or other anatomical issue. It's just non-specific. Pain that in this case, in the vast majority of all low-back pain is not due to any specific underlying cause, no specific pain generator. The idea that it is due to something. I got to find that one thing that pain generator is an oversimplification of the pain experience we talked about this earlier. It's not just one thing. There are multiple inputs. We, the fancy way of talking about this oversimplification is by calling it the bio-medical model of disease. It's a fancy way of saying that a symptom, low-back pain in this case, has a single underlying cause. And the thought process behind that is that fixing or removing the underlying cause would fix the problem. Remove the pain in this case. Well, the sounds logical in theory. It doesn't really work and can actually make the person's pain get worse, lasts longer and re-accommer often. And I'll explain that. So again, most low-back pain is not due to an anatomical cause in isolation. So I know you're thinking, you're like, what about herniated discs or disc problems? So did herniated discs account for maybe about 2% to 5% of all low-back pain? 2% to 5%. Not a high percentage shot there. So you're like, it's my disc, it's probably not. Based on statistics. Many of the common things in fact, that are said to cause low-back pain are commonly found in folks with no symptoms at all. We call them asymptomatic individuals because they have no symptoms. So for example, a bulging disc or herniated disc is found in about 50% to 70% of individuals with no back pain symptoms aged 40 to 49. 50 to 70% of them will have at least one bulging or herniated disc on some sort of medical imaging, like an MRI. And they have no symptoms. The joints that connect adjacent vertebra are called the fescent joints. And sometimes if you get imaging, like an x-ray or an MRI or a CT, you might see in there some wording that says, oh degenerative fescent joint. This occurs about 30% of asymptomatic 50 year olds. As people get older, the percentage goes up higher and higher. And these things, herniated discs, bulging discs, degenerative fescent joints, all these sort of things are not reliably found in people with low back pain, which is why we use the diagnosis non-specific low back pain. It's not specific to any one thing. Certainly not just an anatomical thing. Side note, just here. Using the word degenerative suggests there's something wrong or defective about the structure or first two. So if we're talking about degenerative fescent joint, oh there's something wrong. This is bad. What's been put forth instead of using the term degenerative is to use the term age related, which is true. If we see more and more of this degenerative fescent joint finding on stuff like x-rays, as people age, it's really age related, especially if it's generally found in asymptomatic individuals and doesn't really correlate well to pain. Imagine if you went to the doctor and you had wrinkles and they called this degenerative skin disease. All right, went to the doctor and he said, hey, what's going on up here, if I can bomb? I guess it's degenerative hair disease. Like, you know what I'm going to tell you. The problem when you are talking about pain, however, is if you tell somebody that they have a degenerative disease of a joint or structure, you've told them, hey, this is fragile. This deserves extra attention, extra care. But also I need you to go exercise. Oh, by the way, there's this new ACFT that you're going to have to do in you have degenerative disc disease or degenerative fescent disease. You're like, well, doc, that doesn't make sense. You just told me that I'm fragile that these structures deserve extra attention, that I'm not whole and now you want me to go stress these structures to go train. That doesn't make sense. So as providers, we try to not use those terms and use either age related or other non-medical terms where people don't build these harmful, potential narratives. You guys can do these, you can use similar sort of strategies amongst yourselves, telling somebody or thinking that you have a degenerative disc disease is not an accurate way to think about it. It's just age related and it's unlikely to be the source of your pain. For example, if you've been diagnosed with that, also kind of frees you from thinking, well, I've got this degenerative disc disease and so I can't do anything about it because it's degenerative. I'm fragile. We would prefer that you think that yourself's sufficient. You're resilient. I mean, there's all these motivational posters up here too, right? So, so, talk about what pain is, what low-back pain is, what it's not. We haven't really talked about the actual causes of low-back pain, right? What's the magic bullet here? What are the causes for the majority of low-back pain? It should be clear by now that there is no one specific cause for low-back pain. Again, very common diagnosis, 85% of the world adults are going to have low-back pain sometime in their life. 90% of it is non-specific. There's no one cause for this. It's not anatomical. There's no pain generator. Rather, there are many different factors that produce this pain experience. There, because there are biological, psychological, and social inputs into this pain experience for low-back pain, we call this the biocyte social model. That's the kind of next step up from the biomedical model. And this is the current view of pain in the medical role. So, from a biological standpoint, we're going through all of these. From a biological standpoint, the workload that an individual is exposed to plays role, such as the amount of exercise or occupational activity that they have to deal with. If you have a person who's never rocked, never lifted, never done any sort of training before at all. They come to basic training and get thrown into all of this. They now their exercise and their lifting weights in the gym. They're doing PT and they're doing a bunch of extra activity. That is a new challenge for them that they have not adequately prepared for. Might they experience pain? Maybe, effectively, they're not prepared for their orders that they've been given. So, how would we reduce the risk of them developing pain from this mismatch? Well, we would have started training earlier. We would have exposed that person earlier and gradually increased the stress over time. One thing that can generate pain is having this sort of training load or workload mismatch between what somebody is prepared to do and what they are asked to do. So, that can be problematic. This is huge problem in the United States. Also, as 80 percent of the United States does not actually meet the current exercise guidelines, which does involve twice weekly resistance training. Just to show it hands, you guys don't look around. So, we're not using shame here. How many people actually lift weights twice a week or more? Oh, this is good. I'm so happy. Those of you who didn't raise your hand, you know, just saying. So, get a good in there and lift some weights. From a psychological and from psychological and social standpoint, we also have a very big problem. There are learned threats from family members or close friends who have had low back pain or who have had medical providers tell them like, hey, one thing that can cause low back pain would be a herniated disc or degenerative facet joint, or something else. And so, the first time that you experience low back pain, that person that close friend or family member says, oh, it's called your disc. Like, well, I wasn't even thinking about that it was related to my disc before, but now I am. This is a whole, this is a social phenomena. It particularly united states. We're we're thinking there's something boom anatomical that's causing this low back pain and it's been handed down. It's in all of the occupational safety data stuff, right? You see a person trying to lift a box off the ground one way, they're bent over, they're using their back and that's dangerous, right? There's like pain like cartoon pain graphics there and they're, oh, lift with your legs. Don't stress your back. Your back is fragile. If you're on social media, you can see people pretending to lift with a rounded back and then a mushroom cloud appears over their back. These are harmful narratives and they're pervasive. They see it into our subconscious as a society where we think our backs are very fragile. We can damage them very easily. We need to be careful. We only get one spine. With all this in my what should we do? Well, the first thing is good news, even though low back pain super common, right, 8% of adults are going to have it. The most of these cases resolve on their own about four to six weeks. Four to six weeks, most of them resolve on their own. I understand that the experience, particularly the first few days of having low back pain, you think this is the worst thing I've ever experienced, it's never going to end. I've been there. However, that sort of catastrophic thinking actually makes it worse. If you know now, you've been inculcated that it's going to end in four to six weeks on average, you're already set up for more success than you were before walking into this presentation. Here's the other thing. I know what you're saying. I know what you're thinking. You're like, all right, I get it. You're saying it pains all this touchy feeling emotional stuff. But what if it is a good disk issue? What if I legitimately herniated a disk? I was doing the new ACFT, the Trap Bar Deadlift test and I've herniated a disk at shot across the room. What now, Dr? Good news is, even if it was a disk issue, which again, is only responsible for about two to five percent of low back pain. Most disk issues tend to resolve spontaneously on their own, meaning the herniation regresses on its own. The worst the herniation is the higher percentage chance that it's going to resolve on its own. So it's called disk sequestration, it's a part of the fragment that's actually been ejected from the disk. It's floating around on its own as a 96% chance, 96% chance of spontaneously regressing on its own. Without you doing anything other than like living. Good news, right? So let's talk about some other things that people commonly ask for because they think it's going to make them better. People say, Doc, look, got this pain. I need an x-ray. Need to make sure it's not something serious. Well, the first thing is imaging doesn't show pain. It only shows bony things if we're talking about x-rays or additional non-bony things if we're talking about advanced imaging like MRIs and CTs. So it doesn't show pain. The current recommendations are not actually getting x-ray until after six weeks. Unless there's a suspicion of something more serious like a cancer or an infection. Handful of other things, thick that you can, the doctor will be able to pick up on exam, which makes sense. So that six week mark, again, most people's low-back pain should have resolved four to six weeks. All right, so after that, then you might be thinking, if you're the medical provider, hey, maybe I missed something. X-ray at that point might be something to do. The reason why we don't do it in the first six weeks, one, it doesn't change what we do. Getting an x-ray doesn't say, ooh, you need to do exactly this. Doesn't show pain. You might find something that's incidental that's completely normal, just a normal variation of anatomy. But subjects of person to an more extensive work up, like getting an MRI or getting a CT. Those who get an MRI for low-back pain tend to do the same as those who don't, or even worse, in some cases, it's more incidents of disability. Also, MRI doesn't actually do a great job at finding issues. When you have different radiologists looking at the same images, they'll find different things and not tend to disagree with each other about what they actually find because we're humans, and we do that. So a favorite study, and I was really trying to not quote any single study in this particular lecture, but this is my favorite study. They sent this little lady to 10 different radiologists, MRI centers, each other own different radiologists. It's the same spine, they're taking a picture of the same spine, and these radiologists, the all similar levels of training are interpreting this, and they didn't agree on any one single finding. There were 50 different findings that they reported across these 10 different MRI centers. They didn't not one single one was repeated across all 10, and they found a ton of false positives, meaning they identified stuff that wasn't there. I know what we're thinking that MRI is a school standard, we need it, it's going to help us, but in the case of low-back pain, probably not. The common thread is that the military doesn't want to spend the money. The tight ones. It just really doesn't help in this case, and my experience with military medicine, I did two rotations at Navy Portsmouth Hospital, a psychrotation and emergency medicine, rotation. They tend to spend more money on medicine. They're like, ap, it's the military, they'll pay for this, order all the tests. Thing is it just doesn't really help, and it may in fact hurt you here. So think about it, if you have low-back pain as an adult, just started a week ago, you finally go to see the doctor because you're worried, which is fine, this is normal. And they say, you know what, let's get an MRI. Get an MRI and it shows three herniated discs, which you didn't know that you heard had before. If you hadn't come to this presentation, you might be thinking, boom, there it is. Not the song, which is won't, there it is. This is boom, there it is. Three herniated discs. That's what's caused my pain. I will be in pain until these discs reabsorb, or until I have surgery, or until these discs spontaneously regress, which is not the case. Again, many asymptomatic individuals, 50 to 70 percent of those ages 40 to 49, will have herniated disc on MRI and be asymptomatic. I know this because during my medical residency, I got an MRI and it showed three herniated discs and I didn't even have back pain. That's not why I got the MRI. Anyway, yeah, that was a traumatic experience. I still tried to think about it anymore. So advanced imaging, we probably wouldn't recommend. We probably wouldn't push forward. Hopefully you guys are on board with that. Next thing people say, all right, what about meds? Doc, no imaging? You work for big pharma. What meds should I take? Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of good solutions here from a medication standpoint. So over the counter medications like Tylenol and ibuprofen have either no evidence that they help. In low back pain, for Tylenol, does not help, would not recommend or very little benefit. ibuprofen would not recommend. And that's again, people, it kind of makes sense because back pain, particularly the majority of this back pain that people experienced, is not inflammatory. So people say, yeah, but I take ibuprofen when I have low back pain or a little back tweak, it makes me feel better. Why? It's like, well, it's hard to separate out the placebo effect from what's really happening. You're taking a medication. There's a ritual there. There's an expectation that you're going to get better. And so you feel a little better sometimes. That being said, when it's actually widely studied, not a lot of good evidence there. Same thing, prescription medications like steroids, like doc, I want an injection, or I want to take a prednisone. I took that once, maybe feel great. No really good evidence that this actually have any benefit here. Opioids, very little benefit in chronic low back pain. So last thing, more than six weeks, but harmful in long term. You guys have been keeping up with the news. You know that to be the case. So this should all make sense to you that just taking a medication probably doesn't do a great job in addressing low back pain due to the multifactorial nature of the pain experience. If it was just a biological cause, then sure, maybe medications would be more efficacious. They'd work better. But because there are biological, psychological, social, environmental inputs all to this sort of pain experience, it makes sense that medications not a magic bullet. Okay. Similarly, if we're looking for this one cause of pain, the pain generator, we're going to be on a wild goose hunt. And we may miss a tribute to the pain experience to a twud, which is a time wasted on useless detail. We might look at imaging and say, oh, I have the set joint degeneration. That's what's causing this. And until I get that fixed, I'll never be whole. I'll never not have low back pain. Could hold you back in a long term. Okay. So since there are biological and psychological inputs that drive this pain experience, those are the targets we should actually address. So let's talk about those. Biological, let's talk about exercise. So I started this earlier on saying that one of the reasons why people, one of the biological causes where people can have this most common type of low back pain is when the training stress or work low outstrips what somebody has prepared for. It's increases too quickly and too much. So preparing for the demands via training that gradually increases over time is how we would address this. So we would start people with something that they can tolerate today right now. And then gradually increase that stress over time. I know this is just shocking. But this is also how we would start treating this type of low back pain. So let's say somebody tried the new trap-bar deadlift test. And they said that they had back pain after that. That's a traumatic experience. They know they have to do this test to keep their job. Okay. And they did it once and then they had back pain afterwards. So like, look, I did the deadlift and then now my back hurts. And now you're telling me how to do it again anyway. So what we do in that situation were one, one biological cause for somebody who had back pain after that is if they've never deadlifted before. And now you put them into a competitive or testing situation. It's probably not the best way to do it. What we would rather have them do is be exposed to it under less challenging less challenging situation and gradually work them up to the test they're going to have to do. That's training over a longer period of time. That might mean starting with just the empty bar. In this case, after somebody already has pain, what we want to do is desensitize them. We want to reduce the threat. So they even see the trap bar. They say, look, no, I can't. They have PTSD. What I'd love to get them to do is do a trap bar deadlift from a reduced range of motion, maybe from a higher platform, right? Or if they were previously doing it with weight on the bar, do it with just the empty bar. Something where they could do the movement as close as possible to the movement that they're going to be asked to do, but that they're able to tolerate. We're going to try to desensitize them, reduce the threat, reduce the fear around that. Now, if they won't do it at all, we'll do something else. That's similar. We'll gradually have to move farther and farther away from what they need to prepare for, but we'd like to do what we'd like to do ideally is if somebody said, look, I hurt my back in the trap bar deadlift, what do you recommend I do? I think you should do the trap bar deadlift again. But at a more manageable load, whether that's total weight, total reps, sets, et cetera, the whole training load needs to be appropriate for what you can handle right now. And that got to be has to be gradually built up over time. Getting stronger over time is going to help the individual or you to be more tolerant of different stresses, particularly those around physical activity. It also helps build self-efficacy. If someone comes into me and says, I've back pain, I did it while I was doing the trap bar deadlift, for my new on-the-fysical fitness test. What do you recommend that I do? I say, look, I think you know, I'd ask them, what was your previous exercise history? And get that information and I'd say, I think you need to do the trap bar deadlift, in addition to these other exercises to get you fit fit for duty. And here's how I would do that. And you need to be in charge of this. Get the process of going through this sort of training-based rehabilitation build self-efficacy. You're the one who's responsible to get better. You don't need to come see me multiple times a week for an adjustment, for a massage, for a pep talk. Rather, I want to give you the power to manage this on your own. The last part of this with respect to exercise is a term we call auto-regulation, which is a fancy way of saying adjusting things based on the amount of resources that you have. So imagine a situation where you're super, you're sleep deprived, or you're really sad, or really upset, or you're really hungry, or something that ultimately puts you not at your best. Relationships stress, occupational stress, something like that. And it's really bad. And you're not able to perform up to your best. You're not able to tolerate as much training stress as you would when everything's going your way. So our recommendation would be instead of just pushing through it because pain don't hurt and pain is weakness leaving the body is to have a sort of stop gap in place where you don't end up pushing too far too quickly. So easy ways to do this. Most of your training sessions that you're doing at the gym, because all of you are now going to be engaging in your resistance training. Most of your training sessions, if you were going to rate how hard they were, how fatigued you were at the end of the training session, should be about six to eight on a scale of one to ten. If at the end of every training session you're like that was a ten, I've never been more tired than this after exercise. This is it. That's probably too much for you. It's probably too much. On the other hand, if it's a two, you're like, I'm fine. It's probably not enough to encourage change. Six to eight's kind of that sweet spot. So during periods of high stress right from whatever reason, keeping it in that ballpark is going to kind of keep you safe from a training perspective. Your unlike you're not going to be able to ideally push yourself into that, hey, I did too much for the available for what I was prepared for. So that's from an exercise standpoint, what should we do? From a psychosocial standpoint, the first thing we can do, and what we're trying to do right now is education. But what pain is, why people have pain? There's no pain generator. We talked about that. Pain doesn't necessarily equal harm. Like harm to the tissue or tissue damage. If you know anybody who's been to war and maybe still has shrapnel in their body, that's the definition of tissue damage. And they may or may not have pain from that, for example. And during this educational period, we'd also like to give you tools so that you can self-manage, whether that's exercise advice, whether that's managing your training, whether that's new information about just straight up what doesn't cause pain, all of these things can be helpful. So that can be super useful. And then finally, from a social standpoint, I'd really like to encourage all of us, everybody in this room, to watch our words and actions, what we say to each other and how we act towards each other with respect to pain. So if you happen to see a woman or a man fall off a pull-up structure onto the ground, get up and walk away just fine, just go on living your life. You don't need to go over and ask them if they have back pain now, tell them to sit down and then go on WebMD. They're probably going to be fine. If you have low back pain, we would highly encourage you to stay calm, to not catastrophize it and say, oh, this is probably something traumatic, because it's probably not. And then to try to talk yourself into self-managing. If you need a professional counsel, we'd like you to see a health care provider who's trained up on this stuff. And then when we're talking to friends about what causes pain. Somebody says, oh, yeah, it's my bad disk. That's what's causing the pain. If you feel comfortable talking to them about this stuff, you might try to engage in a conversation where you can provide them more information. If it's your Uber driver, maybe you say, oh, yeah, that's wild. And then don't say anything else. It's a long drive from here to bar still as I found out yesterday. All right. So let's wrap this up with some take-home messages. Take-home's here. Pain is an experience that we have in order to try to protect ourselves from our perceived threat. The threat is a combination of many different factors. It's not just one thing. Anything that increases that threat is going to increase, has the likelihood of increasing our pain. So whether that's fear, whether that's not knowing what's going on. All right. Or learned experience. All of those things can increase pain. Most well-back pain is not due to something serious like a fracture, mass, or infection. Most of it resolves in four to six weeks on its own. We covered, I think, in some pretty good detail that it's mostly not, it's most likely not related to some anatomical issue like a disc, the set joint or anything like that. To treat and reduce the risk of low back pain, we need to exercise and build tolerance and reduce sensitivity. Motion is lotion. So if you're having low back pain, the worst thing you can do is be sedentary, not exercise. The best thing you could do is try to do an exercise that's very similar to what you were doing when you got hurt. Tensual with reduced load. Potentially with the reduced range of motion. Potentially with an altered tempo. The idea is again, not to be scared of it and to desensitize you to to that exercise, to that motion. It's all about violation expectation in that instance, meaning that you expect yourself to have pain when you bend over, for example, if you hurt yourself deadlifting. Well, we'd like to prove to you that that's not always going to be the case. And if we can violate that expectation, we can put you on this path towards improving self-efficacy and you'd be able to self-manage this on your own. And then finally, ideally, you would all be part of a social change revolution to change the way that we all think and talk about back pain and society. Because we can't do this on our own. There's only two of us, but as we get to kind of spread this message to folks, the idea is that this becomes less and less of a problem. I thank you for your time, Luke and I now.

=== FILE: EPC 2019 in London： Injury Risk in Powerlifting ft. Mike Israetel, Mike T, Eric Helms, and More [StDKHbqhG64].txt ===

Hey everyone, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel where we bring modern medicine to strengthen conditioning and strength conditioning to modern medicine. I'm your host, Dr. Jordan Fyginbomb, and we are back. It has been a long time since uploaded to the video, but I moved. I went abroad for a whole month and have a lot of content for you guys that I want to share. In this video, we are going to recap my trip to London for the European Powerlifting Conference 2019. Alright, welcome back. If you're new to our channel, make sure you hit subscribe so you get updated with all the latest content that we put out. And if you're an OG, thank you for being patient for this latest upload. It's been a work in progress and again, getting moved and traveling all over the place is not made it easy to do so, but I have a lot of content that I'll be releasing over the next few weeks, including a bunch of training vlogs and I have a meet coming up. So it's going to be good. Now what I was originally going to do is just upload clips from the European Powerlifting Conference with some of the speakers and some recaps that I got with them after the conference was over. But for myself, I figured that I could actually do my presentation here in the studio under the control environment compared to the auditorium where the audio wasn't that great, the lighting wasn't that great. And to be honest, the footage we got from it, Jim Elliott was on the camera. What is up, is Jim Elliott specifically Jordan Faganbaum's presentation? Pretty cool, but also mostly the rebuttal that Jordan and Mike Israel had in the kale discussion was interesting because a lot of times you hear people's opinions about things with no response and I thought that actually really helped me think about things that I would otherwise just agree with on face value. By hearing someone else's opinion on that subject and honestly, you do just realize that everything's a little bit more nuanced than that. It's not bad, it just wasn't complete and what I'd rather do is try to give you guys my presentation on injury risk and risk reduction in powerlifting. So we'll put my PowerPoint up here and you guys can follow along. The links to all the studies that I cite in here will be in the description below and as well as some other ways that you can keep up with latest barbell medicine content. So let's start out here. So let's establish our objectives for this presentation. One, we want to define what an injury is. We want to characterize the injury risk in powerlifting, discuss strategies for injury risk reduction and discuss strategies for injury management. We're going to try to jam this in to about 20 minutes. I had an hour to present at the European Powerlifting Conference and there were some questions that kind of ate up some time. But if we can jam this into 20 minutes, I think that'll be good. And then you guys can hear from the rest of the speakers. So disclaimers, this is not medical advice. I am not your doctor. You should seek professional evaluation and we have a great pain rehab, consult service that we offer through barbell medicine. So I own that company. That's my conflict of interest. So the first part we should start with is what is an injury and the very beginning, why do these definitions even matter? How you define an injury determines its prevalence, meaning that when you try to study this in the research, if you change the definition, you can actually change the prevalence or how many injuries you see in a population. So prevalence is a scientific term for the number of active cases present in a population at a given time. So to highlight this, we'll look at a study from Bar at Al. They studied 176 volleyball players during the 2001 World Tour to the eight-week competition. They used two different definitions to try to compare the prevalence of injuries in this athletic population. So definition one, they used what's called a time loss definition for injury, which is any physical complaint that resulted in time loss from competition or training. Definition number two was based purely on physical symptoms. So any physical complaint of pain sustained by the player during a volleyball match or training irrespective of the need for medical attention or time loss from volleyball activities or training. So using definition one, which was the time loss definition, 23 injuries were reported in these 176 volleyball players over the eight weeks. The majority were mild and the only missed one to three days. Using definition number two, which was again, the physical symptoms irrespective of time loss or actual need for medical evaluation, there were 54 injuries. So over double the amount of injuries that were reported. However, 98% of women and 100% of men did not miss any play in time. Meaning that these people had physical complaints. However, they didn't actually need to change their training or their competition schedule. So the real question is, is that an injury? Is that a useful definition? What do we need to actually have criteria wise for something to be meaningfully called an injury? So to help guide us, I think if we go back into the history of where the word injury even comes from, that might actually help us determine where to go next. The word injuries actually derived from a 14th century Latin word injury, which breaks down into not right. So in meaning not and then juror meaning right or loss of not right. So the earliest history of this being written down or recorded probably goes to Homer. A Greek author in the 8th century BC book, The Iliad. He describes a crash of a humiloce of Corinth during a chariot race. And he says that he has Rexus of the skin, which is a discontinuity in the skin. The injuries also described in the book of Genesis in the Bible when Jacob's thigh was out of joint secondary to wrestling. However, it's interesting that neither then nor seemingly now do we have a unified definition for what an injury actually is. Because neither of those texts actually characterized what was being experienced by the individual. And thus the reader's left wanting more details was umilose in pain after being thrown from his chariot was Jacob able to walk it off after his thigh was out of place. Hard to say and again, we don't know that from either of those texts. And so it's just interesting that that's where it came from. We still didn't really have a good characterization of what it actually meant to have a quote unquote injury. So really from then until about 2006, we didn't have a unified definition for sports injury. So enter the first World Congress on Sports injury, which was held by FIFA in 2006. Basically they came up with different types of injuries that fell under the umbrella term of sports injuries. So there could be a physical complaint injury, which was any physical complaint sustained by a player resulting from a football match or football training irrespective of the need for medical attention or time loss from football activities. There was also a medical attention injury, which was any physical complaint requiring medical attention, a time loss injury, any physical complaint that resulted in time loss from training a competition. And then a non-fatal catastrophic injury. This was actually added a year later in 2007. This is a brain or spinal cord injury resulting in greater than 12 months of severe functional disability. So this was actually the first kind of consensus on this is what a sports injury is. However, this was just for the sport of soccer. And it hasn't been widely adopted in either the research literature or by other sports organizations. And so we still don't have this definition of. Here's what an injury is. Here are the criteria. And that really tends to influence the research. And unfortunately, it makes it harder to analyze and interpret these sorts of things. So we're going to get into it during this presentation and try to make sense of the data as it pertains to powerlifting. So unfortunately, these criteria have not been adopted by either the research or other sports organizations. And on the one hand, it's frustrating because that influences the actual research we have on injury prevalence in certain sports. On the other hand, it's kind of understandable because different sports are likely to have different injury criteria based on the needs of that sport. So for example, consider a gymnast and a figure skater suffer a wrist-sprayin during training. Does this constitute an injury in both athletes? Probably not the wrist-brayin only limits the gymnast likely whereas the same injury probably doesn't affect the figure skater. Although it might and in which case we could call that an injury. So just having these sort of physical complaints that maybe don't influence actual training or competition schedule, it'd be hard to say. And so you might need different criteria for each sport. Also perspective matters. And so it depends who you're asking what constitutes an injury. Are you asking the athlete? Are you asking the clinician or the coach? So actually this study was done by boiling at Al in 2018 where they interviewed athletes, coaches and physical therapists on what defines a sport injury. In general, athletes tend to focus on criteria specific to their own context. So a reduction in performance, having to change their plan, competition or training, stuff that immediately are directly affected them, conversely physical therapists tend to focus on things that they could find on physical exam. So weakness, instability, or pain. But not the change in training plan or competition schedule that seem to be more meaningful to the actual athlete. So the authors actually concluded that a sports injury should not be viewed as a health condition in itself, but should rather be viewed as an interaction between physical damage and contextual factors. So one of the hardest things I had to do for this presentation was actually created definition of injury. We propose a definition for injury that we're currently using in a prospective trial on about 500 individuals participating in powerlifting training. This is a headed up by Dr. Michael Ray and their collecting data right now. So the Barbell Medicine definition for injury is any complaint that causes a reduction in sports performance, secondary to training or competition. That's criteria one. Criteria number two is pain or discomfort as rated by the athlete and or objective neurological deficits that includes cognitive deficits as well that might occur from like a post-concussive syndrome or something like that that are experienced during or secondary to sports training and or competition. And in addition, any use of over the counter or prescribed anal gs to reduce pain or discomfort during training or competitive sport would also fit this criteria. And then finally criteria number three, training or competition schedule is modified significantly to reflect a changing goals or prioritized outcomes secondary to points one and two. In this case, the term modified refers to the alteration of single competition or at least one weeks worth of training. For example, I power lifter withdraws from a full power me due to knee pain and reduced performance in the squat and or deadlift and now focuses on a bench only meat. So that would qualify for the competition schedule being modified. So after these criteria have been set forth, we also wanted to classify sports injuries as and there's a variety. So what we did is we came up with different sort of time periods that reflects the severity of the injury based on our definition. So a minor injury one to 14 days is the duration, a moderate injury, 15 to 30 days and a serious injury greater than 30 days. And we picked these words carefully because language matters. Other classification systems and then in studies where they do actually define how they characterized an injury will say things like severe or catastrophic injuries for things that last longer than 30 days. And that may actually impair not only the current sort of symptoms that may make it worse and it may actually impair the rehab and recovery process. It should be noted that injuries are complex and it may be possible for an athlete to meet points one and three without point two, but this should necessarily negate a classification of a sports injury that person would still likely qualify. Even if they don't have a pain or discomfort or an objective neurological deficit although most of the time they likely will. So one should note that there's no requirement for tissue damage. And the best way to talk about this is actually by using an example so we'll use delayed onset muscle soreness which is known as doms. Using these criteria, routine delayed onset muscle soreness or doms would not be considered an injury. While doms can produce short-term reduction in performance as well as mild pain or discomfort, it does not typically require substantial prolong modification of the training or competition schedule unless it is very severe. In that case when doms is very severe, it would qualify as an injury but your regular soreness would not. One thing you'll notice about our definition of injury is that it's lacking any sort of requirement for tissue damage. That's because tissue damage doesn't reliably correlate to pain or dysfunction and so that's why we left it out and we'll go through this a little bit further. But before we do that, this is really one of the problems in the FIFA definition that was put forth in 2006. Each one of those items, each one of the types of injuries that they proposed, the categories was based around this sort of physical complaint like it's all biological or it's all tissue damage. But as we'll see that doesn't seem to be the case. So speaking of tissue damage, one problem with the finding injury is that there's no real distinction between disease and injury. Some scientists tend to hold the idea that injury describes damage to the body due to sudden energy changes, whereas a disease makes its presence known over longer periods of time. But this presents a number of problems with respect to injuries and pain that aren't reliably correlated to tissue damage, such as non-specific low back pain and some causes of tendonopathy, tendonopathy being an umbrella term that refers to tendon pain without specifying an underlying pathology. So we're going to make the case that tissue damage is not the same as pain. The biomedical understanding of pain is problematic. It inaccurately endorses a linear relationship between noxious stimuli and pain and is often dualist or reductionist. From a reductionist perspective, pain is often considered to be in the brain. The biocycossocial conceptualization of pain suggests biological, psychological and social factors all being integrated together at the brain, body and the environmental level. The person's experience of that integration. However, biology does not equal pain on its own. So let's go through some examples here. So for example, 21 major league baseball players received serial shoulder MRIs prior to each season for 10 years. All the pictures had some sort of tear or defect observed on MRI. 11 showed a rotator cuff tear. 9 showed an articular surface tear of the superspinatus tendon and 2 showed full thickness rotator cuff tears. Interestingly, all of the pictures were asymptomatic. They had no symptoms. Furthermore, those with evidence of a rotator cuff tear pitched over a thousand career anines were as those without evidence of a rotator cuff tear pitched less anines. About 729, this is from Lezniak 2013. The authors actually said there are no statistically significant findings between any single preseason MRI finding and subsequent time on the disabled list. A moving to a basketball, the reported prevalence of meniscal and articular cartilage abnormalities based on MRI findings are about 20 and 50 percent in asymptomatic, collegiate and professional basketball players respectively. So collegiate basketball players, about 20 percent, prevalence of meniscal and articular cartilage a damage on MRI whereas professional ball players is about 50 percent. They further reviewed MRIs on both knees of 14 NBA players who at the time of MRI demonstrated a normal physical exam meaning there were no deficiencies found on clinical exam. They had full range of motion, no joint swelling or tenderness, no ligamentes into stability, etc. All the players who had MRIs of their knees had at least one imaging abnormality. Only 3 knees total, 10 percent of the sample had no evidence of abnormality. Papas at al found a high prevalence of both patella and quadriceps tendon abnormalities in a review of 24 D1 college basketball players, a specifically 83 percent of women and 90 percent of men showed abnormal patella tendon findings. Additionally 75 percent of women and 90 percent of men showed abnormal quadriceps tendon findings. And again, I cannot stress this enough. All of these individuals we just talked about with all these imaging abnormalities were asymptomatic at the time of imaging asymptomatic. And so the reasons for this are numerous here are two potential ways to understand this. One, the tissue damage, quote unquote, may be adaptive. For example, when researchers compare the thickness of ACL and PCL which are ligaments in the knee in high level weight lifters versus sedentary controls, they found that weight lifters had much larger ACLs and PCLs. On average, weight lifters ACL were approximately 78 percent larger than those of their age match controls. Further, increasing the cross-sectional area, of those crucial ligaments, the ACL and the PCL could represent one way of reducing injury risk based on the current evidence of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for a knee injury. Another issue with just trying to connect tissue damage that's diagnosed via imaging is that this may not be reliably diagnosed to begin with. So MRIs, while useful in many cases, are probably not as reliable as the public and some doctors think. So this is one of my favorite studies by Herzog in 2016. They sent the 63-year-old woman with back pain and sciatica to 10 different MRI facilities each who had a different radiologist who generated a different report. The 10 different radiologists generated 49 different findings in total, 16 of which were unique and not a single finding was found in all 10 reports. On average, each radiologist made about a dozen errors, either false positives or false negatives. Again, we hold MRIs up to be this whole eGrail for diagnosing tissue damage, but it doesn't appear to be as reliable some of the time. And then, again, people can have MRI abnormalities and still compete at a very high level. So, again, imaging abnormalities might be an artifact of improper reading or improper interpretation based on the actual radiologist report or maybe adaptive or it might just be a twa at a time-wasted on useless detail. It might not mean anything with respect to injury or pain and that kind of comports with our more complex model, the biosecoces social model of forepain that you hear us talk about. So, much, so the TLDR is super hard to define an injury, but how we define an injury actually matters. So, again, it cannot be stated enough that tissue damage does not reliably correlate to pain. You can have observable defects or abnormalities on imaging and that not be tied to pain or dysfunction. And so, thinking of everything is just related to the biology or the anatomy, that's very reductionist and we don't want to do that. And so, by the same token, pain does not necessarily mean harm. With that in mind, imaging should always be interpreted in the clinical context. In other words, it's not a finding a lesson connects in some way to a person's case. Just going in to have an MRI to check things out is likely a bad idea because you can find a host of abnormalities that otherwise wouldn't cause you any sort of issue unless you knew about it. So, do you want to know? It depends. The clinical context is important. So, now that we have a better idea of what an injury actually is and the problems with defining injuries, and then also tissue damage, let's talk about injury risk in power lifting. But, present, we have about eight studies that look specifically at the injury risk in power lifting and I've linked them all in the description below. The range of findings is between one to four injuries per thousand participation hours or about one to two injuries per athlete per year. This is similar across all barbell sports such as weightlifting and crossfit. The other hand, bodybuilding is slightly lower and strongman and highland games are slightly higher, although admittedly there are very few studies looking at strongman and highland games, athletes, injury rates. So, while the rate actually seems to be pretty low for power lifting injuries, the prevalence or number of total cases in a population can actually be high depending on how you define it. So, there's a 2018 study by a strong back at Al, they did it on sub elite Swedish power lifters. They basically took the people who were just below that elite cutoff based on a Wilkes score and then gave them a survey, asked them about injuries and certain training and lifestyle habits. They found that 90 of 104 responders either had a current injury or an injury in the past 12 months. While the store is out to be about 3.9 injuries per thousand participation hours as far as a rate is concerned, the overall prevalence was quite high. However, this prevalence is significantly impacted by the definition that they use. In this study, they decided that an injury was defined as a condition of pain or impairment of bodily function that affected a power lifters training. For example, 73 individuals reported a current injury, but only 40 actually changed their training by reducing volume or intensity. Conversely, about 12 people decided to increase their emphasis on technique, seven emphasized their warm-up does this constitute a meaningful change for those that emphasize their technique or their warm-up? Probably not. Maybe the 40 individuals who reported changing their volume or intensity actually had an injury whereas the other folks probably not if they didn't actually have to modify their training meaningfully. Another interesting thing is that the symptoms tend to be relatively short-lived, the average duration of injury in this study and the other studies that actually report a duration is less than two weeks. So, it's not like you're building towards this catastrophic injury. You know, all this tissue damage has to build up and then boom, you blow up in your out for months that appears to be less than two weeks. So, again, the injury rates relatively low and comparable to other non-contact sports and then the duration of symptoms tends to be relatively low as well. Another problem with the study is that it was retrospective. It asked athletes to recall self-reporting injuries over the past year. Recall bias is super common in these types of studies as participants may not remember previous events or experiences accurately and they might emit details. Additionally, the accuracy and number of memories recalled may be influenced by the events and the experiences themselves, aka in this case, the injury. Finally, the validity of a recalling an injury and retrospective injury studies has been shown to be very low even when assessed by medical professionals. We prefer to do a prospective study, which is what we're actually doing on our current study. So, the question we have is, is powerlifting safe? It appears to be relatively safe. One of four injuries per thousand participation hours, which is similar to other non-contact sports. So, for example, a prospective study of injuries in about 300 elites, we just track and feel athletes show that they had an injury rate of about 3.57 injuries per thousand participation hours. Interestingly, walk in in cycling are not purely benign either. Walking, for instance, has an injury rate as high as 1.2 injuries per thousand participation hours. cycling on the other hand has an injury rate around 2 injuries per thousand participation hours. When you compare this to popular sports, context sports, like American football and wrestling, American football has got an injury rate of 9.6 injuries per thousand participation hours and wrestling has an injury rate of 5.7 injuries per thousand participation hours according to a study by Hootman at Allen 2007. Sports like soccer, rugby and cricket all have these massively inflated injury rates as well, 15 to 81 injuries per thousand participation hours. So, comparatively powerlifting is pretty safe. So, the question then becomes, is it worth the risk? And I think if we turn to Nietzsche and one of the greatest rappers of the early 2000s DMX, we can get some insight on this. Nietzsche is a German philosopher and former soccer player and he's known for this phrase, the man who's the soccer player, he's a bi-fi-mediate and the stuff. DMX also said in his 1998 hit single slip-in. So, if you find meaning in the suffering from powerlifting, it's worth it. Up next, let's discuss some strategies for injury risk reduction. So, intrinsic factors are things like gender, competitive standard, so are you elite, are you novice, bodyweight age, load lift, some of these things are modifiable, some of these things are non-modifiable. So, we'll talk about gender here. First, where differences were observed, women actually tend to have a slightly lower injury rate in barbell sports compared to men, 1.3 injuries per lifter per year, compared to 2.1 injuries per lifter per year, and this was in two separate studies. Higher rate of knee injuries than men, however, which actually comports with other existing data we have on knee injury incidents in women in sports, but that's for a whole another video because the risk factors there probably are not just related to their gender. Moving on, competitive So, two studies actually investigated this. They compared elite level, international level competitors to non-alite or national level weight lifters. Elite lifters actually had a lower injury rate, 3.6 injuries per thousand participation hours versus 5.8 injuries per thousand participation hours for the non-alite weight lifters. Another study by Rasky at our reported 2.6 injuries per thousand participation hours in the elite group and 2.9 injuries per thousand participation hours in the non-alite weight lifting group. So getting more advanced in sport doesn't appear to confer additional risk. In fact, it may be a protective and one of the mechanisms here might be just building up this tolerance to train and the adaptive changes in all of the tissues and metabolic systems and the sort of physiology of the lifter to tolerate the type of training needed to perform at that high level. As far as body weight is concerned, there's actually no data on power of senior weight lifting and body weight and how it correlates to injury risk. However, there was a single study that was performed on strong man athletes and reported that heavyweight athletes, those who were greater than 231 pounds or 105 kilos, had more injuries than lightweight competitors, those who weighed less than 105 kilos. Basically, the difference is very small, however. Zero point five injuries per thousand participation hours for the heavyweight lifters compared to 0.3 injuries per thousand participation hours for the lightweight lifters. With respect to age, again, there's no data on power lifting and weight lifting. There's a study on strong man athletes that reported fewer injuries and athletes over the age of 30 compared to those under the age of 30. But again, this difference is pretty small. So point three injuries in the people over the age of 30 per thousand participation hours compared to 0.5 injuries in those under the age of 30 per thousand participation hours. With respect to the load being lifted, it in power lifting strong back showed that hitting a personal best was weekly correlated with reporting a current injury and had an odds ratio of 1.02. Now, this is important. An odds ratio isn't as statistical measure used to determine how strongly two events are correlated to each other. So an odds ratio of one suggests that two events are independent of one another, whereas a number higher or lower than one suggests a positive or negative correlation respectively. The further the number is away from one, the stronger the correlation. Importantly, correlation cannot prove causation. So in this case, the odds ratio of 1.02 is extremely small, perhaps meaningless or even artifact increase in risk. So we don't really have data of suggesting that increased load and power lifting increases the risk. And finally, this 2017 meta-analysis by Kio at Al, which, again, a link to the description below, is a meta-analysis on 20 studies, on injuries and barbell sports concluded, in general, intrinsic factors have relatively little effect on the injury epidemiology of the weight training sports. Moving on to extrinsic factors. So there are some extrinsic factors that don't have any influence. So things like competition rules, training or competitive environment or any specific equipment, actually increase injury risk. We don't have any data suggesting that that exists. That being said, we do have some data suggesting that extrinsic factors like the acute on chronic workload, stress levels, training level, and strength levels all can correlate to injury risk. For instance, acute to chronic workload, the load refers to the internal load. Internal load is the relative physiological and psychological stress imposed by external load. Ergo, the volume intensity rest periods the overall work on the individual as interpreted through their individual characteristics, their genetics, their previous training status, their expectations, etc. So you have external load, which are, you know, all the parameters of your training, individuals characteristics, you add them together and you get the internal load and you can measure this with things like heart rate change, or things like RPE, a particular set, or a session RPE. And overall, internal workloads can be described as a measure of the perception of effort by the athletes themselves. So what's interesting here is that subjective metrics like RPE, session RPE, etc. correlate better with injury risk than external factors like intensity, volume, etc. For example, the acute chronic workload ratio considers the training load that the athlete has performed relative to the training load that he or she has been prepared for. In practice, this means that the workload assigned to a liftor should not be too much greater than what they are able to currently tolerate. So one way to measure this is to actually compare the current weeks training to the previous four weeks of training and just make sure that the increase isn't too great. That being said, it's hard to be confident about using a specific interval here like should it be this week compared to the previous four weeks, previous three weeks, previous two weeks probably needs to be adjusted for each sport. It's also hard to be confident in how some of the state actually applies to resistance training since it's still pretty new and we're kind of sucing out the details even in how to measure it. So the way that we're currently comparing workloads are by using session RPE and the duration of the session in minutes and we're comparing the average weekly values compared to the previous four weeks average. And just kind of seeing like, hey, what's the ratio between the acute workload to the chronic workload? That's rather complicated and I think one practical tool that you can take home is to start rating your session RPE. session RP, again, it's a scale going from one to ten, 10 being very very hard, one being very, very easy. If you note that most of your training sessions are RP 10, session RP 10, you're laying it all out there that probably portends a bad outcome. Some sessions may be very, very difficult but they all shouldn't be maximal all the time. Conversely, if they're very, very low, say less than five, that probably means that they're a little too easy for your given fitness level. And so therefore, may not be adding to the sort of training stress that's needed to drive for their adaptations. So again, it's important to make sure that the current level of training is reflective of your previous level of training and that you're not going up too quickly too soon because that's probably going to lead to a bad outcome. The next extrinsic factor that's meaningful is managing stress. And this is something we talk about all the time. So this is stress from work, school, interpersonal relationships, et cetera, all part of the individual characteristics that influence the internal load. So again, external load or all the objective values of the training session and then your individual characteristics sort of interpret that or filter it like an Instagram post and gives you the internal load. That's a result. And so we actually have some decent data here on this. So for example, a division one study on their collegiate athletes, they had a much higher risk of injury when academic stress was high than when it was low despite training and competition schedules being the same during both periods. And so one way that you can get around this is by having an auto regulated program where you're allowing for these day-to-day variations fluctuations or even week-to-week variations and fluctuations in your not only readiness to train, but also the resources you have for adapting to and tolerating that training. Speaking of training, becoming well-trained is a great way to reduce your injury risk. And we call this the training injury prevention paradox. This is a phenomena where athletes accustomed to high training loads tend to have fewer injuries that athletes training at a lower workload. This is also known as the workload injury paradox whereby higher chronic workload is protective against injury when acute workload is similar to that chronic workload. So training more and becoming more well-trained tends to reduce the risk of injury. So gradually increasing the training load over time so you can handle more workload tends to be a good idea to reduce the risk of injury. There's some evidence for this with respect to higher level lifters actually having a lower injury risk. We talked about that a few minutes ago. And the takeaway here is that when you actually again look at the higher level lifters, the elite level lifters, they're actually training at much higher volumes, much higher frequencies usually than newer lifters and yet their injury risk tends to either be the same or lower in these studies that we actually have inside it here. So what you would expect is that since they're participating in more and more training that they're actually at risk, higher risk for for injuries but in fact they're not in there. It appeared to be again sort of able to tolerate this increased level of training due to rashing up that workload over time becoming more well-trained. Probably one of the biggest extrinsic factors that we can actually modify here is getting stronger. Unfortunately, there's no data on powerlifting or barbell sports on actually like, oh, however strong you are correlates to your injury risk. But in other sports, there's clear data here. So for example, a study on 26,000 athletes showed that improving strength reduced sports injuries to less than one-third and overuse injuries could be reduced by half. Another study analyzing injury risk reduction from strength training showed a 10% increase in strength training volume reduced the risk of injury by more than 4% at points. Overall, this probably kind of falls or ties into that become well-trained category. As getting stronger over time requires more training and therefore the tolerance or being able to tolerate increased training load. One thing we can't leave out we're talking about barbell sports are accidents. So for instance, dropping weights on feet are fairly common, accidents in the weight room are common with actual increased risk in younger individuals who presented to the emergency department. Injuries were classified as accidental if it was caused by dropping a weight or improper equipment use. So in a sample of over 4,000 patients, a 77% of the injuries seen in the age group 8 to 13 were due to accidental injuries. So again, dropping a weight or improper equipment use were as 27 and a half percent of all weight room related injuries were accidental in the age group 22 to 30. So still significant, watch your toes, don't drop weights on your toes if you can avoid that. In addition to accidents, a catastrophic injuries do happen but they're relatively rare. And so you look at case reports to kind of see like, hey, what sort of things are happening? Is there any way to reduce the risk from these catastrophic injuries? And I don't think so outside of safety practices in the gym. So for example, there's one study that reported a clavicle fracture that occurred during the bench press. Somebody broke their collarbone during the bench press. Another case report where a guy had a simultaneous rotator cuff and biceps tendon tear during strong manic competition. I'm not sure that there's anything that you can do to reduce the risk there. Okay. And fortunately fatal accidents in the weight room are relatively rare. So again, only handful of case reports here. The first report I found was a nine-year-old boy had a 23 kilo barbell fallen his chest from the uprights on a bench support in the home. So I assume that there was a bench press in the home and there was an oddly specific yet non-standardized 23 kilo barbell just resting on the uprights and any event this bar came down landed on their chest. The kids chest and twirl hold on his right atrium did not survive that unfortunately. The second report, weight lifter who was using animal steroids, experienced sudden cardiac death, although the sudden cardiac death might have been due to an arrhythmia, due to a congenital defect in certain ion channels which can happen too. Overall, I'm not sure that we can actually reduce the risk of these types of events. So last part of my presentation was on injury management and I think that is best saved for another time because it's a pretty expansive topic. I'm already running long to begin with and I think that we have some more concise and accessible and easily digestible resources that I've linked in the description below. There's a great video with Dr. Bracky and a handful of our different articles that I think would be useful to plug in here. So overall that was my presentation at the 2019 European Powerlifting Conference. It sounds much better in here than it does in the auditorium so hopefully you guys enjoyed and now let's hear from some of the other presenters at the conference. You can get really the results because now that it is really exercising intensely and that's not going to be actually competitive. To defend that, you will really all sign slowly, which is no race ever, and no competition ever. Both at the moment, you can just split just slowly and then you can walk that takes like 30 seconds. So, I would want to characterize our riders and then sort of join the rest with best. So we know that the protein can have a significant impact on body opposition, especially for cutting, you know, exhibition, protein, also maintaining body mass. All right, raising the addition to supporting performance on to prevent fatigue, you know, that our ability to work in Passy is regularly in store-stored glyphogen levels. It also spare with room to ease. They allow that for the teams we used for cellophonal superpincynthesis rather than being working down on an enemy. Facial auto-operative, they help us support hormone production. Maybe it could taste good. And there are a few fantastic, also essential amino acids. So we do have to get those from the diet. So we're gonna, there are low, safe limits for all these nutrients. Now, a couple of high-finished meat, hence, have to take time with your own. You can make our own little close. You can give it any of your chances, but that's really not a factor of work requirements. Let's go on my name's Eric Helms. I am here at the EPC. I am a research fellow at the Gopton University of Technology, not strength conditioning at Ph.D. And also one of the co-founders in the Chief Science Officer of 3D muscle journey. I talked about sticking to agents in power lifts today. What causes them how we should be thinking about them and just realize that we're gonna have them regardless on one of the evidence of these strategies that we could use to address them. Okay, now, in serious note, I'm presenting on that sticky, sticky, if you put it in an air, as carbon, whatever, not sticky voice. What do we know? What are they? How we define them? What do they mean? And should we be doing anything about them? Who here is aware of the internal battle between specificity and an inviriation and an in the world of power with them? Less side, first of Shai-Ko, first of the Bulgarian system, and first of the Middle East, first of my teams, we put a K-D show up and we're very different, vice-chair-in, and how we're gonna do a more impressive role with her. Don't you know, it's 2019 Mathematics Science. It's a vicious, vicious, warm round, isn't it? So, this continued from an outside, as you're expected, if you're a computer power, you're not all looks to say, you guys are just doing variations, I'm better press-watching it, but that's kind of silly. But a lot of it is also driven by tradition, who's a pervert of Louis Sims. Does someone who, yes, you could lose you? Out! So, yeah, this is something that is present in all things that you can do. If we do things because other people do things, and then we feel it's appropriate to do those things, because we want to get excited, because smart people say we do it, or you're a good listener, or you're a good coach. We inherit a lot of ideas without actually knowing the idea, but many of the idea, I think it's kind of a good thing. Like, what I see is we go through phases and power of movements we consider good accessories for x-wanted, the real reason everyone was doing off-delessor and the names for a while, because not for these names, I get it because shekno, right? Or we need to pause to ask for a while, not because owning most right down the whole loss, like this whole heart of sense of, right? And if that's on what area you're in, we did the first type of, which because, there you go, right? So there are rationality, and these people didn't go to these for reasons, but the individuals you might be seeing do it done, or the people letting that out, often the reason has no more depth than I've heard of, which was a good accessory movement to do. So I want to take this movement beyond that. I want to explore the continuum of accessory movement, as in a little bit of a statement watch. And to do that, we have to have an understanding of what's taking points are, if they're, and what actually makes sense for a scientific biochemical perspective, to do about it. So, who will aspect as my talk, that I addressed to these main common practice, you'll see pauses in power of the thing, something that you'll see in various types of programming, that they have deadlifted the cause of the needs. This is often done as hyperlithin for the purpose of trying to get stronger than showing where you're weak. But if you think about it, if you are weak in a certain sticking region, do you actually want to be training yourself to reduce less force by stopping there? Probably not. However, you make it technical fault, just off the floor to the knee, where the barter of the leg is very common thing. It might make sense to have a fallen, as a sort of trait of partial range emotion, to actually chunk the movement from motor learning. So, that is probably a better approach, and I better use this method rather than thinking about it's the sticking region. I should actually pause there. What's the MMA fighter? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can count on me, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like if Conner McGregor, like lifted weights, and like, with strong. Conner McGregor? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, so this is Brett Gives, I have a world championship, multi-time I have, we'll champion Big Bencha, Bintcha, he was talking to me the other day about why Griffa's close grip of Benchpress for competition. Yeah, what do your thoughts? Well, I mean, there's always things that you should be in the sports field, what's from the field? Yeah, I guess we got talking about it. I mean, but the other day, I said, I didn't notice you were close to being, I guess, Junior, most people were up. Sure, yeah. I'm an off, and I had gone through that. And initially, I said what happened, I was sort of, you know, usual sort of, think you're on the ring. I guess a lot of people started around there. And then I took my pick. I mean, then it wasn't a full theory that was like, not just a small possibility, but I wasn't able to be inside that. And so, because you had that in the back, you might have said, we had to close grip for a while, and I got really, really strong at that close grip. And going out white, I was felt with and it wasn't as strong. So I trained like that for a long long time, so arms pretty much root for it. And eventually got the point where it was super, super hard to make progress. Like I got around around, around 180 to 195, which is still a great interest. And I was making those, obviously made them broken from around, you know, I put about 20 kilos on it, so it's like, for instance. But it's couldn't give past their corners, essentially. I knew that. If you look at most of the biggest benches, they're not super close, they're not going to start with their arms root cool. Or even two fingers outside of it, it's going to be least on the ring and water, right? So I knew that going out water, was going to have a higher strength, but tension on the fucking tendu to train while they've, you know, the next two or three years. Even if I take a hit now, like 10 kilos now, I can go out of the water, and it's going to result in a bigger benches, essentially. And what's your bench now? Which is exactly what happens. So the biggest benches I've actually done now is 220 kilos. I mean, I have, oh, I reckon I would have zero chance of being able to do that with the close grip. And I also think that it can, that can definitely, so that was obviously the recovery aspects, the variety, so the transference of exercise that you're going to have with, you know, with close grip being your competition, pressing movements. So it's again, transference and secondary loss, you know, water those exercises going to be, that's essentially. So you get a lot more variety, you get a lot more volume in when you're sort of somewhere in that sweet pedal, and then a wrench, just a walk, and you know, see that, you know? Hey guys, Dr. Mike Guitel from Renaissance Periodization. Our average foods are often the tastiest food in the world. They are foods, though, we'll sort of one at a time, which are very food. We've got a man, which are very food, cookies. Those are cars. Does anyone have a bigger food than just not have cars? Let's hear it in this first, say they hear it. I'm sure it's gone. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. This is a big amount of fat food anywhere. And there's about 2009, we're like, you put bacon and everything. It is cool to eat bacon, like you were a f***** apple. Like store-tubered black-bying, you cover up your bacon and you restaurant, and they're, yeah, it's not here. They're in the law office. They can eat bacon. No, anyone with friends? Not all the jokes are funny people. I'm actually laughing at my view. I'm not kidding. I didn't get it. I didn't watch all tasty foods at cars. I don't know why I'm doing it. So when somebody's restricted to car, a high-grade intake, because they have, look, many of us can issue with over-eat food they're super tasty. If you put out cars, I don't feel like I've ever tried this. She ain't even a car to do. Like someone's in a car that you're ghosting. All right, you did a f***** you leading one. Can't have car to do it. Okay. You're like, oh, I got bacon. Put it all in one line and crying while seeing it. You know what I mean? I'm gonna do that side and the car people and walk around with their dogs, made a nice thing, and they'll just like, f*****. I want cars. So if you lower your cars, you can potentially control your appetite from low enough intake, exposed to this super, super-suitable tasteiness. But if you're rich in car-powered intake, you can score a fat child of taking the right high foods, which we'll get into, it can be tough. It can be tough, which is my life, folks. Come to you, it's a beautiful life, our from all over, our, you have those medications. Do the cool, cool thing, more cars like you're in a row, when I think cars like low enough. And they go into some living to that, right? There's a living in that and short term, when they go off and just eat more cars in a team set, or a couple of days, they're also long term to the same team, these end-bremes, six, where I have, I'll start with you know. Those are the downside of car. They're not that. Right? A lot of works that's not a little picture, they're outside of cars, so let's say, a look at those, and see if we can get a little bit more clear. On a side, car or high rates, when you eat them, tend to cross against some of the creation of something, so it's nice. And it's so incredibly helpful, and also muscle growth. If definitely helps with muscle growth, because it is anti-charology, you can even break, and so on as wide as you can, I'm all getting to prevent some muscle loss considerably. If you look at that, one thing is metronautalysis, and the more spot they have there, it actually does have a significant to provide a lot of that all the effects. All of the studies around other people actually lift weights, or people who consume a lot of power at all time, and that probably has even bigger than it all the effects. If you look at the number of people that have ever done in enormous eating, no power to low power, so this is precisely eating zero people. And the artist people in the world get to order a lot of power of high rate, that's probably not the accent. So if you eat carbohydrates, you probably go to a muscle, which is a good thing, which is what we want. So that's good. Power from a normal muscle in other ways. A muscle pump has been implicated in how to get at least a part right because you're constantly not going to be feeding, five cells wide. So if you're able to get a constant power growly, it's a little bit more muscle, it's not just potential, but it's an important point. So if you eat more carbs, you get bigger pumps. You guys are running in charge for a while, you eat carbs, you go to a gym, like I made of things, and either, and just go in the gym, just get in, I know that's good at carbs, so just have a lot of it. So when you eat carbs, you get a bigger pumps, and then you get a bigger pumps, you probably go to a muscle, that's really good thing. There it is. When you pack it up, you muscle cells by which your cell detects how much glyphogen you are storing, and if you're storing lots of it, it's sort of gives you all clear muscle, what's the best pathways you can go? If you're storing very little glyphogen, but either the body is less inclined to let you grow muscle, it's not a one or zero relationship, it's not under warm, it's probably a sort of scale relationship where if your glyphogen is mostly your fully loving, you are really, really potentially hypertrophy and getting to muscle milk, if you are significantly a loss of glyphogen, muscle milk is much harder, right? So you can probably be under in carbohydrates and you will get some more occasional times where glyphogen is not really highly stored, you're basically got a muscle growth. And then, similarly, the take on tip is, you don't need to go crazy, you get super in depth of the numbers, but as long as you're eating enough carbohydrates, you're supporting your training, and you don't feel like you're super deprived of glycogen, if you feel like you're getting decent, up to the gym, and you feel like your energy levels are good, then you are probably getting enough carbs, and if you wanna push the carb level up the past, that's probably not a ton of advantage. So there's a lot of preference there, just don't go super crazy low in the carbs, and eat enough fats and protein, you can have tons of carbs, you'd be super successful, and you're vast, and then people love you, and you finally have happiness. My guilt about what a massage year's situation. N 2017 Hey, I'm Magto share with zero. Three active trainers. mantis And have to be that ambitions will be what's going league. That would be important if you want to know maybe for example the recovery plan of a certain living intervention then you would want to know how much stress that's in part of the organism not necessarily how much volume is. As close as working. Let's work and start here. Let me go back. Let's see where you guys must have the subtle a week. I would say that's kind of the question that I started out with is what is it that I'm trying to understand when we talk about volume? This volume telling me, this volume answering the question that's bouncing around my head. The question is something about how difficult is this protocol? How difficult is it to complete and how difficult will it be to recover from in a sense of returning to a normal ability to execute the next workout? Recovery is one of these difficult things to define. I think we from a pragmatic standpoint we kind of know what recovery feels like. I'm going to leave it at that for now. I think we get into maybe a rigorous definition of what that's all about. I'd rather focus on some of those things. I think volume is pretty obviously insufficient to answer that question. As an example here, if you imagine that you have a more than 100 kilos and we give you two different protocols. The third of the results is three sets of 12 reps of 60 kilos. That's going to be basically three 12 reps. The Eugene Lates 21, 2100 kilos of volume versus three sets of three reps of 90 kilos. Three are in sets is a little bit more than a third of volume. What impact those two workouts have? Just three sets of three are in demand about the third of the resources. No one does the same right? Conversely, what if we try to equate for volume? In terms of ton of share, you can say three sets of 12 reps again, three 12 arm sets. How many three are in sets? What do you need to do? If you're not following, you have to do eight three arm sets. If you imagine doing an agenda in the squad of three 12 arm sets versus eight three arm sets, it doesn't seem like an equal amount of work. It doesn't seem like this is telling me what I want to know about the difficulty of the resource demand of the training that I'm doing. This is really important because one of everyone's favorite questions to ask is how does that surprise should I do? I think it turns out that the answer of how much stress is given protocol and partying on a letter that turns out to be a pretty important information and answering that question. You can also count on your card sets. On the Greg's website, there was an article. I think I'm a falsely attributing this agreement with the best of it. In Greg's article, I'm a type of fee risk range. I'm asking about counting on your card sets. I remember when I read that, I was like, man, that's good. That might get it, right? In any dozen of large part, if you take our two protocol, we can increase that of 12 reps, 3 12 arm sets. Well, that's three words and sets, three heart sets, there's just three heart sets, that's also three heart sets. It makes a big more sense that those are similar demand on resources, energy during the session, and after the session. I don't mean that to say energy in terms of caloric expenditure, I'm talking about energy in terms of cognitive emotional energy, how long will you take you to feel normal again after that session? How long does it take the strongest to go away? How long will it take any sort of joint stiffness to go away? It seems like number of heart sets gets closer to that. But then we don't always do 10 RPE sets. We don't always take every set to failure. So we're about three singles and 90 kilos. Those will be singles that are 7 and a half, 8 RPE, somewhere in there. How do those compare to three heart sets? What about three doubles, 85 kilos or 12 singles and 80 kilos? How do they do those things compared to it? The individual singles and 80 kilos, if you're more or less 100 kilos, a single 80 is going to be quite easy. Should that count as zero? That doesn't seem right. So what fraction of a heart set should that count as? I started asking myself, where do I think from a practitioner standpoint that, the stress from training comes from? What I came up with is that it comes from primarily from muscle damage or tissue damage, more waterflates, but some sort of busy logical change as an adult of the training status and psychological fatigue? Rather than trying to spend a lot of time calculating tonnage and all that stuff, focus more on number of heart sets, something like that, just keep in mind that easy sets don't count as zero, but heart sets definitely count as more than that.

There's two parts of your body that it's socially acceptable to regularly display. Look, that's your four arms and calves. So, regardless of which other training goals are, if you are training your four arms and calves, like honestly, what's the point? You're always on display. Yeah. You always train. Yeah. Because, you know. I do try to time it, but yeah, we're going to do nothing. What's your name? How do you say the ball gets full of it? Oh, it's real ball gets full of it. It's real ball. Yeah.

=== FILE: Exercise for Persistent Pain Populations w⧸ Dr. Michael Ray [sL-nL-hVKGY].txt ===

I can't watch Hey guys, this is Dr. Michael Ray, I'm a Barbell Medicine Pain and Reheat clinician I'm coming to you today with a video about our latest blog that we just released regarding exercise and persistent pain Now in this blog I review an article by Plaskiedl titled Exercise and Doose Hyperalegesia, a meta analysis of exercise dosing for the treatment of chronic pain If you're not from the other type of olegesia, it's just a fancy way of saying decreased pain perception Now we know that this is an important issue, persistent pain is estimated to affect about 1.5 billion people worldwide today And to the main stage treatments that are usually recommended are both education to the patient about pain And then also go oriented activity interventions or exercise Exercise the difficult part about this discussion is we actually don't have a lot of solid data and good knowledge on what's an appropriate exercise dosage For patients dealing with persistent pain and in particularly specific pain states That's something that Plaski seeks to share a little bit more light on So Plaski took data from a 2017 Cocken review by Genon and reexamine that data to see if we could have DOSage effects with exercise on persistent pain states Now Genon from the 2017 Cocker interview had this to say about the totality of evidence for exercise and persistent pain states The evidence in this overview suggests that the broad spectrum of physical activity and exercise interventions assessed here A aerobic strength flexibility range of motion core or balance training programs as well as yoga, Pilates and Tai Chi All potentially beneficial though the evidence for benefit is low quality and inconsistent The most commonly reported adverse events for increased soreness or muscle pain which subsided after several weeks of the intervention Physical activity and exercise main proof pain severity as well as physical functioning quality of life So based on what Genon had to say from the 2017 Cocker review it appears There was not exactly an overwhelming amount of evidence will support for the recommendation of exercise or particular dosage for individuals for system pain And this new article by Plaski out of all the authors sought to understand how altering the dose of exercise might affect pain They say the primary objective is to test the hypothesis that the dose of exercise would impact the efficacy of exercise and physical movement based therapy To reduce persistent or chronic pain For this new review, Plaski out of the site to utilize randomized control trials from the 2017 Cocker review That included adult patients, 18 years of older chronic non-cancel pain defined as greater than three months in duration And it is a meta analysis reporting post intervention effect sizes for pain It was put in the final caveat was the included articles had to be published in a peer review journal Now the Cocker review originally included I want to say 21 papers 381 individual studies now Plaski ended up including 75 individual studies that met their inclusion criteria The pain states that they looked at were inclusive of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, low back pain, intermittent clodication, neck pain, spinal cord injury, and fatella for more pain syndrome Those were included pain states When they wanted to look at exercises effects on those pain states, they then had to classify the exercises that were utilized in these interventions And they did this kind of broadly, they classify the exercise modalities as either strength or resistance training, aerobic exercise, either land or water And then meditative movement therapy Now they further subdivided from these broad categories and to things like walking, jogging, pilates, tai chi Motor control exercises range of motion, flexibility exercises, aquatic aerobics, resistance training and land aerobic exercise They talk about that a lot more in the article which I definitely recommend reading So once the authors categorize the exercise interventions, they needed to then classify the exercise dosage For each exercise intervention to look at its effect on the pain states particularly So they classify the exercise dosage, based off of frequency intensity, time, and duration Frequency is defined as the number of bouts of exercise performed within a week So for example, if they performed the exercise intervention three times that week, then the frequency would be three Intensity was defined as absolute intensity in which they took metabolic equivalent units, nets And they multiplied that by the number of minutes performed in one week For time that was a cumulative amount of time and minutes the exercise was completed per week So if they completed it 60 minutes and those three times per week, that would be 180 minutes of time per week And finally duration was the weeks the exercises were implemented in the study So if the study went on for 12 weeks, then the duration was at 12 week intervention So again they just classify those in the frequency intensity, time, and duration For each exercise intervention and it looked at how the dosage effects particular pain-based states So overall the author states that they found that most of the studies included in this review Demonstrated some positive benefits of exercise up pain outcomes that was 69 of the 75 included studies Of which 30 were statistically significant So less than half Of the statistically non-significant studies 39 or 45 described positive training benefits of exercise Why only six studies reported worse pain with exercise? Now that last part of that statement is kind of intriguing When we see things like trending towards statistically significant That's more of a view to or a trickery where it's not really telling us anything meaningful But rather perhaps it's trying to force someone's bias of wanting to support exercise interventions for Efficacious ways to help people with persistent pain Trending towards statistically significant isn't very meaningful in this regard So the reason article about Pulaski at L just further demonstrates our lack of knowledge regarding a proper exercise dosage For those dealing with persistent pain We seem to know that it's beneficial but at what frequency intensity time and duration We're really not sure it's not like the national physical activity guidelines that we have in the US But we have some understanding of an appropriate baseline level of dosage to incur health benefits on the participant We're not quite there yet with persistent pain You know it has a lot of positive benefits We're just not sure what their proper dosage is Now this shouldn't be looked at as a net negative The way that we can see this as clinicians Is this means we can work collaboratively with patients Define with their appropriate dosage for them Based off of their goals Their ability to hear long-term and most likely that's going to be related to something that they enjoy And then finally looking at their prior training history all of those could culminate into getting together Some type of what I would prefer to call movement activity or cold erected movement activity That they can utilize to work through the issue to currently dealing with And then maybe if we can get by and long-term for all the other positive physiological adaptations from exercise Then we get something that they want to do long-term throughout life Even with the understanding that maybe their interest change It would be very easy as a member of the Barbel medicine team I personally very much enjoyed resistance training Specifically with the barbell But as someone came to me working through one of these pain-based states that they discussed in this paper And they weren't very into barbel training They knew that it wasn't something they're going to do in the future And they just didn't have any interest Then I'm probably going to find other exercises to incur the effect that I'm looking for That they think they could adapt to their lifelong term We know exercise adaptations on a spectrum Some of the ceases doing the exercise the minute they leave our clinic Then is probably going to not have a long-term benefit for them One final point that I do think is important to state here We do know that it's okay to allow patients dealing with persistent pain-based symptoms to exercise with pain And there may be some short-term benefits and allowing such an approach By decreasing connesia phobia Instilling self-efficacy and teaching the patient that pain doesn't equal tissue damage necessitating avoidance and protection Hert doesn't equal harm in the scenario Either way, hopefully the findings from this review Help stifle claims that one must do a particular exercise dosage Type frequency intensity time and duration to get themselves out of pain And rather reframe focus on defining the patient's preferred exercise dosage Based on activity history and individual goals

=== FILE: How Does Weight Loss Change Cholesterol Levels？ [I3MVuKYKZvQ].txt ===

How are lipid panels affected by dieting? So in general, let's talk about after you've lost weight, right? So you've dieted and lost weight and then we'll talk about what happens while you're actively dieted. After you lost weight, usually a 5 to 10% weight loss produces a about 10 to 15% reduction in LDL and maybe a little bit greater reduction in triglycerides, which can be useful. Particularly if you were carrying too much body fat before. If you lose more weight, you can see a greater decrease in those numbers, right? So if you lost 20% body weight, you may see a given greater decrease in your LDL and your triglycerides. And in general, HDL tends to stay the same. If you start exercise at the same time, HDL may even increase overall good. Now the nuance here is that if you were a candidate for statins prior to losing weight, meaning that your 10-year risk of having a bad outcome. So you were a 10-year risk of having a heart attack or stroke or something like that was high and you were a good candidate for statins. The treatment goal for LDL reduction is 50%. 50. Reduce your LDL by 50%. And so if the average amount of LDL reduction you can expect by reducing your body weight 5 to 10%, which is a pretty substantial weight loss, right? Is 10 to 15%. You're not getting there. You're less than 3 times less than the sort of that minimum threshold. So it doesn't mean that you shouldn't even try to lose weight, just take the statins, forpig pharma. Now what I'm saying is just that we should not avoid medications when they provide clear benefit. And it doesn't mean that the person maybe necessarily needs to be on a statin forever. It's just to reduce that risk, substantially going forward. Maybe that's the initial movement. What happens to the lipid panel while you're actually dieting. You can think about this as the body fat. You're actually liberating a lot of stored fat into the bloodstream and you're using it for fuel. And so a blood test, particularly a cholesterol test, is a snapshot in time of how much fat is in your blood, how much fat is being carried around by certain proteins in your blood. And so let's say then you stick the needle in the vein, pull out the blood. Oh crap, there's way more fat in your blood at this particular time. It's like, well yeah, it's on its way to the muscle tissue to be oxidized for fuel, for example. And so you see that all the time that people, their triglyceride levels will be significantly elevated while they're losing weight. Sometimes even their LDL will be elevated while they're losing weight. It usually doesn't happen after you've lost weight and you're weight has plateaued, but certainly during weight loss. So the recommendation for lipid panel intervals is about, is every six months, I believe, after you've initiated it, all of those some clinicians will do three month intervals. I, when I was actively seeing patients and somebody was trying to lose weight and for lifestyle, we were trying to lifestyle recommendations initially. I would effectively try to schedule that second lipid test till after a period of time, we were given that a lose weight and then maintain it. Meaning that if it's going to take you more than three months to kind of lose the weight, I would extend the interval time so that you are weight neutral, maintaining your weight, your new lower weight before I tested. Got another lipid test. Yeah, I don't think there's a great reason to check lipid panel super frequently. I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I definitely, every three months is, is I think too frequent to be super useful. I would just not check blood tests while you are actively aggressively trying to lose weight and then check things, you know, like that after things have stabilized. So, good.

=== FILE: How Sore and Tired Should You Get From Exercise and How-To Adjust Training [A652sNIRrvg].txt ===

We're going to try to answer some of these curated questions that you guys have submitted. Alright, question number one. How do you effectively balance training so you are still making improvements but aren't functionally useless the next day or two or even longer? This sidebar. When was the last training session that you had that just laid you out completely? It's been many, many, many years. Probably the last one I could remember was like probably about the time when I quit Texas method. Oh yeah, yeah. Programme that I would not do again. I think I mean the last time that I was so sore or like just beaten down after a training session is when we went to that CrossFit level 1 MD thing in Hawaii. In Hawaii and I remember we were walking to the car and I was like there's a disturbance in the force. You know, like quads? Like yeah. But I wasn't like useless. I was just annoyed because then I couldn't really train productively the next time I wanted to train. Oh you mean, so at the seminar they actually made us do a couple of wads with them. Yes. That was why that happened to you. My favorite part of that whole experience was Austin and I were in different squat groups so they're trying to teach us the squat and it would PVC pipe right. It's the front squat and my front squat is terrible. I like to blame my anthropometry. Austin likes to blame my lack of athleticism. But I'm being told there with the PVC pipe like wedged up against my beard. It's guys like beautiful front rack position, excellent mobility or whatever. And Austin is in the corner getting squat therapy because apparently he's got butt wink or something. A lot of his squat. It is taking everything in my power not to start laughing at him. That's my favorite part of that. Yeah. Besides random glassmen sort of excerpts. But to answer this question, I don't know that at any point in my training career, since I've been using auto regulation and actually kind of been thinking more about my the process of getting stronger that I've been so sore or so tired after training session that it's actually made a difference in anything I've done afterwards. I mean, during the best most productive training years, training wise in my life, I took all of my boards. I, you know, did my intern year in residency of graduate medical school, like started this business, like whatever. So at no point was my, I guess, cognitive function impaired significantly at no point that I have to miss a training session because I was like two sore. There's been modifications, but those are all kind of baked into the training, which is the idea. Your training session should meet you where you're at on a given day based on your performance potential and that performance potential is intimately related to how great you're good you're feeling, right? How well you're functioning, which you can only tell like when you're in the gym, right? They'll have like indicator weights for certain movements, like you hit this weight and you're like, all right, do that move fast or slow. It tells you like, am I going to be stronger than normal or not quite a strong on a given day? On average, you know, again, it's a bell curve kind of thing. Most days, I'm going to average level of strength. Some days are better than others, but I, to answer this particular question, I think if you're routinely feeling beat up and like your personal life, professional life is suffering, secondary to training, I would, I would, the training program probably needs to be adjusted. And if it's one of our training programs, which is possible, I mean, I had a guy come up and say he's running one of our hypertrophy templates and he's like, I've never been more sore in my entire life. And I'm like, instead of like, I don't know if you wanted to tap on the back, right? Like, yeah, brother, you're good for you. I was like, hey, man, I'd probably lower the RP target RP of each set by two or so. The idea is like, maybe you see their overshooting or going to failure, or close to failure too often, or otherwise sort of maybe partying too much stress for what you can currently handle. And that's kind of leaving and feeling beat up and tired to whatnot. So that's how I would address this is, is adjust the training stress. Yeah, the first thing I think of when I hear that somebody is feeling useless for two days after a training session is this is a major programming issue. You're either doing too much or what you're doing is too hard. So those are my usual interventions at that time point is probably upfront. I'm going to look at the program and if it seems like a reasonable dosage of training, I'm going to bump the RP targets down by a point or two or whatever. Some made up of mouth and see how they do. If it seems like maybe you started training, you know, not that long go and you're probably doing more than I would expect you to need at this point in your training. Maybe I'll trim off some back offsets or something like that. I might adjust the volume, but you should never feel that destroyed from your training. It's not a badge of honor. It doesn't make you better than anybody else. And it is probably not the best way to go about your training if you want to train consistently and kind of build momentum and build progress over time. I really, I mean, even back then that time that I was alluding to, I still was not like put out for two days. I just felt, you know, more fatigued than usual. So I don't know that I've ever felt functionally useless for a day or two after a training session. And even really get particularly sore at all anymore. Yeah, let's not really knew exercise or something. Yeah, with new exercises, that's kind of expected. But to Jordan, Jordan was making the point during the last lecture that we're not aiming to continually overload people and make stuff harder and an effort to force adaptations to happen. Rather, if the training is set up appropriately, you will adapt and be able to demonstrate that by increasing your loads in subsequent sessions. So earlier this past week, I had one of the best, I've actually, this last week was one of the best training weeks I had. And on my main deadlift day this past week, I pulled heavier than I have in a while. So I pulled like 60 for a double. It was quite easy. A bunch of back off work, a bunch of other movements that day and after I finished, I told Tom, I said, you know, if I had to rate like the session RPE of this, there was like a six. Like these were some of the heaviest weights I've lifted in a while. But everything moved fast. I felt really strong. I didn't feel particularly beat up. I could have done way more sets. I could have gone way closer to failure. So that's what I had in me on the day for the programming that was there. I took it, felt strong, felt great. The session, even though it was very heavy, relative to my recent performance, it did not crush me. And I felt fine afterwards. And I felt fine since. So training should not be destroying you. Would not recommend you go to that point. So some adjustments are in order. Yeah. And I think that if you're regularly feeling that way, just got to change training. Yeah. Can't eat your way out of that. Can't sleep your way out of that. No. Can't remember where we had of that. Yeah. All right.

=== FILE: How To Get Motivated To Exercise？ [8J0qsTNU1lc].txt ===

All right, number 10. Any tips or techniques you find generally helpful for increasing motivation or discipline and training? I mean, this is a tough one. It is a tough one, but I think I go back to some of the stuff we talked about during the behavioral change lecture, and then additionally we kept sprinkling in. I think you should enjoy this. I think you should enjoy not only the training you're doing, but the components of that, but the actual process, so your goal-oriented training. So I think if somebody is like really having a hard time sticking to it, I'd wonder like, do you like what you're doing? Is this enjoyable for you? And if it is, great. So what's holding you back? Because there are some things that come up that people generally respond to in a way where they might need some additional counseling. So for instance, if somebody misses day one of the workout, I've seen it a lot of times where people will just not work out the rest of the week. They're like, I missed my first day, this week's off. I'm just going to repeat this week next week. They think it's like all they're not in for nominal. And it's like, nope, don't do that. Or like, no, but if I don't work out today, then tomorrow's my scheduled rest day, then I'll have to work out tomorrow. And then have to work out the back to back and that's like bad because I need to perform optimally on all these days. And it's like, no, just put all the workouts together. We have like a literally a litany of different questions on our form that's like, hey, I'm leaving town for the week on Thursday, on Friday. And I have four workouts to do this week, what new? And it's like workout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, going your vacation. And I don't say that like to be dismissive, right? But it's like the actual acute performance during your workout doesn't really matter as much as you get into the total training. So that's just one common thing that I see all the time and people are struggling for time resources in order to train. And I think working around that can help people stay adherent to the training program provided they like what they're doing. But if someone hates what they're doing, right, or is fearful of what they're doing, that's problematic. The third thing that I find really important is the social aspect here. So if people are doing this by themselves, so like they have a home gym and they're the only one in their house that uses the home gym, or if none of their family members work out, even immediate or extended, none of their friends work out, they're just effectively leaving their social circle. They're saying, I'm going to leave my family, I got to leave all my friends and I go to the gym where I don't know that many people, that's a hard sell for a lot of people. And so I think that to the degree, you can leverage social support, you can make things more effective, a second economical from a time perspective, and then make it enjoyable. Those are my big sort of things that you can practically apply to the programming and the social support network to get people to adhere to training. But as far as actually finding motivation in people, that's stuff. You got to give them the old gipper talk. Why, what do you want to do with this? What do you want to get out of this? Where do you want to be in three months, six months, 12 months? How do your actions on a daily basis lead you closer to or further away from that particular goal? Something. Yeah, yeah, I think I don't love the, I don't love centering this discussion around the idea of discipline at all. We've talked in some of our previous Q&As and on podcasts and stuff like that that, you know, in the past decade, we can count how many workouts we've missed on one hand or less. Even last week, when I was laid up with the flu, I still went out and did my deadlift day on Tuesday. And like I said, I almost passed out trying to pull 405 and people might say, you're an idiot, you're crazy for trying to go do that. And I was like, well, I think back to that day, right? I'm having like coughing and chills and sweat on the couch and I feel like shit. Why did I go out to the gym and try to do that? Was it because I'm just like a total badass and more disciplined than anyone else on earth? No, it's because I actually enjoyed training. And I got up that day and I was like, well, today would normally be a training day and I liked training. So it would make me feel better. Maybe if I went out and tried to do something. Now, I probably tried to pull more than I was ready for on that day, right? But I did it because I actually enjoy training. If I loathed training, if I hated training and I felt that sick, that's like double barrier to try to go out and do that thing, right? So I look back to why have we not missed a training session in the past decade, basically, or a couple, right? Because we actually enjoy training. And to the extent that maybe we've we both definitely like skipped out on certain like, say, social engagements or something, because we, because training was more important to us, it's because we enjoy doing that, right? So the enjoyment piece, I think, is under-emphasized underrated. It's not that, you know, we're just like better than you because we can do this thing that we hate, right? Even when we don't want to, hey, we actually enjoy doing this thing. So I think finding that like why you're doing this and trying to play that up is a bigger piece there than just saying, you're not disciplined enough to do this, right? You're a bad person because you didn't do this session because you're not disciplined enough. I don't think that that's a good way to view human behavior really in general. Also Rick Ross helps. Always. Instant PR. Instant PR, snap, yes.

=== FILE: How to Become a GREAT Strength Coach (No Certification Needed) [a8m-YxM-ByA].txt ===

Hey everyone, welcome back to the barbell medicine YouTube channel iTunes, Stitcher, wherever you're getting this from. This is the barbell medicine crew. Minus like Vanessa Hassan, Alex, Charlie, Charlie, Derek, Joe, and we're missing some of them. We're missing some people. We're missing some people. We're in Chicago. We're going to talk about coaching. So we wanted to get a broad panel, individuals, and talking about coaching today. This is the disclaimer to start this off. This is not like a well-researched, evidence-based review of marketing data, sales data, coaching, like, this is more to start opinion. Yeah, it's similar to opinion and experience. The med school podcast. Yes. But we're going to include some other perspectives and try to inform you the listener or viewer at home about how we got to where we're at today and then maybe steps for going forward if you want to become a coach because we get that question all the time. This was actually prompted by a question in San Antonio. It was like, how do I let people know that I'm willing to help them with my coaching? It's like, there's a long story there. So let's start out with this. Let's start out with how we all got started. Alan Throll. When did you start coaching? Why did you start coaching and then like, what's been your journey? I started coaching in 2013. So it's real, well, before that I coached high school team. But actually coaching one on one was when I opened the gym. I mean, it was kind of an necessity. I didn't really have much structure. It's opening the gym. I was just like, if someone comes in, I'm going to help him out and take them through a workout. And I started out wanting to do group training. Sometimes I was a group, but oftentimes it was three people or two people or sometimes one person would show up to the group session. That's not the group. Yep. So it was more personal training that was, you know, one person group training. So I was coaching a lot of people like that. They're small and great. Smaller group. My group group. And so that's always started coaching more one on one outside of coaching teams. But so did you, you opened the gym like right when you started coaching? Yep. I opened the gym complete scratch. Like no experience. I didn't have any clients built up. Yes. I was just like, I wanted to. Yeah. So anybody who came into the gym was automatically your client. You weren't like sitting waiting for some gym manager or personal training manager to like give you a new client seat. It was just with you. You come to my gym. Well, you got to know who I am. I didn't think you said that out loud. How long do you think it took before you felt comfortable actually coaching somebody? Like, do you have any like fear initially like trepidation like, hey, I have no idea what I'm doing. I just opened the gym. People are coming in and they want to meet like, you know, taking them through a workout or like give them a training plan. Do you confident initially? Talking to people. I was always a bit unsure of what to say. Me talking to people like why should I come near gym? Being a salesperson. I wasn't very good at. But I would say that like telling someone what to do came fairly easy getting out of Marine Corps and just, I mean, honestly, like some people, you know, like, here's a workout tell Jordan to do it and you're like, if you want, you can like, you know what I mean? So like being somewhat assertive was easy. So yeah. That was that probably came from being an altered beforehand. And so there was a little bit of a transition but it wasn't too bad. Look at looking back now like how long do you think it took for you to become a coach like a good coach in your own mind? Because like you can only tell this retrospectively. You can't like, everyone thinks they're awesome when they start, right? But then like five years later like, yeah, I can't believe I started there. And I would say that once I was finally a coach by Austin was when I was like, hmm, so this is, this is like a good coach is. And so I learned a lot about coaching and you know, about programming the lifts and whatnot. And so all of that definitely after Austin before that, it was just a, you know, like a couple of years of probably not the best advice. But you get any certifications along the way. Like it was your first cert, like how to do it. So you open to Jim, you do that. I open to Jim. And like it is a worst business plan with nothing, no business experience, no credentials, no clients. Maybe I never worked in Jim. Yeah, I guess maybe. I was just really motivated and a bit naive and I just wanted to start a Jim. Yeah. And also we'll link his, hey, I started to Jim video to see you guys getting, that's a cool story. Tom, let's move to you next. When did you start coaching and like how did you, this come about like what were you doing? I taught martial arts and college. And then for Barbell coaching, like 2008, 2009 I started informal coaching people. And then by 2010 people were paying me to coach them. And like how did you get involved in that? Like, like somebody that you were training martial arts was like, hey, I also want to get strong or was it like you got interested yourself and training in that. There was no, there was no like carryover from my time coaching martial arts, but just as far as coaching people and like being in front of people and giving instruction, that probably started it. But as far as the Barbell stuff, it was, there was no point at which it was like, aha, it was sort of a gradual thing. The more I was lifting and the more I was looking at stuff, the more people came to me for advice. So people were just coming up to you or like, sir can't tell me, we please teach me. Because I was in a CrossFit gym at the time. And so the idea that people would go and like actually work on strength and a dedicated fashion was kind of a novel thing. At that time and to the yeah, for sure. So that, that attracted attention. Yeah. And then what was your first certification like how did you get started? Starting strength coach. That is the only like, you know, fitness certification I got and I got that in February of 2010. 2010. Yeah. So it wasn't like, I'm going to get all these shirts. I'm going to go to a personal like a global gym coach, a bunch of people. You were just an agenda and people started asking you. I don't know. Miron that squat. I mean, you're a bastard on after all. That's true. Leah. So same, same sort of question to you like, when did you start what the certifications did you get? And how did you get started coaching? I was right. I think I was coaching people informally in about 2014 and by 2015, I was being paid by some people to coach them and I was running small group classes. Okay. Not like very small group classes. No, I was actually running my class. My classes were full. My classes were full. I had a waiting list for my classes. Sure. So I was teaching barbell classes a couple days a week. And then I was coaching some people independently as well. And then how does that start like people just started asking you? Or you were like, go on a day. Let me coach you. Right. So initially, it was people were asking me for help. I'm a pretty open person at the gym. So I was willing to offer insight or advice. And then when I decided that I wanted to learn to become a better coach, I did get a little bit more aggressive about finding people to coach. And I offered to coach people if they were interested. And then the only certification that I got was the starting strength certification. And when I wanted that, I decided that I needed to coach a broader spectrum of lifters. And so I actually asked different types of people if they would be willing to work with me so that I could have more practice. But before that, you never had asked somebody to, yeah, they would just call me to. I come up to make that. Yeah, I see. And then what did you want to become a coach? What's the, why did you get bored or like? Well, it was just it lifting and training and all of that that goes with it was so important in my own life. And I think that that showed to the people around me. But as it became so important to me, I was really excited about working with other people who cared about the same idea. So I loved it. So I kind of grew up. I played multiple sports, but throughout my swimming career as I went through swimming, I started to coach more and more of the younger age groups behind me to the point where as I got to the upper age groups, I started, you know, I was getting coaching more and more individuals in the pool. And so I had a long, I'd been coaching some form of like, you know, human movement. I guess so to speak or sports performance for for a while, both formally getting paid and in formula prior to that. And so that kind of had been going on for a long time. After I finished swimming and I decided to pick up a barbell to avoid getting super fat from not being a real swimmer anymore. Oh yeah. Like, this is a common thing amongst swimmer. No, no, no, I know that happens. I'm just saying for you personally. Yeah, I was like, I don't want that to happen to me. So let me go find something else to do because swimming by myself and the pool was super boring without a team around me. So I found, you know, I started to pick up a bar and started training, did all kinds of wacky stuff. I mean, I've talked about this a bit before where I didn't coach anybody for quite a long for probably a couple of years when I was starting out with the bar until I was training at a college gym when when when I was in med school. And by that point, I was actually getting decently strong and I was squatting, you know, approaching 405 at the time and people, you know, at the time in that gym that was like not common. So I started to get some attention. By the time I was squatting, you know, 405 or more, that sort of get a lot of attention. And that was around the time I think I met you and you were like, hey, dude, you ever, you know, like coached anybody on this stuff. And I was like, well, I've helped a few, been helping a few people out in the gym and then we decided to pursue it a little bit more formally from there. And kind of, and in parallel to that, my whole academic career had been kind of also kind of like coaching, teaching, stuff like that. And so I think for as far as like why I ended up getting into it, it was kind of something that has always been part of what I do in terms of teaching other people, both in academics, in sport, athletics and something I still do now in medicine too. So it's kind of just how I end up doing. Panic forward. Yeah, as opposed to your little bit. Nobody cares what I did. So there's like move on with this onto the next one. Yeah, moving on. Jordan, did you get any certifications? I'm just calling you. Well, that's the thing that I kind of saw it. I mean, I worked at a company called ViTech Systems, which is now being near you, which is subsidiary Boeing. That's why I did not have to after college. I just got a biology degree. And I was like, I didn't know if Tom, you couldn't do anything with the biology degree. Besides, like, you know, work is a lab like tech or whatever, but you didn't really need a biology degree to do that. So in any event, I was pouring plates all day, just micro, like, to stain. But I wasn't even doing the staining. I was literally just pouring the plates. Like a machine. Something like, yeah, I haven't mechanized it. Yeah. So I was like waiting for my job to be replaced by the machine. And so I did it for three months after I graduated. And I was like, I hate everything about this. Like, I hate everything about this. This is terrible. Like, give me out of here. What do I like? And I gotten really into training when I was in college. And at the time, like, you think about this, 2005, 2006, 2007, on the internet. There's nothing on the internet about training. Besides, like, Dave Tate's deep squatter and like, Dave Tate telling you to pour olive oil on your pizza. Like, that's it, right? And so, you know, you can't... I mean, if you want an olive oil, you're back in. So, if it fits your macros, I guess. Yeah. So at the time, it was just harder to learn to stuff, right? And so, but I, you know, I had a really an interest in exercise physiology and exercise physiology. Assessment, I ended up taking all these exercises, graduated with one-to-extredits. And I thought that was interesting. So anyway, I was working in this terrible job and I was like, what do I do now? And I was like, what do I like? What is it even enjoyable? So I was like, I'm gonna become, I'm gonna go train people with this gym. I was at this gym, training, and people like members had asked me to like, maybe I would need to do it. It's all dudes. Of course. Like, I thought I was getting a lift or you need to like pick up chicks. It was all dudes. Like, hey, what do you think? Like, you know? Well, yeah, I know. It ends up working out fine. But it's... Don't let this be a lesson. Don't do anything. For... Yeah, to get yourself a date because it's gonna be a good backfire. So in any event, sorry coaching at a commercial gym, and I got like, I think every start that was available at the time, like, I did the CSDS, so I did ACSM HFS, I did CrossFit, I did USAW, I did USA Track of Field, I did the CISSN, I did a RKC. Oh, we call it a note about the RKD. Yeah, I did it. Like, then they wanted you to test and I was like, this is stupid. Like, yeah, I did a lot of this because I thought it would ultimately give me two things, one like Keshay, like, oh, this guy's got all these letters. Letters! Places! Yeah. Oh, that was gonna help like get business. And then the other thing I thought it would actually teach me to know things about training. And to some extent, like the minimum requirements that you're passing on these tests, like, probably do impart some like knowledge base. But I never felt like, I know what I'm doing here. I never felt like that until much later, my coaching career, like, I know how to program, I know how to coach the lifts, I feel comfortable giving people advice, like, on these things. I was so exceared as the wrong word, but just very aware of how tenuous my knowledge base was on these things because I was still questions for myself, like, how was the best way to get your squat to go up? I still had questions about that, you know? And the people were like, why are you gonna do this? I'm like, I mean, you know what I think to me? Yeah, I think. Yeah, but I was very fortunate. I mean, I'm gonna ask you guys about your client sort of situation. So like my first client, I remember that ever trainer named Janna, how Janna? She watches all this stuff now. She's cool. But it was so interesting. I was like, I was like, I'm gonna have you squat. Like, the second session, whatever, had a squat under a bar and then bench and deadlift. But nobody else in the gym was doing it at the time, so everyone thought it was crazy. They're like, you're having her squat bench and deadlift. Like, yeah, because that's what I would want to do. I can't like sell somebody training and then have them do stuff that I would never do. You know, like these weird, like, I'm gonna hop over an exercise box and I'm gonna like stand on a boat, see you ball and then do like this weird burpy to all the things on just to like make you feel tired, which you know, is better than not exercising. But so I just had people do stuff that I would want to do. And like, plan to work out that way, which tend to work out, like, I guess it's good that I like to power lift in. There's something. You don't accept with some selection bias in that they're not, you know, if they see you doing that and then they want to come to you, right? So whereas other people who would have no interest in doing that, they wouldn't have approached you in the first place. Yeah, nobody's like hiring me and they're like, hey, you want to do like some boxing stuff? Like, you were just, you were just, you know, winning based off of the selection bias there. That's the right problem. I'm just saying that's the right problem. That's the right problem. I mean, way to take me down if I put this. All right, so I thought these people actually voted by. Yeah, right, right. It turns out. It turns out. Yeah, it turns out not so much. All right, so Alan, the first time somebody comes to your gym and decides to pay you to coach. What was that? Like that was 2013. I say, what's your stone business? It could have taken too long. Yeah. Like I said, the whole, when I first opened the gym, it was all supposed to be group or class training. That's the structure. There wasn't, I didn't have like, once the one I went on. But it would just be, you know, one person to show up and then they'd get the kind of the work out of the day, I would run them through it. Yeah. You were doing a crossfit? Is it crossfit gym? No. You would hurt a crossfit. Yeah. Yeah. It was like strong man circuit training. Okay. Push this slide, carry these farmers. I'm going to let you do it with those. There's no dead. That's heavy. Yeah. Yeah. Very similar to that. And then, I don't remember the, like the first time I said, I'm, I think I'm going to start, you know, charging people separately for one on one coaching. Oh, this is all like involved in, this was like in the gym. Yeah, sign up for the gym. I'll tell you, you throw a workout. You know, basically. But I do remember having a lot of older women that I would train for one on one clients. I don't know what it was, but there were a lot of them that I'd like to do. Well, but that's, that's not a unique story though. Like people in the personal training people in a coaching, like I think all of us, he said, hey, what is your bread and butter client? You know, it ends up being like a middle late middle late or just at least a not 20 something female. Like just 30 plus that tends to be a bulk of your market unless you're like in this really strange like niche. You're like, yeah, all I ever train are like athletes like it is like, okay, cool. Like I hope you enjoy like not actually making a living from this, you know, for very long because it's hard to. It's very difficult to do that. Also like the reimbursement's not that great unless you're winning championships. And the moment you're not winning championships, you're out and should you ever hurt somebody, like not that you actually hurt, but they became, you know, that's that's not a great way to build a business. Also there's only so many elite level athletes. Yeah, and the odds of them living in your city and like wanting to train with you. I mean, I guess if you moved to Miami or LA, you know, that might improve your chances, but even then, like. So I don't think that's unique. I'm talking about like retired like, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's actually your love. It was mornings and afternoons would be with retired women who didn't work. And then in the evening would be the bigger crowd where I would actually get people to show up for a group session. But as far as one I want training, yeah, it was a lot of some, some older retired men, but it was just, I remember working with a lot of retired women to. Leo, you think most of your clients originally were women. Yes, yes, in fact, my first class, everybody assumed it was women's lifting class. And I did not want it to, I didn't want it to stay this program. It was only where I only trained women. I wanted to be training people. I like it. Love training women, but yeah, all my first clients were women. Oh, women. Yep. What do you think it is now? What's the split? Uh, it's actually more men now. Oh, really? Yeah. Awesome. What about yours? I, so you first saw your wife. It was not actually. No, no. I was a runner for a long time. And I was like, you know, I wasn't going to, I wasn't going to influence that until she, you know, developed interest in one. I hadn't had a lift. That was later on. But I guess I was training in that college gym at the time. And so when I was lifting heavy weights from the college dudes, mostly, we're, you know, taking interest in that. So that was what most of my clients basically did. That's a bunch of guys. That first was fine. Yeah. I mean, that's who was there. And initially, you know, I was given them technical advice, or teaching the lifts. And I was not charging for any of that. And then once things, you know, picked up a little bit more and people were wanting some programming guidance and stuff like that, then that's kind of where I started to feel comfortable with charging even a little bit, which was not very much at the time. But that's what I felt ready to do that. Tom, you're, you're at a crossfit gym. Right. And I said, you were paying to go to that crossfit gym. At the time, yes. They were they coaching you? Uh, I, I stopped. No, I actually what happened was I asked to be able to work on my own, which no one else was doing. You wanted to open gym for yourself. Yeah. Yeah. So I got, I got permission to work on my own. But so then you're like, people are coming up to you and they're like, Tom, Tom, Tom, we know you went to the games 2008. No. Well, it's true. In fact, it was, it was 2009. And I started doing this before that. Yeah. Also, so, y'all, y'all, y'all jokes aside. But so, so you're at this gym. You already have like a unique membership, you know, because you're the only one doing open gym. And then also people are asking you to coach them. And the gym, the ownership's like cool. Yeah. Mostly because I had been there for a year or year plus already. And I had shown myself to be a reasonable human. And I wasn't actually troublesome. And so I started doing my own thing. And the gym owner was supportive of it. And then it wasn't like there was some mass migration of everyone like doing CrossFit to... I know we just went to Trayne with Tom. No, that did not happen. Trayne with Tom, yeah. Well, but I think that it brings up like it starts to like a kind of an important point. Like, well, how do I get started coaching, right? Well, like you have to coach. And but before that, you actually have to train yourself. So all of us have like a very similar like origins. So like, I started getting into this. I started my life. I spent a lot of time doing this. And so at some point, people are going to ask you for some expertise. And that point is your time to kind of, you know, it's a decision point. Like, do I want to like try on my coaching chops? Do I want to develop this? Or like am I totally fine not doing that and like moving on in other aspects of my life and sending them on the way? That expertise needs to be demonstrated in some fashion. Right. Chairs for kind of what we're talking about is that you have to have trained and achieved some level of competence with it for anybody to ask your advice and it doesn't end up being where you train and you enjoy it. You're terrible at it. And so you go down like beating down everybody's door trying to get them to let you coach them. Yeah, you don't need to. Yeah, nobody advertise their services from ground from like day one where like because you need to have like something that's valuable. A demonstrably valuable skill set where people are seeking you out. And then you were trying to magnify that in a way. So like, Tom's in this, what I would consider a hostile environment because they're always friendly. Yeah, you know, because other people are getting coaching, right? And like, you would have to assume on someone like that coaching is incomplete or, you know, at least not, doesn't align with their goals. And so I'm going to get this additional coaching or coaching instead of this, you know, from this other guy. And so and the other part of that is it's not like you were squatting like 500 for sets of five. But you had demonstrated that you had been training and you had proficiency in what you were doing. And you weren't trying to step outside of that. If somebody was like, yeah, and I actually, I want to squat on the squat and deadlift and bench and press. But I also want to, you know, train for this ultra marathon. You know, there's like a point where you're like, but I actually don't know how to do that. And to your point, you know, I went, I went from like, shockingly weak to less weak and I put on weight in that process, which was something that people weren't really doing. So it wasn't like I was squatting 500 pounds. I was squatting a lot less than 500 pounds. But there was a change that was unusual in the context that I was in. And like it wasn't a hostile environment and so much as like the gym owners like you better not be doing that. And so the gym owner was actually supportive of it. So yeah, but I'm just saying that the people you'd have your say in that your clientele, what would be your clientele were informed consumers because if you thought, I mean, I had the coach, you know, that they said, no, no, I want a little bit more. Yeah, and so and then so you were at the gym, you were working out at the gym, where you got your your clients initially, same thing, like you were literally working out at O to you, when people were approaching you. Yep. You didn't just decide, you didn't wake up when one said, I want to be a coach. That's a way for people to like email you. And then you were at Cross with Jim. You're a West. And then people had already been coming up to you. Yes. So Allen, you like created a space for people to come to you for expertise. But in the military or wherever before, did you ever coach anybody? Yeah, just friends. Yeah, because they approach you because you were the workout guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was usually like, hey, dude, a bench, four or five or a couple of reps, but I can't squat it. We taught me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On the barbinger section. On the barbinger section. But that's I think if I had to give, and all of you guys way on this, if I, you know, if someone wants to say, hey, I want a coach, like what's the first thing? Like, well, so this is assuming that you've trained on some level to develop some valuable skill set. Like, you need to be in a place where people can approach you and be approachable to allow what to happen. It's not like you just say, you wake up and say, yeah, I've trained a little bit. I'm going to be a coach. And then like, just wait for people to be. Conversely, you can't say, I'm going to train a whole lot and get super, super strong. I'm going to be in my garage gym for the entire time. Yeah. Nobody's going to find me see me or approach me. I remember there was a, this guy was like, he lived like 20 miles outside of any, like, town. Right? Like, just, he's literally like, you know, in the middle of nowhere relatively. Yeah. And he's training his garage and he's like, how do I coach people? Like, you have to go to town. Yeah. Like, you have to see people at D.C. when I was in the commercial gym, I did that for a year before I ended up doing my own thing. And they were real big about working the floor, walk the floor. And some people took that to me and like, going up to people and asked them, like, hey, can I train you? But I never did that. I would literally just be trying on a clock and so you were like, yeah, I would just be walking around and I wait for somebody to ask me a question. And there were many days where I didn't get asked a question, but I was in that gym. I was waiting on a client. It was just going to come in an hour afterwards. Or I would be working out. Right? And then people would be like, yeah, I know that you work. You're like, hey, it's, it's, you're, you're almost waiting for people to approach you so that you can demonstrate your skill set that you should be worth, or finding a working on the time. You're not just saying, I have this skill set. Please hire me. You know, that's, it comes across as a little desperate. Yes, so you need to advertise your services until you're already like doing something, in which case you can let people know you're open for business. Right. And when you're training with people, it's not as Tom's. It's not just that you're the strongest person even, or that you reach the great number, but I think when you're in that environment, people see everything you go through. And so they see the different training that you do, the struggles, also that you have, and they see someone who pushes through something hard, and maybe fails and yet gets back to it. And that's also just as important for people to see as seeing somebody who lifts a lot of weight. They need to make stuck with it. So, so I think if you want to coach, yeah, you should be in a gym with other humans training. And if you're not, I don't know that you can coach like that. Like you're then you're just waiting for somebody else to like direct humans towards you. Like why would they? Well, that's exactly like nobody knows that you're an expert. And if you're not trained, if you're untrained, you're probably not an expert, which, you know, tree thirt's. Okay. So Austin, early on in your coach career, like any huge regrets. I think the early coaching career regret is one of overconfidence, which I think tends to be common among many people, especially as they start to learn things. If they learn things from people, they put some trust in and they buy into it, and they want to start dispensing this advice. It's easy to be overconfident with that. And to fall prey to all the cognitive biases that we all know now, know much better about, you know, we start to see things work that we expect to work. We tend to dismiss things when they don't work, and it doesn't necessarily fit what we expect to just standard kind of confirmation by a stuff. And then, you know, additionally not knowing what you don't know is a huge problem, and not appreciating that there's this whole world of things that you don't understand yet. And so certain pieces of advice that may have been given back then that I definitely regret because now I'm like, well, that was wrong. And maybe some of them, I didn't know at the time, some of them, nobody knew at the time because the evidence didn't exist yet, for example. But the overwhelming thing was, you know, particularly going through that initial process and get the certification and stuff like that led to an inappropriate amount of confidence and some of the things that were done or some of the advice that was dispensed. And so now things tend to be much more tempered. You think you heard anybody? In terms of an injury as a result of the advice, not that I know of, in terms of like some sort of unquantifiable harm because I gave them advice that they followed that may not have gotten them as good and outcome as they might have otherwise gotten. Short, probably. Yeah. And those are the kind of things that we count as, as harms. Yeah. So probably from that standpoint. Yeah. Tom, you think you have any like regrets from your training crew? Not training coach crew? Yeah. Probably giving away too much of my time. Like for free. Yeah. Just in general. I don't think I'm in that is. In general, probably being overly focused on making sure that like some of my clients were taking care of at my own expense, particularly. I don't think I don't think I really, you know, some of the advice I gave probably was not the wonderful, but I didn't like do anything. I didn't wind up hurting anyone. People tended to make progress like I was a positive person. So I never like ran into problems where I was like super mean to somebody or anything along those lines or dismissive of people. But yeah, just probably being like actually overly giving at my own expense. Of course, Tom says, I'm just too nice. That's right. Too nice. Five stars. You know, if you had a lot of people coming to you and you're giving away a lot of this time, maybe that was an indication that maybe you were in a place where you could have feasibly charged for coaching. Maybe sooner than you ultimately decided to. Yeah. Well, we were talking there was like a pricing question like how do I price myself? It's like, well, how many clients do you have? Two. I don't think that's the question desk. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think that's the question desk. Because that's not limiting or you know. Leah, early mistakes. So I think you were right. Yeah. I think one of my early mistakes that bothers me is insistence on things that didn't matter. You know, like in part because of some things ways that I had learned how to coach or about lifting, just really being too insistent on particulars about programming or what someone does. Yeah. Now, I really regret that because it didn't matter. And so when you even asked the question, do I think I harmed anybody? I don't think I've physically harmed anyone. But I think I harmed at least for a time. Some people's progress because I wasn't looking at them as an individual. I had a program or an idea that I was trying to make them all fit. Is it an indirect? Yeah. Induced neuroses and people over that kind of thing, which is I think probably. Yeah. Neurosys or like, you know, like if we're talking about people who are new to the gym and then they're scared and you're kind of like, well, but you got this is what you have to do. This is the correct way to do it. Yeah. And so that's definitely one of my regrets. But I'm really, like, I don't know that that lasted a very long time because I think when you are a good coach, you pay attention to people. Like Tom said, you start to see what people need. You want them to do well. So then you have to start thinking about why am I doing this? Should I ask more questions? Should I change things? Then you become a better coach? Uh, yes. Well, yeah. I'm with you. Okay. Alan, how many are like, what sort of things early on in your gym ownership slash coaching career? Um, anything to your grit. Definitely, uh, miss Lee and information with regard to, uh, setbacks, specifically like pain and injury. Um, I always feel like I had to give an answer or I had to be this point of authority that knew. Oh, your shoulder hurts because of, you know, these trigger points. Or because of this and that, or let's mash this up or we need to start doing these corrective exercises. Or, you know, uh, I've encountered a number of people who've had a back tweak, you know, and just, uh, going about it the wrong way. Uh, probably doing all the wrong things. Um, and, you know, baby in it, uh, checking up on them, you know, way too much or like, from my standpoint of like, I don't, I know what this was like for them. I don't want them to happen again. So I'm going to like, just avoid this and this and this, uh, making the situation worse. Um, so I would say definitely from that. It's a common thing for when you're in a position of authority like that, there's this concept called commission bias, where, you know, it's this, this tendency to feel like you have to do something about the situation all the time. Um, and, you know, it's very uncomfortable to sometimes say, you know, I'm not necessarily sure what the best course of action is or that perhaps the best course of action is to not. Um, immediately do something about the situation. And so particularly when you have people who are paying you presumably for your, you know, they're paying you and they want your advice, you're like, yeah, do this. Yeah, right? Yeah. And I felt like if something happened, uh, that, you know, someone's freaking out about it. Pop their back and they're laying on the ground. Uh, I feel like I'm, if I'm not like at their level of reacting, uh, that I was almost like being dismissive, you know, like, yeah, you're fine. Yeah. So I felt like I had to like get on their level, you know what I mean, and over react to. So that's the now you know, a whole lot more about what was going on there, right? That's funny. I think also just from some of the answers. Weightlifting is probably pretty safe as, you know, things go. It's rare to like actually, you know, generally don't concuss people, you know, Speak for yourself. Yeah. Trying to tell me any credibility. Like people people, well, people will tweak things or people will, you know, you'll see, like, minor strains and things like that, but it's pretty rare that, you know, especially when you're coaching somebody that something kind of a straw fake happens. Yeah. Yeah. I think I have similar regrets for all, like, just as far as like being overconfident things, telling people information that was wrong or like unknown at the time and being very confident about it. And then always feeling like I had to do something or have an answer. I mean, that certainly happened just nonstop. The only other thing I regret is actually similar to Tom's thing where he's like, Oh, too much gave too much of myself. You didn't say that. But there was, I mean, definitely a period of time where I was trying to do too much coaching and too much business stuff. Like, just too much worked where I couldn't operate at the level that I wanted to operate at. And that would be, that was a mistake. But I think the message to the listener viewers, like, if you want to be a coach, like, you're going to screw up a lot. And it's okay. But you can, we can kind of cut that learning curve off. We can argue about learning curves of your podcast. We can cut that off by saying, you can't know all the information and what you're very confident about what you know is probably less confident. It's not like a indictment on somebody's knowledge basis. You have to be very okay. Are comfortable being uncertain about things. And then, you know, not necessarily, you know, people think you have to be very confident to sell folks on your expertise. And that's not necessarily the case. One of the biggest demonstrations of expertise is being like, actually, no, no, the answer to that. I'm not sure how confident I am in this answer or, you know, you hear that kind of thing a lot from actual experts. Yes. Yes. So, like, you know, people are like, well, I don't feel comfortable starting. I don't know if I know enough. Like, that's actually a sign that you might, you know, you may actually be ready. You know, so I don't know that somebody over a few hundred percent ready to start coaching, like, from a knowledge base. But if you feel like you have all the answers and you're, you know, ready to go, then I would strongly advise you to like temper that, you know, down and understand that five years from now. If you've started, if you're starting today, you're going to think back and shutter at a lot of things that you said and did. And hopefully you don't hurt anybody. But because weightlifting so safe, we're not usually like, hurting folks. I did have a guy who I trained drunk. I was in drunk. He was drunk. And I allowed him to train while he was drunk. He said he really, because he was like, I really want to do this. Like, I really, I don't want to miss a session. I just, I didn't have the hour. And he was a weird, that was a weird deal. That was weird deal. You know, in hindsight, I take a heat lift. Yeah, he was fine. You know, I just did a not a great session. And anyway, all right. So let's talk about certifications for a second. So we, everybody up here besides me, like, spend a whole bunch of money on certifications. Now, being veteran senior coaches in the actual site of condition of you and unique in a way that you're actually making money in this kind of conditioning field. Unlike the vast majority of people in the direct conditioning field who are only in it for a few years because they're not making enough money. And then we'll all on to something else. How do you guys view certifications? Like, do you think there are any like very useful certifications that you would like recommend people get or how do you feel about that? So it's like, I want to come work at your gym island. What certification do I need? So I used to, like, you know, bash commercial gyms and all the popular certifications. Say there'll be a SNOW and do anything. But I'll give one example of a guy used to train punch and nugget, John Mead. Train him when he was, when he was, when he was 17, he eventually decided that he want to start coaching too. And so without me saying anything, he got a couple certifications and he got a job as a personal trainer, a California family fitness. And he's now the number one trainer and like all of Northern California. He works, he loves it. I wouldn't be crazy about it. He will work like 16 hour days like clients 45 minute sessions back to back to back. Just nonstop and then go to gym and train. And he's 11 it. And he eventually wants to go somewhere more with the coaching. But for now he's getting like hands on clients every day all day, seven days a week if you wanted. In fact, one of my, Barbara medicine clients reached out to me, said his dad, got some coaching. They live in the area. And I was like, hey, I'm booked. John's good. And so he went in anyway, he signed John to send me a text that he purchased 72 sessions with John. But anyways, he got the, you know, basic certifications. He's working in a commercial gym. And he loves it. He's getting a lot of coaching experience. So yeah, I mean in that sense. Yeah, but that's good. But yeah, I'm just telling stories now, but as far as like, which way are you saying that been so far as it gets you to a place where you can acquire the real experience, not that they're a replacement for. Right. Sometimes it's a good idea to say, I just want to go get hired a nine to five. And if that's the case, and you do need certifications. Nobody's going to say like, wow, you're really strong dude. You've got experience that you know, they want on paper, what sort of a case do you have. And so in that sense, it is definitely useful and necessary. Leo, what do you think if you're going to recommend a certification for somebody to get? Yeah, so I don't have a certification to recommend. And I think in my mind, what would maybe take the place of it is a certification at least for me. And I think for a lot of other people, even the story demonstrates that someone has put in a certain amount of time and personal effort. And so I would encourage somebody to find other ways to demonstrate that and then show that. So the people see this really does matter to you. Tom, you got a certain that you like get a fancy, fancy or no. I don't know that I have like enough of an informed opinion to say one way or the other. Well, I mean, do you want to talk about story insurance or? I could. Well, so the question is, we all add that certification all have given it up. The question is, do you think it is a good cert for somebody to like go to like go get because and I say this by thinking like most of us are saying, if you need a certification, just go get one. So you can get experience, but the process of getting the starting strings requires more experience more. It's more involved. But does it put you in a better place as a coach? I think that's dependent upon what you want to do because if you want to work in a commercial gym, the answer is generally no because they'll be looking for a CSES. Yeah, or NASA or something. Sure. Getting a starting string certification will make you appeal to a segment of the population that's aware of starting strength. And also the kind of emphasis on being competent at seeing and queuing movement on a couple of lifts is valuable. Yeah, can be sure. Yeah. And like even though we would differ in certain regards on a programming front, the idea that like you can kind of have something of a focus and get stronger and work on these things. And like a systematic way is also useful. The general concept. Sure. Even in the end of the awesome. I mean, I think that, you know, we look at some of the coaches that we've brought on here. So like Allen, for example, like Joe, like Leah, like Hassan, you know, multiple of our coaches that we have brought on our people who. You and I kind of mentored. And, you know, I think that I feel better about the, you know, the people who I have mentored and kind of brought up where I can say unequivocally. You know, I trust Allen to do effectively everything from a coaching programming standpoint. He knows what his scope is. He knows when something is no longer within his scope. He knows when he has the appropriate degree of kind of calibrating his uncertainty meter with things when he knows what he knows and what he doesn't know and he doesn't know. And I can say that for all the people that I've kind of mentored. So I like that model of of, you know, of kind of coaching development education stuff like that. Of course, it's a more time intensive process and things like that. So, you know, perhaps finding somebody that you, it's analogous to what we did in residency. Going through that process under, you know, that kind of degree of supervision, which again. Yep, it's very time intensive. But that's kind of the way that we develop that kind of level of competence. And so, you know, maybe where as for example in contrast, somebody who just says, I got this certification under no circumstance. Do I have that like unequivocally trusted your ability to do anything? If you've compared to the person who maybe I have mentored or say the person you have mentored, I can say, oh, I have a good idea of what they would do and I have, you know, full confidence in that. And so, you know, if you're looking to get started in the coaching game and, you know, you are training, you're in a public place, you're doing all these all these things that we've talked about so far. Maybe the final way to try to cap it off is some sort of kind of like, you know, finding somebody who maybe you like the way they do things or you aspire to their practice model. And seeing if you can intern with them or, or, you know, work under them in some fashion, which is something that we've done with, again, lots of people who we ultimately end up saying, hey, you're ready to go, let's hire you and bring you on. Yeah, exactly. We'll not necessarily for us, but whoever that may be to you and maybe in your activity of choice or your sport of choice or whatever the case is, I think that's how, you know, a lot of practical expertise gets developed much more effectively than taking a course or achieving a certification or something like that. Yeah. Because even like when we can't get out of medical school, we had been through all the classrooms stuff. We had the certification that is the MD, we didn't know what the hell to do with our first patient that we saw, right? Until we went through the process of that time intensive mentorship and guidance and correction and making mistakes and that kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. I think that, I mean, I agree with you, that would be the best way to actually grow your skillset versus acquiring different certifications. I don't think there's any certification that I would recommend above another other than you need to probably have one to get yourself in job. And so you would make sure that that comes, that whatever certification you get is associated with some sort of insurance that you can opt into because that you just need that. But there's not a certification out there that grants you a skill set that I think is worth the cost of attended the price of attendance. So, for instance, getting a USAW like certification. Like, if you want to work with weight lifters, probably going to have to have that certification or at least have gone through their coaching system because, you know, that they tend to stay within their own groups. But it doesn't make you a great Olympic weight lifter or Olympic weight lifting coach. Getting the starting strength certification, it's sort of, you can coach to a reasonable standard like these handful lifts under a very specific model that is not, you know, universal and is not necessarily the only way to do those exercises. And so you're constrained. But like, you know, if you're not going to grow past that. Maybe that's fine. There's a big cost there. Getting a CSES doesn't make you like a college level strength conditioning coach. And so, and they're different costs associated with this. So since none of these are going to bring you enough business to like warrant. Getting one over another, I just don't care. So my recommendation is get the cheapest certification that you can get that is universally accepted. So CSES is actually like relatively inexpensive. If you have a college degree, the ACSM, HFS, again, is reasonably inexpensive and the test materials are reasonably inexpensive. And as you universally accepted, those would be my two like ones that I'd recommend if you're trying to work in a commercial gym setting. I, if you have to get a Nazum serve because that's the only one that gym accepts. Yeah, I would prefer not, but, you know, maybe find a different gym. But there are no like specialty search that I think are worthwhile to get as far as actually improving your knowledge base in a way that makes you a better coach. In other words, should you go through the process to obtain these certifications? You should not come out the other end under the impression that you are actually a certified strategy that you're in especially. Yeah, exactly. Like you just have a piece of paper that allows you to start your journey. Yeah. So people like, what about this one nutrition one, I'm like, nope, not that one either. Like what about this one kettlebell, like special note, not that one either. What about it's like no, no. They're all like minimum requirements for you to like get a piece of paper doesn't mean that you're qualified. The only nutrition thing that I know that, that qualifies you to be to work on some body nutrition is a registered database. Yeah, after you've done all your internship, yeah, the thousand hours is required. So, okay, move it along. We got two questions left. We'll go down the row, start with Tom quality or qualities or quality that you think is very important as a coach. I think I think there's probably two things. One is some level of technical expertise, whatever that means. Like you need to. You need to be able to see movement, cue movement or understand programming in some form of fashion. Like the kind of basic technical knowledge. But outside of that, I think that like being personable or being compassionate and being able to relate to a lot of people and to tailor your approach to whoever it is you're working with is as important and in some ways more important than like the straight up technical skill I've seen. I've seen people who are great lifters or who know a lot. Fail very badly when interacting with their lifters and I think you need to be able to relate to your lifter. I think I was probably thinking similar along some of the lines in addition to the expected level of knowledge based communication skills. This is kind of how I would summarize it and communication skills. Can you relate to your lifter like the example that Alan gave earlier with the back pain knowing how to respond and communicate and that sort of a situation to drive the boat in the right direction and not the wrong direction. I think that's a place of course itself requires a little bit of extra background knowledge just to what you should be doing and how this stuff works. Being able to kind of read social cues. Some people have a bit of difficulty with that. Reading if you are just completely missing all these red flags that your lifter is throwing up at you during the session and you're not able to respond to them and modify things accordingly if needed or provide reassurance. If no modification needs things like that where you can read reflect communicate really effectively to guide them along the path. Whatever that may be, whether it's training related or through about a rehab or you know if they enter a competition, the kind of communication that happened between like a coach and an athlete on a meat day or something like that. The communication skills are super super important and that's something that takes years, probably years to develop. Lots of mistakes, lots of like foot and mouth moments and may actually benefit from having that kind of mentorship that I described earlier where somebody was watching you interact or communicate with somebody and this is something like an medicine. I do with the residents that I work with and have them communicate with the patient. I'm like, you know, after all, it's just a step out. We'd be brief and here's how I would have said this. I would have said this a little differently. I could see on their face. They responded, you know, maybe scared them a little bit or maybe, you know, things like that. So I agree with Tom that the communication skills in some situations are probably even more important than knowing the raw, you know, science or technical data or something like that. Sure. Yep. I don't disagree with either of you. I just think as far as like how to acquire said things like I think the fun knowledge is really important and I think to acquire that. My general advice is find three sort of people or groups that you like, like, you can find very trustworthy, right, and the way that you an ascertain that is like, the credentialed. There's a track record like on par with like academia, like, you know, things that kind of give them sort of like, so like in the within their social groups are they value is like high, you know, quality content producers like they have all these sort of check marks like, okay, cool. They, you know, they're PhDs or their MDs or they're, you know, veteran coaches and all those, they have a bunch of social currency because they put out a bunch of good content and and they actually have content that's available for you to consume. And then you can get the three like things and pick three of them and read everything they put out and watch just do that because you're trying to get the latest fund of knowledge and you can't read everybody and you can't, you know, see every so the idea is that you're going to start somewhere start with three people. So that's like again, the fun knowledge I think is super important for the communications thing, I don't think you can like take a class on how to do that and be, you know, you can take classes on this, but you also have to do it and practice it and get feedback. And I think that's when you, you probably want to, the bigger things that happens when people start coaching and they do it for a long enough period of time, they develop their own coaching style, their own coaching voice, their own interview voice and style and stuff and they start kind of. Yeah, they're able to express the personality that they want to project a little more clearly and be able to be adaptable to different situations based on different clients needs, once, et cetera. But you just have to practice that and I think what happens now most of the times people go in, they're not necessarily rapidly expanding their fund of knowledge and they're not necessarily trying to become a better communicator outside of selling people on stuff. You know, it's like, hey, do you want to work out with me today? You know, buy this package, which I'm not, you have to ultimately end up selling your skillset because if you know, you could be the best, have the best fun to knowledge and all this other stuff, but if you have no clients, you're on a coach. So you end up having to ask for money at some point, like you never ask for money, never get paid. You know, giving you any difference in the same thing. I don't think I really have anything different. I think I would just sum it up by saying you have to be really, really committed to being an expert. Yeah, what about, yeah, for what about for women, though, anything different for women? Yes, you need other right hormones. Yes. Well, so, but yeah, but like for women for women, because this is a male dominated deal. Oh, I've been that like a huge question. Why does this coaching, why is coaching a male dominated? Well, number one, I just don't think there's enough women who pursue strength and condition themselves. So they might be why would we have women who are coaching? You're going to have less because there's less women. Right. And then it is a pretty, it's a pretty unique and at times difficult to go into if you are a woman and you can feel like you're out of, like you're out of your element really easily and I mean, I think. We're falling apart here. We're a man, we're just going to let him in. Yeah, right. Editing. I'll do a test. Yeah. Thanks, Ian, post. Yeah, that's famous last words. Okay, so we'll just go down along last question here. So one piece of advice you can give to somebody who wants to start coaching, what would it be? Austin. I'll probably echo this same advice we give to people when they want to come back from an injury. It's going to be too embrace the process, meaning that you need to accept that it's going to take a long time. You need to accept that you know, you're going to make a bunch of mistakes. You need to accept that even if you feel really confident about something, like you probably shouldn't be. And you know, we even at this stage in the game, we're changing things that we do on a regular basis. We're reading variously all the time, updating our thinking on things and are almost becoming less certain of things every day. Really, really, really, really. Yeah. And that's kind of just comes with the territory in terms of embracing the process of self-improvement, really, and anything. So that's what I would recommend. I think my recommendation would be to really accept the fact that it love that you are going to be a professional coach. Because it's kind of easy to just start training people. You're on the side. Yeah. Yeah. But if this is something you really want to do, it is not easy to get to that point where it is your profession. But you have to be very committed as far as learning and time and money and how you carry yourself and all that to being a professional coach. I agree. There are a lot of people doing a part time. I got two or three clients. I don't know if you want them as your coach, and I don't know if they're really serious about coaching. Right. Yeah. I mean, someone can enjoy that. That can be their little hobby. But if a coach is really what you want to be, it has to be serious. It probably would be what I just said. I don't know if they can. I feel like that was my answer to just know your target client. And again, that can be as specific as you want or as generals who'd like, you know, obviously, don't be so rigid in your approach and be able to, you know, I only want power look for the plus 500 works. It's not really beautiful. Just on the fly when helping someone. But yeah, understanding maybe is general. I was like, I'd like to teach people about string training. I think it's good to have that and kind of stick with that. And I'm, you know, not going to try my best to help a triathlete. I might refer them somewhere else. You know, so. I think you have to be willing to eat your own dog food. I think what? I think that part of coaching should be exposing yourself to the things that you ask of your clients. And I think it winds up informing your coaching practice and continuing to inform your coaching practice. If you are doing things. Obviously, you will have clients that need to do things that are different than what you do. But still being in touch with what it is to, if you are in barbell coach to do barbell training yourself. I think it is important. I think you guys have excellent answers. I think a lot of the content in here has been stuff that we wish that somebody told us early on in our coaching careers. The only thing I'm going to add because I haven't said it yet. And I do think this is really important part of actually building a coaching business. If you actually want to do this professionally, it is content generation. And so, when somebody comes to me about business related issue, they are like, my business isn't taking off my business. And then the first thing I'm saying, are you training your garage? Does anybody know that you are training? Does anybody know that you are an expert? If you know that you are a garage, go to the gym and talk to people. But the other part of that is content generation. What have you created for the community lately to demonstrate your expertise? But demonstrate your interests and things. And demonstrate your being a professional. Demonstrate your dog food to take it back to Tom. So it is like, I think content is king. And so you should be writing things. You should be making videos. You shouldn't mean start a podcast. Like if you don't have an idea. You don't have to start a podcast. But if that is your jam, go for it. But I think with writing stuff, for instance, if you have a topic, you are going to look up. I'm just going to learn things. So it is like self-exportation. Same thing if you made a video, you are like, I am like a video on carbohydrate. Carbohydrate intake. I don't know whatever. And you are like, oh, maybe I should learn something about this first. So I have content. And then you end up learning a bunch of stuff. You didn't know so content not only informs you, but also creates a service to the community. Also demonstrate your expertise, demonstrate your professionalism, demonstrate what you will Interested in. And so if you are not creating content yet and you want to be a coach or you are a coach and you are feeling like, what do I do now? I would spare time. Create stuff. Create content. Much content is you can create the better. So that is why. What did I, when we first recorded this, I told you my mantra, when I started doing this was like, I want to be prolific. Like, I want people to look back and say, when I was in medical school, like, you see all the articles that came out, all the videos, all the content. Like, to do was prolific. So that is like one of the motivating like, mantras when I am trying to create something wherever it is like, you know, if I were prolific, I would probably just finish this right now instead of watching another episode of Family Guy. Anyway, from the Barbell Medicine crew to you, thank you so much for watching. This has been a coaching podcast. If you catch it on YouTube, make sure you hit subscribe.

That's a funny fun. Thank you.

=== FILE: How to Combat Bad Information [IF9B9G5sZzk].txt ===

What strategies do you use in your approach to correcting misinformation or misunderstanding in various settings? Uh, wow. Okay. So what strategy? We'll start with the first one and then, uh, yeah. So other than holding Barbell Medicine seminars and all the information that has already been disseminated through Barbell Medicine, of course. Let me tell you a story. It's no stories about my life. I previously, uh, particularly early on at Barbell Medicine, I thought it was my job to police the internet to make sure that no BS was being written anywhere, that could potentially harm anyone and I needed to correct everybody. That's a fool's errand because not only can you never get anywhere close to all of it, you're not actually changing anyone's mind. I still do this from time to time because I'm not very smart. I told you my GPA earlier, so you guys should be well aware of like my ability to like learn things. So not high. So I still do this at times because either I am a glutton for punishment or just again, not smart, I learn a lesson. But one thing I realized is that, uh, more productive use of my time, our time is to actually just create more information. So effectively, like, if somebody's saying something silly on the internet, like, I can't stop them from saying that and me directly challenging them is unlikely to work out in my favor. But if I write an article about that particular thing or make like a long, you know, series, like a tutorial or like an Instagram story, you know, rant thing, that'll reach way more people, help more people, whatever. I particularly like writing stuff or making a YouTube video or whatever, it's stuff that doesn't disappear on as long lasting content. It tends to be good because a lot of people are going to see it. Then it's there. I can refer people to it and then allows me to really flesh out my ideas. The cool thing is, uh, if I can find some common ground with that person who I originally disagreed with, uh, on occasion, you can sort of strike up a conversation based on that. Uh, it's rare, but it has happened before where I end up agreeing with people that I've initially been like, oh, no. This makes me angry because you're wrong. But uh, it's possible. So my recommendation is for like how to go about this is not correcting people that writing reflex, uh, can occur. Uh, I do think in professional settings, it's a little different because usually if you come in guns ablazing with a bunch of evidence that you're willing to just give people and say, hey, if you have some time, check this out, read it, particularly if they're guidelines or like, you know, bulletins or whatever, those tend to be like, oh, shoot, I didn't actually know this. Um, so I think you can do that in professional settings, but in more social settings or like on social media or amongst friends, I probably just wouldn't do that and I'd focus on putting that creating original content that would be my take. Yeah, I agree. The context matters a whole lot here. And so within the public sphere, the social media sphere, things like that, I'll go ahead and say, I'm a smarter than Jordan. And that I just don't do it. I don't care to engage with with people or argue people with people or try to go out and correct misinformation. Um, I'm happy to just hear my recommendations. Here's why these are my recommendations and you people out there are free to take them or not. And that's kind of your decision. And so I actually take a similar approach with patients even because sometimes clinicians, doctors, healthcare professionals, um, can get really, really, really, really overly invested in like paternalistic and like feel excessively responsible for this stuff. And assuming that I have discussed with somebody and feel like I've gotten them adequately educated and I can, and I know that I've gotten through to them and my message is clear and been understood if they choose to pursue a different route with things, then fine. I feel like I've done my job. Um, whereas sometimes people might take offense to it. If somebody doesn't follow their advice or they might really beat themselves up or get to, you don't work up about it. Um, I see this more often when when patients say they want to leave the hospital during the course of my treatment and then I go and I educate them about why I'm recommending maybe they stay and if, if I have more work to do or whatever and if they say no, I'm, I'm leaving then okay, you know, I can't really beat myself up too much about that. And in social media, I ignore all of that stuff. I definitely don't go down the rabbit hole of arguing with people or I get tagged every day in things people like here. Look at this. What are your thoughts? I don't have thoughts. My thoughts have been expressed elsewhere and you can again take my recommendations or not and that's fine. One day we're all gonna die and things are gonna be just fine. So, um, that doesn't bother me. In the professional setting, among other doctors, among other clinicians, I know or at least I like to think that I'm among peers who are going to be more receptive to evidence. And so if you've watched any of my lectures that I've given to other doctors on sarcopenia or the cancer lecture or really any of my, my talks that I've given, uh, my slides are just littered with references and graphs and data and things like that. And that's something that I, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's obviously important for how we practice, but it's also a strategy to actually convince people that, hey, I actually, you know, know what I'm talking about here. And here's my justification for my belief, whereas in society, uh, for a lot of this stuff, you don't necessarily need to have a really strong justification for your belief. You can just have beliefs. So if you listen to, uh, our last rehab podcast from Reno's Q&A Michael Ray talked about, uh, this YouTube channel that we all, that, that me and him, he, he introduced me to called a street epistemology. And it's a guy who is actually in San Antonio, and he goes around and he'll meet somebody and he'll talk to him a little bit and he'll elicities like tries to get them to make a claim about something that they believe. And then very gently, kindly he'll start to delve into this belief and ask them just kind of pointed questions to try to get at the heart of why they believe what they believe oftentimes it ends up going down until like religion and things like that. But he's very good at it, uh, in terms of getting to why people believe what they believe, but overwhelmingly what he ends up showing is people can't justify oftentimes what they believe. They just make sure it up and they just believe what they believe. And, um, we're very, uh, we're very stupid creatures. And so like Jordan said, it's a fool's air into go out and try to save the world and correct everything that's wrong out there. So I just don't do it and wouldn't recommend it. Uh, have you been in an argument in the last week? But been in an argument in the last week. No. I've been into, you've been into. Well, to be fair, it's not my fault. One of them was like a scheduled podcast on like injury and it's technique. Sure. Yes. So that I did that to myself. Yes. But the second one, this guy was making the claim that because doctors don't receive like advanced nutrition training during medical school that they should not be counseling patients on dietary changes, to which my reply is, why do you need to know all these intricacies to do that behavioral change counseling? You don't. Just like you don't need to be a programming whiz or like, uh, you know high level coach in order to help people in, you know, achieve these physical activity guideline minimums. You don't need that. You need to be experienced to know what to do for trouble shooting for like performance, right, or have a big toolbox for cueing people in real time. Sure. But to the extent that you need this huge fund of knowledge, just to like be able to draw up some initial recommendations. Like, I don't think you need that. Or to act, I would prefer the in fact your tool kit was more robustly stocked with behavioral counseling techniques. Yeah. I mean, most of you guys who are here this weekend, you probably are now feeling a little bit more comfortable at what the basic outlines of what we would recommend as a healthy dietary pattern might look like, right? So energy intake and protein fiber, how the fat distribution looks like. And then within that there's tons of latitude. So cool. You don't need to have hyper advanced training to be able to counsel somebody on some of that stuff. But having those conversations is the hard

=== FILE: How to Re-Start Training After a Layoff [c4NNE6eox4c].txt ===

Jordan said, boy, anytime I see that in a question, I just like, I probably didn't say that. Yeah, probably. Here we are. Jordan said during the seminar that enjoyment and exercise has the biggest impact on endurance. Oh, that's true. I did say that coming back to lifting after a long layoff, I found it difficult to find enjoyment with weights that are so far below when I used to be able to do any suggestions or resources on how to start enjoying training again. I don't have any resources on this. It'd be great if we had a book. It was like enjoying training. Like, it just like a whole book. I'm like how to make starting enjoyment. Yeah, starting starting starting, starting pleasure. You know, just, yes. I'm lifting weights very pleasurable. Yeah, that's gross. So this is a good start. Starting hedonism. Yeah, a way to use my weights to, yeah. I actually do have a strategy for this because this happened to me. I did cross it for like eight months. Yeah, I experimented with the dark, dark arts. And I lost a substantial amount of weight in a substantial amount of strength. I'm not sure those two things were related because I wasn't really lifting weights. During that time, I was doing a bunch of Olympic lifts. And it just, I wasn't squatting, eventually. You're deadlifting. Yeah, I'm a weight went down as well. So when I came back, I remember I squatted. I used Leah's belt. This is how like, yeah, kick kick. Yes, yes. This is how, this is how like, kick kick I was. That was a hundred. I remember I came back from Australia. And I was 84 kilos, 85 kilos, which is like all of 185 pounds or something like that. And I usually as belt and I squat at 180 kilos, which is 396 for a hard triple, a hard triple. To be clear, I've benched that before for a triple. So like things were bad. And I was like, what? So I'd recently decided to like quit doing CrossFit because I didn't like it. And then, yeah, so enjoyment was low. And I was like, I was going back to powerlifting because I love that. And then I did powerlifting for one day. And I was like, no, where's all my strength? So the strategy that I used on the exercises that I had a lot of history with. So squat bench deadlift, I changed the rep range to things I didn't have experience with. So for example, I'd never really done squats or deadlift for sets of eight and ten. I stuck to mostly those. And I picked different exercise variations that I had very little experience with. And previously, so that I didn't have this like historical like performance, a barometer that I kept going up against. So I did that. And honestly, I remember it was like six to eight weeks after I came back. I was within about 10% of my normal strength levels. And so I was happy again and could train like relatively regularly. Benefits of this are kind of twofold. One, you don't hate yourself every time you go to the gym and think, what was me? This is the worst I've ever performed in my whole life. And then benefit number two is that you're sort of slow, gradually retraining yourself to do a different thing. So remember, I had been doing CrossFit for eight months. I was not squatting, benching and deadlifting like I was during my normal powerlifting training. Had I just switched back to powerlifting with no sort of bridge in between that could have potentially been problematic for me. However, I had this sort of on-ramp where I was able to sort of get back to the normal training. And so that worked out pretty well for me. So generally that's how I recommend folks do that. If they have a specific goal that's different than their normal that we've been training for for a while. And then they want to go back to a previous type of training. I put program this like GPP-related bridge where the rep ranges are different. The exercise selection is different so they don't have this like, again, historical thing that they're comparing themselves against each single time. You can do that a lot of different ways. You can do that with rep ranges. You can do it with adding chains or bands or different barbells or different sort of range of motion or tempo. There's a whole different things, a lot of different things you can use. I just actually dealt with this very scenario although not entirely due to a lift off. I had a patient of mine who I have been working with for a little while who was recently diagnosed with cancer. And specifically he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and one of the standard treatments for prostate cancer is what's called endrogen deprivation therapy where you basically get put on testosterone blockers. You can think of it like that. You get like chemically castrated basically to prevent endrogen stimulating the prostate cancer from growing anymore. So we're intentionally making him hypogonaddle and he was observing that his performance was going down in the gym. When you're truly hypogonaddle, then sure we would expect that your performance is going to be altered with that. And he was having some distress over this because he pulled 500 at national last year and now he's like I'm seeing my numbers start to change. And so what should I do? I'm not really loving training when I'm weaker. And I just said we need to change the metrics of performance here. We need to pick some different exercises, right? Rather than a competition squat and a competition deadlift than a positive bench press, we need to pick some other things that you haven't done before. Give you some new opportunities to PR, right? So now that if you're going to be doing pulse squats and deficit deadlifts and stuff like that, every time you train is going to be a PR. And so we change the strategy and he's now fully on board with that idea and training with some different things. So again, same deal so that he doesn't have this constant prior performance to compare himself to. So that's what we did with him. So effectively the same thing, just do different things and you'll have less of a metric of comparison. Yeah, just change the goalpost. Boom.

=== FILE: How-To Address Pain Without Being A Nocebo [9LXK_V9GcLg].txt ===

What would you recommend for managing slash receiving feedback on pain in the clinical world so that's not to ignore patient's perceptions but still maximize the rehab process? I can start. Alright. So this was the reference where I was talking about how if you're a coach and your coach and somebody who has some discomfort, say in their back, after every rep or after every set, you're asking, how's your back feeling? How's your back feeling? How's your back feeling? Constantly drawing more attention to that area because we know that a tensional focus plays a big role in people's experience of pain. And so I would make the recommendation to not do that when you're coaching people. This isn't to swing the other way into say just to ignore any symptom that they report but you don't necessarily need to go fishing for that. In a rehab context, if you were a skilled clinician and observer and communicator with your patient, then you can observe what they're doing and then just ask them what their thoughts are. After a given set, how'd that go? Do you feel comfortable increasing the load? Something like that. And given that you've had the discussion, the education process ahead of time, saying, we're going to work in a range of tolerable symptoms and aim to progress gradually from there, then you can get that feedback. They can volunteer it to you rather than you go and fishing for it from them. So to the point where if they're feeling comfortable and okay, then you can celebrate that and say, that's awesome, that's great news. You're feeling good, that's a good sign. We can keep progressing in this process. Whereas if they volunteer that this is pretty uncomfortable or I'm concerned about this or this is freaking me out or I don't want to go up anymore, then you can respect that and maybe have a discussion around it and modify the plan accordingly rather than constantly going again, fishing and drawing their attention to an area that their attention may not necessarily be on. Focusing their attention more on the task and celebrating the victory of that went well. I think is probably the way that I would go in a clinical context. I recognize, however, that in the clinical world there's some tendency and rule, potentially even rules and requirements to get patients pain scores on a scale of 1 to 10 and that can be annoying. I don't need to do a pain score on a scale of 1 to 10 after every set either. So I would do the bare minimum on that front as far as getting your pain scores and then just focusing on the task and not unnecessarily drawing attention to where it doesn't need to be. I think the only, just to have practical sense, I actually don't recommend that most coaches ask about it. If you notice somebody who's demonstrating pain-related behavior which during a lift would be slow down, that occurs during the descent of a squat, for example, or hesitation during a particular lift that is abnormal because you've worked with this person before. You can ask, hey, was that painful for you? Or you can ask them even a more open-ended question, like what's going on? Just to get them to start talking about it. But my general recommendation is to not ask, does that hurt after any set? The only time I think that's appropriate is if you're trying new stuff, to try to work around an existing injury and you're on the fly, trying new things to see if they're still sensitive to that particular movement. Someone had low back pain like Leah when we were trying to gather in Santa Cruz quite frequently. If she had a low back pain, we do a mid-shin rack pull and after she did a set of how that feel, how that feel is the right question there. And then if that didn't, she said, I still, still pretty sensitive, it's still a pretty good. We try another thing and I would say, again, how does that feel? Something like that. I think the big thing that people, I don't know if they feel this way, but I certainly think it gets perceived this way, it's like you have to be perfect with this pain stuff. And if you mess up, dang it, I ruined it. That's not the case. We all make mistakes. We all say the wrong things sometimes. Important part is, the important part is to not compound an error with another error. Like, oh, did that hurt? Oh, no, I said it. I said the H word. I'm saying, now you're freaking out about it and they're like, what? And so some of that actually gets transferred to them and they're like, they start feeling guilty about having pain. The normal human experience. And then the stuff can start snowballing. And so I think it's just like, yeah, look, we all make mistakes and don't use the right language all the time. We have certain goals for how we communicate and let's try to do the best we can. But in the coaching setting, I think it just plan on saying how does that feel. If you notice something strange. Yeah.

=== FILE: How-To Assess Self Efficacy [vRP021pAg24].txt ===

Music Question number two, how do you assess self-efficacy during your initial evaluation? Oh, this is a great question. Well, you just ask them what's your self-efficacy in it? No, this is usually like, huh? So, barring any proprietary methods like that pamphleter team, which I've never used personally. I just, you know, found it on the internet to torrent it, just to see what it was. Really interesting. But some of the questions are, can be useful or the styles of questions. So, admittedly, in barbell medicine, and so, that's what I do now. It's my full time job. This is not something I need to usually directly assess. Being like, to try to figure out, does this person have resources, skills, like, you know, to go out there, you know, you like, you like, to go out there, and, you know, try to take ownership of their own health and the role that they play in their own health. But, in residency, you know, a question I would often ask people is, you know, what do you view your role in all of this to be? So, if we're talking about a disease status or like a new diagnosis or there are long-term chronic disease, like, so what is your role in this, in this sort of process? It is a question, like, a loaded question because a person might be like, either I've never thought about it or it immediately, like, I don't feel great about that. But that's not necessarily a bad thing because if they feel sort of bad about it or responsible, that's what I want them to feel responsible for. I don't want to feel bad. I want them to feel like I do take responsibility for my own health and I feel like I'm in control. That's those are signs of self-efficacy. If someone were to say, I don't feel like I play any role in this, I don't have any responsibility. That's the opposite. That's low self-efficacy. And so assessing what resources skills, tools, somebody else has available to them is a whole, another line of questions. And so going in with more open-ended questions specific to the sort of behavioral change you're targeting. So if it's exercise, be like, okay, what sort of exercise would you like to do, what sort of strategies do you have to become more physically active, what sort of access do you have? And sort of then you're starting to assess like how far people have gone on their own. And that, again, gives you a clue how much self-efficacy to the half. If someone was super motivated, ready to change their behavior, and had a high level self-efficacy, I probably wouldn't be seeing them for to change their physical activity patterns because they'd already done it. Right? So I'm trying to find the hang-up. Right? Where do I need to come in and either provide if it's knowledge, okay? If it's additional strategies, okay? If it's additional resources, okay? It just, you're trying to kind of work down that rabbit hole to figure out where you come in, rather than starting from the beginning and not going through any of that and saying, here's the plan. Yeah, assessing self-efficacy. I think emerges naturally just from having a conversation with somebody. I presented during the pain lecture a bunch of examples of the kind of open-ended questions that will ask people during this evaluation for almost anything, whether it's medical, pain related, et cetera. You know, what do you think is going on, what are your biggest concerns, have you dealt with this before, what did you do then, what do you know, what do you think is going on, et cetera. And through all that, just listening to their answers, you can get a feel for where somebody said is that was something. There are certain validated questionnaires for self-efficacy and certain context. There's, for example, a pain self-efficacy questionnaire, PSEQ. But once you start down that rabbit hole, it is easy to get way too excited about questionnaires. You can use questionnaires and scales to evaluate everything. There's a Tampa scale for Canisia, FObia, there's a catastrophizing scale, there's a pain self-efficacy questionnaire, there's questionnaires for literally everything you can think of backpack and, you know, all the, there's way too many of them. And eventually your whole encounter with somebody is them filling out questions. So I think that's something that probably more useful in my opinion for research purposes to actually measure things like differences in self-efficacy over the course of a particular intervention. If that's what the study wanted to look at in real world practice, I don't think you need a questionnaire to do that. I think you need to, you know, be a human and interact with another human and have a conversation and get a sense of where they're at, where they're coming from. The downside is that takes time, right? And so you need to be in a clinical environment where you actually have the time to do that. So that can be tricky. Where's the AI self-efficacy? Yeah.

=== FILE: How-To Avoid Burnout？ [NQUEiQ-WQV4].txt ===

How do you guys personally take care of your mental emotional energy? I think that anybody who's involved, particularly the healthcare fields, you know, has there's a difficult balance between like taking care of yourself, the person and then caring for others. But you went into this field to take care of others. And some days are harder than others and you give more than you get and other days you get more than you give. As far as how an individual needs to approach their own particular needs for like a mental health standpoint, I think services that are underutilized are mental health services. If you feel better talking to a counselor or some sort of psychiatrist that can all be useful, me personally. I have found reasonably good sort of balance if you will by trying to maintain a set of boundaries that works for me, meaning that I can it's pretty easy to get kind of really involved in somebody else's sort of like this is their journey and this is how I'm helping them. And these are all their issues that we're kind of working out. But I have to also step back and understand that's not my particular situation and addition, it's maybe not okay if they're emailing me five or six times a day. And so creating those boundaries where hey, this is the expectations that we're setting as far as communication, like frequency, style, what I can be responsible for, but I think overall having some sort of boundaries, like professionals and boundaries are useful. I think also kind of understanding the field that you're getting into kind of expect some of this and then using like mental health services would also be useful. Like people need counselors need counselors, it's very underutilized, this is underutilized. And then I don't know that there's any reliable like a specific approach that I think universally works for all folks. So finding your kind of stuff that makes it viable for you can be useful. I mean burnout is super common in medicine and, you know, among some specialties more than others, I get to see horrible things very frequently. And burnout is common around me as well among kind of fellow clinicians. So I definitely agree with everything that Jordan said with respect to professional boundaries outside of work. For example, if you feel like you're having issues from a mental health standpoint using those kind of resources, as far as my own personal habits on this front, this is a big part of why people say, how is it that you've gone like a decade and missed one week of training? It's like, well, this is why I make sure that I train because for me personally, that is my most useful way to maintain some kind of control over my life, some aspect of consistency, something that I enjoy that I can look forward to whenever I do end up getting out of the hospital, whether it's earlier late, I plan to train regardless and don't skip that session, even, you know, if it's 10 or 11 at night and did that plenty of times in residency because that gave me a sense of continued control over my life. That's a big part is if you feel like you're not in control, right? So loss of self-efficacy over your situation, loss of autonomy, that can be a big deal. And then similarly, you know, if you're a coach, biting off more than you can chew can be a big problem, right? In terms of your client load, for example, something that you actually do have control over. There was a period of time when I was in residency where I was doing similarly multiple jobs, like I do right now, but with respect to residency, I did not have control over my life. I had to be in the hospital certain times and responsible for whatever was going on there at that particular time and then I had these other things, coaching and, you know, some telemedicine stuff I was doing outside that I did have some control over, but I definitely bit off more than I could chew. And I like correct, pretty hard around that period of time, recognize that I bit off way more than I could chew, but at the same time, I knew that I was still training and I knew that it was temporary and that it wasn't going to be like that forever, right? And so ultimately, fortunately, I was able to get through that and have other things that I can kind of look forward to and enjoy, but I've definitely, I'm currently in a period of time where I'm actually trying to scale back a little bit of how much I'm doing because like, do I really need to be doing this much right now as far as all the things that I tackle and work on at the same time and the very clear and obvious answer is no despite the fact that I still do them. So definitely easier said than done and I don't have it perfect at either. But everything Jordan said as well as paying attention to, you know, your workload to the extent that you have control over it, if you have more control over it, that's awesome and scaling back if you need to and my bias is definitely training as far as some measure of consistency and consistency and something I do have control over that may be something different for you. Take advantage of that, whatever that may be.

=== FILE: How-To Deal with CNS Fatigue [vODrvwfYltw].txt ===

Music Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum. We have Dr. Awesome Rocky in the studio live in the flesh. That's real. He's in town this week and we decided to answer some questions from the internet. Alright next question, what's the low down on CNS fatigue? It's like a, it's a sign-fil-thing. What's the deal with CNS fatigue? Worst bit ever. That's well. Worst or best. Is it even possible for a novice or early intermediate to obtain CNS fatigue? Yes. Or is general fatigue not the same thing as central fatigue? Due to poor recovery, sleep hydration, nutrition, often mistaken as CNS fatigue. They're not, I mean, you can have them set, you know, one influences the others. I don't know that I would differentiate the two. So let's just say what fatigue is, particularly with respect to exercise, the way we explain fatigue is like the negative psychological and physiological outcomes of physical activity that ultimately reduce your performance potential and those are going up against the positive sort of psychological and physiological outcomes from physical activity which would be fitness adaptations and that balance effectively gives you your performance potential on a given day. CNS fatigue, central fatigue, as it's more appropriately discussed in the literature, is effectively things that are current at the level of the brain and spinal cord that modulate force production. So one way to test for if you have central fatigue is experimentally. Experiment yet. You don't actually do. Yeah, look, man, if you got a battery and small electronics, don't do this at home. Yeah, we gotta say that. So effectively you have people go to failure on like late extensions, for example and then you have that you stick these electrodes in their quads and then you shock them and see like can they actually produce more force? And if so, that person had central fatigue effectively the brain and spinal cord through a bunch of different processes are tamping down the amount of force production that the muscles actually have access to. It's got like this protective mechanism kind of thing in a very simplified, very simplified sort of way. On the other hand, if you put the those electrodes in, you shock them and no additional force production has occurred. Effectively central fatigue is not the limiting factor, but peripheral fatigue is a limiting factor. So the muscles are tapped out. Yeah, so either muscles are damaged, there's a accumulation of stuff that's prevented from contract, depletion of energy substrates, also to stuff. All right, so that's the load out on like what central fatigue is and as far as is it possible for a person who's relatively new to training to have central fatigue? Yes, it's possible for everyone. And in fact, I would argue that any type of physical activity has some cost associated with it. Now, it might be minimal compared to the fitness adaptations that you're getting. It might be minimal compared to your previous level of training and it might you might not notice it particularly if you're not testing yourself or requiring yourself to perform at a certain level. But it's still there. It'd be very difficult to engage in any physical activity that like is somewhat challenging at any level and not have central fatigue as far as how long that lasts. And the effect it has on subsequent days performance depends on what physical activity and what series of physical activities you've been doing and how well trained you are, how you can dissipate, how you can tolerate that. The last part I'll just address before us in just outwokes me on this is could you have a higher level of central fatigue due to lack of sleep, reduced hydration or impaired nutrition status? Those things are all integrated at cortical, so cerebral cortex level areas of the brain and also sub-portugal levels. So yes, to basically the brain's taking into consideration all of these inputs, integrating them together and saying, hey, here's your performance potential that's again very simplified view of how we conceptualize this sort of fatigue, performance potential fitness adaptation interplay. But yeah, if you're not, if you're, you know, haven't slept well and if you're actually dehydrated or and not you, volmic and if you are fasted or other stuff like that or your blood sugar is low or your muscle glycogen levels are low, sure. Yeah, you're going to have likely to have an impaired performance, but you probably can't predict those things on the front end of a training session either. What I'm getting is that thinking about these, like you just heard me say all those things, you're like, well, I didn't only slept seven hours and I didn't have my normal two liters of water today and then like my meal is normally time 90 minutes exactly before I start working out enough, 120 minutes. So I think we think those things are going to be a good day today as far as like their overall impact on your like performance level and I wouldn't expect them to have a substantial impact unless there's a substantial change in them that again, ultimately, manifests as like last week with food poisoning. Yeah, turns out you don't need to eat, don't need to eat. I didn't eat for like two and a half days. I managed to keep some fluids down, but not much and sleep was impaired and you know, my performance was still higher than the week prior all that day and then a few sessions later, everything was back to normal, but then I actually happened to feel worse in the gym that day and it was like, you know, it doesn't make sense. Yeah, it doesn't make sense if you assume that all these variables are like very linearly and predictably related to things. Sure, and also don't consider the other complexities of performance that likely outweigh these. Yeah, yeah, the way I would kind of comment this question is, you know, breaking things down, for example, into like central fatigue, peripheral fatigue and all these different variables, that reflects the way that humans go about trying to understand things, which is reductionism. Right? Sure. Yeah. So, you know, we try to break things down into their component parts, understand all their individual component parts, and then, you know, in theory, we try to just like mash it all back together and to say, I get it. Gotcha. And then that almost never works. In terms of giving you such a good understanding that you can use it for predictive, prognostic purposes, right? It's useful for us to understand these concepts of central and peripheral fatigue and things like that. But for from a practical standpoint, for a trainee, like the person who presumably wrote this question, and they're like, is it possible for a novice or intermediate to obtain CNS fatigue, as if it's like something they should be worried about? I view fatigue kind of like pain, kind of like hunger, kind of like a bunch of other things. It's this experience, right? Fatigue is an experience that we all have. And it's not super useful to break it down into these component parts in the same way that like if I have, if I experience some pain, and my question is going to be like, am I having like, you know, central pain, am I having central sense of pain? Am I having no susceptive pain right now? Am I, you know, it's not that useful because our approach is going to be similar in terms of, you know, managing the energy, paying situations for most people in this situation in terms of fatigue, you know, say you've go in and your performance is not where you want it to be. And you're like, oh god, is this central fatigue? Is this, no, it's like, I'm just going to ideally, auto regulate, adjust my loads for the day, get the training dose that I want to get out of the session and move on with my life. So I don't think it's worth, I have literally never in the course of a training session thought about, do I have for, yes, is my CNS for I today? It's just like, no, my performance is just down today. And for whatever reason, just be like that. Yeah, no, I think, I mean, that's, I like that perspective and then I think the only utility in doing the reductionist thing is because a lot of people will talk about CNS fatigue. Yeah. And so it's like, I will now you know at home what it is and like, it's good for understanding sure not so much for application day to day in training. Yeah, people. Yeah, when people say my CNS is fried that there's, there's a lot of undoing that you'd have to it. Yeah. I would rather you just say, I'm tired. I'm tired. Yeah. I'm not feeling it today. Yeah. It's like I played golf today, right? And I've been having, I've been playing the golf of my life recently. And so at some point it was bound to stop. Yes. It's just, it do be like that. And that's today. That was today. I didn't play poorly, but it just, you know, there's some inherent luck there. Yeah. There's a lot of time between when the ball leaves the club face and lands and you're not a control of any of that. Yeah. You know, didn't go my way. But the whole thing was like, I wasn't trying to wait, what's going on here? Like, do I am I tired? Am I, we're right this time? And while you're still going to go, just play. Yeah. Similar to, you know, when we talk about pain, somebody has back pain, they're like, oh, is it my facet? Is it my disc? Is it my ligament? Is it my QL? Is it my so-a? Is it what? It's like, yeah. Not worth worrying about. Yes, I'm glad. Some days it do be like that. Yeah.

=== FILE: How-To Determine Good Technique [wjAf5jgYMog].txt ===

Music Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum. We have Dr. Awesome Rocky in the studio live in the flesh. That's real. He's in town this week and we decided to answer some questions from the internet. Next question, how to pick a particular technique for exercise. So this question was a long example about how there might be different. In the optimal position to activate more muscle mass, I could pick a particular technique for a given exercise. Again, to make this more generalizable, I go back to that reps model. So you're trying to pick a particular movement pattern or a style for an individual to perform an exercise and it should be repeatable, meaning that they can do it over and over again. Yes, there's a rep to rep variability. We accept that. Probably even better than trying to do it with this rigidly perfectionist kind of tendency. But they can repeat it, meaning that the reps look somewhat similar. So they're not doing two different exercises, you know, rep to rep. It's efficient. People will tend to self-organize into like an efficient way for them to move. This is most well studied in running, where people will pick this a gate and stride length and everything else that suits, seems to suit their body, their mechanics or strengths, et cetera. But otherwise you'd pick a style for a resistance training that you are efficient in meaning that there's not a lot of extraneous movement where you're applying force in directions that don't help you lift the weight. And it meets all the points of performance for that movement. So whatever arbitrary sort of points you'd like to make. So for the squat, let's say you want to squat below parallel. You've made that determination. You don't want to do it at a slow tempo. You want to move the thing as quickly as possible. You want to do it with the bar on your back. You don't want the bar to move. All of these things are, you know, you're determining their importance. So they are quite arbitrary, unless there's a competition specific standard. But in powerlifting, for example, the only thing is you've got to walk the way down under control. You've got to get the squat command with lock knees. You have to squat below parallel and wait for the recommend. If the barbell happens to move up your back, can confirm they will still give you white lights for that. So again, points of performance are somewhat arbitrarily defined. Now that's just from a strength perspective. If there could be high-purchasing specific points of performance that you want to include, if it's a conditioning mode, all sorts of stuff, right? But in any case, those are the things I think about when actually picking or trying to move to somebody's technique towards what I would consider better versus worse. And so again, that's the rep model that I use. So I don't know the, I think that's like my, it's like kind of where I like approach this. And then just basically looking at the individuals movement and having a conversation with them about the points of performance that either are determined by the sport that they're participating in or what they're giving a bunch of credence to based on their own preferences. And then, yeah, coaching. I mean, you're just, you're looking at it into the extent that you are reliably able to discern lapses in efficiency or efficiency errors. And then if somebody's not me, certain point of performance, yeah, trying to correct those. But that's how I'm picking a particular exercise style. What I would add to that is that, you know, the technique that somebody uses to execute a movement is also likely to vary over time. We talked about this in our last one a little bit as well. And so that does a few things. It helps us get away from perfectionism, particularly upfront, recognizing that this is going to be a process. The other thing is that it helps us get away from trying to predict in advance like what my individual, you know, preferred styles going to be on day one. I think that there are some basic, what you're calling points of performance to borrow some terminology. Sure. From folks, so like the most basic one on the squad is like, I would prefer that people stay balanced throughout the whole movement of the squad. I prefer they not be way back on their heels and then rocking up onto the toes. And that's like a super basic example of something, right? It helps to be repeatable and efficient. Yeah. And that's exactly it. There are a whole bunch of other things that I might look for like to see, you know, somebody do or not, again, depending on the goal of the movement. So if they want to go to, you know, a parallelity meet, then those standards what I'm looking for might change, even within a parallelity meet. Sure. They're telling me I'm going to go to SPF. I'm like, you're good. Yeah, yeah, you're good. Yeah, you're good. Yeah, you're good. Yeah, you're good. Yeah, you're good. Yeah. But like you said, you know, hypertrophy might come with different considerations, as far as you want to make sure that the target muscle that you're wanting to grow bigger is, getting receiving as much stimulus as it can. You want to be taking it through sufficient range of motion, although there's even evidence for some partial range of motion. I've heard three benefits too. So this stuff does get complicated rather quickly. I think that there should be, you know, a degree of comfort. It should be able to meet the task demands, the task goals, whether it be for competition or for health or something like that. All these things are kind of dynamic. And they're just recognizing that it's an evolution. It's a process over time. There's tons of experimentation. You'll see some people out there who train and perform at very high levels who have technique that you might view and say, man, that doesn't look like what I've been taught is optimal. Sure. Yeah. People high-barring in-pile, if you meet some setting-world records, don't they know that if they just move the bar down, that they, it's like, you know, that's a complicated process. And so I wouldn't necessarily impose these rigid kind of ideas on people up front, rather pick a few basic things to target things like balance in the squat, for example. Bounce in the deadlift is another one that you can work on, bar path in the bench press is probably like one of the big ones that we tend to emphasize early on. And then there's a whole lot of experimentation from that point forward. Some people in the bench are going to gravitate towards a wider grip. Some towards a narrower grip. The squat, some are going to gravitate towards a wider stance, a narrower stance, knees more forward, knees more back, more bent over. And it's not all something that is exclusively determined by their segment lengths because there are people who are going to think that is more to it than jump. That's a piece of it. There's more to it than that too in terms of what ends up being people's preferred style that they can train most consistently and use for adaptation and do the best with over time. Yeah, that's another reason why we like having a fairly high amount of exercise variation within our programming, particularly for those who are relatively new to training or very far out from a competition because it's like, you don't need to decide right now. Like this is the style, this is the specific type of squat or deadlift, a band that you're doing. And by exposing you to different ones, we're working on that efficiency and you're awareness of your body in space and we're working on exposing you to maybe different ways to move that you might say, that one was good. Yeah, I like that right now. Yeah. Five years from now, you might not like that. Cool.

=== FILE: How-To Develop Healthy Habits in Youth [mNkT_bsUHFg].txt ===

How can we do a better job of framing exercise and diet in a positive life for our youth? For example, it's somewhat common practice for parents to not let their children leave the dinner table until they've finished all their vegetables. Another example of this would be coaches making their athletes run as a form of punishment. These experiences may frame healthy eating and exercise as a way that is synonymous with suffering and discomfort. How can we improve these psychosocial variables? Nice. Early and or address them with adults that have already met these experiences. Or lived these experiences. Excuse me. I picked some hard ones this time. It's just that I don't necessarily agree with the premises. So for example, I don't know that one may necessarily associate this with a form of punishment. He might but depends on other stuff. I don't know, was your parent yelling you don't run? Or like, hey, let's go run around the house. Let's go do a lap. Maybe that's your suggestion. The way that the recommendation or the way it's framed. Yes, it does. Exactly. So for example, I'm not pretending to give anybody a parent-day advice. There's a few people. Peter of us should do that. Parent-day advice, relationship advice. Look, I'm not your doctor for that. I think so one, I always think that the parents leading by example probably makes for a better environment, especially for making recommendations or suggestions to their kids because mom and dad are already doing it. So you should do it too. And then also if you're going, if you're needing to modify some of the behaviors that the child is engaged in, especially with respect to the diet or activity, the way that you're recommending them should be ideally into a form of positive way or affirming way rather than do this in a negative light because I think there are too many risks there with potentially future psychological distress around those actions. But trying to get kids to eat vegetables, for example. So one, as a family should be eating vegetables regularly and involve the kid in preparing the vegetables and picking the vegetables and how to, you know, which way will shell you prepare them? All that stuff is useful because then the kids got a buy into these vegetables like, look, I help make these and then they're probably going to eat them. With respect to being active, like, hey, do you want most, especially, I know the parents I know that train, if they train at home, their kids want to come out into the gym and play around with mom and dad who are lifting in the gym. So exposing them rather early on can't be a positive experience rather than say, hey, get out of my hair, go run around the house. Not saying that that's how people do it, but I think that leading by example and then also involving the kid in the process, like whatever process can be useful because then they have a bigger buy in. Oh, you just got a home gym, rebuild the home gym, like, yeah, let's set it up together. You know, we're sure this goes. All the stuff that's sort of stuff can be can be useful as far as adults that have already had these experiences. I think you're going to sus that out during this, like, the sort of interview process, you know, when you're taking into client, asking them, you know, what sort of barriers do they have or feelings or thoughts do they have about changing the dietary patterns. And if something specific comes up, that's where you're going to get there. But I don't routinely see that to be honest. I have, you know, the closest I get is people say, I don't like vegetables. Yeah. And then when I explore that, it's usually due to, like, I don't like the way they taste. I don't, you know, and then I'm not really sure how to prepare them in a way that tastes tasty. Let me just go down and kind of try things. If I could give advice to parents who have kids, it'd be to get them to be an active and is many different ways as possible. And the best way to do that is not only giving them choices and opportunities, but also leading by example. So if mom and dad lift or otherwise are active, like, they have slightly likely the kids going to want to join in on that, it's just the normal thing to do. Yeah. I don't have a ton to add to that. I mean, that's kind of why I included this question as mainly to convey the message of leading by example is going to be kind of the main thing that I would suggest here. For adults who have already been through this, refer back to the standard behavior change talk that we did, all the same things, what do I there as far as how you work with people to change their behaviors? That's the idea. Did you add live? No. You know where my dad and my mom met at the gym? Yep. My mom was in a robix instructor. My dad was playing racquetball. And apparently, short shorts meets short shorts. Nice. Yeah, that's how I came to be.

=== FILE: How-To Explain Pain to Others [FEsQ70Ci76k].txt ===

What are the most quick and effective analogies you've used to explain pain to patients? The first caveat that I would say here is I typically don't go into these encounters with the aim of explaining pain to a patient. The patient knows what pain is, what it feels like. They're coming to me telling me this hurts. I don't have to tell them what it means to hurt or what hurt is. Rather, I'm there to help them make sense of their experience to understand what it means, what it doesn't mean and what they can do about it if anything. Usually, there are a lot of things that can be done about it. So I think that we need to be cautious about, because, you know, and most of us when we learn a lot of this kind of new-fangled pain stuff that's actually been around for a few decades at this point, you get excited to just kind of like, you know, burst into the exam room and start, you know, telling your patient how it is. It's like the cool kid guy. Oh yeah. Here's what you're feeling in your back and they're like, what? Yeah. Right. So I think first and foremost, in all of these encounters where I'm having these kind of conversations with patients, I'm generally asking them to tell me about what they're experiencing and then I just shut up and let them tell me. And I even do the same thing outside of Musco-Scale pain related issues when I'm in the hospital and the ER, somebody might be coming in with something else that I actually need to admit them to the hospital for and I'm not there to necessarily kick in the door and tell them what's going on. I said, tell me what's going on and I just zip it and let them talk. At some point, I need to start getting more involved in the conversation, but anytime I find myself talking more than the patient is, that's a red flag to me that something's not right. And I tell my residents and students that, particularly when they get to talk into too much, you should be probably talking a little bit less. I want to hear more from them. With that said, once it gets to the point where I've assessed the patients understanding of what this pain means, then that may be a place where I can kind of confront some of those beliefs and aim to redirect those a little bit. So if their belief is, yeah, I have this pain in my back when I've been over and I think it, you know, every time I have that pain, it means that my joints are grinding away against one another and that's why I'm having pain. Well, that's something that I probably need to correct. I need to nudge that in a different direction. Otherwise, when I ask them to go and bend over and exercise, to pick up a load off the floor or something like that, then that's a situation where that interpretation where they're like, oh, no, my joints are grinding together. I can't do this. This is unsafe. I can't time I should use camp at my sock on. So I have to alter that meaning, that understanding that they have. So a simple kind of metaphor that you'll hear used a lot in this world is just kind of the idea of pain as an alarm system. That's one where it's very easy to discuss it. Patients can understand that fairly readily. You can also build in the concepts of kind of sensitivity to that, into that discussion and kind of help to alter their understanding of what pain means to guide them on the right path. But I just caution people not to jump to that sort of aggressive over-explaining to soon to early before you've listened to the person and gotten a sense of where they're coming from. Yeah. I think people are trying to have deeper discussions with patients or even other people about pain. The analogy that I like that I think makes the most sense to me as far as the complexity of what's actually going on is that pain is an experience similar to hunger. Like hunger is an experience and that there are many different inputs into why you become hungry and why you have pain. So for example, you don't always just hungry when your body is low on energy or needs calories. So it's not just biological, but there are social inputs. If you see people around you eating, you smell that tasty donut, you see food for example, you might become hungry. There are psychological things that go on that affect your dietary intake or you want to eat or not and that's similar to pain that they're all these sort of different inputs that get integrated into that experience. And so when people start to understand the complexity, then you can further explain this. If people need it, but you don't need to have this in-depth discussion with somebody about pain until you've figured out what their story is and why they're there, why they're not ready to eat it. Well, yeah, exactly. It's not everybody's ready to eat it. So if your friend says, yeah, man, I threw my back out this morning, I'm not going to make it to the gym or whatever. Yeah, so let me tell you about pain. Pain's like hunger, you see. And sometimes you just got to let the big dog eat. It's like, wait, what? It's like, I don't know, I went to a seminar. That's what I took home. It's not what we said. Okay. Yeah. So in general, I kind of wait for somebody to ask me to weigh in on these things before I actually weigh in on them.

=== FILE: How-To Manage Training And Shiftwork [QRoYH35UHWM].txt ===

How can you best mitigate the effect of shift work like 24-hour shifts such as naps to catch up on sleep? And then how do you not know CBO yourself into thinking you'll have a bad day? Because you didn't get enough sleep or some other factor that is far from ideal. I can start. So this is something that I think both of us have some experience with. Having been through periods of time already did 24-28 hour shifts somewhat regularly. And there's not a great way to get quality sleep during that period of time, particularly when those shifts can be unpredictable. So there may have been some of those shifts where I was able to get some sleep during the shift. There are some where I had to be awake, alert and doing things the entire time. And obviously there ends up being a consequence afterwards. Some of those days after the shift will crash harder than others, or if you end up getting some sleep on the shift, maybe you don't sleep as much. And so the unpredictability, the variability, is problematic. It results in you generally not feeling awesome. And I think that is unfortunately probably part of the deal with doing 24-hour shifts with any degree of regularity. You're not going to feel completely awesome or completely normal all the time. If they're more spaced out and relatively infrequent, then you can try to get on as consistent of a sleep schedule as you can in between. And that'll restore some semblance of normal sleep. But just the idea was sleep in general and that this should be the takeaway if you listen to our podcast on sleep that we did with our friend Dr. Gordon. Is that consistency is kind of what tends to be the name of the game here. In particular, if we can get our patients who we have with insomnia, if we can get them waking up at the same time every single day, then that ends up resulting in developing sufficient sleep drive. Over time, such that they end up kind of falling into a more normal sleep cycle rhythm. But obviously this is a big barrier to having a consistent sleep schedule. You just have to do the best you can in terms of consistency. As far as the other part of the question, where it had to do with not kind of crushing yourself by thinking you're going to have a bad session just because you didn't get enough sleep or some other factor. I think this comes into the discussion I had earlier comparing external versus internal load. So external load being the absolute weight on the bar, whereas internal load describes the response to that training stimulus that we measure using RPE. I think that if people who have excessive focus on the importance or the significance of the external load, they put all their value and self-worth on the absolute weight on the bar, I think you're going to have some trouble with this situation. Right? Because you're going to put so much value on lifting a particular weight on a particular day at a particular time and your life, the cards are just not going to fall that way. You get to that day, that time, go to lift that weight and maybe it doesn't go. Right? And that's tough. That's why we like having more as Jordan said, maliability, flexibility in your training program, where you view the training process differently. You don't view the training process as something where you have to lift a specific weight. Rather, you're saying, I'm the weight on the bar, the rep I'm doing is merely a strategy to elicit this response that I'm trying to get. Right? And in that sense, you can change the weight on the bar and not freak out about it. Rather, you can pack yourself on the back for saying, I got the desired stimulus for where I am today at this particular time, based on how I'm performing at this moment, given everything else in my life that I may or may not have control over. Right? So it can almost become a win when you go into that session. You use your auto-regulation strategy like RPE. You adjust the load accordingly. You complete the whole session. That's awesome. That's a win. You're doing more than just about anybody else out there who is doing 24 hour shifts. Guaranteed. Right? Instead of viewing it as I was supposed to squat 500 today. Right? But I could only squat 455. I suck. Right? Big difference in how you view that in terms of the training process. So this has a lot to do with kind of how if we're going to be goal-oriented, the nature of goals that we use. Are the goals we use performance-based? Right? Were you insist on performing lifting a particular weight? Are they out-come-based? Like, I'm lifting to win only if you ain't first your last. Right? Or are they process-based goals? Right? I'm going to train all four sessions that I'm supposed to do. I'm going to get my conditioning in, et cetera. And that's my win for the week because my life is crazy like this. So that's the way I view this. It's just reframing how I view the training process in general. I think the only thing I have to add is like if you were trying to set yourself up for success, you would want to control the or maximize the variables that are under your control as much as possible. So for example, you're on 24 hour shift. That doesn't mean, yeah, I'm going to skip three different meals and just have breakfast. For example, before leaving the hospital and three red bowls. Yeah, exactly right. So if you have your nutrition relatively under control with the health promoting dietary pattern, you know, your training is set up to allow some flexibility, rather than having very rigid processes. And then again, ultimately, a scribe in less sort of importance to any single session, any single exercise or any single sort of even input into your training. I mean, I would just assume that you're going to PR anyway, for example. Yeah, like if it's me, if I mean I don't work outside of barbell medicine anymore, this is my main baby, but I wish I could get us on to a night shift because if I go on night shift, I'm going to PR historically, whenever I'm on night shift PR start raining out of nowhere. And I have no idea why I have no reason to stay up at night now. I'm not into generate. So I can't do it. But yeah, I would just assume, all of the things we need to do are going to do great. So having that positive kind of outlook on stuff, good nutrition. And then I don't know that I would recommend NAPS because I just feel like that's not really going to help. It could help acute performance, but if it to the extent of compromise is sleep drive later on, it's probably net negative. So probably wouldn't do that. We just go in and train and go on with my life because that's a good summary of, you know, this whole deal. That's right. Train and go on with your life. Yeah, exactly. Very cool. Well, thank you so much for coming out here. Norfolk for our first seminar back, really appreciate it.

=== FILE: How-To Train Around Anatomical Limitations [FRmudtXGWeU].txt ===

Music Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum. We have Dr. Awesome Rocky in the studio live in the flesh. That's real. He's in town this week and we decided to answer some questions from the internet. This question is about how to approach training with hard bio-mechanical restrictions. So this individual recently found out through an x-ray that he's got a possible bone spur on the front of his ankle that severely limits his ankle mobility on that ankle. Basically he can't move his shan any further forward than vertical on that leg which makes squats a little weird sometimes and he has a tendency to twist at the bottom of the squat if he's not paying enough attention. So this is interesting because you're going to have people with certain anatomical variations, some people post operatively that won't be able to do certain exercises. So just having hard bio-mechanical restrictions, although I think when we say they can't do a particular exercise, we need to have some sort of standard that we're saying okay because you can't achieve this particular standard. Yeah I don't necessarily view it as you can't do this exercise so much as it is a position that you may be unable to achieve at that particular moment in time and then the nature of your restriction may be one that with time, with training, with you know, adaptation, you may be able to progress to achieve that position, other things, maybe a little more set in stone and you may not be necessarily able to just gradually progress towards a certain position which brings up some other questions which is I imagine what this is kind of getting at. Yeah so I think you know if this individual is having trouble squatting right and I would say all right well is the trouble the twist at the bottom of the squat because I don't necessarily view that as like a hard stop you can't squat. You might squat with a twist or with a lean or with you know some other sort of thing that may not be aesthetically pleasing based on what we've been cultured to believe. Condition rather to a perfect squat but that doesn't mean you can't squat and what do I mean by squat I mean you know simultaneous hip and knee flexion to this arbitrary death standard with a straight seven foot barbell. You know you remember watching I think it was cloak off who always pulls with a staggered stance he is like one foot that's like a couple inches in front of another and you know certain people on the internet would get pretty triggered by that but it's he's been doing it for decades and you're not super strong doing it without any apparent you know not to hit with no detriment sure being apparent from it. Yeah so I feel like if you can't do a particular exercise to your desired standard I would first then just evaluate that standard like why does that standard exist because if it's just kind of like an arbitrary constraint you're placing upon yourself due to a value system imparted on you from somebody else I don't know that that holds much water. Now if this if you can't in this case for example a squat if you you can't squat to anywhere near parallel without substantial variation in like your movement patterns so it's not repeatable without substantial difficulties having some sort of efficient movement pattern meaning like the bar path is all over the place for example you're losing balance or whatever and you can't develop any proficiency to mitigate those first two things the repeatability of the efficiency of the thing then I don't know that that movement is you know suitable for you I just call us the rep model of like exercise selection so is it repeatables it efficient right and then are you meeting the points of performance of that particular exercise whatever you decide them you know determine them to be so in this case I think this guy can probably squat if the twist was so bad again that it was not repeatable really sacrificing a ton of efficiency and he couldn't like you know if the twist was like throwing him forward onto his toes under heavier loads and that might be present a little more of an issue sure sure yeah and in that case I would move to a different training exercise to train the lower extremities if you can trap our deadlift sure if you can pull normally those are to you know ton of different movement patterns that would be fine leg press if you could split squat if you can do a higher box squat I mean you know there's so many different options a belt squat for example might be easier because you get to sit back a little further depending on the apparatus but effectively like at the end of the day you're trying to train the major muscle groups multiple times per week through ranges of motion that are useful and I know that what does that mean what does useful well it depends on what's your training for if you're trying to for a very specific sport athletic you know competition then the useful ranges of motion are kind of defined for you same thing with like movement velocities are like you know narrow down for you if you're just training for life or to be healthy well the world is your oyster you can pick a bunch of different exercise a bunch of different ranges of motion and so you want to train the major muscle groups multiple times per week through you know different ranges of motion likely and and different movement patterns and you know it's intentionally vague that way because it just depends what you want to do yeah I'm going to come at this maybe a little bit differently I think it's it's wise to look at this and say um what is the what is the standard that you're aiming to to meet with this movement I agree determining is the issue here that you're struggling to achieve depth because you want to go compete and meet sure well in that case how that you want to compete and meet if you want to compete and meet real bad then you need to make some other accommodations in your movement because you don't have the option to not squat to certain depth in your right and so if it's that important to you then we need to think about what are the potential interventions that we that we can use here right so one would be if we are very very confident that this restriction is due to this ankle spur which may not be sure you know it may it maybe one of those things where you experience some discomfort and we went looking we took a picture we found this thing we blamed it we do that all the time with back pain and other things but if we're fairly convinced that it's related to this um obviously that's more of an anatomic kind of structural limitation right so we say I don't care I want to find a way to squat to depth and meet well the first thing is it seems like he can squat with a vertical shin so that means you can probably take his stance pretty wide it goes out he can do like west side style you know pretty pretty vertical shin squat and that may just need to be his style given that limitation another option might be go and find the weightlifting shoes with the highest effective heel height so I think they're like the edetus lifestyles or something like that have a full like one inch heel height and then that you see how much you can get out of that in terms of that elevation in the heel may give you you know an extra inch of forward knee travel um uh in a squat or some combination maybe use both those heels and a wide stance squat and you may be able to do just fine with that if none of those things are getting you to where you want to be and you still say I insist I need to be able to squat well then you need to address the thing directly and if we're very convinced that it's there then shit go get surgery you cut the thing out you know um those are kind of the ways that I'd be looking at this is how can I modify the exercise of this and equipment that that I can use like the like the heel height with the shoes to to help me get there or do I need to go in an intervene on this thing and all of that is couched in I must be able to squat to a particular depth that I cannot otherwise do right now if comp competitive goals you know certain uh uh uh depth standards are not really in the picture then yeah I wouldn't get too concerned about this just based on the slight twist alone that doesn't spook me I used to twist actually a fair amount of my squat I'm working on that and in your garage years ago um but uh that wouldn't that wouldn't worry me um compared to compared to the other stuff yeah if the ex like I said if the technique is repeatable someone efficient and it's meaning all the points of performance that you have for that particular movement pattern the rep models if you I'm cool with it and if you happen to twist that's fine yeah and for talking about the from like a health promoting standpoint like all the stuff just went out the window I have zero of the service about that my I'm more concerned about your progression loading programming etc this exercise being inherently dangerous so what I'm doing yeah cool

=== FILE: How-To Warm-Up For Deadlifts [BbRJTET9ZsA].txt ===

Alright, so this is the Barbell Medicine Deadlift Forma from a Deadlift workout that Dr. Austin Baraki and I did not too long ago. So Austin's getting ready for deficit deadlifts. I'm getting ready for tempo deadlifts, but we're both going to start with empty barbell deadlifts. This is kind of like a Romanian deadlift, which typically starts at the top and you trace the bar down your legs to a little bit below the kneecap. Usually a few inches. I'd like to think of these as extended range of motion RDLs. You're going to go a little bit further to where the barbell would start if it had plates on it. Now, it typically recommend 2 to 6 sets of 5-8 reps. The idea is you're trying to actually make the muscle warmer and increase the temperature and also get mentally prepared for the task at hand, which in this case is deadlifting. So some external cues that I like is to feel the steel of the barbell, drag the bar up and down the legs, keep it in context. You should feel the steel. And some internal cues that I like are to initiate the movement downwards by pushing the hips back and then also do stand tall at the top. We're not paying much attention here to what the back is doing. Am I in flexion? Am I in extension? Is this quote unquote neutral spine? The reality of it is no matter how you set up, no matter how you deadlift, the spine is going to actively flex when the bar leaves the floor. Now, if you have a lot of flexion or a lot of other spinal movement or some other technique that you'd like to correct to improve efficiency, you can work on those during the empty barbell sets. And then also, obviously, as you're warming up, your work sets should be just C bar, lift bar, because at that point your technique should be relatively dialed for that day. So we did a few sets, about three sets with the empty barbell and go straight to 135. And you can see myself doing tempo work. So I deadlift the weight and set it down under control, because I'm trying to extend the eccentric portion of the lift for this tempo deadlift. Austin is going to switch to deficit poles. So he's using two mats here to space himself up on the ground and crease their engine motion. And you can see he is an active spinal flexion. And we'll discuss that a little bit later, but this isn't really a problem. If you don't make it to the end of the video, he's just actively trying to adapt to that to make a spine more resilient. Now Austin's best pole is 720 pounds, my best pole is 738 pounds. So we typically take plate jumps all the way up to either the midfives or even up to 600 or higher just depends on the day. So we went right to 225. I'm doing doubles. Austin's actually going to work up to a heavy single, but at this point he's still doing reps to try to get warm. So that was 225. This is 315. And again, I'm personally and working on controlling the eccentric. That's the lift for the day. And I'm using those same external cues dragging them all up and down my legs, keeping in contact, feeling the steel. And then initiating the movement downwards, if I push my hips back. Now since Austin is doing a normal tempo, so not extending the eccentric, you can see his lifting velocity is much faster on the eccentric. And I'm still trying to actually move the weight concentrically as quickly as possible. So that's one thing. We really try to coach folks is during the concentric. So on the upwards phase of the deadlift, the upwards phase of the squat, upwards phase of the bench press, or press, trying to move the weight as quickly as possible, obviously while retaining control of the barbell. So again, we jumped from 135 to 225 to 315 to 405 now for 95. Still not using the belt. Austin's actually going to stay beltless during this whole session. Me, I typically don't put my belt on until I get into the mid-fives or over 600 again. It just depends on the jumps I'm taking that day. This is 565. Nice little pull. There, this is 585. And again, extending the eccentric, trying to set the bar down very slowly. And typically, my second rep ends up being slower on the way down because I kind of get into the groove, but we're only doing doubles here. So we'll try to clean up that first rep. Now this is 600 pounds. This is Austin's top single, I believe, from the day. Again, beltless, off a deficit. And yeah, he was in some spinal flexion, but you can tolerate it just fine. And this is my top set, 660, first set of two. Again, trying to move away as quickly as possible during the concentric, even though I know I have to slow it down on the way down. So not as easy to do when you know you have to go slow. So the first rep was probably a little too fast for my preferences on a tempo deadlift, but now I get to go real slow. And that's pretty much our deadlift workout and warm up. Six, six, seven, seven, seven. What's going on? So we basically just did our little deadlift warm up. What we did to deadlift workout. Whole things, basically the same. What are you thinking about when you're warming up on a deadlift? Uh, not really a whole lot to the honest. Right. I mean, I think we've both been deadlifting long enough that it doesn't take a lot of active thought. I think that one thing I do pay attention to, basically from the empty bar on up, is basically like outfields in my hands. Basically at a point where I can kind of get a feel for am I strong today or not as strong today based on how heavy a certain weight feels. Yeah, sure like the velocity of which a reference weight kind of moves probably. But even like when I pick up the empty bar to warm up, if I'm having like a day where I'm like super beat down and very tired, can kind of tell the bar feel a little bit heavier. I don't necessarily base a conclusion on that and say it's going to be a bad day, but I do take that into account and say, I need to pay attention to how 70 kilos, 120 kilos, whatever each jump that I take, how it feels in terms of. Because it heavier than this normal feels, it's lighter than this one with feels, it's about right. And then that helps me kind of calibrate and narrow down my ultimate weight selection for my top. Yeah. Yeah, I don't want people to percevereate like on the, how does the weight feel like what am I going to do? But yeah, you're just using it the whole way up to kind of figure out like to converge upon your working sets for the day. Yeah, and it's something that I don't necessarily put a ton of active thought into. It's just something that I like can ignore. So I'm not thinking about my technique at this point anymore. It just kind of happens. I'm like, oh, you know, things feel really fast today. And when it feels light, I definitely like hype that up in my own mind. And when it feels not great, I'm like, let's see how the next jump feels. Yeah, so I kind of play a little confirmation by myself. You need a direction. Just to give myself the best shot on that day of having a good session. Are you worried about your back flexing during a warm up? Because you're not as mobile as you would after some, you know, I'm not. I know my back is flexing all the time. Regardless, whether it looks flat or not. And yeah, it's not really huge. I'd rather I'd rather a dad to decent degree of spinal flexion. So it's more resilient. I can tolerate that position better, even under heavier loads, which it does. Yeah, I would also for beginners. I would make a stronger case for them doing less warmups. Because they're more easily fatigable than trained lifters. So if they did a bunch of extra stuff, they'd probably be worse under the barbell. Just because warm up volume counts as training volume. Yeah. So there's something coming from that. I see it's got where the rain is covered on the run. I see it trembling all too.

=== FILE: Hypertrophy for Strength Athletes [INHi9m-zWMY].txt ===

All right, related does a strength athlete ever achieve enough hypertrophy? Is there a point in the athletes development whether there is no longer a need to make the muscle larger and only to make them stronger? It's a complicated question. So enough hypertrophy. I mean, that's like saying, you know, you ever get jacked enough. You ever make too much money? I mean, I don't know that you can say yes to that. So as far as in an athletes development where they no longer need to make the muscles larger and only need to make them stronger, that assumes that these happen independently. And I don't know that I view them as like two independent processes. I think that the amount of muscle mass increase that occurs, that co-ocurs with strength increase particularly at high level strength athletes is much smaller than when a occurs in like physique athletes, bodybuilders, et cetera, who are primarily just training for size increases and not at all for strength increases. But I think that there's still some hypertrophy occurring nonetheless even if it's relatively small. Now that being said, the actual hypertrophy process is rather complicated as far as like does the myophibrular hypertrophy just the contractile protein? Is that precede some of the sarcoplasma hypertrophy which tends to create a more substantial increase in muscle cross-sectional area or does the one, you know, precede the other. That stuff's still being assessed out. And so this is still an active area of research. But for from a practical standpoint, I think trying to get as jacked as possible using what while still doing the specific exercises, the specific for your sport and the correct intensity ranges to make them go up would be the goal. I don't ever think you say, I'm jacked enough. I'm going to cut the volume down. Yeah, this part last part of this question or it says there's no longer a need to make the muscles larger and only to make them stronger. I think that creates an kind of an artificial dichotomy or separation between those two things. When really, at least there's there is to be fair some debate in the research world about how much hypertrophy contributes to strength development and performance. But I tend to lean on the side and I think you probably do too that strength performance of a particular muscle, one of the contributing factors to that strength potential is muscle size. The other major contributor would be the neurological like the skill, the recruitment kind of aspect of it. And so you can't really say I don't need to make the muscle larger and only to make it stronger when muscle size is probably a contributor to muscle strength. And so I think that to the extent that you want to continue making your muscle stronger, you should strive to make them larger as well. And I don't think there's actually a way for you to aim to make them stronger without generating some amount of hypertrophy along the way in the process.

=== FILE: Is Bulking and Cutting a Good Strategy？ [B13p0KbQzC0].txt ===

Music Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum. We have Dr. Awesome Rocky in the studio live in the flesh. That's real. He's in town this week and we decided to answer some questions from the internet. This is for the old Misk forums from Bodybuilding.com. Is bulky and cutting the best method for long-term hypertrophy? I just don't know how you're going to get around it. Is the deal. So when you go look at actual scientific evidence on this in-body builders or people who identify as bodybuilders because not like they've all competed. Which is also weird like in the literature. They they they they they set out of flyer like are you a body builder you want to sign up for this study and it's like how do you make sure like show me your NPC that people will gain more lean body mass when they gain more weight. So the more weight you gain and to give in time frame they tend to gain more lean body mass. They also gain more fat mass during that time too. So and there's a huge inter-initual variation with how much lean body mass that people are going to gain and how much fat mass that people are going to gain too. So you know you could have even twins like groups of twins fed the same amount of calorie surplus and one group of twins that are identical are going to gain way more lean body mass compared to the other group of twins. If you want to get bigger and gain more muscle mass I don't see a way around like you're going to have to go into a calorie surplus at some point and then likely you're going to have to go two periods of time where you're reducing fat mass as far as what's the best like stair step model versus like a you know bulk then cut and then maintenance. I don't know that I have hard feelings on that. I do tend to prefer having weight stabilization periods at every step of the game. So when people gain weight they gain a significant amount of muscle mass. I want them to like maintain that weight and then when people lose weight, lose body fat. I want them to maintain that little weight. This weight stabilization period for a couple of weeks before they you know do anything with their calories. You might set yourself up for failure if you do not have these weight stabilization phase. Particularly after weight loss people are like I just lost weight. I'm prime. I'm super animal. I'm going to gain all the lean body mass quickly and it's like actually the biggest signal that your body has physiologically is to restore fat mass. Like so yeah you're the most animal I can ever be but for fat mass not for muscle. Not the cool kind. Not the cool kind. Yeah. So that's the approach I tend to do with the understanding that gaining a lot of lean body mass is going to take a long time. It should be a slow process. That's why like when people like how much of a surplus do I need to be and I'm like it's got small 250 calories, maybe 500 calories and then it's going to take up long time for you to do this anyway and gaining weight rapidly is a good way to gain a lot of fat mass rapidly unless you have great genetics. Right. So and gaining fat mass rapidly is probably not the move, particularly from a health standpoint. So yeah I don't know what the best method is for long term hyper-feet if it's like again just cycling but bulking and cutting but I do like the weight stabilization phases and I like making sure that people are the good candidates for either goal. So if you're already carrying too much fat mass is the bulk. Right. Yeah if your BMI is 30 year above, do not pass go, do not collect $100. Don't bulk. If your weights are conference is approaching that sort of cut point where you have an increased rate of obesity related diseases which there's a specific to your ethnicity. It's about 37 inches for guys for example. Do not don't bulk and in fact you probably should lose weight then probably better. Anything else you want to add to that? Yeah I agree with the fact that with the idea that you're probably not going to be able to get around it I think that there's similarly there to the extent that there may even be a best way to go about it. Right. It is probably going to vary between people like the super freaky genetic people. There may be a better strategy for them and then for people at the other end you know might be in the other direction. The problem is that like you said this is a very very long process and so we don't have any trials comparing bulking cutting group to like people who just steadily maintain like a hundred to 200 calorie surplus for like decades and see who gets more jacked like 20 years later. So we can't necessarily know or predict that but life is going to you know probably like in I've never deliberately like aggressively bulked or cut I have like gradually gained weight primarily for strength performance not necessarily with any hypertrophy you know goals myself but then like you know hospital work gets tough and I unintentionally cut because shit happens and so I've kind of effectively ended up in that situation just as a result of life but yeah it's all I've had. Yeah like that.

=== FILE: Is Training To Failure A Good Idea？ [6OwaUlX4Qic].txt ===

Hi there, any general guidelines for training with RPE, particularly in regards to how often and what context RP-10 can be considered a productive training stress? As far as are any guidelines, I'm not aware of any practice guidelines for RP-10s when he's RP-9 when he's RP-8. As far as my general recommendation, my assault based on coaching and using RP-E to communicate how hard things should be with people for, oh, I don't know, a better part of the last six years, almost exclusively. I rarely program RP-10s outside of a testing situation or meet situation because I just don't think it's worth it. Meaning that I don't think that the fatigue is worth the potential stimulus that you get out of that. I think that most efforts should be somewhere in that RPE 6 to 8 range in general. That doesn't mean you never go to 9 or you never do a set at 5, but it just means in most of the sets I think should be RP-6 to 8, and that's as far as a general guideline. That's as close as I can get. The rep schemes can obviously vary across that, but I don't know that I just spend too much time working well below RP-6 or well above RP-8. Maybe here and there, but not yet a lot. Yeah, I tend to agree. I think that hopefully what you guys took away from the programming lecture is we're aiming to deliver a stimulus to the individual to elicit a response. The weight we put on the bar is exclusively selected as a strategy to get a particular response out of somebody. One metric of that internal load, that response that we're looking for is RPE. I don't know that I really almost ever in a training context want to elicit a 10 out of 10 situation, because the closer you get to that 10 out of 10 effort, you may be getting incrementally greater stimulus, but I think the rate that the fatigue cost goes up way faster. Unless there is some particular reason why the performance on that set in that session matters a lot, which I can't really think of too many situations without the case, then it's probably not worth the cost. I mean, there are some, sometimes where you're just going for some arbitrary PR because you want to. Like I can think of the time, the first, when I last fall, I squatted 500 for 10. I thought you were going to say two days ago. No. No. But that time, I was only supposed to squat it for 8, and I squatted it for 8, and I was like, I think I got 10, and 10 would just be cool to do, so I'm just going to do this. But I would not program that ahead of time to say, I'm going to go to 10 today because I think that this is a valuable training stress. That was an excessive amount of fatigue generated from that session, and I wouldn't say I would regret doing it, but I wouldn't have programmed it ahead of time. You could make a case for going closer to failure on isolation type movements that has been discussed. Still don't think that you need to go to 10. But when you're talking about general guidelines for training with RPE, I think that we can get a reasonably good training stimulus staying further away from failure on our compound movements along with specific practice for your task, like single at 7, single at 8, double at 7, double at 8, et cetera. But for isolation stuff, you can go closer to failure because in general, this systemic fatigue you're going to get out of it, right? Taking your tricep press downs to failure or something like whatever. It's not going to be that big of a deal. Thought is that if you let people go to failure to RPE 10, that helps them calibrate their RPE scale. I know that it is unargument. I just think it's relatively weak because I don't necessarily care how accurate the RPE rating is. Just as long as you're using the same scale each time, so the precision is still high. But you know, that is unargument. Sure. Okay. Yep.

=== FILE: January 2021 Virtual Pain and Rehab Seminar Q⧸A [H4exGLpZ-GQ].txt ===

Well obviously thank you guys for attending this weekend for our first virtual Barbell Medicine Pain and Rehab seminar. Hopefully it's been beneficial for you guys and you've got a lot out of it. I've enjoyed talking to each of you that have commented and submitted questions throughout this weekend and then now we're going to do our kind of traditional Q&A that we do at the end of all of our seminars. Obviously just virtual at this point. So we've curated some questions from folks throughout the weekend. I'm going to go through each of these and do our best to answer them. I don't mind all narrate this. Derek and then we'll bounce around answers for these questions. The first one comes from Sean. What are your thoughts on programming for Rehab? And we're going to have this as kind of a broad context I take it and then I can expand on it afterwards. I think we are by and large severely underdosing. A lot of our athletes in Rehab and I use that in the general like just broad strokes rehabilitation term. I think we are missing the boat by not having our athletes at least try and get as much exposure to overall conditioning as they possibly could to reap the benefits of it. And this could be just accepting that there are other ways to train other than just what the athlete is currently doing. And specific to the talks, we've been through this weekend. Having athletes that have exposed ACL reconstruction in the gym more than just twice a week doing low-intensity state cardio or doing some basic fundamental movement drills and starting to resistance train. I think increases their overall capacity for athleticism which really should be our goal. Now, on the other side of this spectrum, if we're taking it into visual who's not meeting physical activity guidelines, the real game with programming there is finding where to start and what they are willing to do. The type of exercise, the specific sets and reps do not matter nearly as much as just advocating that they do something. We are likely missing the boat a little bit as rehabilitation professionals by trying to paint or paint individuals into a corner and advocating they do a specific type of exercise instead of just finding out what they want to do, what they are willing to do in the and trying to increase capacity from there. Yeah, I think it's pretty good. Brought to review, I don't have a ton to add. Just meeting people where they're at, seeing what they're currently dealing with, what are they trying to build back toward as they accomplish, so goal-sutting and then dosing an activity appropriately over time. And then hopefully progressing it as Derek was talking about, I think that's one of the unfortunate things that happen to rehab is we just remain under dosage a lot of times and we don't progress people. So there's nothing wrong in my book with three sets of 10 of some type of movement, but how do we progress that over time for those that need it and so having some type of like building blocks to work with or basic training foundational principles like specific facility, progressive loading, realizing that we need to make individual variations and differences for folks specific to their needs and demands over time. And this realizing like what is the population that you're working with is this someone that's a clinical general population that we do just need to get active and start doing small kind of changes and behavior throughout time to help with their experience or these athletes that were trying to get back to the field and having some type of his term to support criteria would be necessary in that process. So I think those are kind of the big things that we struggle with as far as just dosage activity being appropriately given to the person that we're working with. The secondary aspect of that could you talk a bit about clients that have had really negative experiences with medical practitioners not listening to them and who have lost faith in their chances of getting better and the medical establishment's ability to help them in general given what we know about patient expectations and packing outcomes is a necessary to convince them that they can get better for them to get better. And if so what can be done to change their minds about the potential outcome. So kind of two questions there. How do you help individuals who are dealing with maybe some not so great interactions throughout the medical system and then also how do we work with their expectations? I think we can't underestimate the power of the phrase, well that sucks. You need to acknowledge that they've had a bad experience and I've certainly had plenty of patients who have been told things by practitioners that I would consider not good advice. And it is establishing that new relationship and being able to communicate with people and understand where they're at is an integral part of just the human experience if not a rehabilitation professionals job. We're all going to have those negative experiences. I've certainly been told things from individuals that have impacted me in a negative way. But it is that acknowledgement that there is hope. Now I don't think that you have to expect to get better first in order to get better. I think that's a little bit of a cyclic phenomenon in that you can start the process with the very expectations. But if you start seeing you can do more than you thought you could do prior, then that starts doing flincherexpictations. Whereas if you come in with the expectation that you're going to have progress, that probably makes it a little bit easier. But each person's path is unique to them. And this kind of gets back at the big theme of how many different ways can I get a message across. So I may be saying the same thing. For example, hey, you need to be more active. But I don't think anyone has ever been more active from just being told they need to be more active. If only it were as simple as telling our significant other, they need to calm down and that would get them to calm down. It's how do I address this issue in front of me. And sometimes you can face it head on. Sometimes you need to take our around about way. And especially if there's been some negative expectations in the past or especially negative messaging, sometimes we really need to circumvent the problem. We need to work around it instead of working through it. That way the individual who's been told these negative things can really gain perspective on why what they were told is wrong. Yeah, I think it's great. I don't have anything to add to that. Thoughts on how to increase participation, compliance and accessibility for youth resistance training. I'll kick that to you there. Normalize it. And that really is the biggest thing. I think we have to hit critical mass in individual seeing that is safe to train, that is effective for over-isletic performance. That young individuals can put weight on the bar and see progress. And I will even caveat this further. If there is one component where we really need to increase participation is with our young female athletes. We need to be the biggest advocates we can to get them in the gym, comfortable lifting weights, and seeing that they can get stronger. Now how do we do this? One, you start with one individual. This is going to be a movement that builds from small numbers, just like many other things. If we start getting some athletes, especially young female athletes in the gym, they start squatting, they start deadlifting, they start resistance training. And then those start to manifest as results in the field, I think it eventually takes care of itself. But if we're trying to start a movement, I think sometimes trying to cast a really wide net of just messaging across the board may not be the best way. But if we can get one person in the gym, then we can start getting two people in the gym. And then three, and then five, before we know we have our own Fibonacci sequence of people in the gym lifting. And that is how we do it. Like that. Fibonacci sequence of folks in the gym. It's good. That could be a teacher. In regards to exercise prescription, do you see any role for rehab exercises or a more specific loading of a body part, or would you rather go about selecting activities that might be aligned with the patient's goals, and things that may have difficulties within daily tasks and work on these gradually. If we would give a more specific exercise for a given body part, does any value in that in that part from just doing the same thing, doing something that is rather nothing. So I think it depends on case context and the person that I'm working with. Some folks, I probably don't want them to be the view in what we're doing is just like rehab. And so I'm okay with trying to get them to view it as still training. Other folks, I worry about pushing the envelope too much too soon. And I kind of wanted them to look at this as like a rehabilitative process where they're not ready to go back to sport. So I think it really depends on the mindset of the person I'm working with, but also than the case. When it comes to like specific exercises, like the kind of things that I see big advocacy forward would be like post-op scenarios, as well as like acute muscle injury cases, stuff like that, then I definitely think there needs to be specific what we think of as rehab exercises. I can think of like several post-op shoulder cases I've worked with where yeah, for several weeks, it's like how do we get back active range of motion while we're respecting the physiological healing process of what happened in the surgery. And so that's going through those very basic kind of fundamental steps of returning range of motion, active assisted, and then active unloaded ranges. And then as we get that back progressing into more loading based. And then if it's an athlete's sports specific base, it's kind of is going to this very methodical rehabilitative process. Other people, if I'm dealing with like persistent load back pain cases, I may want them to see is this is like, yeah, this is resistance training. This is getting you active. This is loading your body. This is a cool thing to do. You don't need to be like in rehab in that context. So I think it depends on the mentality of the individual I'm working with, the case context as far as like how I'm going to talk to them about what they're doing and then whether I'm going to give specific exercises. I'm a fan of getting someone to load a specific area that's symptomatic, potentially playing off of placebo like contextual effects and also just giving them confidence in loading that area, especially if they have a propensity of wanting to offload the area. Yeah, I think there's a little bit of a conversation here about want versus need and individuals with more what I would consider general pain presentations. There I'm going to have a lot more discussions about what they want to do and there it may be accommodating what their desires are. However, if you're coming into my clinic with a hamstring injury, we're going to do some very specific exercises. And there are objective goals or much more clear to find. If you're coming in status post and ACL reconstruction, you can want to do sports all day long, but we need to make sure that your quadriceps strength is up to the standards that it needs to be. There were likely going to be doing very specific rehab exercises. It is case specific, but I think to muddy the water a little bit, often in the acute phase, if we're going to classify an injury as such, there are very specific quote unquote rehab exercises that are often beneficial, whereas if it is more towards the chronic side of things, then it is a little bit more of a discussion about meeting the individual where they're at and finding what their goals are and what we can do to get started. Okay, I think that's, yeah, it's all of that one. The question is regarding the discussion I'm moving away from body region silos for management of muscle skeletal pain. I also think that's as a sign of a great, I think it was an editorial to go read for folks if you've not read it. Based on your experience in practice, how many individuals need a more structured rehabilitation program in the context or reducing pain and disability? Would that be sufficient enough for us there are need for more structured, specific program? Yeah, and that kind of goes hand in hand with what we were just talking about with the prior question. I think it just depends. Some people, we generally just need to get back to life activities and function and like encouragement and then other people need a much more rigid structured plan to implement to get them to where they want to be able to go back and do some type of specific activity. Yeah, I think here, this is a really hard thing for a lot of rehabilitation professionals because we want to give this very structured plan. And I can tell you, I have this discussion with parents a lot when I see adolescent athletes that are just not meeting physical activity guidelines. They want a very set regimented recipe to get their child better and it really is, they just need to be active. And here, I don't think a really structured rehabilitation program is warranted. It's just, you need to do more than what you're currently doing and you need to find things that you enjoy doing. I think sometimes we get a little bit overly driven towards this conversation around specificity and we forget that there are hundreds of thousands if not infinite ways of moving and all of which can essentially be an exercise. And what works for you and what you enjoy doing is not what I enjoy doing. And more than anything, it's not about me applying my definition of normal to you. It's about facilitating everyone in front of us finding their own normal. And if that's the case, I may not need to put very strict constraints on what we're doing as far as a structured or specific program. Yeah. I think having people autonomy and flexibility and programming is a pretty big part of this discussion. Like, feeling as though they can make changes that need to or life got crazy and they missed a session. And I forget what lecture I talked about this on. But rarely am I like, yeah, you need to double up on Saturday and make all that up. Like, no, like, there's probably another session of coming for training. And we see that even with like, behavior change, specific. There was one study I referenced in the low back pain discussion on looking at facilitators and barriers to implementing physical activity for those dealing with persistent low back pain. And it's like one of the biggest things to read about because I did a qualitative analysis of as well and interviewed the folks that were in that. And it's about them filling as though like there's these very specific, forensic recommendations from the rehabilitation clinician of these specific exercises that have to be done on these specific days. And they were like, I just don't feel like I can meet these expectations being placed on me or they gave me exercises that I don't even have equipment access to that. So I think having flexibility and their ability to see like, oh, this happened in my day. You know, can I pivot to do something differently that might not meet those like very strict guidelines that were given to me? And then it would be helpful in the long-grain to help with adherence for physical activity. You mean everyone doesn't have red toe straps swinging from their ceilings that they can do, you know, plank walk out, swallow one leg is abducted to exactly 28 degrees. Right. I mean, I would be shocked if that's what was recommended by some people to some people. Yeah. It even gets that like the idea of like what you were saying with specificity. I think what goes with that is people are like, oh, I have to do these three specific exercises. It's like exercises to get myself out of pain. And I've seen this numerous time in Barbama medicine consults where they think like that's add and finish them. Like I can never take away these activities because if I do, my low back pain is going to come back, which also isn't a good place to put someone in. Yeah. I think that is a great point to break up or bring up. I have had many athletes come in for consultation who have been told by a prior clinician that they need to do this certain set of exercises. And I just had one last week who had probably 25 exercises that she was doing three times a week because the clinician said that's what she needed to do in order to say healthy. And it is an interesting conversation of will have you try doing less. And I think too often in the rehab context, we want this one to one ratio of one problem one solution when we can probably address the problem. Probably address or check multiple boxes with a more broad frame approach. Yeah, that's tough. Difficult conversations. The body region silo thing. I think it sounds great on paper. I question the ability to implement that in our current healthcare system. I don't see a skinning rid of patient presents with low back pain, patient presents with shoulder pain. I think because we're always going to be in a position as clinicians of trying to roll things out that may potentially not turn out so well for us if we didn't roll them out. And so although I like the sound of you know removing these body silos. I think in our current healthcare system it's unlikely doesn't mean it's impossible. It's just as hard for me to see how we implement that right now. Jacob asks in the context of load management for multi directional athletes with activity related pain. Any strategies for finding areas we can dial back while keeping participation high. This is going to be context dependent and it really does come down to what the athlete can tolerate. I think a good coach or a good rehabilitation professional is going to find those activities that an athlete can do. And this really goes back to that thinking outside the box conversation. And we want this cookbook recipe. Let's do it this way. But you have to let an athlete explore their environment and see what they can do with minimal symptoms. And I think trying to quantify jumps or quantify maximal effort. You know things like RPE do come in handy here because you know if we're doing a desaleration drill okay why want you to cut at 70% in athletes will start kind of self governing there. But it also is finding different drills they can do to change direction. I think one of the more important things you can start doing is structuring how much they can move a lot of times if I'm doing like a reactive ball drill where we're trying to move. And I think I'm going to move forward backwards to the side. In the beginning I'll start out in like 10 square feet. As they start making progress we'll move it out to 15 square feet and the goal is to be able to get it wide enough to where they are getting up to full speed doing these drills. But you can put these constraints on the environment where they're having to move in smaller spaces to where likely the forces they're experiencing are not going to be as high. So it's on the recent term of moosey plastic that's all you buddy you don't come on. I mean yeah I have a lot of thoughts it's a word that the international association for the study of pain is put out there has another descriptor word for someone's experience trying to give a label. I mean, it is like the official definition from the ISP you can go to the website look it up is that no seoplastic pain is pain that arises from altered no seception despite no clear evidence of actual or threat and tissue damage causing the activation of peripheral no seceptors or evidence for disease or lesion of the somatosensory system causing that pain. And so instead of it being no seceptive or neuropathic we've added this additional term of no seoplastic. I don't think that it moves the needle forward and management I don't think that it's very meaningful at this time at least it's not been demonstrated. And so I don't really know that it gets this anywhere I think my further concern is just like applying labels in this kind of broad stroke fashion that doesn't actually add any meaning or further understanding to the discussion of why the individual in front of you is having pain. And in fact my concern is people with just being like yeah you have no seoplastic pain don't really know that that gets us anywhere and it's similar to the conversation we had over the weekend of your catastrophizer like I wouldn't say that to someone and I don't think it's beneficial or useful and I wouldn't want to hear someone I'm working with say to me they think they're a catastrophizer because I'd be like just we need to stop and kind of reframe this discussion and move ourselves away from that type of label. So yeah, I don't think there's any reason to believe that it's a necessary label and I don't think that there's any reason to believe at this time that it's going to do anything differently from a clinical practice standpoint. There's also a discussion that likely needs to be had at some point about the differences between experimentally induced. No seception which could be then rated as painful non-paying full discomforts on a so forth versus lived experiences dealing with those who are having pain and daily living. And I'm not one in the same and even though that's often how they're talked about and paying literature as far as like inducing of pain as well as like real life experience of pain on the real world so. Over the answers to your question I don't I just don't think it adds that much to the conversation. The next one says I mentioned something to the effect of I don't like explain pain. Okay, yeah, so we have a couple parts this is a longer question so a couple parts highlighted. This is a pain rehab seminar. I think it's useful to find out find what I can generalize out areas. What could we take from this weekend and apply to oh, is that the same okay. Let's go with this what at that part out. This was a pain rehab seminar. I think it's useful to find out what I can generalize to other areas. What could we take away from this weekend and apply to quote unquote prehab. In addition to meet physical activity guidelines and be sure to include some strength training. Can we conceptualize pain as a okay soul stop there let's answer that first question there. You got it. Yeah, no, I just have a visor hatred of the world. And that's just me because it really is like well okay, let's just get prepared for life. As far as meet physical activity guidelines, make sure to include some strength training. If I'm going to go back to what I said a moment ago about just telling your significant other to calm down like I guarantee if I walked upstairs so that the camera she was mad I'd be sleep on the couch for the next few nights. It is more nuanced than that to use the boron S and parlant parlance like you have to have these conversations about what the individual is willing to do. And this gets back to being comfortable having the hard conversations and saying this is where we are. What can I do in order to position myself in the best case scenario to be successful. You know, there's a lot of this talk and training about we just need to go hard every day we're going to go to war and all these stupid analogies. But frankly, if you look at like you play those analogies out, there's a lot of preparation on all fronts. Like we need to make sure we're taking the steps to prepare ourselves to where it's not about going in and getting red faced and pulling as hard as we can every day it's. Did we set ourselves up with our stress management with our participation in physical activity guidelines with how we're allocating our time in order to have the best possible outcome. Like this is those things like I'm going to just keep reverting back to it. It is so simple. It's complex. People have difficulty with the basic principles because it is so simple and they feel that everything needs to be charged up. It doesn't we need to get good at our basic principles. We need to do the things that really are high yield for us even if they're a little on the boring side. Yeah, I was pondering this question a bit more. Is there anything we need to add to the National Physical Activity Guidelines is kind of interpreting this which I would say no generally speaking for folks who aren't sports specific athletes like we can't even get people to meet National Physical Activity Guidelines at this point in time. So that would probably be like and if you read the World Health Organization's recent guidelines that just came out last year. It's any activities better than none they've removed the 10 minute bouts recommendation for fear of people seeing 10 minutes and not wanting to engage activity. So now it's just get up and do something and hopes to start moving that needle forward because we continuously. If you look at healthy people over the decades, we aren't really moving the needle forward and I mean, for matter to get people active. I don't know why you're trying to add anything else when we can barely get people to do that. So I wouldn't worry about it and just as a relation to that like that is just card as far toward training me to week and resistance training twice a week. So we have a lot of information out on that topic so I wouldn't worry about adding more. I think as far as it relates to like a takeaway to our seminar that would help people out with that on their journey of physical activity and pull nice implementation is realize that like. Try to find something that you want to do from a point of enjoyment realize you're not always going to enjoy it, but overall hopefully you do it's probably going to feel hard sometimes that's okay. You may even feel sore which is where that kind of pain conversation comes in is this normal or not. And typically it's perfectly okay. I think that's probably like the big takeaways from the pain lectures or bits to that. There, do you think we can can conceptualize panes with the momitor away of indicating overall status a manifestation of total stress? No. It's way more complex than that. As we've talked about the entire weekend, pain doesn't equal to your damage pain in, I don't even like the alarm side of it. Just because I don't think it's a really good analogy out of it when we're talking about things like a muscle injury, we talk about the other side where you may feel really good but you're not ready to return to sport yet. So it goes both ways. A thermometer really implies that you know what's going on in the environment and I would say if anything where we suck at as rehab professionals is really talking about what's going on in the individuals environment. It's not about what their pain is, it's about what their external stress load is. Yeah, I think a lot of times we're just wanted to try to gain control over the situations. We're looking at ways to revert to a prior premise of pain equals tissue damage equals arm equals hurt. And if we can't reframe away from that foundational premise, then we're looking for a lot of ways to gain these like these metrics like a thermometer. And it doesn't pat out very well. The pain of the alarm actually comes up in just a second I think is a question. And a traumatic cases what is a useful narrative or metaphor they've used to help an uneducated patient start from square one understand what is happening. You want to go first, listen to me, don't me to. I don't know that I have very tangible general metaphors usually when I'm consulting with someone I try to find something that's relatable to them. So like what do they do for a living whether it's like an engineer or the mechanic or some other type of profession that I can make an analogy that would be relatable that's understandable for them. So I don't I'm not one of those clinicians that's like yeah, I always use this general metaphor. Unfortunately I'm curious to your response there. I agree that there is some specificity to it, but I do have one that I lean on a lot and what I'll talk to them about it is their shirt. When trying to explain the manifestation of symptoms that just come one out of the blue. And especially things that have kind of lingered around for a while my normal analogy is that we normally do not feel the shirt on our backs. Except for after I've said something like I just did and now it is impossible for everyone listening to this conversation to not feel the shirt on their back. And it is because we've now kind of devoted some attention to that and when symptoms linger around a lot of times. It is because we can't stop feeling the shirt on our back and a lot of what we do in rehab is really trying to wreck that focus elsewhere. Like whatever is there may still be there, but now we're not paying as much attention to it. Yeah, I like that unfortunately a motto is not on the call to like. Cheer is arms that pain and attention discussion you just said yeah he would love it. Okay, so there was been a couple of questions about like pain neuroscience education explained pain education on pain understandably still given my lecture on pain. I think we first have to because people like to do not like explaining pain to folks. I think we have to define what we mean by explain pain and I think that's super individualistic to the person in front of me. I don't like these kind of general templates that have come out to be like this is how you discuss pain these are the magical words you need to try to say to explain pain to folks. And what I worry about and the kind of more common climate these days with this discussion of explain pain is a very neuroscientric focus which has put us into a position that's no different than saying. My desk for low back pain it's in my muscles for low back pain now it's in my brain. That's always been time talking about all of these things is because when we look at models the whole point of transitioning away from biomedical was to minimize duality. And so then we expanded on that model to biosycus social to say here some other variables that can be influenced. If we're just saying pains and output of the brain and we're taking this very neuroscientic approach to it. Actually no different than the original model we tried to move ourselves away from my other concern is we're not also giving control back to people in the sense of what am I supposed to do turned out my brain. Putting out pain which I've literally had people say to me on consultation how to wait turned out my brain outputs I don't feel pain. And like that's not actually possible nor recommended or any of those things given. Pain is an acute experience if you're living in a society. That's what happens we have pain experiences my bigger concern is how do you respond to those situations in which we're having those experiences and I don't feel the need to tell them what pain is. I went to listen to what they think pain is and maybe we have some talking points if they say to me like I think every time I've been over and fill pain in my low back that means that my disk is slipping. I'm like I understand you may think that we may even talk about like where did that narrative come from and work through that but it doesn't mean that I default to this very neuroscienture kind of focus of explanation to someone that's my biggest concern. As we're too busy trying to tell them what their experiences first is listening to them tell us what their experience is and then figure out how we helped them make sense of their experience so I look at it more of a sense making process. That's individualistic versus a general template to say these are the neuroscientric components of someone experiencing pain. Yes, the brain is a part of having lived experiences. It's not the only part nor is it the primary focal point we need to pay attention to. If you go back to StoWolts quote that included my pain lecture he talks about that great great article I will warn you it's meant as a philosophy paper was published in the journal phenomenology if I recall correctly. Which phenomenology looks at lived first person experiences and understanding like existence and being being in time would be like one of the main books that you would look at for this type of stuff. And so like it may be heavy and deep but the point of like moving towards an active model is adding other layers we're trying to minimize hyper focusing on a single component. Hopefully that helps explain my position a little bit better. Pain is in alarm goes hand in hand with that I agree with what Derek said a second ago I don't use that metaphor I don't really agree with that metaphor for a lot of different reasons. I think sometimes in some situations there may be some fear and apprehension to engaging ones environment related to their pain experience. This one usually comes up with like the fear of audience behavioral model by land and I think loss or was actually like the original creator of that model. And I don't think that we can say that that's a broadly generalizable model in all situations. Which interesting is these discussions have been ongoing for a number of decades despite like the popularity of some narratives that are ongoing about how to talk about this stuff with patients. And so I have quote here pulled up because I had the benefit of like preemptively reading these questions ahead of time and this is from one of walls articles in 1979. And he says pain is taken not as not as a simple sensory experience signaling the existence of damage tissue the presence and intensity of pain is to poorly related to the degree of damage to be considered such a messenger. Pain is a poor protector against injury since it occurs far too late in the case of seven injury or a very slow damage to provide useful preventative measure. Instead is proposed that pain signals the existence of a body state where recovery and recuperation should be initiated. This places the word pain in the same class of words such as thirst and hunger which signal not only a body state but also signal the impending onset of a former behavior. Pain is a way of being in the world as Bork said it is specific to the individual's existence and I often look at as a call to action as an imperative. But it often to what wall is saying occurs way too late in those experiences is reflective in nature. And it's not going to alarm us to something impeding because you're reflecting on what's already happened typically in the scenarios. I would I highly recommend folks go read walls article is quoting on the relation of injury to pain the John Bonic Electra that's from 1979. Also highly recommend casser's paper which is on just titled the function of pain by casser c a s s e r. It will probably challenge some people's biases about like evolutionary adaptations of pain which is a common narrative that goes with pain is an alarm. I am far less confident in the narrative of evolutionary adaptation as an affordance than I was before I read that paper. I think it takes care of most of those questions. All right, so there's a few others that popped up so I'll switch over now because I think there are a few great questions here. Have you ever considered addressing stress your in air incontinence and athletes even though this is not a pain issue. It would be a rehab issue it exists in a lot of athletes and can be a deterrent to resist and strain especially women and new lifters in general. I've had a very hard time finding meaningful information that addresses this. In fact, I've recently had a urologist tell me the only thing that would help me is surgery and he would not do it unless I decided to stop lifting indefinitely. Well, I think right here we can go back to our negative messages that aren't really efficacious. I do have these conversations with athletes, especially my female athletes that are wanting to resist and strain. Not my area of expertise. I have sub-recommendations. I think reaching out to Merrill Apatu at the University of Florida does a lot of research in this is great. And then there's also Sandy Hilton in Chicago. Both of those individuals I cannot recommend highly enough when it comes to this topic and I certainly do not think you need to stop lifting. But there are individuals that are much better suited to have this conversation than I will ever be. Yeah, we really need to keep saying this and it would be nothing more than just like sending Merrill a message. We need to do a podcast on the topic with her because I trust her opinion on the topic. I defer all basically pelvic health questions to Merrill. She's an expert on it. She's phenomenal what she does. I cannot speak highly enough about her. And we certainly need to have her on a podcast. I think this was definitely teed up for me. What are your thoughts on the concept of physical literacy in relation to injury risk reduction specifically in regard to ACL tears? Do you feel the idea of higher levels of exposure, confidence and diversity in movement at a younger age would be correlated with lower injury rates? Yes, can I just stop there? Really, this gets at that principle of you need to be an athlete before you are a specific type of athlete. And we're talking about physical literacy. I always go back to this analogy. No parent would let their kid go back to or go to school to just go to math class early, so certainly hope not. Like we accept that in your education system, you need math, you need language arts, you need some type of humanities. However, we then turn around and say our kid needs to only play one sport. And it's not so much that the one sport does the damage. It's the fact that you've painted yourself into this very narrow window. Kids do need to know how to throw ball. They need to know how to kick. They need to know how to carry something. These are our fundamental skills that should be part of athletic development. And we really do need to facilitate those. I'll take it one step further. I think a lot of adults lose their physical literacy. And we need to go back and teach them to quote unquote. Read again. There's no reason that 30 year old shouldn't be able to throw ball or kick a ball or run a little bit. And it's not because we're getting older and we can't do things. It's because we're getting older and we don't do things. And we need to make sure we're keeping that literacy as we age. That's what I got. I don't have anything that any of them. Are there any last minute questions? Anything you guys want to talk about? It looks like Tony also asked a question about any guidelines on ACO rehab for those who went to conservative root. There's no surgery for a full tear of basically somebody looking to return to a level one sport at a recreational level. I don't know if you guys saw that one or not. I did not get eote. Would be my first recommendation. I've never seen anyone who I thought had too strong of a quad. I would do the Eric mayor reductionists thing here and say get your quad as far as strong as you can to where you can accept those loads. And then it also comes down to that participation practice play algorithm of starting out with what you can tolerate in sports specific and then making it progressively harder until before you know what you're actually doing the sport itself. But I can't overemphasize get yoked is the biggest guideline. Also need that as a t-shirt. It's it has a cooking with the he's in the episode just waiting to happen. I'm surprised I haven't done anything with egg yolks yet. I was about to yeah. You could do cocktail as well. Just another egg yolks egg whites. Yeah, that's true. It wouldn't fit. I don't know if you guys saw the one from Ingrid as well. What are your recommendations on evaluating local clinical partners for PT who would take more of a strength and conditioning approach versus the more prevalent passive modalities or subluxation model with higher practice athletic or academic base rehab facilities. So it's people. Yeah. It's this is one of those where it's funny because I feel like the conversation about specificity versus variety has come up in different flavors this weekend. And I think when it comes to building your networks variety is integral. I think most people on this talk would accept that the odds of finding a good clinician are not that high. Well, if our probability is low, then we need a lot of exposures in order to find the ones that matter. And if that's the case that I need to go out and meet a lot of people. And I meet I may meet 20 strength coaches that I don't deem worthy for every one. But for every one that I do meet that makes my life easier. I mean, my algorithm in life is essentially a yes no do you make my life easier. If yes, I want you around if no kick rocks. And the more people I can find that helped me along my journey. The easier every component of my life is. And I have some strength coaches that I trust to let in the world and back. And I think they're phenomenal what they do. I mean, one of them I met because I was helping a neighbor move a couch. It wasn't like I was out seeking strength coaches that day. Another was introduced to me in the Bay area because he was friends with the same physician who ended up training me. It wasn't like I was seeking these people out. We have to be willing to have that exposure and go meet people along the way. Yeah, I think that's the build a referral network and this has to take trust. And if you're going to trust someone, you got to get to know someone. So I think that's going to be the biggest aspect of that. And the ones that I have referrals with this point like we've worked well together for a number of years and we do trust one another and that's why it works. Yeah, I think it does go symbiotic in that like once you start building those relationships. You know when the other person is better off doing it than you are. And I think in terms of figuring out where your level of expertise is one of the things that really is a sign of a good clinician is knowing where your limits are. And I think too often we want to hold on and do more than where really our level of expertise is. But at that point it's not about our personal growth is about the athlete's growth. Like if I have their best interest in mine, I may put them with another coach, but I may still talk to that coach that way I can learn why they have the rationale to. Be at the tip of the spear in this return to sport program. Parker, I'm not touching that question. I missed it. How about Nathan's to go see that. That's a mic. That's. I would ask what you mean by education. What are people saying that's my biggest concern. You're not going to ask what he means by pain. I mean, I would love to if someone has an answer. I'm all ears. I would say that when I talk about education, my thought process is probably better phrase as communication. And when it comes to sense making it specific to the individual. And that's why I was using the example of if every time they go and been down to pick something up, they think they're slipping at this. And we can work through that narrative and discuss it. We're going to communicate with one another. But I'm not going to turn on the fire hydrant and blast them with information of things I think I know about pain. Another Derek classic for quad sets. Yeah, it's. Yeah, so I'm pretty notorious in the volume versus intensity conversation about just framing it of you haven't done enough. This is where I would say I probably channel my inner CT flutter. It's the. Okay, well, I'm not even going to tell you how many of these you need to do, but whenever you feel like you've done enough, just do 10 more and then you're almost there. So that's where Mira are trolling me. I think that's it. I agree. I don't want to answer that. Yeah. Once we stop the recording side of this, I'll happily answer that question that I'm not not doing that on a hot mic. It looks like one actually just popped up. In those scenarios about patients being afraid of flexion based on a narrative of slip this to use behavioral learning strategies to support the communication. Like have them been to over pick something up. Yeah, for sure, potentially. I mean some folks I can just say like, yeah, that's not really something we need to worry ourselves about. And they're just fine. Other folks going to need that little bit of guidance along the way where I get them bending over picking things up. The flexion conversations interesting because the easy educational component there as far as like communicating to them about what they think is ongoing in their spine is like. We actually have our spine moved dynamically throughout activities of day living all the time unbeknownst to us and then specifically and things like resistance training the spine is moving dynamically under load. In variable amounts, whether it looks completely quote unquote neutral to us or not. And so those are just talking points to be like, I understand you're worried about that. Did you know that we actually have the spine going through various types of movements or the area looks neutral to you or not. And so those are just kind of talking points with them. And then we can work through that and it'll be like usually what happens is that's counter to what they've heard and they're like, well, have you heard of what so and so said with this certification where they said I should do x y and z. We can talk through that stuff and make an individualistic to them. All right, so I'll do. Well, could you repeat the source of the philosophy quote yet earlier? Yeah, that's from still well in active approach to pain still unhartman. We actually did a podcast with them episode four. I want to say on the pain and rehab podcast for Barwell Medicine. So that would have been 2019 and then his papers in active approach to pain. Do you work in treatment programs or single session? It depends. I do one off console to both in my clinic and with Barwell medicine all the time. I love when I'm able to just have a conversation with someone provide reassurance, given them a game plan and they can go implement it without me. I think that's awesome. But there are folks who have to have consistent. Followed along guidance usually like post up cases. I see that's going to be in this serious aspect of the discussion and seeing them regularly in clinic. But outside of that's like it's very rare that all consistently have to work with someone that's a non trauma non post up case. I may do like two or three visits with them and then they start feeling more and more comfortable. My usual stance on this that I often say when people ask me like, How long is this going to take? I'm like, let me get out my magic April. I'm a figure this out because in a lot of scenarios you have no idea, especially in those non trauma non post up cases. We don't really have a solid grasp on how long the individual is going to take to get to where they're going to be. But I'm here for as long as they feel like they need me. Some cases that may reset the state to me saying to them, you don't need me and you need to go on and conquer the world without me. Other cases I may say like, we need to spend a little bit more time together, most likely based on what you're telling me. I think even here it kind of goes back to that networking conversation. And one of the most amazing parts of the area is being able to reach out and have conversations with coaches around the world. Just last week I had a consultation with a lady who had had a particular dislocation. And she was wanting to get back into training and been told a lot of frankly BS. And she was located in New York City. And I told her we went to the consultation I made my recommendations, but it really sounded like she needed someone just to watch her do things. Like she needed someone to sit there and take her through a jump program and show her it was going to be okay. Luckily I know a clinician that I trust in New York City. I was like, well, you could follow me for coaching and that would be one thing, but that's fine. You're going to be uploading videos. You would be much better off working with somebody who's going to be able to sit there and tell you everything's going to be okay. And take you through a progressive jumping program. It's money out of my pocket, but I would much rather that clinician be able to sit there and reassure her in real time than be making money off of that. Yeah, I think our specific remote work has a selection bias to it. There's definitely been cases, camera can attest us to it. I know that we have been like, I don't think this is going to be right fit for you, not because we didn't show us, though, we couldn't help them. But because just given what they needed, it would do way better working with someone, most likely in person. And we even try to find people locally if we can if we have contacts there. Just wondering about the implicit versus explicit beliefs that unless the person experiences the movement would it be difficult to facilitate a change? And if we can facilitate a change in a belief, I would say it depends on the person, you know, I have to have conversations with them and then leave the things that they are telling me. So I don't, I wouldn't feel comfortable saying every person I ever talk to can necessitate some type of consistent guidance with re-bulitative intervention. I think that's it. Yeah. Well, I will stop recording. I appreciate you guys attending this weekend. I'm so special for you. If you guys need anything, you want to talk about things further. You want references. You can always email us or emails are readily available out there. I think they're probably in the package you guys got as well. But thank you guys for taking the time to spend with us over this weekend. And I hope you have a good week upcoming. Thank you.

=== FILE: Live Q⧸A 3.17.2021： Interference Effect, Posture, Strength Decay, and More [9kEm03wHSqw].txt ===

Music Instagram Live, what's going on? It's Dr. Jordan Faganbaum, Barbell Medicine. It is the 17th of March. We're doing a surprise. Instagram Live here for about the next 30 minutes. While I'm, you know, making dinner. What we do here if you haven't joined us before, it's a Q&A session. I want to make sure that you guys know to ask me a question. So I'll just say ask me a question. Ideally, these questions are related to fitness, medicine, health, whatever, and are generally applicable. So it's like a very specific injury that you're having, a better place for that question. It might be the forum where you could just kind of explain your history. We could talk about it. So you can find that on thebarbell medicine.com website. Just join a forum and we have a pain and rehab forum. Specific. So that'll be useful there. Or you can ask your question on our Facebook group. But yeah, so we do here at Cell Live Q&A. Ask your question in the comment below and I'll try to get to it. If you're a returning viewer, thanks for coming back. Let's see. All right, next level Benson asks, how would someone ideally balance lifting and running without taking many days off? This question is interesting from a few different levels. So let's address first off the elephant in the room. Most people will kind of be afraid of mixing a lot of resistance training with a lot of endurance training because they're afraid of this interference effect. The adaptations that you're leaning from, the endurance training are going to impede or attenuate or otherwise interact with negatively the adaptations you're seeking from the resistance training. It's usually not so much that endurance folks are afraid of the adaptations from resistance training, impeding the adaptations they're selecting by engaging in a lot of endurance training. But that would be the same type of thing, the interference effect. Tens to only be problematic, meaning that it's actually decreasing the limitations that you're leaning from training when the volume of training is too high. The volume, actually to be more correct, the overall training stress from one or potentially both elements are too high. And so effectively you're just trying to keep your head above water and tolerate the training. You're not really able to make as good or as rapid improvement and realizing the adaptations that your training is sort of producing. So as far as where to cut that off, it really depends on the individual their training history and in particular what is their endurance training history, what is their resistance training training history. But my kind of rule of thumb here is for new individuals, people new to training, or people new to endurance training since we're Bartle Medicine. It's not like running medicine or like, you know, cardiovascular, endurance medicine. Most of the folks that we train, you know, work with have some experience with barbells or, you know, that's where they're starting. So that's self-selected population. So most of those folks, if they're trying to get into endurance training, and you know, we do program enough endurance work and aerobic work in their training to meet the current physical activity guidelines. That's one of our kind of staples. After that, it's just slowly increasing that volume. So, you know, three times a week, 30 minutes for steady state sort of cardio. That's kind of like that limit that I don't really like to go above or in a different specific work. Behavioral sort of physical activity that would fall on, you know, in the criteria for the physical activity guidelines like walking. I don't really count that. But, you know, if we're talking about actual like, oh, you're jogging, you're running, you're rowing, you're swimming, whatever. Three times a week, 30 minutes per time. That's kind of like that cap that I have on newer sort of trainees, they're relatively new to resistance training and they haven't done a lot of aerobic work before. That obviously goes out the window if people become more and more trained. So, how to program for this? Well, it just depends on what you're going to prioritize if anything. I don't know that you should necessarily have more days off or less days off because I don't know anything about your current program. Our endurance template, you know, uh, trains people four days a week and you have three, uh, or four dedicated, like endurance workouts that you can kind of split up. So, theoretically, you could train every day. Or you could take two days off a week or three days off a week if you're starting to pair some of the stuff together. It just really depends on your like training background, training history, your, the resources you have to training, uh, you know, do you have access to a gym, do you have access to, you know, various, different modes of aerobic activity and all of those sort of stuff. But I wouldn't really worry about the interference effect unless you're just doing way too much. And then, uh, you know, the second part of this is like, what do you really want to get out of your training? And then you get to kind of program around that. You know, Jordan, do you still recommend resistance training to patients who don't have immediate access to a home gym or a gym membership? I recommend resistance training to all adults, actually all individuals, um, based on current guidelines. Now, as far as what does that look like, it just depends on what the resources are. One of the biggest barriers to actually participating in physical activity is access. And so people are like, you know, no excuses, you make your own, you know, sort of path is like, well, if you don't have access, do to whatever, you know, situation that may not be your fault, even though you are responsible for that, uh, you know, that's kind of a hard line to toe. So, yeah, if people don't have access to any equipment at home, we have our at home, you know, how to exercise at home. They have free template there, free article, on how to do that. And I think that would help people meet or at least work towards meeting those current guidelines for resistance training. I obviously think external resistance, uh, is going to be useful for most folks, uh, make it easier for them to meet the current guidelines for resistance training. And for individuals who are, um, chiefly concerned with performance outcomes, particularly low velocity strength or even high velocity strength power, uh, and also muscular hypertrophy. I think having access to equipment is, you know, makes that a little bit easier, a little more efficient. Hey, Jordan, do you do your posture recommendations change for folks with osteoporosis? No, we don't have any general posture recommendations outside of that. There are many different postures that sort of, uh, you know, will work as far as like allowing an individual to participate in a full and complete life without excess risk of pain or injury. And that, uh, carries over to folks with osteoporosis or other muscular skeletal or as the Aussie say, muscular skeletal conditions. Thoughts on watching video on bar speed to determine RPE if you struggle with gauging it. I think that you should really try and, you know, use how the set felt with respect to exertion level. I mean, that's the whole point of RPE, uh, and rely heavily on that. And then allow the video and the velocity of the barbell in the video compared to previous performances to sort of fine tune it rather than the opposite be true. I don't, I think people, a lot of people expect that their RPE ratings like they're just they're going to be a wizard with it. It doesn't need to be very accurate. Right. It doesn't need to be, well, I rated this a seven. It has to be absolutely a seven. Whatever type of scale you're using. So you can use a reps and reserve scale. We're a seven means you have three reps left of the tank. You could have a different scale. Like if you're doing singles, for example, RPE seven should feel like an easy opener, uh, you know, or for some individuals, they might have a completely different scale. Right. RPE seven on a single might feel like the last warmup before an opener, if you're a competitive power lifter or it might feel like you have, you know, or you just have it, that's an easy effort. I mean, you can make this with the scale, whatever you want. It thing is it doesn't have to be accurate. It just needs to be precise. Meaning that you're using it and applying it the same way each time and the similar context. So I wouldn't worry about like, man, I'm just really bad at RPE. It's like it doesn't need to be perfect. There's air in there. That's fine as long as you're introducing the same or similar amounts of air each time. That's kind of the idea here. And then yeah, you can find to it with some bar speed. But I find that, you know, whichever way you're sort of we're leaning previously based on how the set felt and the the workout for the day, um, you're going to kind of trend and your personality type. You're going to kind of see the video and perceive it in a certain way. So if you're kind of person who's like who tends to overshoot stuff, you know, you're going to see the video and say, yeah, so look that thing moved quickly, right? And your friends are always going to say, yeah, yeah, I moved pretty pretty well. And you're going to add weight, maybe too much. Um, I don't know. And if you're the type of person who tends to undershoot stuff and be super conservative, uh, you're going to see just like, ah, it's kind of slowed down there a little bit. And so you're going to see what you want to see and I just don't know how much it adds unless you could objectively measure the velocity, meaning like, all right, this is how much the the bar is being displaced and here's how much time is being, you know, uh, has passed by so you actually get a number. So velocity trackers can be useful to kind of like, again, fine tune that, but I think you're the way it felt and how that correlates to whatever scale you're using should super seed any objective sort of data. Adam Johnson, thoughts on Greek yogurt as a protein source, I love it. I eat Greek yogurt nearly every day. Yeah, one of my staples. Uh, big fan, big fan of Greek yogurt. I thought it was a easy question. I have world, uh, amino acid profiles great, right? The protein to calorie sort of ratio is great for me. Um, and I think for most folks, particularly if you're using the low-fat or non-fat stuff, um, yeah, if you're lactose intolerant, probably not for you, but other than that, you know, or vegan or vegetarian folks who don't eat del consumed dairy. Otherwise, yeah, they could pretty good. Bel underscore beaver, aside from dietary patterns carried into adulthood is saturated fat consumption, a problem in children, can be, yeah, if it's very, very high. It's the same, same recommendations apply towards adults. I like you to free pass because you're younger. Um, yeah, high consumption of saturated fatty acids in a diet in general increased athoschorotic cardiovascular disease risk. Uh, in addition, and that dietary pattern is, yeah, there's a lot of inputs that go into the dietary patterns and eating environments and food environments that kind of stem from childhood. So, be really hard to tease all that stuff out, too. Do you believe that everyone has an optimum weight to make the most strength gains possible for them? No, I do not believe that. I think there's a range probably, but that range is likely wider than people think as far as being substantially lower and probably substantially higher. Uh, that being said, when you start layering on top of that, you know, health, uh, sort of, uh, you know, health outcomes, that range probably gets a little narrower. But I think people are associating a lot of like muscular size and amount of lean body mass with strength performance a little too closely for what the data actually sort of reflects, um, at this time. There are ways to make muscles bigger without making them necessarily stronger, particularly if the strength test is a low velocity, one rep max, um, sort of effort, there are ways to make muscles stronger without making them bigger. Uh, and I think that when you sort of understand that the relationship between muscular size and muscular strength probably isn't as strong, if it were being charitable that view, it's probably probably not as strong as, you know, we've been led to believe. Then you start to understand, yeah, there's probably this large range of body weights and body compositions where you can make really good strength gains and the strength improvements are going to depend on the test, like what strength improvements are you actually testing and then also the programming, the programming is going to be the biggest determinant of how strong you get. David Rodriguez 168, what's up Jordan, exclamation points. So it's what's up Jordan? Uh, how much muscle mass and strength loss can be expected to be lost if an individual stop training altogether for over a month. So muscle mass, uh, provided you're not sedentary, I wouldn't actually expect you to lose hardly any if if any at all. The a lot of the data we have on like muscle cross sectional area decay or decrease, uh, and people who are not bedridden and who are not critically ill, suggest that you're probably not going to lose much if any at all, especially if you're eating a substantial amount of pressure protein and again, our active, otherwise physically active as far as strength. Yeah, the data is imperfect is imperfect because they're testing, you know, relatively athletic populations or people who are pretty easily untrained. Um, so that that can be problematic and as far as I can recall, there's not a study out that just measured it at one month. But strength decay in some populations took much longer than that to actually go down, uh, with respect to the barbeda lifts. So I wouldn't actually expect that much fall off for a month. Yeah. And for over a month, I mean, you start getting two months, three months. Yeah, I would expect muscle cross sectional area to decrease, I would expect, you know, your strength performance to go down as you become deconditioned and those adaptations decay as far as how much it's not going to be a lot. You know, you want hard numbers. I don't have them for you because there's such a wide and inter individual range with respect to strength, strength decay and then again, it just takes, it seems to be taking a lot longer than we, we think. Um, and particularly if you're active, uh, it takes a long time to generate these strength adaptations, and it takes a long time to lose them. Same thing with cardiovascular adaptations, as far as particularly if we're talking about a similar magnitude, right? As far as muscle mascos, yeah, the muscles get smaller. You lose some muscle cross sectional area. But the amount, uh, this concept is called the Myonuclear Domain, and it's related to the number of Myonuclear muscles cells, the each muscle cells responsible for particular area of the muscle fiber, as far as replacing proteins, managing damage proteins, et cetera, et cetera. So this Myonuclear Domain, there's a domain for each of these cell nuclei. Uh, and so you don't lose any nuclei, even if you're inactive, but the actual size of the muscle uh, become smaller because due to disuse. So effectively the signal to the, that muscle cell is like, hey, you don't need to make as much protein and then muscle cells like, all right, cool, I won't. But then when you as soon as you give it back that signal to get bigger and grow, uh, the muscle cell goes, oh yeah, I remember what I'm supposed to do, and then you get a rapid restoration and muscle cross sectional area. Yep, that preservation of Myonuclear Domain is, is super important. What are your top three favorite air Jordans that you own? Okay, yes, so if you guys did know that some sneaker head and Jordans happened to be one of my favorites, I like, I really do like the, uh, air Jordans, the classics. Uh, I got, uh, the band ones are really great. I do love those, uh, as far as new air Jordans, the mocha's that just came out. I like those, my air Jordans force that I have for golf, this cement, oh boy, those things are, those things are great. And then, um, other one, oh retrofives, retrofives that are white with the red and blue. I mean, it's patriotic. That's why I like the band so much to the white and the red. It's just, um, and uh, I'm just not going to spend as much money on like the off whites or whatever, because I do, I wear these things. So, in any case, those are my favorite. Is the increased rate of muscle gain, bulking, greater than the subsequent muscle loss cutting when compared to bulking with a period and maintenance to recomp if being lean, being very lean isn't a priority. I guess you're asking if, if you gain muscle faster, do you retain more of it when you're cutting? And the answer is in general, yes, though again, this hasn't really been directly investigated. Uh, yeah, you gain more muscle when you're gaining more weight, but you also gain more body fat. And then when you go to lose muscle, uh, lose body weight, yeah, you're going to lose a little bit of muscle mass, but to the extent that you can preserve that with the adequate protein diet and resistance training, um, and in general losing weight a little bit slower, uh, yeah, you should be able to retain more muscle mass. Um, the maintenance period is probably important, uh, with respect to, uh, more important with respect to weight loss, transitioning into a weight gain phase, then it is from transitioning from a weight gain phase to a weight loss phase. Uh, basically you get this, if you've lost weight, sort of for a period of time, and then you go right back to a weight gain phase, you get the sort of preferential restoration of fat mass. To the extent that you can avoid that, uh, weight stabilization period seemed to help. Uh, I have not seen data on the opposite where people are gaining weight, and then a weight stabilization phase actually helps them preserve more muscle mass when cutting. It's theoretically possible, but I don't I don't know that I could be confident about saying that. Tristan underscore J underscore right is ketosis, an actual thing that helps with losing weight, or is that just all BS, uh, ketosis is the bi-definition is the, when the body's making ketones, ketone bodies, uh, due to fatty acid metabolism and the mitochondria, uh, being in ketosis, uh, and higher levels of ketosis, via a ketogenic diet, so diet that produces higher levels of ketosis, is, is one way to lose weight, um, provided you're in a calorie deficit. If you're asking does a ketogenic diet produce greater weight loss outcomes, or better sustained weight loss outcomes, or better adherence to a weight loss diet, then other types of diet the answer to that is no. Um, we have pretty good data on that. In fact, it looks like very low carbohydrate diets, which would include ketogenic diets. Actually, they tend to lose less fat mass and more lean body mass, uh, then diets that are higher in carbohydrates, also don't tend to gain as much lean body mass when in a calorie surplus, um, and following resistance training program. So it doesn't mean that a ketogenic diet or low carb diet or very low carb or a hydrodiet, which the definitions would have to be fleshed out for a really in-depth conversation of this. I do that in the book. Uh, it doesn't mean that they're not viable diets. They're perfectly fine for people that prefer that type of diet, but I don't know that I could sit here and tell you that they're any better than a different, another type of diet because the data doesn't say that they are. Top three songs for a heavy single currently go. Uh, yeah. So I actually have a training list on Spotify. Let's check it out. Okay. So look, man, I think that you should start out with the Allen Parsons Project. Serious. It's the Chicago Bulls theme song. It's getting in the right head space. Right? Then you're going to put your belt on, get, get, you know, start getting hype. I think you got to do mega-debt, Symphony of Destruction. I'm just saying that one's lapse. Uh, alternatively, if you're looking for something more a little a little more hip hop, I would say key-gloc, key-gloc do. Great, great, great jam. Is mixed grip okay for deadlift? Don't want to die. Definitely doesn't increase your risk of mortality. And I wrote a pretty long article about this called the grip problem. It's on the website. Yeah, mixed grips totally fine with me. I don't actually know that it increases risk of biceps tendon rupture and it just a perfectly fine way to hold on to the barbell. Best initial targets when you're coming back to training after a long break. We have an article on a website called how to return to training. We use RPE to pick your targets. How to reconcile a doctor's fitness advice with barbell medicines, fitness advice if they conflict. Ask the doctor for evidence to support their stance and also understand that it is highly unlikely that they're training with respect to exercise prescription, coaching, etc. is anywhere close to ours. And I'd be happy to discuss that publicly. Was told to avoid grains, dairy and gluten when my doctor diagnosed me with Hashimoto's, but I'm unable to find data is he punky me. If your doctor recommended that, I'd be very, very curious as to what the statuses of their board certification and endocrinology. It sounds like something that a person who's not educated in this topic would say. People do say this stuff and then when you ask for a data, they go quiet because there's not data. Well, they talk about anecdotes. Well, my friend or my cousin or my I had a patient who did this. Yeah, there's no data on that. Would not recommend specifically switching to that dietary pattern to manage Hashimoto's, because that's not how you manage Hashimoto's. If you want to follow that dietary pattern, otherwise, because you prefer it, and it helps you maintain a healthy body weight and sustains your level of physical performance during physical activity, etc. That's all finding good, but that's not how you manage Hashimoto's. Okay, you might have heard the bell earlier, and that was my dinner. Well, at least the rice portion. So I got to go finish dinner. I have finished making dinner so I can eat the dinner. But yeah, this was fun. Mist you guys and gals here on Instagram Live. Can I'm Dr. Jordan Fagamam, Barbol Metacin. I recorded this on the fancy cameras, so I'll probably put this up here later on. And next time, you know, we'll get more of your friends. So when I post it, share with your friends and see you next time. Have a good night. Later.

=== FILE: Live Q⧸A From 11.11.2020 [F37q5j_dKNs].txt ===

It's Tram Live. What's going on? It's Dr. Jordan Faggin, my mobile medicine. It is November 11th. It is 1738. Betty Wop again. You guys know what it is. Instagram Live, question and answer session. So every Wednesday we're here about 530 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. What we allow you to ask questions in the comments section. So if you're just joining us for the first time, welcome. Type your question into the comment section. All right. Ideally, these questions are related to fitness, training, anything like that. But hey, sometimes we go off the reservation and we get to talk about interesting things. If I don't get to your question, I apologize. Head over to our forum. If you go to barbomitons.com, you can sign up for the forum. We're very active there. Or you can go to our Facebook group to search barbomitons on Facebook. We'll accept it to the group. And you can join the nearly, I think it's almost 18,000 folks now. We'd love to have you be a part of that community. So yeah, in those specific topics tonight, it's popry. We're going to dive into some questions here. We scroll up what's going on in everybody. Hello. We're shooting for over 200 folks at any given time. Normally, we get like 1,000 something views while we do this thing. But we'd like to get at least 200 users at a time. I log on. I see some other Instagram lives with like 1,000s of folks. And I understand that I'm not famous. But I think we can do it. I think we can do it. So tell your friends. Connor Whitty, how do you manage fatigue when doing full body training? So this probably gives us a good chance to talk about fatigue, what it is, and then like how do I think about it in general. So fatigue in general are the negative psychological and physiological things that occur secondary to an exercise stimulus. There are two broad categories of fatigue. One is peripheral. Those things happen at the level of the muscle. So muscle damage, accumulation of metabolic, waste products, depletion of energy substrate. All the things would fall under the umbrella of peripheral fatigue. And then there's a central fatigue, which basically is a reduction of the neurological signal to the muscle to create force happens at the level of the brain or spinal cord. And so together, those things are fatigue. And again, they're the negative sort of psychological and physiological things that occur secondary to exercise stimulus. As far as what causes greater fatigue out of proportion to the exercise stimulus, which I think is what you're really getting at, sets to failure tend to be very, very fatiguing, compared to sets where there are one or more repetitions left in reserve. The level exercises tend to be more fatiguing that exercises that you've either done before or exercises that you've done similar variations to, that secondary to the repeated bout effect. Other things that tend to be, again, more fatiguing out of proportion to the exercise stimulus tend to be really heavy. High RPE type work at really high load. So for example, if the general intensity range that drives strength improvements is somewhere between 60 to 80 percent on average, that's where most of your volume work will be done just due to the nature of being able to complete a lot of repetitions in that sort of range. It's not that 80 percent doing sets of four, for example, or five, whatever, at 80 percent gives you a greater strength benefit than doing sets of four or five at 70 percent, for example. But it does cost you more fatigue. So when you think about trying to drive the sort of signal to build fitness adaptations up, you'd want to do more sets higher volume and not necessarily incur a bunch of unwanted or unnecessary fatigue on this case, meaning extraneous. So working heavier is not always better. I don't think that full body training is necessarily more fatiguing than body part or exercise, like a split programs, sort of fatigue. I think fatigue is really unique to the individual and what they've done historically and what they're used to, what their expectations are and in addition, like all the individual characteristics that make them them. So the exercise stimulus is what it is. It gets filtered through again, all the things that make you, you, and then on the other side is the stress which drives both fitness adaptations and fatigue. So how do I think about fatigue? I think about fatigue is sort of a necessary thing that occurs as, you know, again, fitness adaptations go up. Fatigue is also going to go up ideally not in proportion. Ideally, the fitness adaptations outstrip the amount of fatigue that's occurring and therefore you get better. Your best performances will not occur in general when fatigue is at its lowest. So for example, you could go on vacation, right? Take a week off and you're fatigue, particularly from training is going to go way way down. You slept a bunch, you didn't exercise, you didn't train, you ate a bunch of food, all as well, but when you come back to the gym, you don't usually PR. Why? Because your fitness adaptations have decayed. So I don't know that I would be trying to minimize fatigue all the time. Rather, I think a better focus is to try to maximize fitness adaptations and fatigue will tend to trend down over time as you do workouts that are similar to ones you've done before. I would accommodate to what you've previously done. That's what tends to drive this sort of fitness adaptation accumulation that is at a greater rate than the amount of fatigue that you're incurring. So this is why you see in general high-perchary results occur a few weeks after the onset of training rather than the initial onset of training, you kind of have to get used to the training, same thing with strength improvements. So I just wouldn't worry about fatigue like from a recovery standpoint rather I worry about load and fatigue management within the context of a program based on what you've been doing so far. So hopefully that makes sense. Kind of a long answer for the first one, but yeah, had to do it. Best tips from a cut for recovering from a patello tendonopathy. Yes, so I would recommend you see the article paying in training what do ideally you have to find some type of squatting or lower extremity exercise, maybe if you can't tolerate squatting where you can enter in and start doing that ideally to desensitize yourself. And it's going to be a lot of load management stuff. So patella tendonopathy overuse injury, although tendonopathy is kind of the somebrella term that just encompasses all tendon related pain, but it doesn't really describe what's going on, although that probably isn't that important anyway. So I would find something that you can do and gradually increase that over time to where you return to normal activity, that's outlined in the pain and training what do you article and if you need specific advice would contact our pain and rehab team. They would do it. But do you think of the general military fitness tests? For example, the Marine Corps PFT is max pull ups, max hit ups in a minute, three mile run. I don't think anything about them. I mean, I'm being honest, I think that each organization can come up with a series of fitness tests that it deems valuable for identifying folks who are prepared to do the job that they're contracted to do to the extent that these fitness tests reliably do that and are both sensitive and specific enough to identify those individuals who pass the test therefore are able to do the job and then a friend of yours who don't pass the test, they can't do the test. I don't know that and I don't know that data on that. I would guess that the new fitness tests from the Army, where they do a trap-art ed lift and a couple other odd movements, I say odd because they're not their traditional pull ups setups, push ups, et cetera. I think that probably more accurately represents what people are likely to do in the field. But again, I'm not an expert there and I don't know the data as far as individuals who are in the armed services who pass the PFT, whatever it may be and then ultimately cannot do the jobs, ask of them versus people who don't pass that test and can. So I don't know, how would you design a two week taper and peak-free female intermediate lifter? So we have free peaking templates on our website. There's a slow and a fast one just based on some kind of trends we've seen across different types of lifters. But I wouldn't program it in any sort of specific way just because it's a woman lifter. Women in men respond nearly identically to training with respect to strength, hypertrophy, power, cardiovascular fitness training. And I would not program specifically for somebody just because it's a woman or a man, just like I wouldn't program specifically for somebody because they're young or older or any particular ethnicity. People on general will respond about the same unless they have great genetics or adult poor genetic hand or other environmental things like nutrition, other lifestyle factors, etc. Can really tip the scales far as response to training but yeah, there aren't a sex specific responses to training that you would need to consider when coming up with a sort of training program. Can any gains be made when one trains once per week? I mean, somebody who previously never trained before will likely get stronger, gain some muscular hypertrophy, cardiovascular endurance if they're training that, etc. If they're only formally training once per week, that's not going to work for very long. The effectively, the individual will accommodate to that sort of training stimulus. And while they're not incurring additional fatigue, they're also not incurring additional fitness adaptations. And so the way that you increase fitness adaptations is by increasing the signal, increasing the exercise stimulus. And so if you can't really do that by only training once per week, it's certainly better than not training but you know, would start to work towards those guideline minimums at least, which is resistance training twice per week and doing a certain amount of aerobic training depending on the intensity. Usually 150 to 300 minutes for moderate intensity, aerobic training, or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic training. If you're not tired of the conjugate questions, what do you think about the idea that power squats, aka Westside Barbell Style is the best squat for muscle strength, sports, injury prevention, etc. I mean, I am tired of the conjugate questions, but claiming that any particular squat is best for developing muscle mass is completely bogus strength. There are strength-specific adaptations to each type of exercise, because strength is specific. So again, that's just tells you that whoever is saying that doesn't know what they're talking about for sports. There are no squats that are uniquely better, you know, best suited towards sports. That doesn't make any sense of an injury prevention. You can't prevent injuries anyway. You can only reduce the risk. So again, somebody who said that has just identified themselves as not a subject matter expert and then instead of arguing with them, because that's not what you would want to do, you would just go somewhere else and spend your time wisely, getting involved in the community, making a positive difference, learning something, learning a new skill, interacting with other humans to build your social circle up, something like that. All right, had my appendix removed a few days ago and was told not to lift heavy weights for several weeks, still worth taking creatine at this time. I don't know that I would consciously stop taking creatine. It's not like it's, you know, any risk for you to continue taking it. It's just, you know, yeah, you're not leaking out, you know, an additional couple percent of performance maybe, because you're not training. So you could stop taking it if you wanted to, but no real benefit to stop taking it either. Very, very curious, basic differences and recommendations for programming linear progressions, slash novices between starting strength and barbell medicine. Oh, pretty much every step of the way. I think our beginner prescription, which is free article and sort of program, um, and our beginner template, which is an expanded version of that, uh, kind of highlight all the differences, but very briefly, we don't think that you should specialize in four or five exercises, particularly because you wouldn't, in no sport, in no career, in no real setting, do you specialize early on in someone's training? You want a variety of training with respect to exercise. It improves motor learning. So how good you get it, doing the exercise. It reduces in risk of injury, uh, improves leg body mass outcomes. You also wouldn't specialize in, any sort of particular reps games. You would only do fives. You would get proficient in multiple reps games because there are different adaptations that you'd want to get across different rep ranges that don't, if you uniquely happen at five, five is just arbitrary made up number. It's not particularly useful for any specific thing. It's that for getting good at fives. You'd want auto regulation. So RPE are reps and reserve session RPE, something like that, um, or an objective, whether way to track, or the, like a velocity tracker, but that's probably unnecessary and overkill for somebody who's new to lifting, and you'd want to include cardiovascular fitness, uh, training specifically and not avoid that because that helps build your training base so that you can exercise enough to build for long-term development of strength. Um, again, all discussed in our beginner prescription, uh, beginner template is a set of, uh, four sets of five and RPE eight, any more or less fatigueing than two sets of ten at RPE eight, I would expect it to be more fatiguing. One, this is multiple sets to near failure to because the weight is substantially heavier. Um, those would be my two, you know, sort of thoughts there. But again, comparing just one rep protocol against another, probably is not the way I'd base programming. I would try to look at the entire program and, and compare that to another program. What's the deal with calves and why are they so hard to grow? Uh, calves are a muscle. There's an heel lateral heads and the soleus sits underneath. I don't necessarily think they're that hard to grow. I just don't think people train them, and they certainly don't train them diligently. It's kind of like arms in a way, um, you know, people will do, you know, four sets of arms, uh, you know, or biceps and triceps per week and be like, well, I don't they grow and it's like, because you're not doing near enough or they'll do 10 sets and you're like, well, I don't why don't they grow that much? Because you're not doing nearly enough. Same thing with calves, people do calves once a week and they're like, why don't they grow? It's like, do not even close to enough. And then also people will do them for like three or four weeks and be like, why didn't my calves grow a bunch? It's like, it's only four weeks. It's not enough. Yeah. So just like anything else takes time and, you know, diligent effort here. Will my heart explode if I have a pre-workout with 300 milligrams of caffeine in it? So I did a whole YouTube video on caffeine, the current FDA guidelines recommends less than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day. Although individual tolerance is likely varies well higher and lower than that. The dose at which benefits are typically seen varies between three to six or three to nine milligrams of caffeine per kilogram body weight per day. So 300 milligrams is on the low end for most individuals depending on how much they weigh. But this is all tolerance. And your heart's not going to explode anyway. Heart rate doesn't really go up with caffeine. Blood pressure doesn't go up with caffeine. So to answer your question directly, no, but as far as how much caffeine should have, based on your individual tolerance, preferences, et cetera. The way we, you know, people are using caffeine pre-workouts so that they increase their arousal. Not that kind of arousal, but arousal to do, to engage in exercise and improve their performance. And this can be modeled across this or is modeled by this law called the Yerks Dodson Law of arousal. So it looks like a bell curve. And so on the left side of the curve, you know, as you're going up the slope, you are under sort of arous, basically, you're not ready to perform et cetera peak. And then at the top, that's your peak level. You're in a certain level of arousal. And then if you go to higher levels of arousal, your performance actually drops off. You're too height, you know, too many trap slaps, too much caffeine, too much ammonia, or, you know, whatever else you're using to get up for a workout. So I would try to find a dose that you like and respond well, too, and stick to that dose. You don't get used to the caffeine as far as a like reduction in performance sort of improvements. You sure you get tolerance to the caffeine in so far as the metabolism can can get a little faster. But the irgogenic or performance enhancing benefits of caffeine don't require progressively higher and higher doses. That's all just made up stuff. Is timing of protein intake important for muscle protein synthesis or if my intake is efficient over a given period, it's always available? I don't really understand the question, but yeah, protein timing is somewhat important, I guess, on a micro level, meaning that if you continuously dose yourself with protein throughout the day, you would not have as many muscle protein synthesis events that if you had like discrete bolus to meals. So, you know, you eat meal and then you fast, you know, and you can do that every three to five hours. If you, you know, continuously fed with protein throughout the day and you only took, you know, 90 minutes from the end of one meal for the start of another meal. That meal would probably not contribute to muscle protein synthesis right then, but maybe later, time after you've again fasted for a period of time. How much does all of that matter in the grand scheme of things? I think none. I wouldn't even consider it when building a dietary pattern or considering protein intake. I just don't think it matters at all. Is absence of evidence ever evidence of absence? Sure, yeah. So, one example I really like has to do with training pregnant women. We assume there's some non-zero risk with respect to exercise during pregnancy, meaning there's a risk to maybe mom and or baby. We don't know that to be the case because the existing evidence actually doesn't report a lot of, you know, bonafide or confirmed cases. And so, like right now, because CrossFit's got so popular and resistance training is gotten much, much more popular and high-intensity interval training like courses, you know, so like on-steery and soul cycle, whatever, all the stuff has gotten much, much larger. We would expect to see case report after case report after case report. If there were, if there was a substantial risk to mom or baby during pregnancy with exercise, well, you don't see any of that. And so there's an absence of evidence. And so in that case, you really would expect case reports and a lot of data coming out on this if it were a significant risk. So, I think that that is evidence in and of itself that the risk, even though we assume it to be non-zero, it's probably not just wildly high. And I think that's reflected in the latest guidelines from the 2019 Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines during pregnancy. Jordan, auto-regulation in programming seems to focus on set intensity and session RPE, when, slash, how do you ever auto-regulate volume in a training plan? So, oh, I think I see what you're saying, so basically work up, you know, to a set of a certain rep scheme at RPE, whatever, that focuses more on load on the bar. Session RPE is really a measure of fatigue rather than a set of a measurement of exertion, but that's for another Instagram live. So, as far as regulating volume, you could do body weight stuff. For example, that's a good easy example here, so you could do pull-ups to RPE, so you're regulating volume, or you could do a work-up to a set of, you know, five reps at RPE, and then do as many sets as it takes to get to RPE 9, so you're regulating total volume there, or you could do, you know, a set of six at RPE 9, and then take 10% off the bar and do as many sets of six until that feels like a 9 again, again, regulating volume using RPE. If I go into a 500 calorie deficit, but maintain ideal protein intake, can I lose weight while making gains? I assume you mean improving strength as one of the gains that you're referring to, and sure that I find that is almost entirely related to programming, not at all related to a modest calorie change, certainly not 500 calories. I don't know that I would be only focusing on protein intake, particularly ideal protein intake, because the other components of nutrition are also important, as far as gaining muscle mass, if you're untrained or under-trained, sure, you could probably gain some muscle mass, but it's unlikely to be as much as if you were gaining weight, although we don't really know. Great paper by Slater and colleagues 2019, it was like how many calories are needed to build muscle or something like that. What's the argument against training at the lowest possible effective intensity so that you can increase volume as much as possible? I haven't heard many well articulated arguments against that other than like getting better at lifting heavy weights, in order to get better at lifting heavy weights, you have to lift heavy weights, and I would agree with that, but I think that there's a wider range of effective intensities for that, particularly when you frame it through, it's a need for additional volume, and then people just think if it's not hard, it doesn't work, and it's like, I mean, the proof exists in both the exercise science literature and then also in the world, as far as our coaching clientele, our TES is coaching clientele, helms coaching clientele, the data driven strength, the guy's coaching clientele, over and over, this is not like a one-off thing, and it's not necessarily new, just now we're better able to explain it. If I'd deadlift heavy will my waist get thicker? It's unlikely, I mean, so you think about how your waist would actually get thicker, you're not changing your boni anatomy to any significant degree, right? Yes, your bone mineral density is like that increase with axial skeleton loading, that's fancy way of just saying like bearing weight, but it's not like your abs or your erector group, or any muscles of your trunk are going to, you know, spontaneously hypertrophy faster than any muscle growth that's ever been recorded in the exercise science literature. Like it just, it's not particularly without taking substantial amounts of animal ox steroids and or growth secretive to eggs, or something like that, which would stimulate a substantial amount of growth, and furthermore without being in a calorie surplus. So the idea that you could like rapidly gain a bunch of muscle without, you know, something else going on seems unlikely. For competitive sports athletes, what are the implications on performance for doing a fat loss diet in season? Usually doesn't affect performance, particularly based on the data that we have at present, and then reducing extra adipostissue tends to improve performance in most sports. So overall thoughts on weighted dips, I think that they're fine, and I don't think they provide any unique stress to the Glent O'Humeral or shoulder joint compared to other upper limb exercises. I think they're just another exercise that aren't like specifically good or specifically bad. It's just another tool to use if it's something you want to do or appropriate to your goals. Yeah, hey Doc, hope all is well when starting a fat loss phase. What's the best way to determine when weight loss is beyond just initial water weight? I mean, you can't do it without some objective testing, but if you're a waste or conference goes down, that's fine. If you see continued weight loss after the first, you know, weaker too, that was likely unrelated to water loss. But here's the more important thing. Why doesn't matter? And I don't mean that to minimalize your question, but like, how would you, what would you do differently if you found out that the first week or two of your diet most of the weight loss was due to water weight loss? Like, nothing. So I just wouldn't even worry about it. Let's see, for guys in the military, also women, they make us run a lot. Do you suggest more intake of food to gain mass because we will have to run and lift in the same day as well as maximize sleep? Yes, so I think the greater your physical activity goes up, the more calories you're going to need to maintain weight. If you're trying to gain weight, you're going to have to go even higher than that. To the extent that the additional running substantially changes your physical activity, yeah, you're going to need more calories. But I probably wouldn't do that preemptively. I would just see what happened after a week or two of this new, found activity level to see what happens with your weight. But doesn't change, then you're accommodating for this in other ways. I don't know that I would try to maximize sleep as far as just duration, because getting seven, eight hours is probably enough. I don't know that you need to sleep more than that. But I would try to maximize the quality, sure. So not necessarily being exposed to much LED light right before bed. I don't think blue blockers have good enough data to support their use. But yeah, avoiding electronics, highly stimulating activities, stimulants, etc. So that you can have a normal sleep, wake cycle, try to go to bed around the same and get out of bed the same time each day. All good ideas. What is the best exercise for hip slash glute growth? I think there are a bunch of different ones that all work about the same, you know, and so I don't know that there's one that stands, you know, heads and shoulders better than the other ones. I think hip thruster great squats of all kinds are great lunges, step ups, rdails, good mornings, etc. All can be useful as far as which one is the best. You look for one that's got, you can do a lot of volume. It's got a big, you know, relatively large range of motion and isn't that fatiguing. And so that's all going to be personal preference basically. Is there a quick fix for squats sticking in the middle of the concentric? Good out of the whole and very fast lockout as well? Yes, I think with sticking points, there are like non-modifiable sticking points and then modifiable sticking points. So the modifiable ones would be due more to positioning, posture, technique, etc. That being said, non-modifiable ones, it's just, yo, that's your sticking point. It's going to be there forever. It's just going to happen at heavier heavier weights as you get stronger and stronger. It's like, it never gets easier. You just go faster that Greg LeMont quote. So never gets easier. The sticking point never ceases to be. It just gets stronger. Yeah, and most people will stick, that's the normal sticking point for a squat. So I see people on YouTube putting raw egg whites into their workout shakes instead of protein powder for those of us not name Rocky is eating raw eggs safe. I mean, there's a non-zero risk to eating non-pasturized egg products that aren't cooked and the bio-availability is drastically reduced when not cooked and there are no benefits to eating these eggs. So I don't know why that is a thing. Yeah, long-term, down-sides to alternate grip for dead lifts. None, as far as I can tell. I think that the hook grip is probably has a mechanical advantage with respect to deadlifting less likely to have a little windmill. But as far as overall development, I think they're about the same. Thoughts on microdo scene to treat ADD slash ADHD. So there's some interesting data coming out on a handful of substances, ketamine, MDMA, some on marijuana and various different sort of medical applications that we're trying to study and not we as barbomedicine but like the medical community is trying to study and kind of see what the reliable benefits that we can reliably see with their use. I think it's too early to tell and I certainly wouldn't recommend microdo scene to anybody right now. As far as the self-treatment. I think there are unknown risks and unknown benefits and I feel like that that's just risky calculus there. Yeah, I probably wouldn't recommend that. Dude at my gym says you shouldn't do pause slash tempo work if you're already a slow lifter. Thoughts, I mean I think that's would be easily countered with asking him what is the velocity that most successful third attempts are lifted at in a meet? They're all very slow. We're trying to improve low velocity force production. So pauses, worth the isometric portion, tempo work is really just a way to control for a fit load and fatigue management. There's some unique benefits to eccentric training that we're trying to maximize, maybe with tempo work or with overload tempo work or with overload work in general, which is inherently slower on the eccentric. But the idea is that during the concentric portion you're trying to move as fast as possible all the time so that really just negates his entire argument. And so I don't know. I don't know. I'd ask him what his deadlift is just to like assert dominance. What would be the best way to motivate parents to start resistance training if they are reluctant to carry out high RPE sets? I would just ask him what resistance training they want to do and then what exercises in particular they want to do and then have them work in a variety of rep ranges and if they only wanted to go to RP7, that's fine. You could also use the feeling scale, which is a validated auto regulation tool. You could say, yeah you should do this set at this weight for this many reps and it should end up feeling kind of bad at the end for example and that's probably hard enough. But RP7 would be about the same. Any recommendations on how to more accurately assess RPE after each set. So you're really not worried about the accuracy. You're worried about the precision. So I don't really care how close it is to the actual value. I care how close it is each time you do it to the value that you rated it before. So like what you call an eight is always an eight and that's the same. So I would just the best way to improve your precision is to keep doing it and keep using it. Do you practice medicine? There's a great place to end. So no after residency I just did barblem just been doing barblem medicine ever since. Was doing some online telemed stuff for a while but now my whole sole focus is barblem medicine and this is more of a public health promotion thing and education thing for other physicians, other healthcare professionals but I do not see patients any longer. Okay, hey look next week we're going to be back here. 530 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. Be here. Look this was a week showing. I thought we were going to be over 200 but I appreciate you guys all coming out. You guys are great. I'm going to post this to my IGTV also to my Instagram feeds. So if you want to go back through this you can some of this will probably end up on YouTube. Yeah we'll see you guys later. Thanks for coming.

=== FILE: Livestream Q⧸A 10.25.2019 [RAAp4O01ya0].txt ===

I welcome back to Instagram Live. I am Dr. George Biden, I was barbell medicine. I was saying, so I lose brain cells when you don't close long. I lose brain cells when I don't close long. If you need ligate, it's an inch of machine bad for your needs. Nope. I welcome back to Instagram Live. I am Dr. George and I welcome back with barbell medicine. It is October 25th. I am Friday. I am trying to get in the habit of doing these live things a little bit more often. I miss you guys. If you've never joined us on one of these before, it's a Q&A session. You guys ask questions. I try to provide answers, nuance answers. To the best of my ability, if I don't get to your question, I apologize. If it seems like I skipped over your question, I also apologize, but perhaps this isn't the best place for it, in which case, let's say head over to our forum, go to barbell medicine.com, look on the forum, sign up. Before the forum, you can ask questions. We're pretty active on there. Let's go over announcements first. So announcement number one, we have a bunch of new content coming out next week. We got a podcast with Alan Flanagan, a blog post about that podcast going up the same day. That's on Monday as well. Have our vlog from Ron Nationals going up next week. We have our newsletter that's going to go out next week. We have our barbell medicine research review that's going to go out next week, but the Monday following our paint first, paint and rehab seminar in Boston. We have another paint rehab seminar coming up in January, in Reno, Nevada. So if you want to sign up for that head over to eventbrite.com. We also have a few spots left open for our Portland regular barbell medicine seminar in Portland. That's coming up here in a few short weeks. So again, you can sign up on our website or eventbrite.com, search barbell medicine. Let's see what else. So we have our barbell medicine shirts are going to be up in the shop tonight. There are logo shirts, those cool ones that we were wearing at Ron Nationals. See, is there anything else that I'm missing? I'm sure there's stuff that I'm missing. Sure there's stuff that I'm missing, but I want to make sure that we get to some good questions, some good content here. So let's go into Instagram and get some questions. Now you guys who are going to watch us on YouTube in the future, maybe wondering why aren't you streaming live on YouTube? Well, one, the algorithm is not great. They don't, it doesn't pop up in people's search engines for, you know, when they search for barbell medicine Q&A. I don't know. So it's not good for views unless I post it like this. Then two internet connection bandwidth, all that stuff is tough even if I try to do this like one man show for YouTube live streams. So make it there in the future by getting somebody else to help me out here. But otherwise, it's just me. So we're scrolling up. We're going to find some questions. Hey, Jordan, our leg extensions bad for your knees. So this is actually something that comes up all the time. Leg extensions being quote unquote bad for your knees. And so then when you ask people why do they say that it's bad for your knees? And they say, well, the moment arm on the knee, there's a shearing force and this is, you know, bad, that force, that type of force is bad for the knees because you're applying force at the end of the lower limb segment right near the ankle, right? That's where the pad of the leg extension machine sits. And then there's support underneath the actual knee joint itself. And so you got this long moment arm and it's causing shear forces on the knees or people say it's an open chain exercise. And those are inherently worse for apparently pain outcomes, which is not based in evidence. So the leg extensions are perfectly fine exercise. Does not appear to cause knee injury if you use, you know, any reasonable definition for injury. So something that precludes folks from participating in sport or the recreational pursuits causes pain, right, causes dysfunction. And it has to probably do that for a longer, or a certain period of time, right? If it causes pain for five minutes and then it goes away completely, it doesn't affect your ability to, again, participate in sport, participate in recreational pursuits, you know, or activities of daily life for more than five minutes, then I don't know that that's an injury, right? So yeah, you know, leg extensions are fine. Exercise, they're probably, are they're not very specific to squats or dead lifts or anything like that. So from a strength training perspective, probably not terribly useful, but for a body building from a body building perspective, from a rehab perspective, they have some use, particularly getting people to believe that their knees aren't always going to hurt every time they apply force through that. The reason why they're so useful in body building is because you can do a ton of reps and sets without really overfitting the person where as you can't really do the same for squats. So it's funny when Austin and I were actually at our CrossFit level one MD, the certification course in QI, QI, QI, QI, it was in Hawaii on the island of QI. It was funny because when they started talking about pain and injury, I was the one who piped up and was like, hey, that's probably not correct. We should probably think about it like this and make sure not to build these harmful narratives because Austin, you know, was, is blood pressure through the roof and then when they started talking about some nutrition stuff that was inaccurate, my blood pressure through the roof and Austin actually is piped up. So it was kind of interesting that we both like had each other's backs on that and yeah, they said at that seminar, like, oh, well, I can prove to you that the leg extension is a far more dangerous exercise than the squat and it's like, you know, and goes to that mechanical analysis, which is not only a complete misrepresentation of where we're at with respect to modeling pain, you know, from the biomedical model versus bio-cycle social model and then also just, you know, completely like negates, you know, people building their own positive narratives around exercise. So again, if somebody tells you that you put a position of power, like, hey, this exercise is dangerous for you. This exercise can hurt you. This exercise is uniquely dangerous. This exercise is bad for you. Then anytime that you are exposed to it, you know, you run a greater risk of having pain afterwards, whereas it's just a completely neutral stimulus, as long as you don't color it or filter it incorrectly based on your individual characteristics, which includes psychological social inputs, then, you know, you're probably going to be fine. So I actually did some leg extensions today. There you go. All right, considerations for golf and tennis strength conditioning is not a question so much as a big topic, right? Considerations for golf and tennis strength and conditioning. So from a conditioning standpoint, the way I kind of analyze this stuff first, look at the conditioning components. So what do you need for a golf from a conditioning component? Probably not that much uniquely in the way of actual, like, cardiovascular fitness, just because the nature of the sport is, you know, you end up taking so many swings, they last this long, and you have a lot of downtime in between. You might make a case that a person with better aerobic fitness is better able to tolerate either multiple rounds in a day or multiple rounds over the course of a weekend. And I would get behind that. That means that I don't think it's unique to golf. I think, you know, all sport, all recreational physical pursuits probably benefit from increasing aerobic fitness. Tennis is different because the plays can last longer. So probably a bigger impetus for an aerobic conditioning in a way and particularly running at high speeds because that's how they end up cutting across the course or the court, not the course. Sorry, I got golf and tennis mixed up there. From a strength perspective, you'd certainly want to participate in more high velocity for production stuff. So the weight's necessarily going to be lighter so that, you know, you can train squat, bench, deadlift, press, or any variation of those things at a lighter weight. So you can move them at high velocities. That would probably be a big component there. Doesn't mean all of the work would be high velocity, but a substantial portion of it. You'd probably also want to do some rotational work as well. That means that when you look at like meta-analysis, particularly on golf, I've been super interested in this because I've been playing a bunch of golf lately. It seems like anything that makes golfers stronger and able to produce more force makes them be able to hit the ball a little harder, a little more ball speed, a little more club head speed. So this is the opposite in the context of practicing the sport. So you wouldn't just want to go to the gym and not go to the range, not go to the course, not practice your sport, that would be silly. So yeah, I think there's a lot of different options. There's probably no one set of exercises that is like, this is the best stuff, but you definitely have some high velocity works and rotational work and then your traditional S&C stuff. So hopefully that helps. Do you have any tips on how to use a belt? I've never used one. Yeah, so a couple of tips. So one purchasing a belt, like I want a belt. What do I do? I don't have any brand allegiance to any particular belt manufacturer. I personally think that most folks who are getting into strength training should get a 4 inch wide belt and then as far as the thickness goes, I like a 13 millimeter belt. 10 millimeter belt is the other that's the other common size for these swayed belts. I don't recommend a Velcro belt unless you're just doing Olympic weight lifting, but yeah, other than that, I wouldn't get a Velcro belt and they're not legal and most power of new federations or any power of new federations as far as I'm aware. And any event, I think that 13 millimeter belt is, that's my preference. If you want to, if you have any inkling to be in a power lifter or you just want a really good belt to go lift all the weights, I'd get a 4 inch belt. That's like the standard 10 millimeter belt, this little thinner. So if you're on the lighter side or have no idea about competing the future, 10 millimeter spine, but I would recommend a 4 inch wide, 13 millimeter belt. Single prong is my preference. Double prong is fine a little bit more finicky to latch, but some people like those. My first belt was a double prong. And if you want a lever belt, that's cool too. I don't like them. Austin loves them. So that's anyway. You have a bunch of different options, but that's kind of how you would make your decision. And then it's far as how to use it. Same thing is to figure out the appropriate level of tightness. So and where to where it, those are the two big considerations. So I would recommend wearing it as tight as it can be without it moving around or compromising your ability to perform a Valsalva maneuver. So if it's so loose that it's moving around when you lift, it's probably, you should probably go in another hole. If it's so tight that you can't actually take a big deep breath because it's really constricting you and constricting your ability to expand your thoracic and abdominal cavities, and it's probably one-to-tight. And then in this far as where to where it, I think you should put it on one hole, a little too loose, then do a squat with it. And the belt will usually kind of drift to the right position for you to get started, you know, general rule of thumb. And it kind of be able to figure it out over time where you prefer it, but that's a good place to start. So and then after you figure out where it's supposed to sit, cinch it down one more hole and you're ready to go. Yeah, that's what I think you should do with the belt. You're going to, you know, auto squat, for example, you're going to walk the way out. You're going to do the Valsalva maneuver, which means take a big breath and hold it, bear down. Some people like to think about expanding their abdomen or bracing. I prefer the bracing, you know, where you're trying to almost make yourself do a mini crunch while you take this big breath in and hold it. That's my preferred method. I don't think you should try to actively push your belly out against the belt. I don't think that's the terribly useful cue. Although sometimes it works, you know, it's hard to speak in absolutes here. Let's see, spring, 20, 20, $7 for junior beach. We are coming to Norfolk, Virginia in spring, 2020. I think it's spring. If you do the spring or summer, I don't know like when the cutoff is and I've actually ever get the date of our summer, but it's on our 2020 schedule. Yes, I am filming my documentary reaction video. It's not like my documentary. It's to the game changers video, the new Netflix. I think it's on Netflix documentary about vegan athletes. So that'll be fun. I'm going to film that tomorrow. Biggest mistake of your coaching career. I don't know. What's one thing you might have done differently in hindsight? The biggest thing I think which is not unique to coaching is just how people learn. It actually become, you know, educated and experienced in their field. You just end up being overconfident at first. So I think it would have been nice to have found a mentor earlier in my coaching career that would have let me down the right path. And I don't know that I can be too critical on myself because it just happens. But probably the first two years of my coaching career. I was kind of like, I mean, it was a perfect situation. There wasn't a lot of information out there on coaching, just period. And then too, there weren't a lot of people who were like, you know, in the space who were writing articles or were available for this mentorship kind of thing. And so everyone was like out on their own in the wild, wild west. You really had deep squatter with Louis Simmons. You too was like barely, you know, getting, you know, lifting videos up. Certainly not instructional stuff. And then seminar wise. I mean, man, you really just had the USAW and USA track and field. Those are the only and crossfit. Those are the people doing seminars and crossfit is like just started really. So yeah, I don't know. I don't want to be too critical of myself. But if I had to do it over again, I would probably try to seek out a mentor earlier on in my coaching career. And that would have instilled in me some more humility right off the bat. That would have been a good idea. Thank you for podcast recommendation on lipids on the JAMA podcast. Oh, yeah. So if you have not gone over to, well, wherever you get your podcasts from, JAMA clinical reviews, they have really great frequent podcast uploads. We're basically they interview and talk about the latest science with the researchers who perform the review. This one's actually with Brian, parents who is an absolute savage in the world of lipidology and cardiovascular disease. And this latest one, it's the thing that's lipids and cardiovascular health. I think it's the title of it on JAMA, Stanford Journal of American Medical Association, Clinical Review, Wood Recum, and listening to that, he's got two new papers. I think, or at least one new paper that he's author on and I know, oh, he's a co-author on the second one. Those published in New England Journal Medicine, the other one is published in JAMA, JAMA. So, in any event, he's got a bunch of other great papers on this subject as well. What would go, would recommend listening that podcast? These are a specific point where you would recommend someone stop weight loss after a significant drop to start gaining lean weight again or just personal preference. I mean, as long as we're not talking about people who are going to an underweight situation based on BMI or who have lost a significant amount of muscle mass, it should become, you know, that point you would be caquette. If you lost a bunch of lean body mass and fat mass, one of the differences between kick-caccia and as farcapini as you can actually lose muscle mass and gain fat or have too much fat and be sarcapini have sarcapini goviscity whereas kick-caccia is like this global loss of flesh, both fat and muscle tissue and there's some other syndromes, a syndromic kind of of symptoms that are associated with that as well. So, yeah, provided we're not talking about anything like that. Yes, really just personal preference. I mean, how big and jacked do you want to be? I think gain lean body mass certainly useful for gain strength and also carrying more lean body mass obviously. But there's no like this is how lean you should get with respect to kind of lean body mass. Again, as long as we're not talking about people who develop medical conditions from losing so much weight. Does a leg press engage more muscle fibers than the barbell squats? No, I don't think so. And it really depends on I kind of go one step further to try to clarify this question. So, if we're just restricting this analysis between leg press and barbell squat to muscle fibers of the lower extremity, so of legs and we're not talking about the trunk or and back, that's the only real fair comparison that you can make because the squat obviously is going to train engage more of those muscle fibers due to the fact that it's freestanding the additional joints are moving, so you have a lot more muscle mass involved than a leg press. But with respect to just lower extremity, motor unit recruitment, yeah, it's you're really not going to see a big difference. Probably about the same as long as both exercises are being done to close to failure for similar amount of reps. Yeah. Good afternoon doc. Well, I think, you know, time is it. It's almost six. Yeah. I guess for your ed. Good afternoon. All right. How and why is training a few reps from failure beneficial for strength purposes? Yeah, well, so the first part of this strength is specific to context to how it's trained, you know? So if you, for instance, if you only train sets of 10, then you're likely to get the biggest payoff, the biggest transference, the biggest carryover to like a 10-ret max or heavy set of 10. Conversely, if you only train 5, your biggest transference carryover or training an outcome improvement is likely to be strength in sets of 5. So, you know, you'd have to further refine this question for, you know, to make it to clarify, or we talked about one RMS strength, five RMS strength, 10 RMS strength, 20 RMS strength. But if we're just talking about strength in general to the extent that even exists, right? The ability to produce force across a bunch of different, a bunch of different contexts, training a few reps shy of failure effectively is a strategy to recruit more motor units. So let's say you're doing a heavy set of 5. The first rep, you know, and these are all just made up numbers, these are not experimentally determined numbers, but, you know, for the sake of this argument, this general premise holds true. So instead of 5, heavy set of 5 is like 86% of a 1 RMS, so 5 RMS is about 86% of some of these 1 RMS, give or take, because people are different. You know, doing the first rep, you might engage, 65%, 70% of all of the muscle fibers that you can voletionally recruit. Two, you know, rep number two, you're at 75%, get maybe getting close to 80% of all the voletional muscle fibers that you can voletionally recruit. And this is not 100% of all your muscle fibers, just the ones that you have voletional access to. By rep three, you're getting close to 100% of all of the motor units that you can voletionally recruit and then reps 4 and 5, you know, pegged 100% or close enough to all of those muscle fibers that you can voletionally recruit. So by training close to failure, but not necessarily too failure, you get that motor unit recruitment. Same thing happens. It's at the 10, 20, 25, 30, it's just the actual adaptations that you're selecting for our specific to the rep ranges that you're engaging in. That's the biggest difference there. Any plans for selling barbell medicine banner for those of us with garage gyms? So we just made a bunch for the coaches. I don't know if we'll be releasing them publicly, but it's not off the chart, not off the table, off the chart, off the table. Yeah. What sort of training block are you running right now? I saw you enjoying those sweet 15s. Also any reason for the 15s are just a bit of fun. Yes, it's just a pivot week. I just had a meet two weeks ago and vowed ready to get back into regular training. Might have another week of just kind of low stress. Different exercises, different rep ranges, all that sort of stuff. So 15s, it's just light enough where it's not going to cause a ton of fatigue, get a nice little pump and then move on. Yeah. If you could go back and teach 30 year old Jordan one piece of advice, what would it be? So I'm 34. So it's four years ago. What would I do in age 30? I think I turned 30. I was in residency, I guess. What would I teach myself then? I don't know. I probably just would have tried to sleep more. I think that would have been the big thing. Try to get more sleep. Yeah. Almost done with the legacy 12 week strength and not sure which new templates to do next. In GPP, I purchased first half of 2019. Then did thralls free program before this and want to keep focusing on powerlifting. Yeah. If you did 12 week strength, that do powerlifting too. You'd probably have to do a powerlifting three. Yeah. One of those those two, if you're interested in getting stronger, those would be the two most focused ones and most appropriate for you given what you recently ran. Yeah. Is it a waste of a workout if I go out and drink later that night? A waste of a workout? No. Not necessarily. I mean, you know, alcohol has some significant effects on muscle proteins, synthesis and muscles themselves and your sleep architecture and all sorts of stuff. So it can certainly compromise or attenuate strength improvements if you go out and get drunk short. But having a few drinks, you know, probably not going to be a big deal. Yeah. If your goal is hypertrophy and your advanced lifter, could you make an argument that it would be counterintuitive to run a hypertrophy block while on a calorie while on a calorie deficit? I mean, you're unlikely to gain a significant amount of lean body mass while you're in a calorie deficit. So I don't know that it's counterintuitive because in, you know, if the calorie deficit is last, it runs long enough and it's significant enough, you know, think about getting ready for a bodybuilding show, for example. Then some principles or practices that are normally used in a hypertrophy training. So higher reps, significant amount of isolation exercises or less fatiguing exercise selection, stuff like that. What all be useful, especially when you think about the main role of training, it's really, you know, two main roles. Primarily to reduce any lean body mass losses and then two is sort of a metabolic thing, you know, burn calories to increase your sort of calorie burn total daily energy expenditure throughout the day. So, you know, you have higher volume, usually in hypertrophy blocks, you have less fatiguing exercises which can be useful during periods of higher stress, you know, higher, higher environmental stress. Maybe in this case due to the dietary constraints. And then you're still getting that muscle stimulation to preserve lean body mass to the best of the ability you can. Jordan, thank you for all the info you have shared about training injuries. It has helped my training tremendously. Sick. All right. Question, any benefit to occasionally squat without knee sleeves if so when? So I think if you go and look at like what, you know, sort of benefits, you get out of squatting with knee sleeves that helps better answer this question. So as far as actual scientific literature on knee-uprain knee sleeves, best data we have on this stuff is in osteoarthritis. People tend to report lower pain scores during physical activity with a knee-uprain sleeve. Also increases some joint warmth or temperature of the joint people subjectively report. They're joint feel little looser, more mobile, and you know, might be decreased their pain a little bit. On the other hand, if you start relying on knee sleeves all the time, you know, this is a fairly innocuous kind of training tool, but you know, you would hate to like be hamstrung, pun intended by always using knee sleeves. So should you always use knee sleeves? I mean, I think if you're getting ready for a powerlifting meet and the performance in the gym and the training stress from the gym is very, very important to driving training outcomes. Sure, you know, I also don't think, you know, there's any huge benefit to training without knee sleeves outside of, you know, if you ever forget them, then you're fine. If you wanted to do both, I think that's reasonable as well. I don't really have a strong opinion on this. And so when when I do it, you know, supplemental squat movement, probably be a good place to use it. Pivot weeks, maybe don't wear your knee sleeves. Yeah, those would be the places I wouldn't wear them necessarily. Oh, let's see. High dock. If you have a diet, high saturated fat, but you maintain good, be am I, good, waste or conference, good lean body mass, train hard, and normal blood pressure are you still at risk? Are you still at an increased risk of ASCVD? So ASCVD stands for atheroscerotic cardiovascular disease. So yes, diets, high and saturated fat, compare to diets that are lower and saturated fat tend to increase the risk of atheroscerotic cardiovascular disease. The cut point is about 10% of total daily calories from saturated fat tend to promote deleterious changes in people's lipid profile, meaning that they have more atherogenic lipid profiles, usually LDL, particle concentration, so total LDL count, some evidence with triglycerides in there, but that's for whole another story where the podcast with the flanagan is going to recover this in more and depth. So replacing saturated fats with things like polyunsaturated fatty acids tend to be the most efficacious model in saturated fatty acids still efficacious replacing them with complex carbohydrates that are high in fiber also efficacious at reducing risk of ASCVD against athletic cardiovascular disease. Replacing with sugar makes worse. So yeah, I mean if you're talking about somebody who eats a diet that's got 11% of their total daily calories from saturated fat versus 8% of total daily calories from saturated fats. Probably not big deal to be in that range, but if you're talking about somebody who's following the carnivore diet and their total daily calorie intake, 70% of their total daily calories come from saturated fat and they bring it down 10. That would be a significant improvement. Now, yeah, so having a good BMI, appropriate blood pressure, et cetera, all good things, but there are other components that drive ASCVD. So would not recommend just yellowing your saturated fat Jordan, loving strength 3 so far. One thing I've noticed when I deadlift the first rep of the set usually feels harder than the second and third. Any ideas why? Yeah, this is not an unusual phenomenon. So one, there's this thing called a warm-up effect, or basically you're kind of tentative on the first rep because you're either low-key afraid or scared, then maybe it's going to hurt, and you're not really allowing all of your volitional motor units to kind of fire with maximum force. You kind of have a break on you, a restrictor plate, if you will. And then there's also another thing that we see where people set up for the first rep incorrectly, and they get feedback on that based on how the first rep move and then they fix it for their second and third rep, Sarah Bellum, and other pathways, the brain, it's final quarter like, hey, let's refine this. Let's get you a little more efficient here. So one thing you can do is just pull all of your sets of singles. So you pull a set of five as five singles, one way to kind of make sure that you can get over both of those things that warm-up effect, and then also maybe if your technique needs some refinement. You have any recommendations for someone wanting to start a blog, but not fall into the trap of pedaling misinformation because lack of expertise. Well, a couple tips. If you want to start a resource that you're going to like keep up with and ideally direct people towards. One is to come over the bunch of information before you launch. So that way you're not searching for content immediately. Like you have good content. Two, you know, making confident claims without supporting evidence is problematic. So that's something that you probably should avoid, and I think you'd be okay, Dylan, just knowing you and kind of how your mind works. And then finally, I don't know that I would be writing or opinion about things that I have no expertise in. Just, you know, like, like, I'm trying to think. So for example, I, you know, am not an expert in reproductive physiology. You know, fertility, for example, I know people who are experts in that. And if I wanted to write something about that, and I would probably reach out to them, either having, after having written what I wanted to write and using the appropriate resources to kind of get me closer to the truth. But I would want to make sure that an expert weighs in on something that I don't, you know, you're not necessarily as well a veristin as I'd like to be. Well, that are some good rehab exercises for the Patela. My Patela has been strained and is popping every time I squat and begins to hurt. Yeah. So the Patela is a system-way bone. So you don't really really want to rehab the bone unless it's fractured. But if you have knee pain, then you would want to find ways to train that do not exacerbate your knee pain and allow you to kind of move it through a range of motion underload and ultimately get back to your previous activity level. So if what you're doing now doesn't let you do that, I think that you would first go to exercise modification. So I'm modifying the tempo, the range of motion, the load, all of those things and maybe even the implement that you use, all the reasonable modifications. We can put the knee rehab template, it's available. Also, if you want very specific advice, would recommend doing a consult with Dr. Derek Miles or Dr. Michael Ray, Dr. Michael Amado, these are the best in the biz and they run our pain rehab service. Would you expect to lose strength running the hypertrophy template for an intermediate level lifter who had just come off a couple runs of the bridge 1.0, trying to figure out what to expect. So a good question. So one, I don't think that using the NOMENclature Beginner Intermediate Advanced lifter is terribly useful because it doesn't affect management or expectations. So when somebody tells me they're an intermediate lifter, I don't know what that means and it doesn't make me change their programming. And it's just similarly if someone says they're advanced and like what does that mean? Yeah, rather I think you could have beginners and then non-beginners. So big enters just meaning somebody who's on previously untrained. So what I expect somebody who has just run the bridge 1.0 a few times to get weaker on the hypertrophy template. And so again, strength is specific to what you're training. The bridge 1.0 program is much more focused on swap-inch deadlift than the hypertrophy template is going to be that being said given you know my this theoretical arc that I think you're following in your training program some beginner program and the bridge and the bridge and the hypertrophy program I wouldn't expect to get weaker. I'm probably expecting you get stronger. I actually know some more experienced lifters who've gotten stronger on the hypertrophy template. One guy pulled a PR deadlift and closed to 600 pounds while running the hypertrophy template. So it's my expectation is that you'll do great, you'll do fine. I hope that that is the case, you know, there's the alternative situation where maybe you don't do is great. But at the same time you run an hypertrophy template so I don't know that strength should be your first priority running while running that template. Yeah. During the branch press, right side pushing strength is a lot weaker when grinding heavy reps. The right scapula loses correct position, right arm circumference is also one in smaller. Should I do unilateral training? I don't necessarily think so. I don't know that I'd be grinding out a bunch of reps. It sounds like your technique. Could you some refinement and you know depends how long you've been dealing with this and how long you've been training. You know if you've only been training a year or less. I think there's one of the things that works itself out provided you get on the correct program and you know you probably shouldn't be grinding most or any of your reps because it's just not useful. Is there a big improvement from eating 10 fruits and veggies per day versus five? Yeah. So those dependent relationship between plant matter consumption and overall health outcomes. So yes, is there anything inherently wrong? Oh, this is a good setup. Is there anything inherently wrong with rocking for conditioning? It's about the only form of cardio that I find. I can enthusiastically adhere to. That's fine. I mean, I think it does limit the breath of the breath of your conditioning sort of adaptations because you're not engaging in your rowing or cycling or anything else like that. So if you wanted to have a broad base of physical sort of conditioning, you would want to have exposed yourself to more training, right? More different types of training rather than just one. But you'll be great at rocking. Jordan just finished week one of the bridge. Is there a reason why day three starts with deadlift instead of squat? Yeah. We want you to deadlift fresh. There's nothing inherently better about starting with the squat first all the time. We're not trying to prioritize the squat over the deadlift. We're trying to prioritize strength in the squat bench and deadlift on the program. Also, can I do the paused bench after the tempo squat? I would not. I would rather have you do the paused bench fresher and the tempo squat with more fatigue. It'll decrease the weight on the tempo squats and increase the weight on the pause bench relative than if you flop if you flip them. Yeah. Hey, what form of conditioning would you recommend for the vast majority of power lifters, treadmill, stationary bike, undue both treadmill, stationary bike, a rower? Yeah. All that sort of stuff sledwork. Yeah. There's not a specific type. I would do a lot of different types. Physiologically, what genetic differences are there between two people with the same sex, anthropometry, body composition, muscle mass and training history, but different Wilkes scores? So I think the last time I looked at this, there were close to 76 identified genetic loci that are associated with a distinct, like close to 1% or greater, athletic advantage. So, and that was, I mean, I looked at that. That must have been a year ago. I think it was the last time. I actually did a deeper dive in that. It would not surprise me if at this point we're close to 100. And at the end of it all, when we've fully characterized this thing, we're talking about hundreds of different gene loci. So, yeah, a lot of different things, a lot of different things. ACT and 3 gene is like the most well characterized one, but there's again a plethora of them. Whenever I calculate my weight for, let's say, RP-9 from an RP-8, I always overshoot and do RP-10. Always happens with upper body lifts. I rest three minutes. And by doing something wrong, you could rest longer, you know, three, you know, four minutes. If it's a conditioning thing, depends how long you've been training, or just take more conservative jumps. We'll be the two strategies to use there. I don't think taking rest periods that are longer than like five minutes are very productive for training, you know, unless you're really close to a meat and you're trying to simulate meat situations where you're going to have much longer rest periods. But yeah, more taking more conservative jumps, be a good idea. Have you ever done RP-8's off a deficit, so the same range of motion as a deadlift from the floor? Yes, although I do stiff leg of deadlift like that. So typically with RP-8's, the idea for me, it's not a, I'm not trying to mimic the same range of motion. I'm trying to really work the top down while maintaining the normal extension of the spine. And then again, I'm trying to make it a little less fatiguing than pulls from the floor. stiff leg of deadlift's off a deficit and that being a little, you know, about the same amount of fatigues, a regular deadlift if you're using similar RPs and rep ranges, but usually you'll do them for higher reps. When to take creatine for best results, there's no best time. Just as long as you take it every day. I did a video about this. It's on the tubes, on the barbell medicine channel. So I would recommend watching that on a creatine dosing. Hey Jordan thoughts on creatine causing hair loss. Apparently there was a study with rugby players and maybe you've seen it. Yes, so there was not about creatine and hair loss. It was about creatine and DHT levels. So DHT levels are in general associated like higher DHT levels are in general associated with male pattern baldness. However, DHT levels fluctuate throughout the day. DHT receptor density. So that's target side of activity. Also fluctuate in response to DHT levels. And so just saying that something increase the DHT doesn't necessarily mean it increases male pattern baldness and that study did not actually look at male pattern baldness at all. So right now, we don't really have evidence that this occurs. And further, I think the big thing is if you have male pattern baldness, if it runs in your family, like there's not a lot that you can do to make that better. There are some medications that you can take that may preserve some hair. But as far as actually like and then accelerating it, if you take anabolic endogenic steroids that tends to accelerate male pattern baldness, but creatine, I don't think is quite there yet. So does VO2 max increase benefits, hypertrophy strength in any way other than quicker recovery between sets? Oh, does VO2 max increase hypertrophy or strength in any way other than quicker recovery between sets? Yeah, so outside of improved work capacity, so that you're ready to train more readily for the next set, you also can handle more training which you'll actually need because there's a dose dependent relationship between training volume and strength in hypertrophy. So hey Jordan, thanks for taking the time to do these and answering our questions. You're welcome. How much weight loss would you recommend in a specific period? Currently at 217 stars from 232 would it be beneficial to take a break from a calorie deficit? Yeah, so again, depends on context. If you have a person who's going to be adherent either way, I don't see a reason to take a break from the diet. It's not necessarily going to improve outcomes unless it would improve adherence. If adherence is good, and there and or there's some indication to continue losing weight because the risk of not losing weight is greater than the benefits of maintaining weight than I would encourage for their weight loss. Usually 2.5% body weight per month is kind of the recommendation there. Jordan, my biomechanics professors says deep squats is horrible for your knees and I cringed. They just ask him for citation. He's asking for citation and you can there's a shown field study and a heartman, HAAR, TMAA and and is it 2a's or 2 ends or both? I forget those two recent studies on squat, biomechanics actually like fully rebuts anything your biomechanics professor suggests about this and then I'm kind of like, why is this his opinion? Each Jordan do you recommend adding any conditioning routines? Say once per week for the novices starting linear progression. Yeah, well one I don't recommend starting linear progression. I think the program has many holes in it and it would not and conditioning is one of them would not recommend. I would recommend you start our beginner template. It's much better program for most individuals and includes conditioning and that would be my recommendation for conditioning for untrained individuals. I believe you said that the bench press responds better to higher volume than say the back squat. Nope, I didn't say that. Yeah, there's a dose dependent relationship between training volume and strength and hypertrophy and this is, you know, universal like as far as absolute amounts. It might be higher for upper body stuff, but I don't necessarily believe that to be true either. Yeah, hey cool glasses. Thanks. Finally out of a rotation and able to catch this live. Gonna enjoy this with some wine. Cheers. Cheers. Top of Chico. Drink a champions. I feel like I should put this out of the frame. So like we're not advertising for them. Thanks for taking a pic with me at Ron Nationals. It was great meeting you guys. We also need those barbell medicine singlets to come back. Yeah, we're uh, it's also man. Good to see you on here. I think we're gonna make some SPD singlets with the barbell medicine logo on them with SPD. They like our stuff and we like their stuff. So it's gonna be great. Jordan and deadlift bench and press are all going up. Okay. Squat has been stuck at 344 for about eight months. Should I just quit lifting and do Pilates instead? Probably not. I'd be one curious to know what programming you're running and you know overall what your squad is looked like in the last eight months from a, you know, a progression or regressions standpoint. Yeah, but if your deadlift is going up and your bench is going up, it seems like you still have some progress left in you. Since older adults are more anoblockly resistant than younger folks. How many grams per kilo body weight of protein do you recommend per day? Yeah, so the recommendations from S bin for healthy aging. I believe is 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram body weight per day that means that our general recommendation includes older individuals 1.6, oh it's 3.1 grams per kilo per day just depending on you know other context contextual factors like gaining weight losing weight you know some disease that makes them more anoblock resistant or not. But yeah, you know if you get close to that one gram per pound which is 2.2 grams per kilogram body weight per day then you're gonna be okay. I don't know that you need to make it more complicated than that. Doc or the bridge 3.0 and strength 1 significantly different. They are yes trying to decide whether or not to buy strength 1, I already own bridge 3. Yeah, so I think you know if you are gonna limit if you're gonna train 3 days per week and you're interested in driving up your bench press your squat and your deadlift strength 1 is the plan. If you can expand your training to 4 days a week will do strength 2. Yeah, given that you were just ran the bridge 3.0 is stimulation of the lymphatic system via foam rolling one of the reasons people find a perceived benefit from it. No the foam rolling does not stimulate the lymphatic system because it's you know not you can you know mechanical compression can like move things around but it's not stimulating. Yeah foam rolling does not do anything does not decrease injury risk doesn't decrease pain or or things like doms to late onset muscle soreness doesn't increase risk of injury and it actually can reduce performance and potentially cause harm as well if you have a very aggressive foam rolling session. It makes you feel better I mean that's cool I would do it after training but I would not recommend people do it to start out with. The main thing is it builds these narratives that are not great like the narrative that builds is that you need to do this sort of thing mechanically to repair yourself restore yourself because you otherwise broke and damaged and are like a car or a machine. When that's not true we are highly adaptable highly resilient you know biological organisms. So is there a general recommendation for how much one should increase training volume if they decided more volume is necessary? No unfortunately not. Yeah I think you know usually somewhere that 10 to 20 percent range weekly volume tends to be like my sweet spot yeah. Current med student can't really afford to pay for the templates any alternatives I mean the beginner to intermediate range. Well our beginner prescription is free it's free download bridge 1.0 is a free download general strength training program is free download that being said I mean I was in med school I remember and I think you know one not a drinkin with your with the buddies you know that gets you a template. So yeah can creatine lead to urinating more frequently. No not that I've not that I've seen any data on so. Do you think fasting 24 hours one time per week is an acceptable strategy for calorie reduction? No I don't. Yeah the data on intermittent fasting suggests that people don't lose more weight when they do it. The the attrition rate is a little higher but maybe not statistically significant between so the dropout rate right for people in intermittent fasting arms versus regular calorie restriction arms is similar although maybe a little higher intermittent fasting although again it might not be significant so I don't know if that's really a valid criticism you know on the other hand if someone prefers intermittent fasting that's fine but just doing it one day a week it doesn't fix the the main problem which is dietary patterns is just doing something one day a week it's a might be a decent start for somebody you know to get them in the right headspace to get them more resources more tools or strategies to adhere to a calorie restricted diet but this is not going to be enough for most folks physician prescribed testosterone for short-term fat loss thoughts I mean for that indication nope but you're usually more of the story than that so would reserve judgment but yeah not a great medication for a term fat loss just for that indication alone. On bench my feet tend to slip on my lifting platform any coding to put down on the platform or possibly something on my shoes if you're on wood you know like a pot like a wooded platform might use rubber mats underneath the bench underneath your feet if you put carpet over it that would work do you have any ab work besides what you naturally occurs in a lift we all see you doing regularly yeah do a lot of ab wheel rollouts of these hits else it's stuff like that yeah random topic change but it saw the story about the new oh lenses yeah why did you get a 50 but out of 35 and what Sony body do you shoot with so I have a 35 1.2 sigma art lens I have their 24 1.4 so I have a bunch of primes now I think my prime collection is set for video work I have a a 6587R3 so what should you do I feel like it's hard to train consistently in medical school do you have any tips yeah I mean I can empathize because you know you're very busy and you may not have the biggest fortunate to have either gym in your garage or a gym that's on campus or close to you or whatever but honestly medical school like especially the preclinical years there's like a substantial amount of time to train and if you're not going to take the 60 minutes or 90 minutes out of your day to dedicate to your own well-being your own you know health I don't know how to convince you that that's more important than something else I think there's all this pressure also like I can understand like all this pressure you gotta learn everything you have to know everything and whatever but like you know if you're really unhealthy and really unhappy and training helps you know make you healthier and happier then I think you have to engage in training and yeah also I talked about this on our training podcasts or medical podcast yeah I don't know I was not something that I struggled with but if it were me and I was struggling with it then I would just I would literally schedule it I'd put it in my phone after whenever my last you know mandatory thing is I have to go to the gym I'd make sure I have my gym close you know on my bag or in my car if I drove to camp and then I would go yeah so I would do Jordan to what extent is I purchased for you possible without a calorie surplus my current thinking is the more trained a person the less this is possible yeah general you know the more trained you become the less it's possible also you know there's a big genetic component here you know maybe 50 60 70% of the hypertrophy potential of persons genetically you know influenced or determined you know guided you know people aren't gonna like that but you know sometimes it do be like that in any event I think that if you're not gaining weight the idea that you're gaining substantial amounts of lean body mass probably not true some people will yeah particularly the less trained they are the more favorable genetic profile is yeah our slower rates of weight loss beneficial from a loose skin perspective not from any objective standpoint that I've seen no what's the link between osteoarthritis and wear and tear so since you're in medical school I'm gonna use the secratic method and direct you to our resources on osteoarthritis but let's just here's a thought experiment for the people at home so osteoarthritis previously was you know and maybe sometimes currently depending on who's given the diagnosis it was referred to as a diagnosis of wear and tear you're wear and tear on the joints which is and then when you talk about obesity people who have a higher rates of osteoarthritis is because you're putting more force more pressure on the joints it's like okay if that's your explanation will why why do obese people also have osteoarthritis in their wrists and fingers and elbows these non-weight-bearing joints this makes sense right so one of the connections between obesity and osteoarthritis that also kind of loosadated these pathways other pathways of osteoarthritis have to do with the dipocines and other sort of inflammatory signaling molecules that ultimately can cause osteoarthritis was the best thing for osteoarthritis usually physical activity yeah like first line treatment and addition education thoughts on fiber supplementation it's reasonable yeah silly musk it's fun I think you know after you're recommending eating more fruits and vegetables that can be reasonable recommendation sure what's the correlation between heavy squats and ascending aortic aneurysm no correlation yeah yeah fortunately ascending aortic aneurysms are rare and ascending the aortic aneurysms endurance squatting are also rare this funny because at a seminar in New York this guy wrote down on his you know intake form like that he had an ascending aortic aneurysm and I was like I went up to him and I was like hey man is this okay like if you've been clear to exercise by your doctor you know he goes well yeah I'm a doctor also you know etc etc and I was like okay as long as you guys know when an agreement we're good to go here Jordan do you think there is an anecdotal correlation between upper body muscle mass and bench press performance I don't just think there's an anecdotal correlation I think there's empirical you know and and also just objective scientific evidence between upper body muscle mass and bench press performance yeah so according to my calculations I've been here for like almost an hour so thank you so much for watching here in Instagram YouTube wherever you're checking this out right 5 p.m. a fast ticking can get high with me as a deal right as a deal right as a bit right

=== FILE: Livestream Q⧸A 10.8.2019： Red Meat, Hypertrophy, Steroids, and MORE! [fxqiG4n1Jk4].txt ===

Hey, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine Instagram Live. I am Dr. Jordan Fagamab. It is the 8th of October doing Instagram Live Q&A, first off some announcements, thing number one, yesterday posted a new training blog over on the YouTube channel. You're on YouTube right now. You can click back and check that out. It's got a training. We talked about sad extraction. We talked about cancer and exercise and a bunch of other cool stuff and review some of the user submitted form checks. Other things, newsletter is dropping this weekend before Saturday. So if you're not signed up for a newsletter list, you should do that. An announcement number three, these shirts, there's this color way, there's black, there's also a navy blue. Those are going to be available very shortly. They've already shipped to our distributors, so keep a lookout on the website for that. And then we've got at least one new template dropping this week. So our Titan 2 template, also a couple free downloads for the impending cross-foot open. So a bunch of cool stuff coming up. So be sure to keep checking the website, follow us on Instagram, YouTube, wherever you want to partake in your Barbell Medicine Daily dosing. Now let's see if we get into some questions you guys have submitted by Instagram. I'm recording this for YouTube. We'll be up there later, provide us some good questions, good content, etc. The thing is streaming live on YouTube is problematic. Not only for views because the algorithm, but also just internet bandwidth and yeah, it's not great. Anyway, let's see if we can get some questions from you guys and go from there. Do you have a dog or are you planning on getting a doggo? Yes, so the context for this is I posted a new trial that came out. This was in New England Journal of Medicine, Journal Watch. And they were talking about how dog ownership actually has tenancy towards the lowering cardiovascular and all cause mortality. I don't have a dog mainly because I move quite frequently and places, certain places that I've lived don't allow pets. Although the place I'm in now does allow pets and there's actually a dog park in the building, which is kind of nice. But I don't have a dog yet, but maybe maybe, maybe soon. Freaking Cardinals on subscribe. Yeah, I'm a Cardinals fan. I mean, as far as sports go, the Cardinals are tied to two with the braves. I mean, I feel like every season seems like in the postseason we end up playing the braves. But yeah, from St. Louis, I'm a Cardinals fan. You can also subscribe. Hey, Jordan recently I've been eating a poor diet in terms of not getting a lot of fruits or vegetables. Just after in just after recovering fully from a small flare of colitis, but still feel tired every day. Yeah, so if you actually had colitis and you have a medical condition like ulcerative colitis or something like that, I would definitely work that up with your doctor and then they're associated nutrition professional rather than kind of trying to self-manage this. I don't think that's the play here. But in a more general sense, we do recommend that people try to get 10 servings of fruit and vegetables per day. So that's five and five, six and four or something like that. The idea is one, it's going to automatically make sure that you're taking in a pretty good dose of fiber or your our goal of fiber goals would be 30, 35 grams of fiber per day to the fiber nutrients, the final sterols, and some of these foods, the flavinoids, etc. All these other fruit and vegetable nutrients that are isolated to these types of foods tend to be very health-promoting. We have a pretty good evidence suggesting that consuming fruits and vegetables tend to promote tend to be health-promoting. So would recommend, this is general rule, 10 servings of fruit-vegeted per day. You can split that up however you want to. Would you say that bench press and overhead press is enough for front debt-delta development. So the anterior deltoid, I guess it depends on who you're talking about. If you're talking about a beginner and you're looking and you're talking about muscle growth of the anterior deltoid or the entire deltoid all three muscle bellies or all the muscles of the shoulder girdle, yeah, you could make an argument that bench press and overhead press probably along with a row and something like maybe a vertical pull as well would be enough to develop all of that in a fairly untrained individual. Although there's no real need to restrict them to those movements. They're not any better for developing hypertrophy in the deltoid or the muscles of the shoulder girdle than other exercises like dumbbell bench or dumbbell press or dip or weighted pushups potentially or incline bench or literally just hammer strength. Again, as long as the range of motion is similar or exercise that have a large range of motion that you can progressively overload with weight and or with weight and training volume, then really the biggest kind of limiting factor towards hypertrophy is going to be how much volume can you do without incurring too much fatigue. So probably movements that are not compound movements are probably going to have to get into the program for bodybuilding purposes. So the question was, is the bench press and overhead press enough for front deltoid development? I mean, if we're talking from a hypertrophy standpoint and we're talking long term, the answer is no. You're probably going to have to do some isolation work for that. If you're talking about for strength purposes, then I wouldn't think about individual muscle groups. Yeah, I know that is kind of a longer answer and soundbites are preferred, but I would just try to get out of the mindset of, you know, is this enough for one particular muscle? I don't know, just doesn't seem like a good kind of thought process or useful thought process that I think engaging in regularly. I think I just not do that. Let's see, why do people say red meat is bad for you? Well, because, well, I'll get to that. Okay, here we go. Why do people say red meat is bad for you? Does it actually contribute to increasing LDLs or does eating too many calories and gaining weight from a calorie surplus contribute to high LDLs? Thanks. So a couple different issues here. So there's definitely evidence out there suggesting that high intake of red meat can increase certain rates of cancer. Okay, particularly colorectal cancers, the thing we have the most data on. So you look at the IARC International Association Research International Association for Research on Cancer and compile all the data on the process and unprocessed red meat consumption and incidence of colorectal cancer. And yeah, there seems to be a link there. So the recommendation right now is to limit the number of servings per week to about three servings of red meat per week. And then when you go, when you talk about LDLs, so LDL means low density lipoprotein, lipoprotein is just a lipid and a protein. Lipids cannot really travel through the blood on their own. They need to be carried around by a protein. So that's the protein component of the lipoprotein. So LDL is not cholesterol. LDL is cholesterol that's packed into a protein. And so that's what you measure on a standard lipid test for example. It does eating saturated fat intake, which is generally in a pretty good, it's contained in a pretty good amount in most red meat. Does consuming higher intakes of saturated fat tend to increase LDL lipoprotein count. And the answer is yes. We have this in multiple lines of evidence. So metabolic word studies were they actually admit people to either research facility or hospital and keep them under locking key and feed them all the certain things. Okay, increasing dietary saturated fat intake above a certain level tends to promote increase number of LDL. And then further when you replace saturated fat intake with things like monotentrated fats, polyensaturated fats, whole grain foods, fruits and veg, or protein, you tend to get a drop in LDL. And LDL is associated high LDLs, the single best predictor we have from a lipid panel as far as predicting ASCVD, which means aploscerotic cardiovascular disease, which includes things like heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, etc. So yeah, hopefully that answered some of all your questions. And if the take home is, should you eat all this unlimited ounce of red meat, the answer that is no. And so diets like the carnivore diet and some iterations of the ketogenic diet tend to be less, a tend to have some risk associated with them and depends on the potential benefits somebody's getting from that diet. So weight loss, yes, can affect weight loss and weight gain can affect your total your cholesterol panel. But you know, I would not try to think about that independent of red meat intake when you're thinking about constructing dietary patterns that are health promoting. And the other thing is, I don't think that the fact that I'm not a doctor is often doing raw national's, nope. And will you ever do another raw national's of future? I mean, maybe. Yeah, I just don't really like coaching and lifting the same weekend. Not really fun for me. And yeah, I don't think that I want to at this point participate in the USAPL for now. Doesn't mean forever, but for now. What's a good belt style or brand preference? Thanks for doing these. Yeah, I don't really have a belt preference, like far as brand goes. I have a best belts, which is made by Dean Best. I think it's fine. Pioneer belts also tend to make a good product. Inzer has got a ready made belt. If you get just a black color, then you can actually get it shipped to you within a reasonable amount of time. Everything else is going to take you a long time. The SPD lever belt is very expensive, but also very good. I just think a four inch single prong belt. It's 13 millimeters thick. It tends to be the default size rather that I recommend and for most folks. I think getting it from Pioneer or Best Belt reasonable choice there. Thoughts on Mad Cal, 5x5 program. Yeah, I don't think it's very good. So it was good in the period of the internet where free training resources were limited. But now there's a bunch of free stuff on the internet. There's a lot of limitations. There are a lot of limitations to the Mad Cal program. If you like it, that's great. But my opinion, I wouldn't advise somebody to run that. No. How to target different parts of the thighs for hypertrophy? Well, I assume you just mean quadriceps versus hamstrings because you're not really able to target different areas of the quadricep versus different areas of the hamstring. Unless you're talking about not targeting the rectus femurus muscle, which is a quadricep muscle that crosses both the hip and the knee joint. And tends to not get fully activated until there's a substantial amount of fatigue in the quadriceps already. So one training the quadz, knee extension, hip flexion, mostly knee extension, going to be the big one and then training knee flexion. Some hip extension is going to train the hamstrings. What if an exercise is to choose from? So it takes me at least 20 minutes to get through an exercise. Warm up in the work sets is that too long. I spent at least 2 hours in the gym, want to cut down. I mean, 20 minutes to get through an exercise is not long. If you're doing 3 exercises each time, that's an hour. So I'd want to know why it's taking you 2 hours then to get it in. If it takes you 20 minutes to get through an exercise, the warm up in the work sets. That's what I'd want to know. Yep. It possible to start steadily gaining weight without a significant change in diet. I mean, yeah, if you eat the exact same thing, then you become much less active. You could start gaining weight. That happens, or potentially if you start medication, that promotes weight gain, particularly with the water retention. Yeah, all sorts of things can conspire or can found. You're sort of weight variable depending on what's going on. That's worse. Smoking or obesity. I don't know that I could say that one is worse. I mean, obesity definitely has its hands in more chronic diseases and you could make an argument that it's the healthcare costs and the quality of life suffering from being obese. Maybe it's more substantial than smoking, but smoking is still pretty bad. You prefer neither of those things to affect somebody. Our speed reps on the main lifts beneficial. Example 10 sets of 3 with the lightweight and under a minute rest. I mean, if you want to get better at producing force at high velocity, so high velocity force production, sure. You would want to train that via high velocity training, which you have to do it a lightweight. It doesn't really help with low velocity force production, which are heavy, that's heavy, heavy weight lifting. Heavy heavy strength training. Then doing it on a one minute rest doesn't mean anything. All it's doing is limiting your ability to actually produce high velocity force production. So it turns to be it tends to be in a little more conditioning. And then may actually be able to stimulate a little bit of, excuse me, hypertrophy via the fatigue that's generated through that the artificially short rest periods, whereas it wouldn't if you had a longer rest period and you were just squatting 55% for doubles or triples for 10 sets. Probably not a big hypertrophy stimulus there unless you get fatigued enough by the end of those by doing them every minute on the minute that you're actually getting substantial motor unit recruitment. What kind of uses substitute for a pit shark or belt squat? You're going to need a loading pin and a dip belt. You can do that and stand on boxes and do a belt squat like that. You could also have a landmine attachment where you have a barbell jammed in the landmine and then use your dip belt on one end of that and you do it like that. There's also a way I guess you could do it theoretically on like something with like a low pulley set up where you can stand above it and hook a dip belt to that. Those would all work. Yeah. Have you ever tested how many words you can type in a minute? I'm tempted to do it but I'm not going to do it because I don't want to waste everybody's time for a minute. Coming to the Miami seminar stoked very cool. Yeah, we're selling out. So upcoming educational opportunities via barbell medicine. So our Boston, pain and rehab seminar sold out. We have, I think, two spots left are Portland seminar, our regular barbell medicine seminar with Dr. Barackie and I December wall off January will be in Reno for pain and rehab seminar with Dr. Michael Ray and Dr. Derek Miles. I'll be in Reno with those cats and then we'll be in Miami as well Dr. Barackie, Leah, Tom, Allen, the whole crew will be down at Steffi Cohen's gym, hybrid performance in Miami. The first weekend of January. So still some spots open for that. So get signed up today. Otherwise you can miss your spot. A close grip bench is stronger than my competition bench, which has a wider grip, is this unusual? Yes. Do you recommend using a wider grip bench for long term investment as most people say it uses more chest musketeer? Well, most people will be wrong. It doesn't use more chest musketeer, more chest musketeer. In fact, when you look at studies on actual muscle recruitment with different grips, there's almost no difference in any grip provided the range of motion is the same. So that's close grip versus wide grip versus thumbs from the smooth or something like that. I think through the three conditions that were tested under similar relative intensities. So it sounds like your competition bench is either you've newly switched your grip to a wider grip because somebody told you that you should and it's not yet trained compared to your close grip bench or your wide grip, your competition bench is just too wide for your current strength and current training development. So yeah, it just depends what you want. If you're not going to compete, it immediately doesn't matter. You can play around with it if you want, but I don't think necessarily that having a wider grip bench necessarily correlates to a higher bench potential. Yeah, I don't see that you see just such a huge inter-individual variation. And for more on that, I talk about this in the Bench prescription video that we made with Alan Thrall. It's available on our channel. Yeah, check it out. Just started a week five of the legacy 12-week strength template and we'll surprise to see 5-3-0 tempo squats are in for just one week. Yeah, it's just in there for the pivot week. Yep. Is there any chance of you and Austin being guests on the Joe Rogan show? I mean, I guess it's possible, but it's not like Joe's called the stuff and we're just turning him down. So I think that how this works is Joe has to invite you on a show. And I don't know that he's going to invite us. Recently after squat days, when I stand up for my desk, my VMOs cramp up really bad. Being, barbell medicine stands is that this is a sign of not recovering well. Oh, there's a lot to unpack here. So one, the VMO stands for the Vassus Medialis Obliques. The, this was, this is a made up muscle. It doesn't actually exist based on any criteria we have anatomically. This was made up by a physical therapist in the 60s looking at four recently amputated legs. They found that there were fibers at the end of the Vassus Medialis, which is one of the muscles of the quadriceps. They found that the distal end of it right by the knee had these Oblique running fibers and they called it the VMO. Actually later, petitioned Namananatamica, which at the time was responsible for naming all these muscles. They petitioned that group to actually say that there was a VLO as well. So they were trying to not only add a muscle to the sort of dictionary of muscles and the VMO, they were also going to add the VLO and then they wanted to rename the quadriceps to the sexist ups because now there are six heads anyway. None of that worked. The VMO is not a real muscle. Cramps generally, I guess you could maybe call it a sign of not recovering well because it just means that fatigue was relatively high unless there's some medical condition, but most of the most folks keep cramping is just a little bit too much fatigue. Doesn't mean anything if it goes away. If it just happens when you stand up from your desk and then it goes away. It just could be positional. I don't know, wouldn't really worry about it. Jordan, popular question on YouTube currently. What do you think is harder bodybuilding or powerlifting? I don't know. I've never done bodybuilding, never competed in a bodybuilding show. So I don't think that I can actually say which one is harder. Both of them are the problems and the suffering and the difficulty. These are all champagne problems. If you can actually afford to engage in this recreational pursuit of strength or muscle size, then doing okay. You're doing okay in this world. I probably wouldn't try to say one is harder than the other one is more suffering than the other. It's lifting weights. Jordan, what does the evidence say on the efficacy of regular mouthwash use as well as flossing? Thanks in advance. Yeah, I don't know. That's dental stuff and dentistry. The evidence-based model for dentistry is slowly emerging but it's far behind the medical evidence-based medicine sort of movement. So yeah, I'm not sure. Discarnations compressing nerves can fully heal. Indeed they can. Yeah. That's like a Googleful thing. You just Google that and you're like, yep, pops up. Cool. Hey, Jordan. I love your stuff. Thanks buddy. It has all been very informative and helpful for my growth in moving weight efficiently. Thanks, man. Thank you. Thanks for saying that. Yeah, I gas up one of your friends. You know, just hype them up. Call them up and say, hey, you're doing great. I miss you. I like you. Something like that. It's positive positive vibes. That'd be good. Right. Let's see. Jordan just finished the high-purchase for template yesterday. Going back to strength week one tomorrow pulled 405 or set a seven nice man. Cool program. Yeah. Awesome, brand and nice. Can leg press and RDL replace the squat and deadlift if the only goal is high-purchary. Yeah, sure can. Sure can. I would actually argue that the RDL is probably better for high-purchary the hamstrings and potentially even glutes than the deadlift. I mean, really again, which you're looking for is range of motion. The ability to progressively overload via adding weight and reps volume being more important here than absolute intensity. And then the ability to do a bunch of reps and sets without getting too fatigued. So you think about like, how, you know, what could you do more of in a given week or a given session without incurring way too much fatigue that would overwhelm the system and compromise your high-purchase response to the training. Leg press is going to be better in a squat RDL. Since it's a little lighter, you know, but you still have a really long range of motion range of motion is very similar, especially for the hamstrings and glutes and erectors. It's probably a better choice from a fatigue standpoint, although, you know, I could argue it's not that much different, but it may be a little bit, maybe a little bit better. And then people really get worked up about what you can use more weight on the squat. Well, not really than a leg press, but, you know, then a leg extensions, like, a little shore, but the question isn't how much absolute weight can you use? The question is how much motor unit recruitment can you get? And we know that, you know, doing sets of, you can get the same amount of motor unit recruitment doing sets of five and sets of 30. You know, just it, as long as you're willing to go near to the near failure, the question isn't, you know, how much motor, you know, recruitment can you get by the second rep of a set. Question is how much total motor unit recruitment did you get at the end of a whole set? How many reps were stimulating the sort of muscle growth? And then how many of those sets can you do in a given week and to give a session? So anyway, I think people try to overly complicate this high-purchasing thing, and really what you need to do is pick exercises that have a big range of motion can be loaded or done for enough reps that generate that stimulate motor unit recruitment and then that you can do enough volume of them to continue to drive high-purchreat for you over time. And I don't know if having an allegiance to a particular movement is a great way to be a great way to think about high-purchreat. Hey, Jordan is doing leg extension machine, bad for your knees. Nope. I don't know things that are bad for your knees except for maybe acute trauma at high-velocity, an, you know, acute uncontrolled movement at high-velocity might be bad for your knees or like other people hitting it. But yeah, people are like, oh, it's open chain and there's this long moment arm on the knee. It's like, so what? Yeah, tissues adapt. People get better. They're able to tolerate more stuff. Is there evidence to show a salt craving is relevant to actual hydration slash electrolyte imbalance? So those are completely different things. Hydration and electrolyte imbalance, although sometimes they happen. Same time. Gen general people, the thirst response to exercise or sweating in an active environment tends to be a little delayed. And then as far as craving salt, most individuals won't have a conscious sort of, you know, hey, I'm craving salty things. Most people won't. But and that's because we tend to consume enough sodium in our diet. And in general, you can't make yourself significantly hyponetremic, low-low sodium in a way that's clinically meaningful from exercising or competition unless you're doing something fairly extreme or you've suffered like heat stroke or heat-related illness. And, you know, that's then again, one of the things you would you look for is potentially a hydration issue, salt, salt issue. But we're talking about people doing two days, three days training or team-based sports and then doing something silly like drinking, you know, 10 gallons of free water or a gatorade or something like that to in order to get rehydrated. That those sort of things would be the real reasons why you get this sort of hyponetremia, this low salt level that's actually clinically meaningful and meaning that can cause symptoms potentially bad outcomes. Most people after the exercise are hyponetremic. It's just this, you know, thing that happens but it's not clinically significant. It doesn't do anything and it resolves on its own when we eat food. And actually the recommendation is to add sodium to both pre-imposed workout meals. That being said, most people probably enough dietary sodium anyway, it's probably not a big deal. Yeah. How would you explain to a friend why a multivitamin is not beneficial? It's a good question. I probably wouldn't actually explain to them that it's not beneficial unless they ask me because otherwise I'm just wasting my breath. Yeah, multivitamin is not associated with reduced mortality or morbidity that's diseases. If anything, it's related, particularly high doses of antioxidants, high doses of other vitamins are associated with bad outcomes like increased rates of cancer. For example, increase all cost mortality risk. So no benefit to show no evidence really to show benefit outside of patients who need to take a multivitamin due to either a problem absorbing vitamins or or some sort of very, very restricted diet and where their doctor would be prescribing them, sort of multivitamin supplementation. So these are people who have like gastric bypass or who've had like a part of their ilium removed or other parts of the GI tract operated on and then they might have to take supplement or you know people who have like cystic fibrosis or other issues with a malabsorption as a concern or just superscripted diet. Those are the patients that get prescribed multivitamin's you know among others but just your general you know otherwise healthy person you have multivitamin's don't do anything. It's waste your money. Any recommendations on resistance training focus for boxers. How does muscle fibrotypes play into resistance training goals for athletes like this? Muscle fibrotypes are mostly genetically predetermined. You can get some shifting within different fibrotypes type 1 and type 2. They don't go from type 1 to type 2 but in the type 2 muscle fibers you can get some switching from high velocity force producing muscle fibers to low velocity force producing fibers and back and forth depending on training. So yeah just for boxers I think you know conditioning would be obviously be a focus and then doing it significantly more high velocity strength work than I would somebody who is not involved in explosive sport like that. Sure. Does your body get accustomed to a lower calorie diet meaning you start to burn less and less fat? Well as you lose weight, sure. Yeah you're your uh based on metabolic rate goes down, total daily energy expenditure goes down. Some evidence suggesting that part of your needs non exercise aerobic thermogenesis basically just calories you burn from non formal exercise you tend to move around a little bit less but in general in general this doesn't seem to preclude weight loss in a calorie when people are actually in a calorie deficit. You know people tend to continuously lose weight under controlled sort of situations. I think said weight loss can be difficult for sure. How would you approach your client if they were worried about one leg being significantly stronger than the other? Yeah no that's a good question. I think it would just depend you'd want to get more information. So one you'd want to know why they're concerned about it how they did they assess this because there are things like you know hamstrings asymmetry this this that do predict a higher risk of certain injuries in certain team sports particularly soccer for example and so in that how you would assess that is effectively doing you know one leg up to like a set of eight repetitions at RP eight or nine or something like that on one leg and then do it on the other leg and see oh is there an asymmetry and if it's above a certain level then maybe that confers an increased risk in soccer but in Bartel training probably not. That being said what you're gonna find is uh is that that tends to be eliminated via resistance training period meaning that the weak side when you're doing these biolateral exercises when you're doing the the the the the the weak muscle quote unquote tends to get a little bit greater stimulus than the stronger muscle you know provided technique and range of motion are are are relatively similar from rep to rep and that and then on top of that I think that including unilateral work can be useful too I don't know that I would just focus on all bilateral stuff I don't see a good reason for that so uh I think between you know just having that conversation and and and and maybe seeing if you need to take a step further but the final word on this is we're all asymmetrical every one of those asymmetrical no one has has equal strength side side or antagonist agonist and and that's some of that is by you know is is been selected for you know over over millennia but that's another podcast anyone in particular you're excited to see compete at Ron Ashinals sure Leo Lutz I'm excited to see her lift and go out and smash some PRs Claire Claire's eyes she's gonna go out in the 72 kilo prime time class and smash some PRs that to be cool Sam Calhoun our Austin's client she's gonna go out in 63 kilo prime time along with Lorraine Baraki Austin's wife they're gonna both be in prime time I'm really excited to see how they do anybody else that I am excited to watch yeah I don't know probably not what medical school was medical school worthwhile to you would you have chosen a different route yet no I thought medical school was fine for me I think the only thing I would have done differently I mean I got a master's degree in clinical anatomy and physiology prior to going medical school which I actually found the education to be super valuable and the skills learned in the knowledge the front of knowledge like great and and honestly help refine my study technique allowed me to do so well in medical school so from like actual like skill development I thought it was great but the actual how did that transfer to helping me get in a medical school was not that great mainly because it's hard to evaluate like how rigorous a master's program is compared to more undergraduate coursework so I think it would have made me more competitive applicant to do the same number of additional credit hours in undergraduate science education help bring my GPA up make myself more competitive than the actual master's program I did although the skills and fund of knowledge gained from doing the master's program I think was superior to anything I could have done undergraduate wise but yeah medical school was great I just it would have been nicer to have a better I guess pick of which medical schools that I wanted to go to but hey it all worked out I'm at Austin and his wife and a couple other good friends from medical school that was you know obviously been worthwhile and so maybe it all supposed to work out like this would you review a snatch or clean and jerk video for a future training vlog maybe yeah I'm not putting it I'm not saying no thoughts on strong lift 5 by 5 similar to starting strength 5 by 5 based on redgpark starting strength is not 5 by 5 is 3 by 5 and strong lift 5 by 5 actually met Medi in London I think you know if you need a place to start for your resistance training it's fine out for you do our beginner template the beginner prescriptions are free version we think that's how people should start training and also sort of reading that text a lot gives people a better lay of the land for like why they're doing this what's the what the next steps are etc but you know I'm not going to ever dissuade somebody from getting into resistance training so will intermittent fasting interfere with strength improvement maybe yeah I mean we don't really have good long-term data on this the what you'd really want to know is does intermittent fasting actually do anything unique does it for instance make people lose more weight does it have a health promoting effect that a similar calorie level diet where people don't intermittently fast does is there any unique benefit to intermittent fasting the answer that is no yeah to recent meta analysis on this no benefits to is this to intermittent fasting over a regular diet if you prefer it that's cool helps keep you adherent to some sort of diet that's great but it doesn't improve health and any it reduces any sort of disease compared to a similar diet where you don't intermittently fast and it's certainly not going to make people stronger so I think if I was hedging my bets I probably wouldn't recommend intermittent fasting if getting super strong is important to you but on the other hand I'm not going to tell you that it's going to handle your gains I just unless it's helping unless it's the only way to get to keep you adherent to your diet I probably wouldn't recommend it general hey Jordan just wanted to thank you and the bar medicine team today I just hit a four-play deadlift hey that's awesome congratulations have you followed sornux squattober squatting almost every day seems like a fun and community event but adapting to the volume would be interesting I have not followed it because I have a power of any meat yeah I feel in a squat every day I think Matt Perry meant squat every day is the book treat actually some pretty good in uh uh read on coaching principles but I would not recommend people who are only squatting two or three days a week to just ramp up immediately to squat in every day just because it's October I want to increase my low bar squat and quad high perch fee would you choose high bar or front squats as a supplemental accessory exercise I'd probably just low bar squat some more I mean you could pick high bar front squat high bar probably is a little more transference to excuse me low bar squats but they all work the quadrips you know as long as you're going in your failure as far as uh uh developing your low bar squat low bar doing more low bar works probably gonna be the best move there but this all depends on the individual course had a great lecture med school about preventing sarcopenia and kexia in med school today teacher said we need to get people to train pretty stoked wasn't expecting that at this point in time yeah it's true yes sarcopenia uh and kexia should be noted are not the same thing sarcopenia is a loss of muscle tissue literally meaning a poverty of flesh and then kexia is uh and in sarcopena usually it's a loss of muscle but you can actually preserve or even increase the amount of body fat so there's also this term sarcopenica obesity whereas kexia on the other hand is this global loss of both fat and muscle it's a little bit different there's also other symptoms associated with the kexia so is it true that there's a maximum amount of protein that your body can utilize in one meal? no your body has excessive resources that it will allow it to use keep transform and et cetera it convert uh dietary protein into you know muscle tissue energy stuff like that do you still overhead press I have not overed pressed in five or six weeks I think yeah cuz I'm doing this powerlifting meat so what's wider the English channel or my T's hips that's close we're gonna have you know what we'll have to measure I'll when I see him at uh at Ron Ashtonals I'll I'll break out the tape measure but I might have to bring another one tape it together what is the best way to squat for a meat low or high bar either you know some people will be able to move more weight a low bar uh I hesitate to even say the majority because just really depends on the person um in fact obviously there's some very very strong squatters squat high bar in powerlifting and then in Olympic lifting who tend to actually be even stronger um squatting for for a given at a given body weight they almost universally do high bar squats but you know you could argue about their anthropometry so depends on the person's anthropometry so if you have a meat coming up and you've only been squatting high bar what I switched low bar from the meat probably not unless you've had extensive history training low bar on the other hand if you've been training low bar and you have me coming up I probably wouldn't switch the high bar for the you know you better at low bar if uh you don't have a meat coming up and you want to sign up for one then you know I don't know that I would change unless you have a significant amount of time 12 weeks 16 weeks uh so to work this out but I would try to pick one that you want to uh kind of use as your priority squat and that getting stronger in that movement is more more important to you if you have this idea of doing a meat and in the near future thoughts on laser light treatment as a form or treatment or plantar a fasciitis new yeah there's the reason why they're like hundreds of different treatments for plantar fasciitis because none of them work we don't really know why this is happening so yeah would not recommend that for someone returning from a herniated disc injury would leg press aggravate that if the back was kept neutral uh no not necessarily um neither would squatting and even if the back is not kept neutral yeah I mean a lot of this is depending on your thought process your your expectations your previous experiences your education level on this all of these things can influence how you actually respond to exercise so we wouldn't necessarily expect you to have pain with any of those movements but you might even if your back is uh perfectly neutral because that doesn't really correlate to the pain experience um so if you're trying to come back and you want to very specific advice I would recommend consulting our pain rehab specialist they do this every day the best on the industry I'm out of to say in that I'm really glad they decided to link up with us but these guys are great so doctor Ray and doctor Miles that this is just what they do so also why do the doctors charge for testosterone ranges not account for age they do yeah yeah there are published norms for free and total testosterone based on based on different age demographics so just wearing that shirt for the fifth day in the road well this is to be fair this is a new shirt like this has never been worn before but am I wearing the same logo yes yes I am what kind of training plan is ideal for a client who wants weight loss loves cardio but also enjoys weightlifting what would you program for them uh weight loft weightlifting cardio and a calorie deficit I mean yeah it would just depend on how what sort of resources they have available to them if you mean Olympic weightlifting you know then I'd probably have them do Olympic weightlifting most days that they train with weights probably all days uh try to get in the lift weights three days a week and I'd have them do a push a pole in a press and the pole usually would be some sort of Olympic lift maybe one day I did have them deadlift instead of even like a cleaner snatch variant but if you're not talking about Olympic weightlifting then yeah I mean I think two or three days a week resistance training full body workouts do conditioning that would that they can be adhered to and they prefer and calorie deficit and how do you go about planning your jumps for warm-ups attempts at a meat saw your post where you jumped 6700 plus but ideally you would hit 675 in between I don't know how close to get on the last warm-up yeah it's all personal preference so like my my dead lifts I'm probably gonna open it 305 672 and then jump to 730 so like that 727 whatever that is 7-7-732 whatever and then 748 I think third that's the plan but last warm-up prior to 672 probably be 600 I mean and I probably just go 135 to 25 35 15 40 500 500 600 as my warm-up just because I'm comfortable doing that salt personal preference hey Jordan is anabolic androgenic anabolic steroid induced hypogunitism reversible after short-term use sometimes yeah also do test levels return to their previous normal sometimes yeah again I know that you've asked multiple questions about anabolic androgenic steroid use on previous lives and my advice to you is to not use them not because I'm anti anabolic I think there's a ton of place for those things depending on risk benefits but for you yeah the risks are far outweigh the benefits as far as I can tell and you know pay to call you up but that's just my take on it right now and so again just for the this conversation for a second you know you think about certain circuitine patients you know the recommendation the guideline for an Allen circuitine do not necessarily recommend anabolic but in some cases they may be you know beneficial compared to their inherent risk certain professional sports or other high incentive where there's a great incentive to actually perform a certain level you know yeah the benefits might outweigh the potential risks provided someone actually knows the risk and I you know again having looked at your profile a little bit I just don't think that's that's for you and you know you're not all you can make your own decisions but I think that I would probably think twice about this and then I will also just inside probably not ask any more questions about this on the live mainly just because the public perception of of them it's just not in a place where I think I want to talk about them a lot although we probably will do a podcast on the stuff on the future just because people keep asking us but I think I'd like to concentrate all that in one one little location what is the most amount you should adjust your macros in terms of grams of protein carbohydrates fat how often should you change it if you are at an ideal bodyweight and body fat but want to gain strength yeah a lot of questions here so there's no max or minimal amount that you would adjust grams of protein carbs fat in an isocoloric or equal calorie situation and then again if you are at the ideal bodyweight and body fat I don't know that you need to you know adjust your macros in order to gain strength that's probably probably not true unless you're protein intake was significantly compromised and so we know that you know is anywhere between 1.4 to 1.6 grams per kilo body weight of protein per day in folks who are either gaining weight or maintaining weight can yield optimal sort of resistance training outcomes expect a high-purchase feed strength so our recommendation usually is towards the upper end 1.6 grams per kilo bodyweight per day protein start there if you prefer more protein than that that's fine but that's the only thing I feel kind of strongly about respect to actual macro recommendations in an isocoloric situation. See is it normal that myorep movements take a long time to go up and wait? I don't know just depends how many reps you're trying to do I was able you know my experience has been able to either add weight or reps each week when I when I incorporate them in my training so that's why I plan on doing. Dox you ever plan to practice medicine? Probably not as my only occupation know yeah I don't think so yeah I think you know obviously there's a need for people in the trenches to practice medicine and take care of patients but I think that the calling by our medicine and public health is probably a little bit more rewarding for me and that's probably we're all spending the bulk of my time yeah. Would you modify your training at high altitude? No can confirm when it went to Colorado high altitude I did not modify my training. Is there any evidence to suggest? So usually when questions start out there? The answer is yes but is it strong evidence? It's useful evidence but alright. Is there any evidence to suggest that reducing body fat has a beneficial effect on inflammatory conditions such as Xima or rheumatoid arthritis if one were near the cutoff for a waste or conference? Yes so yeah if you're obese and you have too much out of post tissue that's definition of obesity then yes reducing body fat can improve patient reported out patient reported outcomes in both of those conditions so yes to that particular question. What are your top five supplements for power lifters over 40 years of age? Yes so these are no different than my recommended supplements for people for lifters at adult lifters at any age because being over 40 doesn't mean your old or special population. So a way protein or other protein supplement depending on your dietary patterns, creatine monohydrate. I would also recommend that people take a bad alinean recommend that people maybe consider taking caffeine prior to a workout so we did way we did or protein we did creatine we did bad alinean we did caffeine and then the only other you know thing that you might find to be beneficial would be like a a sitrally malade I mean there's a bunch of other stuff that's going to be that you know you have a slight benefit but you know really those those first four even would be the ones that I think I would recommend mostly yeah if you got a puppy which kind would you choose also high you're awesome thanks Sarah yeah I think I would get like a mini husky yeah because the cute my dad trying to get me a disdoodle things like 90 pounds is a horse it's too big it's too big absolutely wrecked my apartment so yeah maybe a little a little husky yeah let's see I find I can hook grip way more than I can deadlift for a single okay but it rips up my thumbs after a few poles then I go to straps for rep work any issues with this I mean I don't know how well your grip is trained I'd want to know what you're pulling have you considered using a single layer of athletic tape on your thumb that's probably what I would start doing so you can again just develop your grip because at some point you're going to need that grip strength right would you recommend vitamin D supplementation if blood work shows low vitamin D in general that is the the treatment so yes but it depends on how low it is that because that helps determine the dosing and what agents are recommended either vitamin D 2 or D 3 and then you should probably check your vitamin D levels in six eight weeks to make sure that you're replenishing your enough I wouldn't recommend to people just take vitamin D what supplemental squat would you recommend for someone who struggles to go below parallel asking for myself uh pause squats pin squats something like that yeah one of those two probably any thoughts on the new Sony cameras or lenses any interest or not really into it well I have two Sony cameras got a a 6500 that's this camera and then I've got my a7R3 floating around here somewhere so the a7R4 came out and the new a was it 7172 I don't know yeah an a9 2 a9 mark 2 yeah I don't know I'm kind of bummed with the stuff that Sony's come out with in the last year I like their product they're still I think leaders in the mirrorless camera world they've got the best specs for sure but we're all waiting for this you know new camera to drop that's got the just 4k 60 frames per second and 10 bit out and you know all the other stuff but that right now they've got the best of both worlds for photography and videography and their auto focuses you know maybe the best in in class so I already got two Sony's I don't think I'm gonna upgrade until something new comes out yeah can following a vegan diet be just as good as one of lots of animal protein if calorie needs are met and protein intake as well beyond recommendation for those extreme train yes but I would make the caveat you don't they don't necessarily need a higher protein intake the data shows it get 1.6 grams per kilo body weight of protein per day even in vegan protein can be you know can can yield optimal results from a training plan so I think that you know and that's for people in a weight gain or or maintenance state so if you were losing weight I'd probably jack that up a little bit but that'd be the same advice for for individuals eating animal products yeah advice on choosing a medical specialty yeah I think you know obviously your rotations are gonna be useful as far as like figuring out like what I want to do this day in and day out because you're gonna see the you know daily grind of a particular medical specialty and then I think that I would try to do some electives in one or two of the fields that that you think that you're interested in but the first thing is you got to figure out if you want to do medicine and surgery and after that this this becomes a little clearer because then you start figuring out like all right you know what kind of surgery what I want to do or in medicine do I want to treat only adults or do I want to treat adult and kids you know it's you're able to refine so excited to see you deadless 750 you two man it'll be 748 but in in my heart I'll think it's 750 oh why do myself I believe hate your hat cubs fan sucks twice fair enough fair enough man Jordan there's a dude at my gym who works out at the same time and I've never said hi and now it's been a year it's too awkward to do now should I change gyms that's weird because there was a guy earlier in this live chat it was like there's a dude at my gym who works out at the same time is me he looks like he lifts but he never said hi I want to say hi but it would be too awkward now should I change gyms I think you just got to do the the bro thing and you know asking for a spot or something like that and then strike up conversation there you go just people connecting people it's what I'm doing here evening dock would love your thoughts on this saw a training video of LeBron Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony these are all NBA players for the the unaware I myself am a cultured individual let's see they were all working with their trainer and the trainer had them all doing similar RDS do similar RDS have a transfer to vertical probably minimal transfer to vertical jump test I mean the best thing we have for the transfer to a vertical jump test would be jumping bounding exercises then you'd talk about you know fairly light half squats and quarter squats where people can actually move the way quickly high velocity and but yeah does the sumo debt RDL does that recruit posterior chain muscles sure it's a way to train the glutes and hamstrings and adductors I think it's fine I don't know why you'd have them do sumo versus regular but you know in a basketball player I don't know that it matters either yeah Jordan long time to see recommended program after power lifting too you could do power lifting 3 yeah it's one thing to do you could also go to like a poetry plan I purchased we two and then jump back to the power lifting 2 or a strength general strength conditioning and then pop back to power lifting 2 something like that how good are MRAPS sets and predicting 1RM after more than 5 reps more than if it really if they're more than 3 reps probably not that great but yeah maybe 5 reps is kind of really where the trailing off tends to happen you know as far as like accuracy is very physiologically optimal time of the day to train so actually kind of looked in this into this and this chronobiology or chrono training and it appears no you look at some of the studies done on this people tend to perform best 7-8 hours ish after waking up but that's generally their self reported exercise time anyway and untrained populations doesn't tend to be a reliable transfer there so let's see what lenses I'll use into the track the other day this guy 70 to 200 f28 this big old guy hands are going numb while sleeping at night don't bother me much during day while training going to try splintine at night concern or not really that sounds like you know comment things being common you think about carpal tunnel and so try this once your doctor and make sure it's evaluated you're not missing anything but yeah that would be the first thing comes to mind especially if it's bilateral so the splintine can help and it goes away yeah if thinking it's a carpal tunnel but nothing gym related that you need to worry about unless you end up having surgery on it all right i've been here for an hour we got 30 seconds left so i'm gonna do some announcements one check out the vlog from yesterday it's over on youtube too thank you guys so much for watching please share this one of your friends doesn't follow me don't think follows me helps grow borrow a message community got's great

I welcome back to Instagram Live. I'm Dr. George Fagman with Barbol Medicine. I was saying, so I lose brain cells when you don't close long. I lose brain cells when I don't close long. If doing leg extension machine bad for your needs, nope. I'm Dr. George Fagman with Barbol Medicine. Welcome back to Instagram Live. We're YouTube. If you're watching this in the future, I'm Dr. George Fagman of Barbol Medicine. It is Monday, November 18th. We're doing Instagram Live. I'm trying to get in the habit of doing these more often. And then subsequently posting them on YouTube if there's good stuff there. So as you know, black Friday's coming. We've got some black Friday deals that you guys and gals are going to like. So be able to look out for information about that. If you're subscribed to our newsletter, you're going to get first dibs on that. If you're not subscribed to our newsletter, you should do that. Because we have a spicy new newsletter going out. I believe it's scheduled to send tomorrow. Also have some new content coming up with Alan Flanagan on our podcast. And then in a long form article that I wrote about the science of Red Meat intake. What we're doing here is a Q&A question and answer. So use them at questions. Ideally, I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability. And we'll just have a conversation. All right. We're going to try to find some questions. So I can provide some answers. Oh, last announcement. If you're really hankering for some new Barbol Medicine gear, we've got the baseball teas, RN stock, the competition teas, RN stock and our singlets are on pre order right now, SPD and Bartle Medicine partnered up together to bring you some sweet, sweet Barbol Medicine singlets which are indeed IPF and USAPL legal. Because yeah, every year I pay to make sure that our logo is approved. So check those things out over on the website. All right, back to the questions. Let's go. Sub-dude house training going. So yeah, actually, this probably is the last week of this developmental block. It was about four weeks, which is a normal amount of time for me. So developmental block is effectively really trying to develop strength and then ideally, either transfer it to a more specific block afterwards to like display, be able to display very specific strength performances for a power-liftered baseball bench deadlift. Or are you entering another developmental block? You can do either one that's just broad strokes kind of thing. So yeah, training is going reasonably well. It's time for me to do a pivot and then go back to another developmental block because I need to pick another meat so that I can actually compete with you. So yeah, plan is to go up a weight class, 105, and USAPL run nationals. Next year, it was a really cool experience going to USAPL national Ron Eschinals this year in Lambert, Illinois. If you haven't checked our blog yet, do that. Had a blast. Level of competition was amazing. The venue was really, really decked out, SPD and Rogue and USAPL and people they work with to put on the whole deal. They all did great and the atmosphere was great. So I'd like to be a part of it next year. And yeah, so we'll see. That's the big plan. I don't know if that's the first time I ever talked about that, but that's what's going on. So yeah, training is going well. I think again, this today and this week actually is going to be the last week of this developmental block. And then see what the future holds for the next next training block. Jordan, I got cycling shoes and I've kept my Rogue Echo bike the same height and have knee pain. They are Clippins. What should I do? So I think what you're asking me is that since you've switched to Clippin pedals on your Rogue Echo bike, you have knee pain. I don't necessarily know that they're related. I'd be more curious about what the rest of your training looks like and then how much volume or which would be duration and also what the intensity is of your cycling. So the first question would be, is there any cycling that you can do on the Rogue Echo bike or on a regular bicycle that doesn't hurt? If so, what are the characteristics that are different between that and when you do have pain? Then I'd be looking at your total training load and the context of your environmental stress. And this all reports are as in the context rather of you actually having very significant knee pain. And if it's a three on a scale of one a 10, I don't know that I care. And then final thing just off the cuff without knowing anything more about you would be when was the last time you were able to do that activity without knee pain and then kind of what's changed since then. So most of the time knee pain when with respect to cycling is generally due to end actually with resistance training is usually a load management problem. I mean load when I say load I don't mean weight. That's part of the external load, external load would be objective metrics things like load range of motion, velocity, total volume, etc. What I mean is internal load. So internal load is the load that's actually placed upon the lifter or the individual which is the external load that's filtered through the individual characteristics of the person. So their previous training, their preparedness to train, their motivation to train, their expectations about what the training is going to feel like and what it's going to do to them. Environmental stress which is not just like humidity, temperature, wind, whatever would like, what's going on in your life, all these things, genetics, again it sort of filters the external load to determine the internal load which is ultimately what gets transmitted into either fatigue or fitness adaptations. And so if you're having a bunch of pain that's cropped up out of nowhere I think the road that I go down is load management and see kind of what do we need to do to get you back in the game and then as far as practically how to do that usually backing off external load which in this case would be intensity, volume and things of that nature in addition to education would be kind of the first steps there. So long answer but hopefully useful right? Any negatives to only squatting with the belt. I mean if you wanted to get better at squatting without a belt you might want to practice that. This is a specific skill although you will still improve your squatting strength without a belt when you train only with a belt. I just view it as a training tool right? If you saw me say oh it's a crutch like I mean I don't know there's a lot of mental things that we do mental strategies we do to kind of decrease our fear about a particular movement or particular set in a particular weight. Using a belt is one of them the data right now suggests that using a belt increases bar velocity and improves the efficiency basically keeping the bar path a little more a little strater. So as far as can you be a very strong individual in there and never use a belt. Sure you'll just likely lift less weight than if you used a belt and got good at using the belt. On the other hand if you're never going to compete I don't know that it matters. But yeah as far as what does a belt do upstairs? Yeah I think that's a deeper story. A more complex story and yeah I think overall for somebody who's really interested in lifting weights getting strong etc. I think using a belt on your most important exercises on the heaviest sets and getting good at that seems to be a good idea. I would also help control the external load by doing some sets. Beltless, particularly on less important exercises and you know that's kind of how I manage it. On the other hand you could use a belt for all of those exercises too and live a full and complete life. The idea that you're going to get less abdominal muscle recruitment has been debunked. You'll actually get more what happens is you're able to contract the muscles a little harder and they're also being pressed against the belt as they are contracting. So the intra muscular pressure increases which increases motor unit recruitment. So you tend to actually recruit a little bit more muscle mass. The extent to which that impacts a more significant training effect I don't know and I don't think anybody else knows either. Meaning we don't have like hypertrophy study outcomes as far as I'm aware of or other strength outcomes where they're actually testing abdominal strength in a reliable manner. Hopefully it makes sense. Let's see. Doc, do you ever use heart rate HRR percentage when prescribing cardiovascular or C? Well, I just had like a pure language stroke. Doc, do you ever use heart rate at this? I don't know what HRR percentage is. You talk about heart rate reserve or just heart rate percentage like heart rate percentage of a particular of your max. Tip or describe cardiovascular exercise. No, I don't. Yeah. One, I just feel like it doesn't encapsulate enough of the individual's internal load. So one way to actually measure the physiological response to exercise the actual internal load is by measuring heart rate. You can do that. That being said, I don't think that that's an accurate as accurate of a predictor as RPE. So I prefer using RPE for not only resistance training but also for cardiovascular respiratory training as well. So you can do reps in reserve also for resistance training that that kind of works. But RPE is I think a better way to measure the internal load that somebody's actually experiencing. Yeah. Thoughts on a recent podcast about doctors and stating that only men 50 to 59 with history of MI benefit from statins. I mean, that's demonstrably not true on literally every level. So for instance, young individuals with the history of familial hyper cholesterolemia benefit and this is as young as people, you know, I think is in the adolescent years. Literally a study just came out showing substantial benefit to those individuals on statins. Familiar hyper cholesterolemia, you effectively produce way too much atherogenic lipoprotein which carries around cholesterol, you know, lipid and a protein. There's cholesterol molecules in there and any of that statins been shown to improve mortality basically reduces the risk of early mortality and also the burden of disease. Also, again, from teenagers with that all the way up to very to people in their 20s and 30s who have risk factors for atheroscerotic cardiovascular disease. Again, that's for primary prevention. So preventing the first aphyloscerotic cardiovascular disease event which includes MI, heart attack, stroke, TIA, peripheral artery disease, acute coronary syndrome, all of these things. So for primary prevention and for secondary prevention people who already have diagnosed, have diagnosed with aphyloscerotic cardiovascular disease statins can be useful. So I mean, whoever said that is just not qualified to speak on those things and I probably would it listen to them on something that they're clearly not an expert in and this stuff is covered pretty well in the new article that's going to go up hopefully either tomorrow or Wednesday titled the Science of Red Meat Intake. Any advice on residency interviews? I thought residency interviews were a lot lower key than med school interviews. Med school interviews, you know, everybody's just trying to get in right residency interviews. It seems like people are just trying to figure out if they like you and if they want to work with you for the next three to however many years. It's weird in every residency and medical school interview that I ever did, they always ask me how much I bench pressed. So maybe your experience will be different than mine. But yeah, I think you should know a little bit about the program that you're going to go interview at. So you know what their specialties are or interests are if there are any and then you should, you know, if you have any questions about like the schedule. So for instance, something if you write to an a family medicine, you might ask how many ICU rotations do you have when, you know, the second years get to act as senior residents on when they're on awards, something like that, just stuff that you'd actually matters. On the other hand, it's hard to really know if you're going to be in a good residency program or a bad residency program just from your interviews. You can talk to other residents and see if you can sus out good and bad. But yeah, most people aren't going to tell you that their residency program is bad. That's a little on a cognitive distance there. So I would just try to, you know, kind of get a feel for the work environments that you'll be in, which you get to tour and then also just what the residents are like because you're going to have to work with them most of the time. Yeah, thoughts on a ass to grass heavy squats. They're a perfectly valid way to squat if you want to get better at those types of squats. On the other hand, if you just want to go down to below parallel, that's fine too. You know, depth is kind of this arbitrary level if you're not going to compete. So it exists upon a spectrum of like, you know, you want to do loaded hip and knee flexion, ground-based, loaded hip and knee flexion through some range of motion that you can keep consistent. And, you know, should you go an inch below parallel or write at parallel? What are the big training differences that you see there? Well, the strength that you gain is going to be specific to the range of motion you train in. And you can make a case for going to parallel or slightly below parallel from a muscle training economy standpoint because you're going to get more adductor more glute once you go just below parallel. But if you go even deeper than that, you don't really get any more, you know, motor, unit recruitment or muscle mass being trained. You just are training the same amount of muscles through a different range of motion so that you get stronger different muscle lengths. So what again, what's the best? I think it depends on your goals and if you're not a competitive lifter, I don't know that it matters. Yeah. All right. If they lifter likes using ammonia or other external things for hypodemites, how would you recommend using them in training? Probably wouldn't. Yeah. If you know that you like them already, that's cool. Use them at a beat. I think in training most 99% of your sessions are just putting in work, developing strength. If the performance on a particular strength workout or lift for a particular day is more important than the training effect, which, you know, maybe you're a week out from a meat. Maybe that's the case. But it's not it's not typical. Then sure, use all the hype, use all the ammonia. But I think just save it for the meat. Yeah. People don't need over everything. Hey, Jordan. If I'm around 20 to 24% body fat, can I gain strength from linear pure disation on a cut? A sure. Yeah. The strength response and weight gain or loss are not that tightly correlated. Obviously, the extent that you're going to compromise lean body mass accrual via a cut or losing weight, you know, sure, that might compromise your total strength improvement in the short term. But in the long term, you're benefiting your health because 20 to 24% body fat is fairly high. I would wager that your waist or comforts is an excess of where it should be and you're probably carrying too much ad a post tissue, which is still a serious to health outcomes. So what I would do, yeah, is most of the time, to help you get their weight and the waist or comforts down to within spec. And then if they want to gain more lean body mass, go for it, particularly if getting strong. And, you know, the low rep range is very important to them. Then surely, increasingly, body mass is going to be a part of the process. But I would not sacrifice one's health in the short term just to get stronger in the short term in some arbitrary rep range. And basically, it is very problematic to be carrying too much body weight for in both the short and the long term. And evidence suggests that when people gain weight, particularly gain excess adipose tissue, they have a hell of a time losing it. If you could just easily lose the weight later, if that was an easy thing to do for people to not only lose the weight, but then keep it off. The obesity epidemic would be much smaller problem than it actually is. So most people when they gain adipose tissue are unable to lose it or unable to keep it off, that's the actual facts of this. This YouTube blog or Instagram live brought you by Topo Chico. I wish that you know what? Look, if you work for Topo Chico, call me up. It's monster me. I literally held the bottle here. I bet you the logo probably wasn't facing the camera, so maybe I'm an amateur here. But it is good stuff. I like this water. I like it because it hurts. And I drink it like hurts a little bit. I want that. You mentioned before that you were doing a paper on CBD oil. Yes, I did. What were the highlights of your findings? That there's very, very little data suggesting that it works in humans outside of these very rare congenital seizure disorders period. The data that we do have on it, particularly well controlled, well designed trials suggests that it's not very helpful with respect to the things it's often touted to improve things like pain, things like anxiety, things like depression, things like sleep disorders or insomnia, things like appetite, nausea, etc. And so a lot of these things, yeah, there's just not data on it. And data that does exist is not either not done in humans or just like the sort of theoretical link between some physiological concept and, you know, an active ingredient in CBD. But the stuff we do have data on like actual data is just not good. And then that's just from like assuming you're getting pharmaceuticals CBD cannabidiol, which you're certainly not unless you have again one of these two very rare seizure disorders or you're being using, you're using medical marijuana in which case you're getting more than just CBD. But that's again, another another discussion. So I just can't recommend it right now. And I think as if more data emerges suggesting that it's very, very useful, then the next problem that I have with this is that the CBD that you're getting over the counter is unregulated. Meaning that there's nobody making CBD products with a certificate of good manufacturing process that's informed for sport, like safe, etc. And then contaminations, the studies on the contaminants found in CBD products I mean, they're overwhelming. Their toxicology papers are just, I mean, the stuff that people are getting in there. Oh man, it's scary. It's scary. And the different dosing and just, yeah. So I think early adopters are probably missing the mark right now and probably there's some nefarious activity with why they're recommending this so hard. You know, the it works for me, fallacy is hard to deal with with people who are not scientists. But look, I'm not concerned if it worked for you or a friend, particularly if that friend is getting paid by the company who makes the CBD oil. That's not a valid scientific study. You have all sorts of biases going into the it works for me, fallacy. And yeah, I'm unconcerned with your, with an uncontrolled observation. And so when we actually put it to the test, when we look at the existing data, yeah, CBD, I can't recommend it. I recommend against it right now outside again, the rare congenital seizure disorders. So I wanted to say thanks for the great content. Recently, did my first policy meet using 12-week strength program total 1320 PR&M squat 501 deadly 539 once six for nine, a place second of 93 kilo class Ben, do that's sick. Reminds me, my first meet, my first meet 2011, a weighty in 176 pounds. It was in a gym. No, he was like, yeah, no, shit, dude. No, it was in a commercial, our school gym rather, like, you know, with all the basketball, uh, uh, backboards pulled up out of the way. Yeah, uh, what did I do? So I went in 176, I squatted 200 kilos, 440, a Bench 303.5, which is 137.5 kilos. I only got my opening bench. I don't know. I don't know why, even try to cut weight either. Like, that I thought the weight cut kind of hurt me. But I remember they were using the stupid Avonco Barbell. The Avonco Barbell's got a very narrow, like, smooth part before the nerling starts. So a standard nerling, I think it's 16 or 16.5 inches, like, nerled a nerl. And then the Avonco Barbell's like 14 inches. And then it's got three power rings, three score marks in the thing. None of them are standardized. And you're like, where do I grip this thing? I couldn't figure it out. So between that and the weight cut, I don't know, not a great, not a great performance, but I did bench 303.5. My first, my first meat, 176, and then I pulled 540. So I think we might have totaled the same. I don't know what offhand. Yeah. Nice job, Ben. Uh, hey, man, glad I could steal you from max for a picture of nationals. I think you would have been a great asset to the cupping station. If you guys are new to following me and you missed my birthday celebration. This is also like a going away party. My friends threw me and Santa Cruz when I before I moved down here. They threw me, it was like a placebo party. There was like a cupping station. There was like a, uh, you know, a reflexology posters all over the place. There was a CBD oil, a collagen protein. I mean, they were just really trolled me hard, which means that we're good friends. So yeah, I'm glad that I missed the cupping station at Ron Nationals. Form is great on the deadlift, but somehow still managed to tweak my back. And he thought, it's on how I'm getting injured. Yeah. Yeah. So just earlier in this pod, well, not a podcast. It's alive for Q and A thing. We talked about load management. And again, that's not just external load, which would be weight reps, sets, velocity, like range motion, velocity, etc. This is internal load. Um, so how you experience all of those things. Uh, so yeah, I think load management is problematic there. I would not associate, uh, form, quote unquote, on deadlifts with back tweaks to begin with. And I'm writing an article on this is going to be my next 20 pageer. So here's the thing. Uh, neutral spine is actually pretty large range motion. Um, it's between, you know, a couple degrees shy of full flexion and a couple degrees shy of full extension, that requires more explanation, but there's not just one. Oh, that's neutral spine. There's a lot of, you know, relatively large amount of movement there compared to just this, of one position. It's quote unquote neutral. Uh, sure. You have, uh, cadaver studies where people rip the spine out of cadavers and they flex them a bunch of times in the disc's herniated. Okay. But you cannot squat, deadlift, kettlebell swing, it literally, literally any sort of movement that involves hip extension or hip flexion to hip extension without flexing the spine. Um, you get a lot of flexion in a, kettlebell swing, for example, or a golf swing, um, for example. And you don't see this increase in a discarnation in sports where there's a lot of, uh, uh, uh, uh, spinal flexion either, um, like golf from, in fact, they have lower than average, um, disc, uh, amount of discarnations. But that's not even the point because discarnations aren't even related to low back pain outside of like two to five percent of cases. So, you know, next question is like, well, would you want to, why would you even want have a quote unquote neutral spine or a flat back in a deadlift, you know, why? Uh, appears to be a little bit more efficient from most lifting mechanics. There's obviously some people who tend to have a performance advantage by, uh, when they round their, uh, or flex their, uh, a lot more spine. But, uh, in most performance tasks where this actually has been tested, yeah, a neutral spine tends to do better than a flex spine, um, even though it doesn't actually can note any increased injury risk. So, the biggest problem is that you have hardline coaches, uh, hardline is not a company. I mean, I'm sure it is, but what I mean by hardline is people who say, and it's a black and white, good form bad form. Um, it's like, okay, one define those things, and then two show evidence to support like this arbitrary line of sand. When people do this hardline thing like rounding your back in the deadlift with the squad is bad and you'll get injured, there are no sebo and you, they're hurting you potentially because I have this stupid model in your brain, like, if I do this, I'm going to hurt myself. It's like, okay, by what mechanism? So, anyway, if you have low back pain, I think it's a low management thing. It's probably going to resolve on its own, um, and so I'll just be looking at your programming. That's, that's what I would address first. Yeah. When calories and protein are controlled, does glycemic index matter, um, um, for what? If it's all getting turned to sugar by your body, anyways, we're fine, carbohydrate anywhere's for you, then more complex carbs. Again, that's for what? You're talking about for weight loss or weight preventing weight regain. If you're talking about for LDL cholesterol, if you're talking about for insulin sensitivity, potentially diabetes, outcomes, like a himglobaly one C. Yeah, matters because you're talking about a total fiber intake. So, best outcomes are, but for fiber intake between 25 to 29 grams per day on a minimum. Um, and once you're cheating that, your total calories are correct. Uh, you know, you're going to be pretty good. Yeah. Uh, let's see, could you expand on the statement? You guys have made in the past in regards to most people actually being under trained. Yeah, most people in fact are under trained. So, for a population level for just looking at the United States, about 40% of individuals meet the a-robic current, a-robic guidelines set forth in the 2018 physical activity guidelines for Americans. Okay, you can look that up. It's free. All right. Uh, and only about 20% of those who are of the 40% are meeting the resistance training guidelines, which is the resistance trained twice per week. So, by definition, the plenty of people are under trained, because most of them aren't even training. And in addition, the ones who are are probably under trained as well. So, uh, and if you just restrict, like, you know, this thing of powerlifting, I think particularly in the United States, there's just this pervasive sort of conventional wisdom that, you know, you don't want to do too much, because you need to recover. And certainly recovery is important. I'm not denying that. But I think you- you have two potential models in your brain for why you're not getting better. So, one is that I'm just not recovering enough. I'm not recovering enough. And so, the way you would manage that is to train less so that you could recover more. The other thing is I'm not doing enough to get better, which is that's the view that I have. So, not only do you have to do more, but then the time between when you're actually applying the training stress, right, and generating the training fatigue to the actual fitness adaptation, the time to realize that is probably going to stretch out too. Although, I would argue that you don't need to necessarily dissipate fatigue to have a fitness adaptation. What you really need to do is have the amount of fitness adaptations that you're developing, that you're generating, the positive aspects, outweigh the negative aspects from training and dost fatigue. So, you can- you all know that you can perform, uh, or have performed very well at a high level, while you still have a bunch of training fatigue on board, uh, or life fatigue, right? It's like training when you're hung over, training when you're tired. You accidentally PR, oops, how did that happen if it's- if you didn't dissipate all this fatigue? On the other hand, you know that you've trained like crap, performed like crap. When you've dissipated a bunch of fatigue, you went on vacation for a week. You didn't train at all. You came back, missed your top set. It's just a little more nuanced than that. So, most people by definition, just are not training. Just, you know, 80% of the United States population does not do any resistance training at all. The 20% who are engaging in that, I would wager most of them are under trained. And, uh, yeah, most people are under trained. Let's see. Are those hats for sale? These hats, the dad hats, uh, they're going to be for sale pretty soon. So, make sure you get those. I think we made a substantial amount of them because I didn't want to run out for the Christmas slash Hanukkah season. So, you're welcome. I like when people ask me like, what is your opinion on this person? Like, who am I to judge the character of somebody's, you know, somebody else? If you want to ask me a particular thing that they said, you have a question about, I'm cool with that. I probably won't name them because I don't want to, you know, start any internet beefs, I've done that for too long. But, if you ask me, like, thoughts on person, uh, I don't know that I think about other people like that, particularly in the fitness industry, that much just as a, as a person. I think about some things they said, some agreed just claims they've maybe made, but I don't think about them like, I wonder if they're a good person. I want to have a vote for. I wonder like, do they donate to charity? I just don't. Let's see, have run a several strength-focused templates in a row, 12-week strength, powerlifting, too. Looking at focus on losing weight for the next several months, should I do power building to or high-perch feet, too? There were me, uh, I probably do high-perch feet, too. Power building, too, you could actually go back and forth on them. Power building, too, has just got more of a specificity towards the big three, squat bench deadlift. If you don't necessarily, so if you really enjoy those lifts, they'd kind of make your training world go around. You know, I would do power building, too. But if you, well, like a break, you know, and you want to gauge in some more conditioning stuff, I think how much feet, too, is probably a better choice. You go back and forth, so you don't like lose your, uh, uh, zeal for doing the big three, if that's important to you. Um, and so yeah, we do sell training templates. It's kind of our entry-level, sort of barbell medicine program. If you're interested in our programming ideas and like how that would actually manifest out into a program, we got a bunch of different templates that are suited for people at various different points of training with various different goals. You should check those out barbellmus and dot com website. If the goal is to increase muscle size, should we strive to get stronger? Yeah. So I know that you asked me this about two weeks ago and I answered you there. I think if you want to get larger muscles, then one thing, uh, objectively that you'll be looking at, is our, my lifts and the rep ranges that I'm training them going up. General, that would be a good sign that you're actually gaining lead body mass in addition to actual measurements. That being said, there are a lot of different ways to generate the stimulus to drive muscle growth that don't involve necessarily a lot of heavy resistance training in the low repetition range. So yeah, how best to reprogram my squat after a nine month herniated disc that caused bad sciatica and left leg, left leg is weak and not firing the way I want it to. Yeah, I wouldn't do anything differently about approaching your squat training than somebody else who is new to the squat and hasn't, uh, or and or who hasn't been training it for a while. So I think, uh, you know, being cautious initially, with the training load and training volume. So, and I would train multiple different rep ranges. And, uh, you know, I think if you want to do squat variations, since you have a little more experience, you can start that from the beginning. So you might have one day of backsquats, one day of pause squats and another day of leg press. You could also make the leg press unilateral one leg at a time. So you can actually, you know, if you want to focus on unilateral strength, I think that's a totally reasonable thing. That I like split squats and step ups and stuff like that as well. But, uh, you know, I think a leg press can be useful here too. Does micronize creatine model hydrate have any benefits when compared to just creatine model hydrate? No. And, uh, I did a creatine video on the YouTube's, which I would recommend you guys watch if you haven't seen it already. Hey Doc, I'm starting to create content from my client athletes and circle of influence and would like to bring awareness to you and your content via occasional referencing. Would you be okay with that? I would be flattered. See, one of the best things that you guys can do, guys, and get, I'll sorry, it's 2019, try to be inclusive. Um, one of the best things that you guys can do is to share this stuff with your friends and family and you know, I don't mean in like an annoying evangelistic kind of way, but there are only so many of us involved in barbell medicine, right? And so we are trying to get the word out. We're trying to, uh, help as many people as possible, but we can't do without you. And so, love if you guys would share, you know, this video or this Q&A or some of our posts or whatever you feel like is, you know, uh, within your, uh, within your, uh, within your purview and something that you would normally do share with your friends, family, people go to the gym with, whatever. What is your opinion on the fact that Louis Simmons has people do more box squatting than regular squatting? Would you ever do this yourself? I mean, maybe somebody preferred box squatting and they weren't a competitive power lifter. Sure. But I don't necessarily concern myself with what Louis does. And I don't mean that in an arrogant way. You know, he doesn't concern himself with what I do. And I don't concern himself with what he does because I think that he, when he talks about power lifters, he's talking about a different sport than I am. Um, it's, you know, gear in a particular federation with particular standards that are different than the power lifting that I've competed in. Um, so, you know, that being said, I'm not married to a regular squat that doesn't involve a box for people who aren't competing. Yeah. How do you approach exercise selection when creating general strength programs? Yes, I'll refer you to the beginner prescription, or, uh, uh, which is the free version of our beginner template, uh, the beginner template also comes with like a 70 page ebook that really details how we came up with that program, which includes a section on exercise selection. So there's no such thing as general strength. All strength is specific. It's specific to the rep range you train it in, it's specific to the range emotion, the velocity, the contraction types, all sorts of things. The degree that one exercise improves performance in another exercise is called transference, uh, or carryover. And the more closely related to exercises are via those again, uh, the range emotion, the contraction type, velocity, etc. Uh, the more closely that they're, they're, or the more likely they're going to carry over to each other. So, uh, for a general trainee, the person who's not going to go compete in a barbell sport, instead of specializing on a few exercises, I would like to have a broader base of physical development that I would build for them until they wanted to specialize if they did. So I would not just use one type of squat variation, or even really mandate that they squat. I really just want loaded hip and knee movement, all right? Like, uh, so same thing with the deadlift. I wouldn't necessarily make sure that they do a conventional deadlift or similar deadlift. They could do a trap bar deadlift, you know? Um, yeah. So I have way less restriction. And then finally, we know that from a motor learning standpoint, when you're trying to actually learn, um, how to move your body, for instance, at space, and, and develop all these motor programs, um, particularly when it comes to non-standard, uh, or movements that are different each time, um, that you would want a wider variety of movements. People learn faster that way, and people have more robust development, uh, of these motor programs. So wouldn't high-press specialized just from a, uh, a sort of, uh, training development standpoint, want more proficiency in more movements, rather than proficiency in less movements. And then, I also think people learn better that way. So hopefully that makes sense. But if you want further explanation, we talk about this extensively in both the free barbell prescription, which is our free, uh, version of the beginner template, and then also the paid version, which we go into this. A lot more depth. Yeah. Let's see, why is my general practitioner telling me that I don't need more than 50 to 70 grams of protein, even though I told him I trained? Well, a few questions. One, why did you ask him? Because it's unlikely that this person is up to date on the current information. So right now, the current, uh, RDA, uh, guidelines suggest point, uh, was it point eight, uh, grams, uh, protein per kilo body weight per day. The current S bin or S bin, European or American, a society for nutrition recommends that most individuals get between 1.2 and 2.0 grams per kilo's, and this, it becomes more and more important as people age, um, because they become more and more and about the resistant. And this is one of the, the primary prevention tools against the sarcopenia and other, um, age related, uh, weakness and muscle loss. So the final part of this is, if you look at actual guidelines from the international society on sports nutrition or international athletic association, uh, I forget the last part of their acronym, or if you look at the NSEA or the ACSM, the recommendations are that individual should consume anywhere between 1.6 to 2.5, all the way up to 3.1 grams, uh, protein per kilo, uh, body weight per day, and as far as where you fit in the range depends on if you're losing weight, gaining weight, maintaining weight, and your needs. So the recommendation that's actually based on very good evidence, uh, that I would give to you is to consume 1.6 to, uh, about 2.5 grams of protein per kilo body weight per day. If you're gaining weight, 1.6 grams per kilo body weight per day is fine. If you're losing weight, I'd ratchet that up, um, yeah. And we discussed this at length in one of our previous newsletter articles actually. So if you have it signed up for newsletter, you get stuff like this in your inbox every month. Yeah. What can I replace milk and weigh with? I like milk because of the amount of protein, but it hurts my stomach. Yeah, so you could try a lactose-free version of milk. If you like that, you could also try a lactase pill to see if that's, you know, if you just don't tolerate dairy, if that's the thing. If, uh, and I would expect you to still be able to tolerate weight with water. So you try that. If you can't tolerate the way with water, one thing that people tend, you know, commonly have reactions to is a weight protein concentrate with the beta lactobumin. Um, you might try to do a weight protein isolate. My recommendation would be try the way with water first. If that doesn't work for you, try to find a way protein isolate by a pound of it. See if that works with water. Um, and then you don't need to take a protein supplement though. Really, if you were getting your dietary protein in from other sources. So any sort of, uh, any protein source really, if you like eggs, if you like, uh, chicken, fish, lean meats, um, if you like yogurt, Greek yogurt, you know, dairy works well if you can tolerate it, but it sounds like that's not an option for you. Uh, but there are plenty options out there. Another non-training question. What is your method with getting your beard line while trimming your neck? Digging the thicker beard man? Uh, beard questions. So, uh, yeah, on the neck, I just use, um, I have an anandis-tea-tea-tremeer. That's just my little, what I used to line up down here, and then I use a safety razor to shave. That's it. Yeah, not no real special technique. Yeah. Are those blue-like glasses? No, these are real glasses because I am losing my eyesight. Do you think isolation exercises are more beneficial than compound lifts for hypertrophy? I'm thinking that isometric is simply a requirement of volume plus frequency behind a certain point of exposure to training. Uh, I don't, I mean, I don't necessarily think so when you look at primary movers, so for instance, like quadriceps in the squat, for example, uh, I don't necessarily know that isolation movements are any better than them. I do think that when training resources dwindle that one way to get an additional training volume, additional training stress, particularly to drive more hypertrophy, um, you can do isolation exercises, but secondary movers probably respond a little bit better to isolation exercises. Also, you can take isolation exercises to failure, or closer to failure, but also to failure with a little bit less detrimental effects. And then again, you know, training, um, trying to achieve, most of our hypertrophy, you know, the maximum improvement that you can by just compound lifts is probably not going to work for, for most folks, um, because you're going to need to do more training volume, uh, more frequency, and then ultimately fatigue becomes a problem that you need to, uh, uh, that you need to deal with. And isolation exercises are one way to do that, but I don't, was far as one better than the other for primary movers. Nah, probably not secondary movers. Now you make a better case for that, but you can also find ways to train around them, um, but in the grand scheme of things, a hypertrophy program would have both probably. Let's see. Vibility of a vegan diet for strength athlete. Yeah, so this is the last question we'll answer tonight. Uh, yeah, I think that if you want to be a vegan or vegetarian, as long as you're getting in, you're the correct amount of calories and told you're going to be fine. In fact, the research from multiple different studies showing that as long as you're getting the correct dose of protein that the training outcomes are either no different or very, very similar or so much so that any difference that's statistically significant, it's probably not clinically significant, um, because of the inter individual variation in training response. So if someone wants to be vegan, someone wants to be vegetarian, cool. We also make a, uh, nice p protein isolate called vegan rx. It's got the same essential amino acid content as our way protein, um, which is good. So if you have a vegan friend vegetarian friend and then you need a protein supplement, there you go. Okay. Thank you guys so much for tuning in. I'm about to get kicked off here because I've been here for like an hour. Uh, again, son of a newsletter is coming out. We're going to give you guys first access to the black Friday deals. Um, also we got a bunch of great information that goes out every month. Um, so if you're not find it for that, do that. Barble medicine apparel. We got a new matte merch over there. We got a baseball tee. You got competition T's pre order for the SPD singlets coming out. Uh, and then yeah, I hope everybody is having a great Monday. Thank you so much for tuning in. See you guys soon.

=== FILE: Miami 2020 Q⧸A： What Big Pharma Doesn't Want You to Know [EZn5qc0hnJA].txt ===

Welcome back to the Barrel Medicine YouTube channel. We bring modern medicine to strength conditioning, and strengthening conditioning to modern medicine. We're in Miami, Florida, hybrid, first seminar, 2020. That's the first time that's happened. Yeah, thanks, guys. Thank you. So we're going to do a Q&A here. Cultivate, we have curated questions. Austin picked him out. His fault if your question didn't get answered. If it didn't get answered and he still have this burning query, please post up on our forum or Facebook page. It's a great community of over 10,000 folks. We're all trying to get better and learn a lot and help each other. So also, if none of those work, if you don't get accepted to our Facebook group and we delete your question off our forum, please slide into Leah Lutz's direct messages. She cannot let the DMs go. And she will bug Pester, one of us for the answer. Yes, true. OK. Question number one. Smoking is associated with obesity and central adiposity. But smokers often cite fear of weight gain as a barrier to smoking cessation. What do? Yeah. Well, so I understand where this comes from, because the idea, and again, there's nuggets of truth in here that nicotine is like an appetite to suppress it. People have this habitual process of smoking them after meals. And they feel like that helps them curb their hunger, et cetera. And then every time they've tried to quit, it is common for individuals who quit smoking that they start eating more in the short term. That being said, amongst smokers, people who smoke, who are heavy smokers, tend to have higher rates of obesity. You also pulled the study. Yeah, I pulled a, I did some background research while I was back there sifting through these. And this paper by Dair in 2015, they looked at almost 500,000 people in the UK who were smokers. So pretty substantial population size that they looked at there. And I'll just quote this line from it. Said amongst smokers, the risk of obesity increased with the amount smoked. And former heavy smokers were more likely to be obese than former light smokers, about a 60% higher odds of that. And they said, risk of obesity fell with the amount of time from quitting. After 30 years, former smokers still had high risk of obesity than current smokers, but the same risk as people who had never smoked. So that increase in kind of tendency towards gaining weight after quitting smoking. That seems to be a transient thing after quitting. But the further out you get from successfully quitting smoking, the more your obesity risk tends to normalize and kind of merges with the same risk of somebody who had never smoked at any point in their life. So I would not use this as a reason to not smoke or to not quit smoking. Although it is cited as a barrier commonly, you know, that risk normalizes after, you know, longterm. Yeah, it's like a short-term risk. In addition with some of the medical sort of management, we have with the associate's smoking cessation and some of the other psychological techniques exceed the CBT and stuff, that those tend to be having better outcomes with respect to even that short-term risk of increase in weight. They tend to not see that as much. Practical slash example suggestions for initiated the conversation with family members that appear to be suffering from sarcopenia. It's actually a great question because it affects a lot of people, but also can this, the answer to this can extend more broadly to other medical conditions that you think a family member might have but not be addressing. Just the first part of this, I don't actually think it's terribly important for you to diagnose them or tell them that you're necessarily afraid that they have a particular condition that's got a diagnosed name. That doesn't mean you never have to do that or that can't be part of your talking strategy, but I think the initial communication should be what your concerns are with about their health. Show some understanding of their current situation and then try to direct them towards resources. So for example, I probably wouldn't even though I am medically trained. I don't know that I would bring up that I'm afraid that somebody in my family has sarcopenia directly to them, but rather I would ask them if they'd be open to going to the gym with me or going to the gym to see a coach or one of my friends who trains folks because that they're already engaging in the behavioral change that I want to get them towards and I don't necessarily want to scare them with medical terminology. If I'm not their doctor. So I would direct them not only to the gym in this case, but then also to see their doctor though then again, you'd have to assume that their doctor's up on this stuff which is kind of hamstrung here. Yeah, I also probably wouldn't bring it up in terms of like an ominous medical diagnosis, but rather my strategies for doing this really revolve around making it meaningful to the person. So the first step in behavior change like what Jordan laid out at the beginning of the weekend is identifying where is this person in the the the the trans-theoretical model with respect to where are they in terms of readiness for behavior change? Do they even know that there may be an issue here? So I do this all the time with my hospitalized inpatients and I think I've talked about this maybe before where I might have an elderly person or even a non-elgently person admitted for a particular medical condition and I'll test them out. I'll do the sit-to-stands. I do that pretty routinely on my patients in the hospital and routinely they fail it. They're either unable to do it or unable to do it without their arms or something like that. And so that might be something that they just had accepted as a part of aging for example. They just thought, oh, this is just what happens when you get old, right? And I don't actually mention the word sarcopiniate to them. I asked them that once I've identified that they that they were unable to complete that task, I might say tell me about the things that you like to do in a given day. Knowing that the answer is usually, I don't usually do very much, you know, I might walk around the house a little bit and that's usually about it. That's what I get from a lot of these patients. What did you use to like to do? What kind of things were your hobbies? What did you use to enjoy things like that? What kind of things were you previously able to do that you don't think you could do any more? Then they'll rattle off a whole bunch of things. Oh, I used to do this in this and this and this do you think that, you know, if there are any of those that you'd really like to be able to do again? Oh, yeah, I'd love to be able to do this, but you know, I'm just old, I can't do it anymore. And then that's my way in to say, what if there's a way that we could work to get you back towards being able to do some of these things? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to do this thing independently without needing to help of your family member, your son, your daughter, your spouse, your caregiver, whoever to help you do this relatively simple task, reaching to grab something out of a cabinet, getting up to go out and get the mail or something like that that they feel like they can't do anymore. So those are activities that hold meaning to the individual and they give me like a hook that I can grab and make this goal something that they can actually foresee as being impactful to them. Rather than saying, oh, I'm concerned that you have Sarkopinian that's associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Right? They're like, okay. Yeah, buzz off, you know? That doesn't mean anything. Rather, making it tying it to a meaningful activity. We do the same thing in the rehab context, right? We're trying to get people to rehabilitate back towards valued activities that they want to be able to do, whether that's squatting and deadlifting, or whether that's, you know, bending over and picking up their kids or something like that. So Sarkopinian is a training process and it involves behavior change. Same as the pain and rehab thing, but again, you have to make it meaningful to the person in order to get buy-in. But of course, even before that, they have to recognize that it's a problem. And a lot of these folks don't even recognize it as a problem at all. So that's when if they can't even get out of a chair, I'm like, that kind of concerns me that you're unable to get out of a chair, you know, just because you're 60 or 70 or 80 or 40 or 50 or whatever, you know, you should be able to get out of a chair and do these things. And I think that there are ways that we can get you here. You interested in learning more about how we can accomplish this and then kind of go from there. So that's how I do it. Yep. You do that. I do that all the time. Also, like, and again, just to reiterate the part when I said the beginning, I think directed people towards good resources. Like, if you want to bring this up in some fashion, then you have to know what your next move is going to be. So now you've got them to recognize that there's an issue. So when I was your solution, I don't know. Well, but you should really work on that. Yeah, you should really work on that. Yeah, you're a little clean. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Not a known for that. Not a known for your rocky. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thoughts on when it makes sense for non-competitive lifters to use straps. Other than grip strength, does it greatly diminish the benefits of the dead lift? Yeah. I mean, I wrote a whole article about this called gripping matters. It's available on a future different locations on the interwebs. I don't really care outside of competitive power lifters or people who are involved in the barbell sports. I do think there's something we said about developing grip strength just in general. So I think, you know, there's carry over then from the deadlift to other exercises where you have to hold on to things like, you know, pull ups, chin ups, stuff like that. That being said, you could work on those just by pull ups and chin ups. So other than just competing to barbell sports, I don't know that you necessarily need to develop deadlift specific grip strength. I think that straps in general can be a great training tool to help folks who have grip problems still train their deadlift. But I would also at the same time be training their grip in the deadlift. So the way I generally program this is working up to your top set. I want you to not use straps for your top set. Use just your hands with chalk and try to hold the last rep of your heaviest working set for about 20 seconds. Set it down. Then if you need to use straps for the rest of your workout, that's fine. But again, if you're not at least trying to develop your grip strength, I think that you're missing out. And I think that just part of the general training development process, you're missing out a little bit. But if someone was very adamant like, look, I do not want to use this alternate grip. It scares me and all this other stuff. I think that's a big deeper issue to have to dive into. And the only way that they're going to resistance train is by using straps. Okay. Yeah. If it's a non-competitive general health person, I don't really care at all. I just think I do think there's just something to like having a developed grip strength. I think I would make the point here that if you had somebody in that situation and they became very trained in their deadlift using straps the whole time. I still think they're likely to have improved their grip strength. I agree. I agree. Just a good enough. I'm good enough for me. I think for a non-competitive person. Yeah. I just think for the Instagram cloud, which you know is increasingly becoming more and more important, can't use straps. Yeah. Do you think that health care provider should be more liberal in their use of obesity drugs? What resources would you recommend to a physician who's interested in learning more? Yes. I don't have the specific prescription rates or how often these should be used but then aren't or how often they're available to patients who would get covered for them. But then they're not made it. They're not prescribed. I don't know that all those rates. But I do know that they're underutilized. And so as far as resources on learning more about not only the mechanism of action but the prescription like indications and things to monitor and watch out for it. Et cetera. The 2016 American Academy of Clinical and Recrerologist Obesity Guidelines has a very lengthy discussion of all of these agents and when they should and shouldn't be prescribed in potential medication interactions and things of that nature. So that would be the first resource I would go to and then after that it would be based on each particular medication just on up to date or Lexi Compton. Lexi Compton. Yeah. I agree that they're probably underused but I don't think we want to because that's likely to get us like YouTube commenter saying the original big there it is. There it is. We just want to throw everybody on medicines. Do I have to listen to your story? Well we're here. Listen. Listen. Pfizer emailed me. Pfizer emailed me because they want to run this social media campaign. Okay and they were going to offer me this is the funny part. They were going to offer me $300. $300. $300. $300. $300. To make a post about this Pfizer campaign. Now to be fair this was like a getting healthy like advertisement that running this sort of campaign to get people more active and eating right and but here's the thing though. It's Pfizer. Yeah I feel like they don't actually care about it. It's sponsored by Pfizer and again like we already get accused enough of being big farm-assials even though most of the medications that we actually like recommend or the classes there's like a lot of generic so it means we're certainly not getting paid for them. Like I don't make I make precisely zero dollars prescribing any medication. Right nobody's giving you kickbacks. No one. Literally nobody. So there's an opportunity. No. I was just so weird that they emailed and so when I said no thank you they were like we have some wiggle room on our reimbursements and I was like I started to think I was like what amount of money would it take for me to make a Pfizer post like being pro Pfizer? You just have to assume that that's the end of your career. Yeah so it have to be at least like I don't know what a thousand times higher than that. I mean I just have to live on it so I was going to say look I need $3 billion. And unless you're willing to give me $3 billion that's what it takes for you to live. That's right to sell my soul to actually be big farm-assials. Okay Oh sorry. Yeah I think that these medicines are also underutilized but given those concerns that people are likely to have I think that we should emphasize that there are specific indications for when they should be used. So remember when Jordan was talking about the nutrition interventions and say you want to initiate the aggressive lifestyle stuff there's a percentage goal for clinically relevant weight loss and there's a timeframe that you want to achieve that and if you do it. Right so if you go through hit that timeframe and you're missing your weight loss targets then there's a perfectly reasonable situation to initiate that discussion rather than just blaming the patient more and saying it's your fault you didn't do this you need to try harder your bad person. That might be a time to say hey maybe the dietary RPE of this intervention right the how difficult this behavior changes for you might be a little too high too difficult to adhere to one of the ways these medications can help is by actually making it a little bit easier to adhere to a calorie restricted diet right through effects on the brains, the tidy mechanisms, all kinds of so I've used these medications actually pretty frequently despite the fact that I was not actually formally trained in them in residency it's quite easy to learn to learn about them for people who have prescribing power and to learn about side effects and things like that particularly through like a family medicine training and trauma that's in turning any kind of generalist practice they're not that difficult to manage or to deal with so I've used them with a handful of obviously as with any intervention just like in training there's a spectrum of individual responses I've had some patients who did awesome with it they said suddenly like adhering to their calorie restricted diet was a piece of cake they had no difficulty with it and others who didn't do great on one but did better on another and some who had less of an effect altogether and so again I don't think these are a great tool to use as what we call monotherapy you just like put somebody on a pill and say up guess you're good now it still needs aggressive multi-modal interventions in terms of the nutrition piece the physical activity piece medication piece etc they all have kind of a role to play here because again weight loss and particularly sustained weight loss is hard yeah the lifestyle recommendations are recommended at literally every level for individuals with obesity and then there's only a certain swath of those that would be qualified for medications sorry Pfizer not today okay after years of being exposed to the more intellectual evidence-based side of the fitness industry I found it harder and harder to communicate with the gen pop about training in a way that doesn't go over their head questions like how do I lose weight or what program do you follow usually a list at lengthy responses where I rarely feel like the other party has any takeaway that allows them to take action well communication strategies do you use with less experienced populations to communicate so that you're able to meet them on their level I mean honestly I think you answered your own question within this question effectively if you're not meeting people at their level based on their level of education understanding etc then it doesn't matter what your fund of knowledge is you just missed it doesn't mean that you're a bad person and that you should like quit or whatever it just you're going to have to try a different strategy so I think it's okay to simplify things I think it's okay to draw things down if you need to make a graph they get it's okay to have pre-prepared materials where you've actually sat down and thought about this and constructed out like you know a couple different statements you can actually run these through different software like free software that's available on the internet to check for like reading level like how how complicated is this stuff but if you're finding yourself explaining like relatively simple concepts and these very long you know complicated manners my my first instinct is to say hey just try to explain it in one sentence or less dumb it down it's fine because they're not asking you like what are all the mechanisms by which somebody may lose weight please provide references I might ask you that right in a question an open book test soon becoming for the barbell medicine training certification no but with respect to just you know peer to you know or not peer to peer communication but also just client to provider communication if they're disassing you how do you lose weight the answer would would be I you need to be in a calorie deficit and if we can find you a way to adhere to a diet where you're eating less calories than you burn for a day we're gonna get there you don't need to go into this long thing because then there they might that might trigger additional questions that you'll have to answer in a similar way so the Twitter I call it the Twitter method you have 160 characters to effectively explain a complex topic and if you can't fit it in there I think you might need to think about this a little harder before you respond it's easier to make up with volume of language no rather than substance and then I also think again having the preprepair materials offer common questions or fact frequently asked questions super useful that's what like in the medical clinic we always laugh or I always used to laugh rather about the pamphlets like the handouts but a lot of that stuff has been thought about even research on some levels in order to better communicate these things because you can't think of a off the cuff response that's necessarily going to be helpful so you can have the pamphlet literally go through that with them and say here's what I think and this is for you to have yeah this is difficult for sure and so you know my regular job in the in the medical setting in the hospital setting I train residents and medical students and so I frequently observe their interactions with patients and I get to see how they counsel patients how they talk with patients how they educate and kind of the way they speak and overwhelmingly the most common problem that I see when they're talking to patients is using too much complicated medical jargon when explaining things to patients particularly really these really complex medical things that they're saying admitted to the hospital for so I always end up debriefing with them and tell them hey that was like you know they were clearly not understanding what we were talking about there this is how I would explain this and it takes practice to develop like an arsenal of metaphors of explanatory strategies to explain some of these complicated things but the way I at least initiate these conversations is always by asking the patient what they know about a particular topic so they somebody might say how do I lose weight and I'm like well maybe tell me what you already know about this condition tell me what you know about you know being overweight tell me what you know about weight loss and that might get nothing that tells me where I need to start like at the very bottom right or they might have some degree of knowledge but it might be wrong well that gives me a little place to start in terms of you know steering them in the right direction or they might start spouting off a whole bunch of complex scientific jargon I'm like oh you're like a scientist and you already know all this stuff right so I've had you know I've seen that a lot with patients who come in and they and I asked them what do you know about this and they'll spread out a bunch of medical jargon like oh you're in healthcare so I can talk to you at a particular level so I use that initial question of tell me what you know about this as my screening tool to identify where the person is at in terms of their level of education and then I tried to reflect that back at them with my language in terms of the way I explain things so I just reflect what they're giving me back at them and again that takes practice uh takes a lot of a lot of work and you have to pay a lot of attention to your language which is something that hopefully you took away from the pain lecture already in terms of words that we use with people when discussing these topics so paying attention towards uses is good but I like assessing where people are at and then just reflecting it back at them yep and to get feedback on like how good or bad of a job you did just asking for a teach back at the end of whatever your communication was so like okay so let's review let's review tell me what you know you know now what you know about this yeah can be useful because if they if nothing comes back you're like bang it missed again but hopefully you build like again certain murder metaphors certain phrases explanations that stick with you add to your arsenal there's a bunch of doctor Lawrence my psych attending like every time she feels oh my gosh I thought he was like like a CD player like you just skip to the next track every time you prescribe the medication it would be the same thing every single time and now in retrospect he probably had explained each one of those things a couple hundred of different times and was like here's how to best explain that so people understand or just you know he liked it personally I don't all right next question do you believe heart rate plays a role in program design for cardiovascular fitness if so when if not why I feel like this is a bit of a kind of a try to get me to commit to like a strong man kind of thing like so I think that the heart like obviously obviously your heart rate is going to be a thing that you're going to use or sorry that you're going to sort of monitor or it's going to be a part of the actual exercise program prescription I just don't like using that as the intensity sort of communication meaning that go run at a you know heart rate of 140 to 150 beats per minute or 80 percent of your max heart rate one because not everyone has a heart rate monitor to some of the problems with accuracy of heart rate monitors particularly with novel sort of training and modalities and then in addition I just I prefer the ease of use with RPE effectively they're both measurements of internal load but RPE you don't need any specialized equipment and does the same scale that you can use across a wide different variety of modalities so that being said I do use heart rate prescription for people who are new to certain exercises so for example I have a client right now who's like I want to get better at running I'm terrible at running so after we address the catastrophic language then I was like okay so do you have a heart rate monitor he happened to have one I was like great so I need you to go you're going to go jog for 25 minutes at an RPE 6 your heart rate's not going to go over 130 beats per minute if it does you need to start walking because I wanted him to understand like even if he didn't feel like he was working that hard his heart rate was telling him something different because he was very new on the other hand if I had a person that same person but they didn't have a heart rate monitor I'd probably just lower the RPE I'd say RPE 5 meaning you should be able to talk in complete sentences you might be able to sing a bar from your favorite song provided it's not Dr. Gray and you're not just yelling all right so you're actually sing twist the yeah long long bar if you don't know twist is a Lincoln bio so yeah it's obviously a thing I just don't use it that often I just don't use it that often mate again because there are limitations to it and then not everyone has heart re-monitor I think if we did more cardiovascular like if we were the the cardio dudes like well I mean cardio has their medicine yeah for about 15 years I was a cardio dude when I swim and obviously the talk test is not an option when you're swimming right where you can you know talk but not sing not really not really an option under water we also didn't use heart rate monitors in general but when I think back to the way at least my college swimming coach programmed a lot of our sets he just used a color system pink red or blue and those were increasing in tech no no blue was actually like all out sprint like maximal and then red was like what I would call like an RPE8 and pink was like an RPE6 and then like no color assigned was like you know the first warm-up sets or something like that and so when I think back I'm like oh he was just using you know internal load you know kind of an RPE type thing but even more simplified which means that if you are working with a client and using a one to ten numerical system for their RPE rating is too difficult then you know it could literally be like you know a stoplight color code system or something like that right and that's you know gonna be gonna be getting you close and you've used you've talked about the feeling scale before it's like this set should feel bad and that you know that's something that's gonna be pretty hard to see this has been researched yeah so for general population people who don't care about one RM powerlifting performance and you're just trying to get a ballpark intensity prescription probably good enough yeah use a feeling scale or don't yeah we often hear from a nutritional and fitness standpoint that you want to live it inflammation I know that certain disease states involve inflammation but inflammation is also part of the healing process can you distinguish between good versus bad inflammation and when we want to control or limit inflammation yeah I mean I think the biggest thing here is is the amount of total inflammation so inflammation when it is in excess is can be or can be problematic generally inflammation cause from training or from other sort of what we would consider it potentially beneficial or benign sources do not go to the level where it can cause harm so one common marker of inflammation is like this metric called C reactive protein or CRP another one BESR the RITS are site sedimentation rate there are studies out there showing that the resistance training drives up CRP at ESR after training but a little bit enough where that's still within the error margins of the test itself and it's effectively meaningless we don't know what to do with the slightly elevated ESR or CRP that doesn't reach a certain threshold where common diseases hang out so it's really just a total amount of inflammation same thing with dietary interventions so you can go find a study right now that talks about tart cherry juice how it lowers cut CRP in half but what that study also says is that the level by which it's cutting in half is a normal level it just goes from literally one and a half to 0.75 and it doesn't you don't even think about that metric until it gets to 10 okay so that's an oversimplified view of inflammation and like how we would want to either assess it or address it but the way I think about it is that in disease processes the amount of inflammation and total inflammation is large and then the amount of inflammation that occurs second dairy to resistance training or other potentially beneficial or benign sort of stresses tend to be well below the the level that causes disease yeah I think that outside of having a diagnosed autoimmune or auto inflammatory syndrome medical condition like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, etc that there's really no reason for you to be worried about inflammation yeah well that's something when you're worried about it because in general you shouldn't because even you know I see enormous amounts of acute inflammation in patients sometimes who come in with sepsis severe infections things like that and even that inflammation which is off the charts in terms of how high it is I'm not trying to suppress it because I recognize that it's an immune response to the infection that's going on and I'm treating the infection to try to deal with that so even in that situation I'm not trying to suppress inflammation in these autoimmune auto inflammatory syndrome where your body is chronically attacking itself yep that merits treatment by somebody who's qualified to handle those kind of immune suppressing medications and things like that but for anybody who doesn't have those medical conditions don't worry about it you know it's going to happen it's a normal part of human existence it is an immune mediated process that's generally physiologic adaptive it helps you recover from training heal from injuries and recover from other illnesses and I just wouldn't worry about it's become like a like a demonized kind of a buzzword that people worry about when they really shouldn't it's just inflammation and just cause something hurts doesn't mean it's inflamed which doesn't mean you need to take anti-inflammatory medications either sure general doesn't help for a lot of things sure yeah all right 20 years ago 20 years ago there was controversy or at least discussion of pediatricic effects of statins in afloat sclerosis what is the current thought on these effects I see parents here yeah basically the question is you know people have discussed whether statins reduce cardiovascular through a bunch of other mechanisms unrelated to cholesterol and they definitely do have a bunch of other effects however I'll cite I will say that we have a huge body of evidence at this point both from genetic data these fancy studies called medallion randomization studies as well as randomized control trials of medications that basically show that any intervention that we can do that lowers the blood lipid level yeah you can actually predict how much it's going to reduce risk based on how much it lowers the blood lipid level so I'll quote this line from a Brian Francis 2017 paper where he says that trials suggest that the effect of low density lipoproteiner LDL on the risk of cardiovascular events is approximately the same per unit change in LDL cholesterol for any mechanism that lowers LDLC so basically any intervention that lowers those numbers a certain amount you get the same effective risk reduction so whether that's from a statin or whether it's from something else or whether it's from something else per unit reduction in blood LDL levels you get the same predictable risk reduction so the overwhelming effect of those medications on reducing cardiovascular risk is via lowering LDL levels or these lipoproteines that we talked about so in general play a tropic effects interesting topic not super relevant to worry about yeah it's like every one millimole of LDL concentration that you lower it's at 18% get to a certain amount of risk of CBD yeah which is cool yeah parents is a meta no yeah he lives probably not in your opinion when does it oh wait oh wait oh wait oh wait oh I escaped one how to set realistic lifting goals for a first year lifter broadly and specifically weight on the bar in the main lifts yeah that's a great question um i mean i i think about to my personal experience all right let's talk about our first years first years in lifting okay first year in lifting i remember i was a freshman at Truman State University i had just came back from this dislocated hip that's how I got into resistance training i was told the squat and i was like got a squat so i went to the gym and i didn't know that you could load weights lighter than 45 pounds on a you can't first squat can't because i never seen it right when i was in there doing curls because that's all i was doing at the time curls in incline bench because i wanted to target my upper pecs all i saw were people loading plates right on the leg press and on a squat so i just thought you put a plate on a squat so i remember i won thirty five i walked it out i squat it down probably half depth and it pinned me i just that i was died yeah luckily i didn't then i figured out their lighter weight increments um my first year of squat did 500 to be clear it was probably high but whatever you know sometimes it's like that i did a bench three sixty five for a double and i deadlifted five forty five to in Nike shocks that was the key um he's what we would call a high responder to train sure or you know i don't know i just i was in college man's what you do right just lift weights and get get jacked yeah i didn't have the same experience but i would okay but i remember thinking in my in my head like i wanted to squat five hundred like my first year i wanted to squat 500 i wanted to deadlift 500 and i wanted to bench 365 and then at soon of the end of the first year i was like like i remember the soon as i squated 500 i was like i need six plates and as soon as like all in the way up three sixty five's going up i'm like i need four oh five five forty five i thought six hundred like that's immediately how it went but i didn't have any like lifetime goals and every time i had like set a lifetime goal uh it was always too low so i think now in hindsight here's the loud recommend for a first year lifter don't pick lifetime goals pick like medium medium to long term goals that you think are reasonable in next year too so for example you're in your first year you want to squat 500 like that's you know not in your first year but that's maybe your that's maybe your first like medium term goal okay right so maybe it's then the first three years of training which i think is reasonable if you're like a pretty good responder to training if yeah okay look i know i've been saying though like pick a pick a goal that you think is achievable in the next six to twelve months three six twelve months something like that and that should be your and then you got to keep redoing that so now what happened the last PR that i hit i dead lifted seven thirty five right and on the way up the only thing in my brain was like i bet 800 to be fucking cool like i can't even be happy you know just sad on my own my own it but yes my recommendation for a new lifter would be to pick uh something that you can do in the next twelve months see you and uh and and go from there but i don't think it's appropriate to try to develop like lifetime goals because you just don't know how you're gonna respond you know this dude you squatted 285 at the end of your what nine nine five yeah i mean i suppose i lifted weights in high school when i was a swimmer because i was smart enough to do some non-swimming stuff sure then i didn't similarly didn't know what i was doing and just did what other people did in the weight room pretty much when i actually started barbell training properly or proper like that yeah it's quite a 285 in four months of training yeah i think that started around one twenty five or something on the squat i guess yeah um but how many people running that same program looks quite more than you lots of them how many of those people have been more than you for a single very few none of them yeah the point is that your initial results within the first six months or a year are not predictive of how you're gonna do long term so that's why i don't think it's a that you could do like these lifetime goals yeah no i agree with that i actually probably wouldn't if i you know if i were in that situation i probably wouldn't set goals in terms of number performance at all at the beginning fair because i think about where i was and there was a guy who was front squatting three fifteen of my gym and i thought he was a god it was like i don't know if i'll ever be able to do that right and i've since front squatting three fifteen for ten i just had no concept of anything back then and so numbers were like meaningless and i would probably rather set like process goals rather than outcome goals right process goals being you know i want to train say three times a week consistently not miss a session for the next nine months or something like that i would set that kind of a goal um rather than a number because i think a number you end up doing stupid things when there are a number goals right because if you're not on pace then you start doing stupid things to try to speed up the pace if you start to get greedy and you try to get too close to it and then maybe you have a setback then you're like whole goal is ruined and then you're like lose a bunch of motivation and bad things happen from that standpoint um so even now i don't typically set hard numerical goals for myself because training has so many ups and downs particularly at this stage of our training training has so many ups and downs um and PRs are few and far between they take a long time to get through so i don't actually set new numerical i'm like it'd be cool to lift this much but i don't know what i'm gonna get there i'm just gonna keep training and you know show up four times a week and put in the work or whatever until i get there so i focus way more in process goals than on outcome goals for myself where other people feel like i want to win national so i'm like okay well i guess if that's realistic then maybe you're gonna win national yeah i'm glad you brought up the process being process oriented particularly early on because again you're just guessing with numbers anyway like outcome really to goals but if that's your thing okay i just think something short term is probably a little more uh tangible than like always what so i have an laundry like that you're probably bound to be disappointed yeah never gonna happen probably last question is it yeah oh have you ever been in a position where you're willingness to denounce silly BS in medicine negatively affected relationships with colleagues or friends if so what was your experience like and how did you deal with it uh yes this has happened often i mean i mean so so for me i it doesn't matter to me if i'm wrong and what i mean by that is not that i don't get upset or like it doesn't like challenge my like oh man or i don't want to prove that i'm right but like i don't hold a grudge about it i just like thing i was wrong i feel smarter at the end of that and then i get to tell you guys funny stories well i'm like writing stuff on the board i'm like yeah and then i thought this and turns out i was an idiot um at the moment you feel like oh my whole being is being challenged um but in general i like go that you know relatively quickly after i accept that i was wrong so i'm i'm cool with with with feeling that uh some other individuals are not cool with feeling that and want to protect that at all costs and so if we disagree on something it's not just that we disagree and like we can still be friends and get a beer together but it's i think that they're stupid i think that they're a bad person and we can't ever hang out again one of my you know i thought we were boys my publish that article shades gray and we're not friends anymore like we we i had a sense of a text message to be like hey like we we good you know and he's like you know there was some some back and forth there and and uh yet i don't think we're gonna ever add i think it's irreparable so it's unfortunate you know because i thought we were friends just because we have a different sort of opinions on things doesn't mean that we can't be you know cordial and like talk about other stuff so that's one thought but it's happened a lot i think with respect to denouncing silly bs like our main thing is like we don't want individuals to cause harm in our community so we're more apt to speak out against people we feel like are doing harm i also think that now particularly are are we've kind of pivoted instead of like just arguing with people we'd rather just put out our own information and say here's what we think if you're willing to accept it you will into you know look at this critically like cool good if you want us to just argue with somebody on on their own terms like probably not gonna engage in that too often unless you know have had a few too many drinks or like super bored so i think you like we've kind of graduated in a way like instead of putting out you know trying to extinguish somebody else's flange like we'll just build our build our own light and and let people come to us yeah that's pretty much my where where i'm at at this point in terms of putting out information trying to support it as best i can and then if people are wanting to buy into that that's cool and if not that's cool too but we get tagged all the time and stuff that people try to drag us into arguments and 100% of the time i ignore those tags just you can't drag me into this stuff anymore um get DMs from people trying to argue about stuff ignore that and it's just not worth it to me so there's some degree of like self preservation that has to happen because we're in this like public space now that i never really asked for but here we are so hello kind of well hold on what let's go back to like 2015 you're about to graduate yeah so let's say that we were having a standard brocestersh mega rush yeah all right and i was like looked dude like five years from now we're gonna be on tour prestige worldwide bridging the gap between modern medicine and striking dishening and communicating this as public figures in the community you you cool with that or not well if i wasn't ever cool with that i don't think we're doing you'd be psyched you'd be like wait really yeah and i'd be like and get this you're not gonna work full time at all so well you'd be like whoa yeah i think being in a public being in this public space uh it comes with a bunch of challenges with it and you can let it kind of wear you down in some capacities or you can develop some coping mechanisms and so there's certainly colleagues that i've come to disagree with on things and that's led to some of us going in our separate directions necessarily but yeah i i have developed things some skills of emotionally detaching from some of those things and not letting it wear me down too bad because it's it's not worth it so i think that i agree we try to put out this material put out a positive message get people empowered self efficacious taking care of themselves and training and then you know haters gonna hate hate is gonna play or look i'm adding one question okay because we already talked about it so we know the answer okay so we were asked yesterday by Russell we had to ask a physician like five questions or we had like five criteria to pick a primary care doctor what would those five things be because we could ask some variation of this question all the time like what makes good primary care doctor and that's how everyone talks in my mind so i'm sorry i know either none of you sound like that but in my mind like that's what sound like that's so i have a hearing problem okay so i'm gonna do this from memory you correct me if i'm wrong okay so is effectively the familiarity with the following five things so you have to be familiar with the obesity guidelines from the american academy of enter chronology 2016 you have to be familiar with the low back pain series in the Lancet good 2018 2018 so funny you have to use the uh USPSTF uh guidelines training guidelines yeah all right what else were the other two i forgot the other two you haven't said the physical activity guidelines yet you have to be familiar with the physical activity guidelines for americans 2018 2018 because they're updated yeah it was a fifth one do we forget what was the fifth one i know it was like a wild card hmm maybe you have to be really good at this whole behavior change do you? yeah that was like my my take on this you know so so the idea is wrapping up the behavior change in motivational interviewing stuff all in one like criterion yeah you just have to have access to like at least we're gonna be able to refer people just to to different places if you don't have time to do this in your clinic um the whole thing you know is that you're familiar with what we consider to be the oh would be the it was the high blood pressure uh stuff because you're thinking the top five risk factors for mortality yeah yeah yeah so the top five risk factors for mortality we would have except expect the primary care doc to be able to take care of or at least make some sort of headway in and so again that's addressing obesity addressing being sedentary addressing high blood pressure addressing high blood sugar yeah i'm sure it's okay and smoking yes and then also having this oh by the way i can i can work with you on pain too doesn't mean that the other skills that they learn or learn in residency or that a learning medical training aren't useful it's just like i don't necessarily care if my low if my primary care doctor can diagnose this particular autoimmune disease or you know treat treat some other condition with there this there might be a specialist for that i'd rather have more primary care doctors who know these things than you know we're able to exercise a lipoma you can get your office sure yeah so yeah that's it for our first seminar for 2020 thank you guys so much for coming out

=== FILE: Not Losing Weight In A Calorie Deficit, What Do？ [MYU2KfmS9Pg].txt ===

Music Music New client reports eating below their total daily energy expenditure, but isn't losing weight, what do? I imagine we can't instantly correct under reporting. Specifically, do you still prescribe an amount of calories that should result in weight loss per the NIH, if they report a total daily energy intake lower than the prescription? So basically, somebody say, I'm eating these calories, but I'm not losing weight, what do? So just like I was talking about in the nutrition lecture yesterday, if the first you check the adherence, right? So it's like, hey, look, are you sticking to this plan? And they say yes. And you're like, okay, cool. And you're taking them at their word, and they're not losing weight at that calorie level, I would reduce calories, and a story. If you do that again, and they're still not losing weight, I kind of go through the same process again. We've just reduced another 250 to 500 calories. They're reporting being buried adherent, and still not losing weight. At that point, when I check for adherence, so let's say two weeks have gone by, they still have a loss weight. Ask them, hey, how's your adherence been? Any issues? We talk about it. I usually ask for proof, not in a way like I'm being an investigator here or interrogating them, but I want to see like there. My fitness path log or however they're tracking their food or something like that, just to kind of make sure that they're counting things correctly. Maybe there's not some sort of error. I also check for things that people don't tend to count certain condiments, sugar sweeten beverages, alcohol, stuff like that. Issues think that people have trouble logging. They're like, yeah, I don't log any of my coaxes because it's liquid. So you'd be surprised. And I mean, you know, this obviously happened sometimes otherwise I wouldn't have the story, but that alcohol and condiments tend to be like the three biggest offenders there for things that people don't track and then snacks. Like, you know, are you snacking on stuff in between meals? And you know, again, this is all in the context of somebody who's trying to lose weight and we've just lowered calories and still doesn't work. And so if nothing appears odd there, then I lower calories again. I'm not averse to continue to lower calories unless I suspect there's this really big adherence issue, you know. Now, obviously we had a client for a while who was, you know, over 200 pounds and then was reporting not losing weight at 1200 calories, but reported 7 out of 7. Every day she was very adherent. And I was like, well, let me see, I'd love to see the my fitness pal reports. I was like, oh, yeah, they're on my phone. I don't know how to get them to you. And I was like, well, you know, you just take them screenshots and just let them see them see what you're eating. It's like, it seems like a long process. Like, I don't know that I can get them to you. There was some resistance. And I got it. And so the whole thing wasn't to be like, gotcha ha ha ha. You know, there's the issue. The thing was like, well, let's address the actual problem. Right. What are the, you know, what sort of barriers do we have to adherence? And we had an even barrier to admitting there was a problem with adherence. So again, the thing isn't gotcha. The thing is, all right, we have an issue here. What's, how do we address the communication thing first and then figure out strategies to overcome the adherence issue? So that's how I address the issue and just some common things that I've seen over time. Austin, you have anything to add? I don't have anything to add to that. All right. Thank you.

=== FILE: Powerlifter Competes in Strongman. I REALLY Messed Up on a few of these events. [H5WW6SKlzG0].txt ===

My name is Jordan Faganbaum, I'm the creator of Barbel Medicine and I'm going to do a strong man competition. Yeah, so I normally compete in powerlifting, I just did powerlifting me two weeks ago, never had done a strong man competition or anything like this before. I don't know, I had this competitive bug where I was like, I want to compete in powerlifting again and I want to compete in strong man. And I'd been wanting to do a strong man meat for a while just because the events look fun, you get to display your strength in different ways, it looks like it's a fun thing to watch for the crowd and I don't know the idea of doing these different types of strength displays. It seems fun. You get to do axle bar deadlifts and clean and press and pull a truck like that all seems cool and I don't know, I just finished it and try and it. I've never trained any strong man stuff before actually, which is interesting because I used to train at this gym, brute strength gym in Norfolk, Virginia and I was in medical school and they had all of the strong man stuff there. They had everything from like finger fingers to the appallants wheel to a Hussophel stone. They had regular stones, yolks and farmers walk handles and framed heres and a car deadlift and I mean literally everything but I didn't touch any of that stuff. I think in fact one time at the gym some of the guys were goading me into do like a car deadlift and I don't know. Because they knew I was like decent polar. They were like yeah, you know, I'm fighting about going and do this car deadlift and luckily no video exists from that because it was not a good display of my strength. But I literally have never done a joke, never have done stones or anything like that up until two weeks ago when I started training for the strong man meat. Yeah, so a parallel thing that like said two weeks ago and then since then basically got right back on the horse and started training. So I had to meet on Sunday and then Tuesday we went to Chicago and I started training again. I mean, it's still been squatted and deadlifting but I have been squatting with the yoke, the yoke attachments if I can find them and I've been doing more reps because I'm trying to build some capacity to walk with this heavy yoke. So I've been basically working up to heavy set of five and then doing some sets of ten for back off work and then all the pressing work I've been doing with has been mostly with an axle. I think I've bench pressed once in the last two weeks, something like that and then everything else has been either axle press or axle cleaning press or something like that. And I've used the flip all bar Swiss bar to bench press once and then for my deadlift training I've just been doing deadlifts with the axle if I can get one to play on. If not, I've been just deadlifting for high reps on the regular barbell because it's Amrap deadlift in a minute. So just kind of trying to build some capacity there. But yeah, how it basically has been working is just one or two, you know, couldnt go big lifts, so it would be like squat with the yoke attachments or yoke bar or something like that and then axle press and then I would do some event specific work like farmers walk or yoke yoke walks or actually don't know if they call them that. This is just what I call them. So over a heavy sled push and pull medley, something like that. So it's basically how I've been training for the last two weeks. I mean, obviously it'd be nice to have more time to train. It just hasn't worked out like that. Oh yeah, okay, so event-wise there's a max deadlift. I think it's 500 pounds for the lightweight men. I'm going to be at the 200 pound class. Although they did just combine it. It's like under 231, so I'm not going to cut. I'm just going to go weigh in at like 202 or 205 or whatever. I end up being into the middle of the day, so I'm going to eat normally and then just weigh in because it doesn't matter. But yes, so there's an Amrap deadlift at 500 pounds using an axle bar. And I asked Alan, I was like, why are you guys using the axle? You know, if it's from the floor, like what's the deal? He's like, yeah, so the bar doesn't give it all, like a normal bar belt would and then the plates don't roll. So, and obviously the thing is thicker, so it's a little bit forward. I was like, I mean, weird flex, but okay, Alan. So it's one minute as many reps as possible, so it's at 500. I feel pretty confident about that because deadlifts. So I think the last time, I've been, I've trained this a few times over the past two weeks. 525 for a set of 10, like an 8 and then I did 500 for 12 at an 8. And yeah, some pretty confident about that one, it should be okay. Although I wonder if they allow you to like, touch and go, because I don't know how to do that. I mean, not efficiently anyway, so we'll see how that goes. And then the second event is a clean and press. I think most people are going to be continental cleaning pressing, and I don't know how to do that. So I'm just going to like muscle clean it and then strict press it because I'm pretty efficient. If that's I did 260, 255 and 260 have done that in the last two weeks and Allencing to think that'd be pretty competitive. So so then they have a yoke and farmers walk medley, so it's 700 pounds on the yoke and then 300 pounds in each hand on the farmers walk. So the first time I did the yoke was three days after my meat, uh, and I was in Chicago, and I loaded it up to 600 pounds and that felt fine. And then the next time I did it was two days after that, uh, in Chicago, Alan was there, and I loaded it to 700 pounds and that felt terrible. I think the yoke was too high and my stance was too narrow and whatever and I don't know what I'm doing. So that just it felt bad. And so that was my, those were my two times, um, you know, being exposed to the yoke, basically just like walking school hot, so there's something like that. But heavy, uh, so we'll see how that goes. I've been able to practice on the farmers handles a few times, so I'm more confident in that, although I guess it's going to depend on which farmers handles they use. So I just I bought a pair from rogue, which seemed fine. And, um, yeah, it's hard to hold onto 300 plus pounds in each hand, but I've been doing it. So, uh, I feel okay about that. The next one, the stones, uh, I've touched stones once in my life. Alan was there, and, uh, there's definitely some skill to it, and then I just don't know what I'm doing. Um, but I can pick the stones up pretty well. Uh, it's just figuring out how to like, readjust and get it over the, over the bar. Uh, and I guess you, we have to carry them, too. So I'm not very confident about that, just given the fact that I'm only going to want's. And then, uh, the last event, I think is the truck pole push medley, which seems pretty self explanatory. Uh, I've been just pushing and pulling a heavy sled to try to get ready for that. So we'll see in my cardio is, you know, reasonably good. Uh, so overall, I feel pretty confident. I don't have no idea what to expect competition-wise, and I have no idea, like how the flow of the meat's going to go. So we'll see how all that shakes out. Uh, it should be a good time though. And, uh, I don't know, I'm pretty competitive guy. So, let's see if I can sneak in there for maybe a podium or something like that. Also my favorite thing so far. Uh, I don't know. Honestly, probably the, the farmer's handles have been like the most quote unquote fun at just because like, I don't know, you feel like more athletic, just carrying something really, really heavy and it's hard. And I don't know, it's like cool, because you get to use a lot of weight. I like that. Uh, the yoke has been the least fun. And I know it just said it's cool to like do this thing with a lot of weight or whatever in the yokes even heavier, but it's just so uncomfortable. And I know that sounds like whatever it excuse. I just, it's really uncomfortable. And I think the learning process for that maybe is a little longer than farmer, so at least for me. So, uh, but yeah, that and the stones are cool. And I don't know, I just think it's going to be fun to go out there and do something different. And, uh, so if we can, uh, see if we can put in a good result. If you're not using a new iron mind straps that I just got, they're not paying you say these. I love their straps. I have their so easy straps that I normally use, prepare a lifting for a lot of supplemental pulls when I need them. But these are the longer ones for straw man, which are handy for the accident. So I got to check out those water bottle, action probably gonna wear my deadlift shoes. Certainly on the accident deadlift. And probably on the farmers walk and yoke medley. I'll probably wear my Olympic shoes for the clean press and the stones. And then I'll probably wear these things. These are just like mechons, whatever for the truck pull push. I don't love those shoes. I'm just saying, I don't love them. I probably wouldn't train them, uh, although I did pull 500 for 10 in them and I never find. And I think I pulled 5, 15 for 10 in 2 and they're also fine, you know, but that's still, I don't love these shoes for just like general training. I was trying to push it heavy, heavy and the shoe kept coming off. And I had these things like cinch down. Like the heel kept coming off. Not, not certainly comfortable. Uh, let's see, pair X. This YouTube video has been sponsored by pair X. I guess some kind of wood. But yeah, just some caffeine. Uh, to use that, you get my Olympic shoes, watches, whatever, and cool, short of loads. This is in here. I'm going to bring my wrist straps, even though I don't think I'm going to use them for anything. But if I do want to use them on the cleaner press, I haven't been using them, but maybe I won't just in case. I have all these, uh, uh, uh, don't see it all, bringing these knees sleeves, probably these just in case. I have one among the, uh, or farmers, which I, I might. Um, but, uh, you know, balance, that's a good idea. But yeah, almost brain just in case. That's the other stuff. Okay. Yeah. So these are the, the row straps that I bought, because I thought they were going to be long enough to use on the axle. They're like one inch short. So I'm not going to bring those out. And then these are my normal straps, so easy. Once for my reminder, I probably had these for like five or six years. I'm not going to bring them, because I don't get a strong enough comp, but these are my favorite straps. Also, and I think has the same ones, but they make a longer version. There's like one or two inches longer, and I think he's got that. This had a spin of my fan, I think. It's probably a thing to put it in the belt, ammonia, baby powder. Yeah, I'm probably not. I don't know if I've been bringing this. I think balance got tacky for me, I didn't buy my own, but what are these? Oh, just socks. Do those in there? Yeah, I'm like most of my life is very unorganized. Oh, I brought a spare change of clothes. I still have a similar. And my meat shirt, I think those things fall in need of your wash. What do you guys think? This is gross. So, headphones, chaps to great. Well, I'll get packed up, get ready to go, and the blast off in the morning. I'll go see Alan. I'll put on tape straight. All right, made it to the venue, rep in the old vintage barbell medicine shirt. Getting ready for rules briefing and first event, things to axle deadlift. So, I'll talk to about that. First, I'm in me. Let's do it. And I fell in a corkerance when I was a kid. And still I can a girl芝ifi on short barbell medicine shirt popping up. I'm gonna get up and start getting through I'm gonna get up and start getting through I'm feeling cold I can't wait to hear the melody go I'm gonna go into the beat I'm gonna go into the beat I'm gonna get up and start getting through I'm gonna go into the beat I'm gonna go into the beat I'm gonna drop that stuff. I'm gonna drop that stuff. I'm gonna drop him with a bear. What happened there, Jordan? Not strong enough. Yeah, the yolk just, I mean, as the third time I've ever touched the yolk. So, I'm gonna drop you again. Four, four, four. So I think, I mean, you saw like, the first two, like, it's not knowing what to do. I was just, I was just, I was just, I was just, I was like, oh, I figured it out. I almost made the whole pass and a farmer thought I was tired. And retrospective? How would I have done more, you? I'm saying you're under a train. I'm saying, for this specific type of strength, I'm under train. Can I change my clothes? Touch me. Oh, my clothes... Oh, my clothes... There she is. Here you go. There he is. There he is. There he is. There he is. Where are you going? There's my hot plan. There he is. There he is. There he is. There he is.osse- roast and Yeah, when you were like, we're taking, we're taking. Yeah, remember when we were, yeah, we were like Steve, I said you were just going to sweat. I was like, pick it up and it was like, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's a job dude. It's like a deadlift bar with stones. Yeah. Yeah. I'm really, really. Yeah. Yeah. I'm really, really. Yeah. Go. I'm really, really, really. I'm really glad to be here. I'm really glad to be here. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We're going to get this backpack, and we're going to get this backpack. I'm really glad to be here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm really glad to be here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good, a good, a good, a good, a good. I'm here! I'm the winner! I'm going! Let's go! Come on! I'm going! Come on! You go! Come on! You go! You should sit. Hey, you're out! Hey, we did do it, go, go, go! Can you do it with a coaching? She's like... She's like... Yeah, literally I was like... Trying to dig in? Yeah. Like the MX. Slip it. I wanted to shine up. You're pushing with the tires straight. Super man, bro. Yeah. Alright, so that was my first strong man competition. I had a ton of fun, all the events were completely different than anything I had done before. And I had a blast. Things I would do differently. I would train actually for strong man competitions, been a longer amount of time preparing, doing the specific events. Mainly just to improve my skill set with respect to doing those actual movements. The actual deadlift obviously was fine because it's deadlift. But the clean and press even I would have preferred to learn how to do the continental clean and press. So my best strict press of all time is 295 pounds. But if I have to muscle clean it and then press it, especially with an axle of the best I've ever done. It's 260 which was a week prior to the meat. The issue was this particular bar was like smoothly machined. It wasn't like chrome or polished or anything like that. But it was just very, very smooth compared to the textured rogue bar that I had bought and practiced with. So ultimately I would have liked to learn the continental clean and press because I think that I could do a lot better. I would have liked to have known the rules a little bit more clearly on the axle clean and press as far as how they do tie breakers. So in my mind it was like a powerlifting me where you could just do you know you have your three attempts and whoever's got the heaviest weight at the end of the three attempts is the winner. If there's a tie they go on body weight or just everyone gets the same amount of points. In strong man it the tie is broken by who opened heavier. So I opened at 180 just because I wanted to take all three attempts and my plan was go from 180 to 220. Then if you 20 felt great I was going to go to 260 because they were taking 20 pound jumps but I felt pretty confident on my press 220 felt okay but the texture of the bar. I just didn't feel confident being able to muscle clean 260. So even though a lot of us tied at 240 I lost the tie breaker which is why I got fifth in that event. How I opened at 220 I would have actually taken second or third in that event and won the overall for the lightweight men's division. So I wish I would have known that rule and I wish I would have learned how to do the continental clean press. The yolk in farmers carry medley actually went way better than planned. I got second in that event. I would have liked to have practiced more on the yolk so that way I didn't drop it so many times so that I could have a fair shake at doing the farmers carry. Because I think I could have done better on that had I had an opportunity to drop it more than once. I just needed to get my grip set and that didn't do a good job of that. The stones actually went better than planned because I've only touched stones once before and so being able to carry and then load 240 was pretty good for me. The last stone I was actually surprised that I couldn't pick it up. Yeah, I decided to use medical tape around my forearm because I was told that that would help with the tacky that was already on the stones and from the other competitors. And then I would like that. However, my forearms got sweaty and the things just slid down. I wish I wouldn't have used them because every time I tried to pick up that last stone it was just kind of like pulling down. So that was a mistake and I would have obviously liked to practice with the stones more but I was just really surprised to not be able to pick it up because I picked up a heavier stone than that before with no tacky, nothing. I just yeah the medical tape was just sliding on there. And then on the truck pull and push that actually went really well. I don't think that I could have prepared any better for that. I did well on that. The shoes that I had those Nike Metcon flying it, whatever the heck they are. Nike's definitely not paying me to say this because I do not like those shoes. Even for other sort of general training, you know, just for like a training sneaker. I think they're much better options. I prefer the Metcon one or Metcon two if I have to stick with it Nike or the innovates. Those are like my preferred sort of just general training shoe. If I'm not going to wear weightlifting shoe or something like that or deadless specific shoe. At the meat at this competition, I probably should just want my deadlifts shoes. They're a little stickier. Those Nike's were like just sliding all over the place. And my heel was trying to come out of the thing even though they're the correct size. And I had them cinched down and it's not the first time I've had that problem. I just thought that they needed to break in but yeah, the not my favorite not my favorite shoes. But getting second on that event and second overall, I, you know, can't be unhappy with how I did and I had an absolute blast. So I want to thank Alan Throll and Robert Striehan for putting this meat on the untamed strength. And Sacramento, it was great. I'll probably do another one maybe some time early next year. But before then, I have to move to San Diego and actually a parallel thing to me coming up in October that's in San Diego. So that's going to be a good time. Hopefully a full meat prep can help me pee on my total and all my lifts. That would be a good day for me. And so I'm looking forward to that.

=== FILE: Should Old People Take Steroids？ [3o4uwSEsvbE].txt ===

Okay. Should the elderly be prescribed anabolic steroids? So there are actually some situations where anabolic steroids have been researched for medical use. This includes severe burns because burn patients, whole body burns and things like that is a major hyper-cathabolic state. So there's some research in that world. And other syndromes where there is severe muscle and fat wasting, syndrome called Kekcia. So anabolic steroids have also been researched in like HIV-AIDS related Kekcia where these patients are just literally skin and bones. They've wasted away. So this is being looked at. I think part of the reason outside of the obvious social stigma around this stuff that they're not kind of used more liberally in practice is actually when you look at the available research that we have on this stuff in elderly patients, the outcomes are actually not like mind-blowingly good. And so I think that until such point as that evidence would emerge where we put an elderly individual presumably sarcopenic individual, not just somebody who's elderly for the sake of it, on anabolic if we see fantastic results in terms of quality of life or other kind of positive outcome measures, then I wouldn't expect medical societies or organizations to recommend this stuff until we have a solid evidence based to stand on. Think a big part of it is that that doesn't actually exist yet. And I'm actually open to the possibility that they may not deliver the benefits that we all assume they would. Rather, I think that we should pull the levers that we know work right now, getting physical activity up and getting the nutritional intake to where it should be. And I definitely think it's reasonable for us to research this stuff. But going back to the root of the question should the elderly be prescribed anabolic steroids? At this time, no, that's not wouldn't be my recommendation because we don't have clear evidence of consistent benefit whereas there is some potential for harm, particularly in elderly who, again, remember the number one cause of death in the US in the world that I talked about on day one yesterday is cardiovascular disease. And there are cardiovascular risks associated with these medications. If you were to give them to patients, so we're giving them medications with some known risk from a cardiovascular standpoint and potentially other organ systems that can be evolved. They're involved. There can be side effects on the liver depending on the type of antibiotics deride and the route of administration as well as on the kidneys. And a few other kind of potential side effects and complications for unclear benefit. So we need research to demonstrate clear benefit before we're going to comfortably prescribe it and that really stands. In my opinion for any medical intervention that we're going to do, I would prefer to have good evidence of benefit before I do it. And that has been particularly relevant recently with COVID when it comes to deciding how we're going to treat these patients. Yeah, I won't get good evidence before I decide to give somebody particularly medication that has known risks and unknown benefits. Yeah, I feel similarly mainly with respect to the, obviously the respect of it analysis, but with the existing data on this. If there was robust data showing like, yeah, when you give elderly patients testosterone, they grow huge muscles and their quality of life improves and all this other stuff improves, then I think it would already be widely adopted. Right now you have, you know, a relatively few amount of studies, particularly looking at muscle wasting and muscle in fact combined wastey diseases. So like Austin said, HIV burn patients, other diseases that causes cakexia like liver disease, et cetera. And then a few like fringe papers that like randomly pop up like using testosterone and women who have chest pain like angina. Pretty easy. Yeah, I remember that one. Yes, we were. Or now the most recent paper that came out of this is testosterone use and depression. And there's other papers obviously out there on testosterone, but much fewer on other antibiotic agents, right? So people are talking about like, oxygen, gelone or anovar, decandurable, whatever. This is the same case that Psalms the selective androgen receptor modulators, these are the new drugs that are on the street, well they're on the street right now, but they're being researched. These are effectively, they're supposed to be like steroid analogs, like work like steroids, but have none of the side effects because they're selective for the receptors that they actually bind to. But unfortunately during the phase two clinical trials when they're doing using them on these older people, they're not getting the benefits that are purported like bigger muscles, stronger muscles, being able to be more active or anything like that. And so when you have this data that like overall suggests not a reliable benefit, and then there are known risk factors, it makes sense that the medical community is kind of like, even during our board's prep, I remember on like step one, there was a question about using anabolic steroid, like a patient who was using anabolic steroids, and then like one of the lines was, data that, at present, does not show or shows that anabolic steroids don't provide a performance benefit in sport, please counsel the patient accordingly. And I was like, uh, Vinny down the street at gold, might have been a video. So as far as how this works in the future, I think if better data comes out, that of a useful, in order to get that better data, we need to do more studies. And I think that in general medicine is fairly liberally leaning, liberal leaning, and so as new data emerges, I don't know that any stigma is going to prevent us from like adopting the latest practices provided ample evidence exists. There was a big series of studies that came out, uh, think maybe last year or two years ago called the testosterone trials. It was a big set of multiple studies on testosterone for various outcomes. So if you're interested in this topic, I'll just look up, look, that was up, and get some results. Yep.

=== FILE: Should Older Individuals Gain Weight to Gain Muscle？ [3quGzNFuDWg].txt ===

Question number one, if an elderly individual who is at a healthy weight, but under muscle starts resistance training, should they be eating a caloric surplus to build muscle, given that they are eating enough protein? Well, okay, this is a good question. In general, I don't know that I recommend anybody for weight gain, unless they want to. So if their personal preference is, I'd like to gain weight for whatever reason. Either strength is the most important thing to them, and they have a, they have their room to grow. That's fine. They want to gain more muscle mass, just for their own record. That's fine, but just for like reducing the potential of bad health outcomes from happening, you can do that without gaining a substantial amount of body weight. And a person new to resistance training has a high likelihood of building a lot of lean body mass without increasing their body weight. We see that all the time in individuals with obesity, they simultaneously reduce their waste or comfort and body fat while increasing their lean body mass. And in particular, I don't know that gaining a bunch of weight at an elderly age is likely to be a great idea. Just because if they're already in a healthy, healthy weight as is kind of a qualifier in the question, I mean, I see a lot of elderly folks who are extremely underweight, you know, it's not often that I see individuals who are like have made it into their 80s with morbid obesity. Oftentimes they don't, they get kind of selected out a little bit earlier than that for through various mechanisms, things that we've talked about this weekend, the medical conditions that can arise. So oftentimes the people who make it that far tend to be pretty thin and frail on the other end of this spectrum in those situations, then getting adequate nutrition and putting them into a calorie surplus if we can, does become a priority. But if somebody is already at a healthy weight, then I would just lean on getting them to train rather than worrying about getting them in a calorie surplus. What you know, the internet's going to say, what? Don't you know that in elderly population, the class 1, OBSV has the lowest all-cosm mortality rates? How do you explain that? The question is saying that they're at a healthy weight, so then I would ask how we're defining healthy weight here. Sure. Well, what I'm getting is that it's that explanation, basically ignores, again, a few things that Dr. Baracky said. So individuals who tend to carry a lot of excess adipose tissue tend to get filtered out when we get to that elderly population, so they tend to make it that far. And those who do, there's obviously there's a survivor bias there. And in addition, once you become elderly, having a low BMI, so like in normal or particularly underweight represents either chronic illness or increase in frailty. And so both of those things, portend bad outcomes. We wouldn't necessarily want somebody who's got a normal BMI, or it is slightly in the lower realms of the overweight BMI range to necessarily say, I got to get my BMI to over 30 because that's going to reduce my risk of premature mortality or reduce disease burden. Yep. All right. Sick. We took on the internet. There you go. Boom.

=== FILE: Should You Take Protein When You're Sick？ [IdxDlhaH0JU].txt ===

All right, question number two. If hospitalized, should I have somebody bring me way protein? You know, this is a funny question. I'm not a silly question. I'm not like that. Yeah. So when I was an intern, I did try to routinely order people double protein when I was putting in their nutrition like Rex. So you have to put in orders for every patient you admit. And for diet, you know, you pick, oh, they NPO. So they can't eat anything. Or is it just liquids or whatever? I would routinely put in double protein. And every time I would get a page, like in the audition, I said, why? And I'm like, I mean, look, they're risk for sarcopenia. Oh, I feel like this is, and they're like, no, this is wrong. Yeah, I mean, if I was hospitalized, I would try to eat more dietary protein. And I'm not saying that just because I'm like protein or gains. This is the thing is the risk of like critical illness, myopathy, bed rest, and it's effect on your antibiotic resistance. All those sort of factors, in addition to not training, would all put you up much higher risk for losing muscle tissue. And for most folks, especially those who don't have like a profound amount of extra muscle tissue to lose, having a concentrated source of dietary protein that is available to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. And there's also relatively low in calories, and it's easy to consume, seems like a good deal. So you don't, I mean, if you can't get it in the hospital, because they would give you insure or something or boost or something like that. There's effectively a protein shake that is low in protein. Well, with plenty of sugar in it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, look, it's got calories, and so people can consume that. And I'm not saying that it's bad, universally. I'm just saying that if you're going to have the insure, like I want the extra 20 grams of protein, too, so get you some way. Yeah, I mean, I think that's reasonable. On the other hand, the counter argument that I make frequently, when we're talking about in hospital diets, because I am involved in making these decisions frequently, is that it's unlikely to make a big difference on people's long-term outcomes when most hospital stays or not going to be particularly long. If you're in an unfortunate situation where you're in the hospital for like three months, then sure, I can make an argument that it's going to make a big difference there. But I'll frequently, majority of the patients that I admit to the hospital are going to be in the hospital for three days or less. Most of them, and fewer, they're longer than that. And then the few of us are going to be there for like weeks to months on end. So somebody who's going to be in the hospital for a day or two days or three days, we're going to say, oh, they have heart disease. So we're going to put them on a heart healthy diet for a day in the hospital. And like, it doesn't really do anything. So I tend to not be super picky about that, because ultimately what it ends up is doing is just restricting the patients' choices when they're in the hospital. And they're already miserable enough. And there's no sense in my mind torturing them for something to give them like two meals that fit this criteria that really. So the bigger deal would be if we could get them to consume sufficient dietary protein in the weeks, months, and years leading up to the hospitalization. So they're super jacked when they go to the hospital. And they're at lower risk of in-hospital mortality. And arguably, they don't need to potentially go into the hospital all if the condition could have been averted. So I think that's far more important than worrying about an in-hospital diet because most hospital stays are relatively short. But to the extent they're going to be there for a while, as long as you don't have any reasons not to feed somebody's gut, then sure you can give them some protein. So they're going to be there for a while. If you were going to be in the hospital for seven days, you take it some way. Maybe I'm not going to be going out of my way to get it now. But you know, you know the range of ring these some way. Yeah, probably that strawberry junk junk keeps it in the back of your head. Yeah, I know.

This is really happening here. It's our feet, ready? I've been doing the gym. Alright, just. RPE what it means it was made by the sweet it was made to perceive and to see the appropriate stress that would mean. Thanks into account, very opposed like the tea, nutrition and sleep, so many conditions that play a position telling you what the weights should be, weight and sleep. The benefits of using RPE. It's a scale that reads, 1 to 10, and 10 being a weight you couldn't lift again. Horses. Everyone welcome back to the Barable Medicine YouTube channel. We bring modern medicine to strength conditioning. It's strength conditioning to modern medicine. Dr. Austin Bromke, I am Dr. Jordan Fagamon. This is training blog number 31. We've got some questions that you guys have submitted. We have some form checks that you guys have submitted. We'll review together and then some of my own training because Austin doesn't send me videos anymore. Which makes me sad. So without further ado, let's get into the questions. Make sure to stay tuned to the end of the video to find out how you can submit your own questions. Your own form checks to be reviewed right here on the Barable Medicine YouTube channel. So Austin, this first question from Kyle Fairbain. He asks, Just wanted to start off by saying your content is great and I see that things are picking up for you all. Which is great. Indeed. I had a question in regards to dealing with what I suspect is my particular tendon. I was making pretty good strength gains with my squat and then I started to feel a dull ache that I would squat through the pain. After a couple weeks at the Barable squat, the pain has increased. It is really tender to the point of where I have you load, makes my knee feel like it's going to explode. I've tried rehabbing myself but no results, any tips for recovery or what to do or what to avoid would be great. Thank you for your time. Yeah. So we deal with knee issues pretty frequently, particularly knee issues that are suspicious for tendon opportunities. And so a classic, you're giving it a pretty classic history for something like this. Typically, you can involve a quadriceps tendon opportunity which tends to be a little bit more localized to both the knee cap or a patella tendonopathy that tends to be localized a little bit below the knee cap for most people. And they tend to experience their discomfort associated with the squat, oftentimes in the bottom portion or during the balance or during the ascent when there's a little bit more tension applied to that structure. And so the question is why do these things kind of get sensitized in the first place? And the pathogenesis or the pathophysiology of how tendonopathy is happening is pretty complex. And that's really within the scope of the question, but it's thought that when you kind of chronically overload the tissue, usually in a cyclical fashion above the level that it's adapted to handle for, you know, a certain period of time that things can get a little bit, can get sensitized there. Some histologic changes that can happen, some neurological changes that can happen. There's a bunch of changes that occur in the process of precipitating a tendonopathy. So the question is what do we do about it? And we view these overwhelmingly as load-based issues. And so the treatment approach to it is also going to have to be, it's going to have to target that same issue. So it's going to be a load-based way to approach the management of it. So we just put that up for us that we approach this by managing training loads of justing programming, sometimes exercise selection, things like that overwhelmingly over or will be considered more passive approaches to treating tendonopathy that you might see so things like needle-ing or whatever other types of instruments you use for your tendon. That overwhelmingly don't tend to work compared to sham interventions or placebo interventions. And even surgery, I would be writing up a review of a re-syn article that was published on the role of surgery in tendonopathy and it doesn't really appear to have a great role in it. So what I would do for you is it sounds like at some point along the line that you're training or in your programming, there was some period of overload to that those tissues that were beyond what they were adapted to handle for whatever reason. And the more you continue to try to push through that if it's not improving, you're just prolonging this process. And this is something I've had to learn in the hard way in the past where usually we expect that a lot of aches and pains that come about the course of training tend to get better on their own and in fact they often do. But sometimes they don't and particularly when they start to smell like a tendonopathy is going on, then frequently you really end up requiring a change in how you're managing your programming. And so what I would probably do initially is dial you far back on your intensity. Potentially even on your dose of training volume that you're doing, maybe maybe not depending on how much you're doing right now. And sometimes we also adjust frequency and typically the intervention that we'll do is we'll actually do something either two to three times a week with a non consecutive days to give kind of a day off in between. There's some evidence pertaining to you know how tendons regenerate and adapt to reorganize in this process that where that can be beneficial. And really we need to we don't need to train in a point where there is no discomfort whatsoever. But the threshold or the kind of the decision process that we take here is if your symptoms are tolerable during the training session and they're not markedly exacerbated afterwards or for the 24 hours 36 48 hours afterwards. Then it's probably a reasonable stress dose. The question is how much do you increment it and this is where people frequently get this wrong. Is they want to get back to their prior level of function much more quickly than is realistic. So standard 10 and off the protocols tend to take a minimum of about 12 weeks or so for most kind of standard prescriptions or the studies on the matter. So you're going to have to set expectations early that this is the process you're going to have to commit to your increments are going to have to be small. You know rules of thumb that we use in practice is generally no more than 10% increments from session session oftentimes. I'll pull things even back further than that about you five percent increment from session session early on. But you're talking about loading load absolute load correct. Not like just reps. You're like well as not just resist 10. Yeah, give in that we pull the loads back quite a bit sometimes we'll both prescribe load loads but also physically like restrained people from overloading by introducing some tempo to the movement because you're in straight check it. That's also basically really good. So you know a lot of the protocols that you'll see already have guys use they might have some people start out with something like in the 10 12 upwards of even the 15 rep range using some tempo to get some initial kind of desensitization going on. And basically to get some people some what we call some wins some sessions where they feel like they're getting some work in they're doing okay the next day they're feeling okay and not getting more sensitizing or discomfort. And then those small increments and try to build momentum and chalk up one win at a time each session. And as the loads go up using those increments the reps will eventually come down you can pull the tempo back down closer to normal. Maybe you go from a 10 post walk to a pause walk if that's a tolerable variation for you at the time and kind of again just bridge your way back towards more. And you're way back towards normal function over time but think the biggest place is where people go wrong is trying to do it too quickly which is really involves the increments and loading that you're making. So if you're jumping you know 25 pounds of session you know or some very large increment where that's a substantial percentage from session session that's a great way to make this process last too long. Yeah because it's likely going to resist burp is not on mismatch and you're keep low versus. Chrono versus what what what the tendon is ready to handle at the right time. Yeah, the way I think about this whole thing I mean the questions about I have me pain you know what do yeah and he's suspected to be a tendonopathy. Or tendon related pain which might not be wrong especially given it's pin point ten and it's worse at the bottom of the squat and you use related related those things all tend to like yeah they tend to like drive you towards this tendonitis. Uh, tendonopathy related issue knee pain as far as what the actual diagnosis is you can use location to kind of like you said kind of guide you so if it's up to the. So the. Uh, Patel I either think quadriceps of its below you think you know, Patel or 10 interpellent statement depending on how staunch you and then if necessary was. And if it's around if there's you know it's sort of global thing maybe think Patel of federal pains in your own which have actually put a link to a science article about that's kind of an umbrella term just means. And you know, right exactly so that's the whole thing though that you do have me pain and you suspected to be due to a must feel skeletal cause right now you don't need a call at a tendonitis or tendonopathy and the notice is like you don't need to get because it's not. It's not going to change what you do. So I'm going to change your management. So the real thing here that is again managing load and breaking that sort of cycle of every time that you squat or do ex movement you have pain. But we do like in our me rehab template which I think fits all the criteria that we've talked about like if you need examples of how to sort of okay pull things back in an organized systematic way and then get back to your normal training like that's what that's there for. So I've linked that also in the description below but we begin with like isometric then we change the movements to like tempo variations pause variations usually at higher repringues to again we're breaking the cycle where getting people some wins some momentum where they don't have pain when they squat so that way is the load built in this small incremental way. Then they get back to the normal training. The only other things that I would talk about would be actually be prevention people people would say or ask how do I prevent getting this tendon related knee pain. It's like well thing one is not to have this acute on chronic mismatch in what you're able to tolerate so that just means advancing things if they're volume wise or training intensity wise we're both too quickly for what you're able to tolerate. So which is just standard principles of reasonably good programming until the program occurs yes exactly and then also not. If you are pretty under trained or under strong that is a risk factor for developing sort of pain like this so getting strong anyway that progressively overloads you over time is kind of the way to prevent this from happening. We do have this we think that it's reasonable to change multiple elements of programming to break the cycle get you on the right path and get you back sooner rather than if you kind of said oh I'm just going to work through it. Well the really common thing we see is people assume that anything that's pain related and training is due because they moved wrong. Yes we have a technique notice we haven't said like we didn't say it because you know we'll typically see people who say I want to fix my technique and keep using the same loads and we hear really enough they tend to not get better from their tendon off the one this happens. Usually hyper vigilante they have some personality traits associated with like actually perfectionism. Yeah focus in like light perfection and focus on their technique they focus on you know if I move this one weird movement is that's what's causing the pain and then. So you pay too much attention to your hyper vigilante and ultimately do worse like and. However, I will say that when people have pain sometimes just getting them to move in a different pattern correct can be a less sensitive way to move and that doesn't really imply that you were previously moving wrong. No it just doesn't. Yeah you're moving in a different way that's less sensitive to any may in fact not actually have a tendon off the if that's the case. Yeah so my stock recommendation if I had somebody come in like this this is you I think our knee rehab temple totally reasonable like just to like jump on you because you were telling you do multiple things if you want to clearly spell it out like. That temple if you're like not man not buying that I think. Doing some isometric works for like a week or two to get your kind of break that cycle get you back you know moving in a way. Uh uh they get you some bill you know gives you that foundation to make some small wins that's a good idea and then tempo work higher rep range and move the pattern that you can tolerate and then ultimately over the next 12 to 16 weeks working back towards your current training right now. I've linked some studies and our knee rehab temple it also in the description. The last thing I would say if you've done the knee rehab temple it were similar before I that failed to work for you then I think that's a that's grounds for like professional evaluation doctor like a ray and direct miles both those guys are been true and Charlie. I always leave them out. Well sorry Charlie well that's what you're here. Our all really keyed up on the stuff really good with the evidence and I think that if you've tried to do this on your own or you try to do this under like this sort of stock template sort of thing that didn't necessarily work as well as you wanted to I think those would be the guys to contact you can. Shoot them and email through our website or email address info for barbomboniston.com. All right next question this is from me kale. I assume that's how you say. McCookly yes. He says I'm very strong like no. Michael Allen in he says after strength development has adapted to the preliminary stress of weight training the main driver to strength development is said to be volume. I've equivalent that this is basically the explanation as I've understood it to be the thinking behind the singular eight and then taking off 20% and doing five so five we're similar. Your programs are based on the main lifts where competition lists are done once per week in the accessory lifts are there to add volume without too much intensity and I've equivalent with that as well. If volume is so important why is the why are the accessory lists done with higher relative intensities and lower volumes and the volume work for the competition list. In short why is volume for the accessory lifts often prescribed lower volume and for the competition lifts. So just a few just problems just off the off the bat so you state that after strength development has adapted to the preliminary stress of weight training the main driver of strength is said to be volume so I think at all stages of the game volume has a very. Direct role at driving outcomes as far as improvements and strength and meaning that you know you need to do some number of reps. So that's it. To have a certain supply higher low or any of it just just needs to be present correct yes same thing with intensity is not either or they're always both important and they have a relationship. Together that's you know usually when volume is higher intensity is lower and vice versa so that's. They're always present in a program at some level and they always are going to help determine the not only the type of adaptations that you get but also the magnitude of the adaptation so that's quibble. Number one when you talk about things in low volume and and and higher intensity whatever it's all relative right so I would not say that any of our lists are programmed at low intensity especially when you look at the literature low intensity typically like 30% to 50% of one or we don't program in there so all of our. All of all intensity ranges that we use are in that moderate to high intensity 60 plus yeah 100 get pretty much not to 100% but. Yeah, but I would say that 100% of our training recommendations are in the moderate to high intensity ranges. But do you have another quibble before we kind of get into this. No, I'm going to get into it. I was doing so I want to talk about first on to find like what strength actually is and then we can kind of talk about how intensity plays a role doesn't how volume plays a role and this is the kind of wrap this up together so first of all strength. The definition of strength is force production that's measured in a specific context so you can't just say it's force production period because it has it's always measured in specific context so for instance the one around the power of the display is not platform. Okay, specific context where force is being produced similar to a two hour 15 minute marathon that is. Placed that is how a context where forced production is being displayed their gymnast doing an iron cross or so it's just different context right and so it's all for structure and then in different ways all strength is measured in specific context you can't differentiate separate just the force production from how it's measured and strength is very specific and. Any different ways that will actually discuss I think probably speaking think about the two like main categories of elements or buckets when you describe like what actually drives strength. Development one is physical changes to the actual muscle the other would be neurological changes to the muscle. So physical changes in the muscle you think about muscle cross sectional area you think about penetration angle you think about you know how many you start a music like all sorts of enzymatic activity in the muscle like how many might a kind of real density. How much blood vessels or supply all things that happen physically right from a holdover of how I think about a lot of like medicine or physiology topics I kind of think about. Do we produce force from start to finish and so it starts in the brain as most things do you have this you know the various the movement centers the motivation kind of the decision to execute the movement and and. And then trace that all the way down through the brain through the spinal cord out the peripheral nerve so the skeletal muscle to the violent or genetics the actual act in mice and the latter force transmission through the tendons to the bone and so you know when you talk about force production. It's like the these questions reflect a lot of kind of reductionism and the way the question gets asked or the like it doesn't all come down the volume of this and all come down to the intensity or something. Yeah, it's it's not really the right way of thinking about this very complex system that has to adapt at every level sure right from the brain through the spinal cord through the peripheral nerve to the skeletal muscle to the tendon all the way out to the bone where the joints get moved. There are adaptations that happen at every point in that pathway. Yeah, and not only as you said to an extent are they specific to the task, but they respond differently to different stimuli exactly. Yeah, so that's kind of where and I think about this just if there's if we can lump group things physical personerological. You know that is one way to describe this thing with your right every yes there are a bunch of different players in the force production and they all respond in different ways to the same training and in the overall adaptation that that yield is specific to the task. So let's think about like how intensity what the role of training intensity is in strength development so intensity is going to be percentage of one RRM or basically describing how heavy the way is what's the load. I like to actually think about this just as a summary sort of standpoint from a summary sort of standpoint that intensity determines the type of adaptations that you're going to get. So all of us being equal the intensity will tell you like what type of force production is going to be improved so for instance when you work at very high intensities you're talking about low velocity. For production what what is under a bar below or you can talk high force production like a sprinter yes with that which you're context right but that but that's high velocity for fraction below the external low external short correct is less and that's just the force velocity continuum meaning that you. You are able to move at higher velocities at lower forces lower loads yeah and so. Intensities determine what velocity for instance you're going to get stronger at intensities also determining what sort of improvements you're going to make. With your ability to display force production so for instance if you want to get a better one RRM. You should be practicing singles and you should be working in rep ranges that are similar to a one RM for the majority of your work. On the other hand if you're never going to a powerless you don't necessarily care what you want to run as you just want to get stronger. Well that you what you're telling me is you want to improve force production in many different rep ranges you don't want to just get better singles you want to get better and shore singles and shore 5 and shore 10s and you know you might want to be able to repeat force production. For a series of tasks like a 20 reps that like you would want to be proficient all of those things and so intensity is going to determine the load. And ultimately determine where you get better at producing force so that's the type of adaptation that's how I think about it. Did you think about intensity in a different way or is that. I think that that's probably reasonably good there's that there's a large input from that standpoint on a lot of the neurologic adaptations that we see. We know that tendons actually preferentially also tend to respond to higher intensities compared to lower and then the only other caveat is that this is again assuming that we're talking about a dynamic. Task like just like a deadlift and those are where things like skill come into play and that's where if you want to get good at executing the skill under a high load you have to do it. However, we have data on lower load training for again isometric force production and you can get essentially equivalent strength outcomes with lower high load strength training when you remove the skill aspect current. You know sustained isometric contraction you know you have enough time to recruit everything you need and there's no skill involved and so you know it's kind of interesting then even using lower loads we can get similar adaptations out of that but again most people here don't care about their you know one RM hand hand. Yeah performance they care about their dynamic strength adaptations in a particular lift or in some particular context and that's where the load needs to match how you're going to test it if you want to you know have the neurological the skill out of patients like that but what you're probably getting to is that that plays a much smaller role in terms of altering a lot of the muscular architectural changes like muscular hypertrophy where we see this huge range of intensities where we can get equivalent. equivalent high-purtrophy outcomes at it and this is where there's been something a couple interesting papers published recently back and forth between. Cody Hawn and the Gatski and knuckles on kind of one side of the discussion and then Lenniky's group on the other side and. All of the like Lenniky's group is almost talking past them with a saying like well you can get stronger without getting bigger muscles so. hypertrophy doesn't really matter that much for strength and they're like well that's not refuting the idea of the getting bigger muscles is probably helpful for strength. Right particularly in this dynamic context or or an either context really but you know the skill and our logical part is kind of separate piece of the art. Just because you can do it doesn't mean that that's not one of the major drivers particularly the more trained you get. Yeah so we talk about like strength improvement again, the neurological aspect you're talking about getting better your volitional ability to produce force like which and that's any specific context is you have to practice that skill. All talk but additionally you have antagonistic muscle relaxation. Reaction is the first time you do a task a physical task like the first time you've ever swatted the antagonistic muscles are slowing you down and breaking you and wasting energy preventing you from like. Realize in your full force project potential but as you squat more more that goes away. Other neurological things include just motor patterning in general so that these all happen from a mirror to step with their specific again to task and intensity and that include and then from a physical standpoint sure. The muscle muscular hypertrophy muscle cross sexual areas of big one also the actual stiffness properties of the muscle the enzymatic activity of the muscles which are all going to be determined again the intensity ranges going to determine the rep range which is going to have an influence on all those things except for maybe muscle hypertrophy so muscle hypertrophy is kind of this. Like I would call it. It's it's on a island here because it doesn't really matter the intensity that you use as long as you're doing enough volume and your sets get hard enough at the end that you're getting this full on motor you can approve it and really what you see when you look at the data. When you look at volumes effect on strength and then you know we'll talk about muscle hypertrophy you see this dose response relationship. I mean when you look at the reviews you see a dose response relationship between volume and hypertrophy you see a dose response relationship between train exercise volume and health outcomes like blood pressure law or an effect. And blood glucose control you know and literally any health metric obesity improvements like what you know by that loss. I'm to clarify just a dose response relationship means that you increase the dose you increase the response it does not imply anything about the linearity of that response. Yes, we'll have of course diminishing returns, but it still increases doing pretty pretty high dose before we start to see things turn around and you see the same thing on strength training as well. It's that once you've corrected for the right intensity and for the movement selection for the task that you're testing you see another dose response relationship. So again the way I think about this overall is intensity determines the type of adaptations that you're likely getting. So all you can determine is the magnitude of adaptations that you're getting. So those response relationship and there are nuances at every level of this sort of force production is a confusing discussion. Yeah, but I'm saying those so but and and so stop trying to reduce it to one very well. Exactly and then just as like when we come back to this question like you know what are your things program like this and when you look at the total program. You see particularly our strength based programs you see a prioritization of the competition list because by saying that you're doing the way strength based program we have to pick our targets right there's no such thing as general strength strength is specific. The specific to contractual type, the specific to contractual velocity specific to the movement you know the range of motion the muscle length literally again every step away and so if you're saying I want to get stronger like when you get stronger what. So we pick arbitrary movements that we prioritize and so we give you more chances to practice that skill more exposure to that specific skill that's why their competition list as we designate the 10 to add more volume on our strength based programs are non strength based programs. Ten to not have that programization because we don't care as much just another tool and tool box to get you to do resistance training. And then as far as why are some of our accessory list on higher intensities than the competition list that's just because the inverse relationship between intensity and volume. So because the competition list are done with greater volumes when we program them that way we have to do them at lower intensities and so. And then on the flip side we know that there's still useful adaptations to be had by training higher intensities and then have lower volumes. So there's a spectrum of what we consider to be high intensity training that would improve your strength outcomes that in those tasks and we use them on our programs. Yeah, I don't see like our competition list being programmed 50% like yeah just do you know tens of 10 it's not having a program. No, we say do six sets of five at 86%. No, so that's the process. So somebody would argue then like look if I want my one arm to go up my three arm five or I'm to go up one and I just do one arms all the time one on just do three arms all the time one on just do five arm. There's very specific you guys just specifically 100 times was drinking game now drunk. Like that's what they would say and you say well the problem is yes the intensity that you are selecting for when you do that is generating that type of adaptation. But you can't do an a volume that way to get the magnitude of that. Yeah, exactly magnitude is going to be necessarily limited correct that those response relationship gets eliminated when you can only do a small dose one three arm does not you know help build or develop the strength long term. So you have to drop the intensity a little bit so that you can do a Napoleon down. I did a message yesterday or earlier today from like a 17 year old kid healthy who said that he was he was doing very high intensity work because he wanted to get his top in strength higher and he was getting so sore and beat up from it that he wanted to reduce his training frequency to twice a week. What which is taking things in the wrong direction the distance. Yeah, so he's hit that's kind of the scenario describing where he's hitting high intensity stuff all the time but because of how fatiguing it is it's limiting the dose that he can generate and so it's going to limit his ultimate adaptation. The type is right. Your fun to drugs and then you can do things like hey I'm going to work up to one top set on the squat per week and make games forever share it because these articles get shared around to us. Like it doesn't play. Yeah, right the flavor the flavor is right. Yeah, okay, you know, you know, yeah, all right. So we talked about for a while. Yeah. Very good question from Connor Willch. I'm currently doing my exercise science undergrad. I'm working on a public health program for a project. I'm trying to get seniors involved in strength training to combat, teacher, the groups of groups of groups of students made out of肬 studies, so this is increasing each other's conclusions. Whether it's for willing repaying or providing and defending incredible things. be lifting heavy barbells for their health. Do barbell exercises provide you need benefits that machines can't offer for seniors. I appreciate you taking a time to answer this and thank you for being a light in the fitness industry. Thanks, man. All right, so I just want to address some of the other dream address. Yeah, all right. So this is a very good question. And I definitely want to talk about all these different points. Particularly this is opportunity to discuss our opinion. He did like a full-on hour presentation on this that is on our YouTube channel. I will leave that link in also in the description below. This will be a condensed discussion on that. We can kind of wrap about it a little more free form. So you state that many tell the delet as a dangerous exercise for anyone who will do it in just 65. But present the view that the sort of advanced age, added advanced ages, low bearing intensity should be reduced in order to avoid injuries and chronic abuse is it's a death. Like everybody thinks this, right? That's what they say. But that's not supported by current evidence. We do not have data, say if you have seen that the deadlift or any one resistance training exercise is inherently dangerous. In fact, when you look at the data on resistance training in injury, risk, and you look at things like competitive weight lifting, competitive power lifting, crossfit, strongman, and even an individual recreational resistance training. You do not see this sort of really crazy high risk. You see that it's actually really low. And then you also have to balance that against the risk of not training, not training. Like legitimately, what are you going to do not train? And it's like the risk of being said and Terry far outweighs the potential risk of injury. The number one way that people get hurt in recreational resistance training is dropping a dumbbell or a weight on themselves. Like that's how it happens. Now sure, in other competitive, barbell sports, applications, that's not necessarily the case. But I'm not worried about grandma getting hurt lifting weights. I'm worried about her, hurting herself by not lifting weights. And then, so, you know, when somebody said all of deadlift dangerous for your back, it's like, well, where's the evidence? I think it's more dangerous to not train your deadlift and not be able to pick things up off the ground. Yeah, it's just kind of people translating quote unquote, compensants, literally, because that's, it is such a prevalent idea and just because things sound right. In fact, frequently, those very things are not to be wrong. So I would just dismiss that at the hand. Yeah, exactly. Just ask the citation when no citation is provided. And you say then, stop saying that. Yeah. And maybe I'll be able to have to. So, then you ask, do barbell exercise provide unique benefits that machines can't offer for seniors? So, I think the answer to that is yes, no and maybe. So, well, let me explain. So, if you're just hit back some new ones, the next new ones. So, if you're asking, do barbell exercises offer unique benefits compared to machine based resistance training from hypertrophy or strength outcomes. The answer is no. The answer is no. You can get equivalent outcomes. And if your goal is to like encourage participation on like a population level, like you should definitely have machine based options because that's going to be a net win. People aren't going to get stronger in a non-barbell exercise by doing barbell training compared to leg press. This study has actually been done. I've linked it in the description below. They tested, they tested people on a isometric leg dynamometer. Would they actually like just lift up against the force, play kind of thing? And they took one group, squatted, one group did leg press, and they both did the same. The improvement was the same. So, yeah, there's no like improvement in strength. Our approach for outcomes based based on machine versus barbell training. If you're assuming you measure it in a different way, like, correct. Because strength is the same. Correct. So, just to make sense. So, the way that barbell training is better than machine based training is if you are trying to get better at that barbell exercise. If that's important to you, if you want to go to IP of world as a master's three or four competitors, you should probably please squat pension template because you're going to be surprised. Then I'll let you use a selectorized leg press machine on your opening attempt. That would be a problem. As far as maybe, I think you could make an argument for the balance component of a ground based standing for you. That being said, there's studies on this as far as fall. And it's not universally in support of barbell training doing better than other exercise programs. So, I don't think I could say that confidently, especially because it's not just an absence of data there. It's like you have data that's not convincing. So, my answer again is, yes, no, maybe just depends on that. Okay, now, to the thick part of this question. Let's talk about Sarkopinia. Does this guy almost come up with a public health program? Sure. Anyone thinking about, do people need you barbell training to come up at Sarkopinia? So, let's talk about Sarkopinia. Let's define it and go through it a little bit. And then, yeah, so, really, it's just defined as a decreased level of scale to muscle mass. There are arbitrary diagnostic thresholds for this that have been established in the literature. But we rather just focus on, you know, low scale to muscle mass, low physical performance, low muscle strength, are kind of the primary ways that we look at this. It happens over time when chronic, well, chronicly when muscle protein break down tends to outpace muscle protein synthesis. And so, I use that framework when I teach about this topic to back to, to explain the stimuli that lead to both of those things. So, things like muscular tension from resistance training is animal-extimulus. We're not going to be tense in action. So, it's like, so, so, so, most of the attention like resistance training dietary protein and hormonal factors, you know, growth factors, either endogenous or exogenous, so, you know, use of animal oxteros can all be animal-extimuli versus primarily catabolic stimuli being the absence of those things or things like an acute or chronic illness, things like chronic hypoxia, being on certain medications that can induce muscle wasting like prednisone, glucocorticoids, and several others. It's just a mismatch though. It's a chronic mismatch between the two. So, when we're muscles being broken down versus that's being synthesized and what you started or said earlier about the physical performance, the consequence of that in its later stages tends to be that, not only do you just have the limoussa-ness but the consequence of that being reductions in physical performance and function. Do you have a sense like what comes first? I mean, we both read a lot of the same things. So, as far as you see the reduction in performance that might be like the first, you know, present, before actually, I think that you can probably lose a decent amount of muscle mass before you start to see substantial decreases of physical performance. However, I say that in the context of the general population that generally don't demand very high-end of the physical performance. That was my tip. For us, if we lost, you know, if we lost 10% of our muscle mass, we would probably observe another substantial change in our physical performance under the barbell when we're demanding, you know, one-heart performance as under our ourselves. For the general population that, you know, might just walk around their house if that, they can probably lose a substantial, large, or portion of their muscle mass before they start to notice like, hey, I'm having a hard time getting off the couch, which is why we use some of these screening tests in practice to look for it. So, like, the repeated up and sit-to-stands that I talked about in my lecture, people cross their arms and have them sit up, they're standing up and sit down, five times as quickly as they can. And if they, it takes them somewhere longer between about 13 to 15 seconds to do that, you got a pretty solid chance that this individual may have circumpine in front of. They may have other things because that's a non-specific test. So, an example, non-specific could be caused by other things. So, they could be super drunk or they could turn their neurological disease or something else, or post-tip. But, like, something else, like, an interview with it. But, in the absence of those things, if they look, if they look thin, they look weak and they take a long time to do that test, there's a good shot that they may have sort of pina. So, as far screening for sarcapina, it's recommended it's done at any time that there, like, any time that an older adult's hospitalized, like, you just should be screening and then by their primary care, they're recommended 65-year-older every time. They see the see-as-as, they're just worth talking about with everybody, right? Because Laura, we should already be talking about them with exercise, if they don't exercise, they're at higher risk. Yes, exactly. Yeah. But, as far as the idea of a screening test is that it picks up your diet, noticing you're not missing anybody with the screening tool. And so, yeah, you might get some false positives in there that you don't want to miss people. So, there's a bunch of different tools that I've linked in the description below if you're like a healthcare provider, you're like, what's the sarcaf tool? Like, I'll put that in there. Some other resources on there, but what Austin's referring to is that there are, that's that test is like, how often do you have problems, like, lifting stuff above your head? There's kind of obvious questions. Yeah, you get on a good decent history. And then, after someone is identified themselves, like, this person's at risk of sarcafini, right? The same thing that you had to do that first before you would then move on to, like, this short performance or physical battery test, where it's like, get up, go, five times, walking, feet test. Those are all diagnostic tests to get to front figure out, like, does this person, in fact, have reduced physical performance? Yeah. The ultimate diagnostic test would be to test a physical performance or physical and or physical strength. And then, technique, like, it takes it to measure how much muscle that's they have. And, again, in practice, I don't think that all this stuff needs to be done. Yeah. Because, again, this is a situation where the risk of inappropriately treating somebody means that you're counseling them to exercise and lift weights, which is different than inappropriately treating, you know, you know, a false positive cancer screen or something where you're going to put them on chemo. And appropriately, which is what it does. So the question was really about, like, you know, what sort of evidence do we have on resistance training in sarcafini? And I think you could look at that from two different ways. Like, one is a prevention of sarcafini. And the other one would be, like, actual management of sarcafini. That being said, um, would you look at both those dig prevention of sarcafini? That's really difficult to assess. Mainly because sarcafini usually is not in isolation. There's other, there's people have other disease processes that are either contributing to or complicating their sarcafini. So it's not like you also have to follow people for a really long time. Right. Yes. And then as far as we're first in sarcafini at that, again, that same issue or those two same issues make it difficult to say, well, resistance training is actually moving. And you don't look like, well, somebody's got CBD diabetes hypertension. You're already asking disease. All this other sort of things. You're like, oh, but didn't resist the strain of health or sarcafini. It's like, well, they have all these other things that are making them sarcafini. And so how do you? Yeah. So it's probably, and then you have to do that for a long period of time. That being said, the latest guidelines on this and I've linked the two, a full tax article you can read on this below. They strongly recommend resistance training. And I think they do that from the same point you, the same sort of position that you were just saying that the potential benefit is high and the potential risk is very low. So why are we not recommending this? Yeah. Yeah. I think that like you said, because of how heterogeneous it can be from patient to patient, meaning that one patient can have sarcafini in due to cancer. Another one might have a due to heart failure. Another might have a due to COPD. Another one might have a due to a combination of all of these things. For it on a immune disease or any number of things, if you do a research study on a variety of patients with medical conditions and you provide them with one standardized resistance training intervention, it's going to be hard to prove that that one intervention works for everybody. Yeah. Because it's likely going to be underdozed for some appropriately dozed for others and maybe even overdozed for some people. So this is a situation where the training intervention probably needs to be pretty individualized, accounting for their baseline physical ability. Their resources available to train and in particular their degree of antibiotic resistance, which unfortunately, not something that we can include measure. But you can kind of infer based on what's a medical condition as this individual have going on, how old are they, how sedentary are they, and that should give you an idea of does this person need a low dose of training? Do they need to, you know, do one heavy triple once a week or do they need to be training more relative? We more frequently be more active, doing more of the activity on a regular basis, and I would lean towards that. The older, the more sedentary and the more sick somebody is. I'll also just say, I'm not worried about overtraining this population. So, and a one overtrainer resistance training isn't. It's another topic, but I'm not scared of that. I am worried about people overfitting themselves over a period of time and then developing an injury, but I'm not worried about that in this population. I'm just not, and I think that older folks have been in general have been done at a service by not only the public lay public, but then also the experts in this summer of public arena telling them, like, you are fragile. You need less. You should be very, very careful. And it's like, I know when you've lived this long, you're resilient, you're a sturdy, you know? Like, otherwise you wouldn't have made it this far. And then we know that there's this dose of sponsorship, just in general, I don't mind premise, and then if you are antibody resistant, if you're anti-idegaloscopy, you check all the boxes for antibody resistant. I know that the relative dose of exercise that you need or see improvement is going to be higher than somebody's very antibody resistant. Further, further, I know that if you don't do that, the potential negatives are much much worse. You know, I'm not worried about like, did they get a little too sore? Like, yeah, you know, we're going to get better. So that's one big piece of this is dosing it appropriately for the individual rather than kind of like, we can't give you a blanket. Like, here's the Sarkopedia template because it's not going to work across the board because just this population. So heterogeneous, the other piece of this that I would recommend you look into. This is a paper that I'm writing a review on for a research review this month. It is written by Rhodes. It was published in 2017. I'm sure you can link it in the show notes. It talks about basically factors that are related to or predictive of resistance training participation in the general population. So that's the thing that will actually get people to do this and to stick to it. And it suggests that there are whole host of factors that we need to be paying attention to, so rather than being extremely rigid with our prescription and saying everybody has to do this single thing. It lists all the factors that we need to be paying attention to, including people's attitudes, beliefs and expectations about exercise, whether they're going to enjoy or not, or it's going to be pleasant or not. That's like a big factor, right? If people are dreading, people who actually train, recognize this when they dread every training session. Basically, it's a pretty darn hard. You're your RPE for going to the gym, as you know how that just needs it. So this is a factor in environmental access to gyms, guidance, all that kind of stuff plays a role. And so you need to have a flexible intervention that accounts for individual preferences, beliefs, things like that. It needs to be dose-depropriably for the individual. And that's going to be difficult to do. But you need to get a sense of it based on how old-centrarier this individual is, and it needs to be progress-depropriately. So even if they're old-sick and frail, and you practically have to start with a low dose, your goal is to increase that dose over time, not to decrease that dose over time. That sounds like so that's a complexity. Well, I do my best. But so you wouldn't those strictly recommend strictly advocate for barbell training. No, no, I think that that is likely to leave out a very large proportion of this population who needs this intervention. And so, you know, I would ask them, hey, like, you know, do you feel about this? Yeah, do you want to like this? Go ahead. Go to the shot. Cool. If not, what can, what, what do you know about strength training, what might you be willing to start with or something like that? But it's not even that you're preferring barbell training. You're just like settling for somebody doing machine-based. You don't care. No, no, no. Let's go. Let me go to how I'll have to be correct from a health standpoint. I actually don't care. We just like it because we like fun. And we're for us, we have biases. Yes, right. But like, I cannot make a straw of argument for barbell training outside of the context of performance in the barbell lift. Sure. Okay. Like, stop eating that to death or is there more? No, I mean, it's just we're going to keep the same to same thing. The only other thing I wanted to talk about was respect to Sarcopinia is protein ingestion. Yeah, we were kind of rapping about this earlier. So again, when you look at the articles that I've like below on this, particularly on those Sarcopinia guidelines, they recommend that these populations take in a higher amount of dietary protein. I think that's the 1.2 grams for kilos. It's like their recommendation. Whereas the 1.6 grams for kilo is the other recognition from Horton. Yes, based on all the evidence. So we just bracket it and say 1.2 to 1.6. Yeah. And that's in general for people who are either in a calorie of it, is your calorie surplus or standpoint, and so Sarcopinia would represent that in general for both, you know, if you start with a obesity, that's a different deal, but at the same time than you. If you're actively losing weight, yes, and you're in a calorie deficit, then calorie deficit is actually made you end of all of the resistance. Right. So then you could actually advocate for some of the higher dose, but that's again, another episode. But the point is that yes, these folks in general need to hire protein intake, and we kind of bracket that 1.2 grams, 1.6 grams per kilo. Now, I am not the big, you know, sort of vocal supporter of protein supplementation in this particular group. Even though I think it's a reasonable inclusion, like if somebody wanted to use a weight protein high quality, you know, high-pohnt and see protein supplement, I think that's fine. But I can't be like, yeah, the evidence says that people who take this generally do weigh away better problems with that evidence that when they look at people who are either elderly or with start opinion, they're not using the diagnostic criteria to like stratified these people. The protein intakes are like substantially different than they have to like show this human's reaction from food or from supplement, and we just consider protein supplements be food than your outcome should be the same. Right. And so, and they're not, they don't have these huge differences between people taking in weight protein, and then like their regular dietary protein intake. Oh, this person had, did that at one point five grams per kilo versus point set, and the more active you are, the less all of this matters. Yeah, if you're, I'm very good if you're older and you're super healthy and you're super active, then you're probably maintaining a pretty darn good level of animal sensitivity and you can probably even get away with less. Yeah, so just because you're 50, which again, we don't consider to be old. That'll, right, you're not frail it. But we hear people say like, oh, I'm, I'm guess I'm 35 now. I guess I need to really start cranking up the protein, and it's like, well, you're not old. Yeah, you can crank it up if you want, but not because of that number. Yeah, one point six grams for key levels. Super healthy, you know, super healthy, super active, 60 plus, zero people are so much that I still don't really, you know, I don't have evidence to say you really need to be consuming this crazy high dose of protein. We think that again, more seditarian, more sick, more frail in the setting of people who are older as well, that then we can make a stronger case for it. Yeah. So I think takeaway for this is that from full the Cal standpoint, we're both like, where does this Australian aim? By hook or by crook, doesn't need to be marble training. Yeah, it could be a machine based. I think you get a equivalent outcomes unless you're going to power. You see in these crossfit videos that they're putting out, where they have people like, looks like they're standing on the set of the sitcom and they're like picking up jugs of antifreeze or something. Yeah, for the cross and healthy. It's like, well, I mean, I guess for like a few days and then you got to get a bigger deal with these, you just add 5 milliliters to it all the gym. But you have how many thousands of gyms for crossfit to say that short. Yeah, although from the roads are at a golly would say that access in a lot of places is yes, it's a barrier. I feel like maybe there's some risk of lifting that antifreeze thing, you know, five is not going to like the legal icon of toxicity. Yeah, it's a problem. And then we talk about protein intake again, if five food are by protein supplement, I think it's yeah, 1.2 to 1.6 grams for kilos. That's kind of a stock recommendation. And then for as far as a stock opinion treatment prevention, I think this stuff is complicated. If you had an develop a public health program, it would be pro resistance training, you know, pro get enough protein in but that's really as far as you can go from a general recommendation, everything else has to be tailored to the person. Yeah, to the extent that you fail to tailor to the person and make it rigid and has to do this way. Then again, there are substantial substantial swath of the population that are going to be necessarily excluded by that, which is kind of not the idea of a public health intervention. The opposite, only people with access resources and willingness to do this, they're going to get benefit and kind of screw the rest. That's not how we do public health. Yes, that narrow casting. So I'll just be kind of relevant. All right, now we're back in Santa Cruz. Let's review some form checks. So this first video is from Katherine. Let's see, this is 60 kilos and she's going to do, think of triple with this. I'm not sure if it's high bar low bar because I can't really see from here. Let's just take a look here. Yeah, depth is in good position. depth is good. Backstays in a good position. A bar path that's kind of wonky. It honestly just looks like you're a little tentative, like you're almost scared. So I think, yeah, and the bar path was kind of a little place on a third rep. So Katherine, none of these are bad squads. I think if something is preventing you from squatting regularly, then you're going to have this sort of tentative on the way down and you might have some reps that look a lot different than others, where as if you were able to squat more frequently, then I think that your squat technique gets cleaned up. So if the weight is a little too much for you to be able to squat more frequently or do more reps, then I would probably advise doing more back offsets at a lighter weight for instance. I'm not sure the program. But yeah, that's not a very difficult set of three, not certainly not a limit set, but it does look very tentative on the way down. But all right, moving on. So this is 275. I don't love the hate banner behind you, but you know, whatever you gotta do. Yeah, your gaze is too close to you. I was wondering if the bar was too low, but it's not, and then you're not taking a breath between your trap. I know it's just light for you, but you said it then, right? So I would take a breath between each wrap, I would move your gaze out a little bit and really focus on squeezing your chest into this like thoracic extension and take the hate banner down behind you. I put this next video in here. This is 3.95, I believe. So I don't love this angle, because I would like to get the feet and the bar, like the whole thing in the frame. So just back the camera, but it looks like it's using a regular camera too, because there's a little autofocus, lens breathing going on there, but yeah, so I can't see your feet, you know, and I can't see the bar now, but let's take a peek at this squat. So yeah, it looks a little deep and just loose at the bottom. So yeah, it's almost like your feet are descent increases, like you start it out like real tight and then you just kind of drop into the hole. So I'll just tell you to get tighter, but your elbow is look good, your head position looks good, and then, you know, the mechanics look pretty good too. I would just try to get a little tighter for each rep and maintain that tightness throughout the duration of the rep. Alright, this is why it, what is this? 3, this is 370. Yeah, I think so. Maybe 340, that's a 10. I see three plates. Yeah, your hips shot back just a little bit, but that's not bad. It's hard to tell depth given the angle of the video, that one. Yeah, you can see your back come a little unlocked, just out of the bottom, and then see your hips want to shoot back. So I would instead of thinking hip drive, if you're thinking that, I would think leg drive, keep your knees forward out of the bottom, and really try to keep your back squeeze tightly into position. I shouldn't improve some efficiency, but it's a nice set. Why it? Alright, this is 20 kilos. Yeah, these aren't bad presses. I would like to see again the whole frame, and I would hold the lock out, just hold the lock out, shrug, just a second, but the bar path looks pretty good, your little bounce looks pretty good. Yeah, nice. Alright, this Sergio, what is this? 65 kilos? It's a good arch, although, and I see you're not using collars, which is fine, because you don't have spotter, but I would just get a spotter problem. Yeah, looks pretty good. Bar path looks alright. That one came a little forward off your chest. Yeah, same thing. So it's like you're pushing straight up right off the chest, and it needs to go back towards the rack. So I'll try to throw the bar back faster off your chest. Yeah, why? That bar is forward. It looks like you're set up too far back, because you don't have a lift off, so you don't want to hit the uprights with the bar sits. So yeah, all these reps are forward. That's way too low on your chest, and you're having to like scoot it back around back towards the rack. So I would either ask for a hand off or figure out a way to un-rack the bar out of the rack by yourself. Alright, so this is Sean, what do you say? This was 360, I think. Yeah, I wish I could see you, the whole your whole body in the frame at the top, doesn't look like you're standing up all the way. Yes, it's like you're stopping and they come back down. I like the emoji, the weightlifting emoji, the background, and I would take an extra second on the on the floor. It looks like the bar is bouncing all the way all over the place, but they looked okay, you're back, it's good. Jamie, I think this is Jamie Douglas. Sumo deadlift, and she said this was like 342. Yeah, those look fine. Nothing wrong with this. I feel like I know this gym too. Anyway. Yeah, yeah, it looks okay. I think I could cue to like squeeze the slack out of the bar and then push the bar off the floor with a little little more tension, because it kind of looks like you're ripping it off the floor a little bit, but that you know, yeah, especially that last one, but it's not bad. Yeah, pretty decent. I think this is her husband. She said this was 405. More similar deadlifting. Yeah, that looks pretty good. Yeah. So you can, and this particular example, you can see the loridosis of the Lumbar spine, you know, pretty clearly. That's not always the case. So, you know, while you can see it clearly here, you might see another lifter where you don't see that loridosis as clearly, and it doesn't mean it's wrong. It's just, you know, different people. But yeah, I don't have anything to say about these deadlifts of that last one, so we'll forward. Yeah, it's a little bit, but, you know, pretty good. All right, another vertical video, just to troll me. So that one's not locked out. Uh, that's not locked out. Your back looks good. The bar position looks good. You're just not standing up all the way. So stand up tall, puff your chest out at the top, just, you know, say it with your chest. And, uh, yeah, last one was at closest one. Yeah, I just would yell at you to stand up each time. All right, so some of my training, I got to meet coming up this weekend, so I just wanted to get this out. It was 550. It's probably where I'll open like that. This is 505. It was going to my feet. Yeah, a little forward. I like my dissent speed here, though. It's better than it's been. Less, less tentative, certainly. Yeah, it's pretty good. So 550 for a triple, no big deal. Did that for a couple sets. Not going to review all my training. So this is 495. It is from a week or two before. 4 triple. I just wanted to put this in here. So again, I'm happy with the dissent speed. I'm looking at my feet as I can. Yeah, that's a little forward. Yeah, I need to focus on staying back. I could probably do a wider stance, but, um, I kind of messed with my hip. And so I just kind of gave up on it for this meat. This is 410. I'm going to do a pin bench on what show you guys some videos there. So that's pretty good for me. I think that was a PR at the time. And then this is 385. I did it after that. This is, uh, I think I do this for a triple. Yeah, the good thing about pin bench really forces you to like figure out how to throw the bar backwards off your chest. So in a regular bench press, you don't want to push the bar straight up. You want to push it back towards the rack. And a pin bench like requires you to do that. Uh, this is a 190 kilo pin bench. This is actually from this just this past week. Um, the week before I did 192.5, I thought I was going to go up a heavier. Um, but anyway, called it there. This is 190 for a regular cop bench. It's from Saturday. Yeah, so that's 192.5. It's probably going to be on a second attempt probably open at 185. Then you see if I can go 200 on a third or something like that. All right. So on some dead lifts, I'm going to look at the plates again. See if I roll the bar. This is 680. Sit here. Yeah, kicked it a little forward. Did it look hard, though. It was a 625, 620. I think I do this for four. Yes, so we're going to use a deadlift bar at the meat. So I got one. I've pulled on it once now. Um, just think I have a video here at the end. Pulled. Uh, on one in the meat before, but it's been like five years. So yeah, I mean, being strong is cool. So yeah, this is a deficit pull. Uh, 635 stiff bar, no belt, the straps. This is 585. I think I do this for triple. So that one kicked forward, but it's light. So 585. That's a little better. I'm just looking at the York logo as again. And then, uh, yeah, pretty good. But anyway, back to this deadlift bar thing. Uh, so, you know, having good deadlift strength is good, but the bar is kind of tricky. So this is my, you know, on the deadlift bar. This is 585 from a deficit, no belt. Pulled up. This is my second set of four. Uh, I lost the video of the single I did with 300. AV issues, but yeah, I think that I'm almost ready for this meat. So yeah, I've been coming up on Sunday, this Sunday. And 1808 class and the soup too we can do. So the plan's going to be trying to get close to 600 pounds, squat, uh, knee sleeves. That's, that's the idea. And then 440 on the bench would be nice. Third, and then if I can, uh, go over, uh, I think like 727 was where I had, uh, pegged for my, my deadlift. So we'll see. We'll see you out definitely vlog about it. This training vlog is getting super long. So let's cut it here. If you guys like the video, uh, hit the like button, subscribe for all these content.

=== FILE: Training VLOG #32： First Powerlifting Meet in Four Years! [OV3xftgWh8A].txt ===

Hey everyone, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel, we bring modern medicine to strengthen conditioning and strengthen conditioning to modern medicine. I'm your host, Dr. Jordan Fagrimam, and this is a meat recap. I just had a powerlifting meat mate 12, and I figured that it would be cool to take you guys through my meat day. Prior to this, my last meat was like four years ago, 2015, raw nationals, and the reason I hadn't done a meat for so long, the medical residency, and then I was doing a bunch of strong, strength lifting meats with the overhead press instead of the bench press, and so I actually didn't mean for it to go that long, but that's what happened. And so I knew I'd been wanting to do a meat, an actual powerlifting meat, but I kept putting it off, I kept putting it off, and I said, I was thinking, well, maybe I'll do it at the end of summer, maybe I'll do it in the fall, but then I started looking at my schedule, and I was like, oh dang, I actually don't have a good schedule coming up as far as having uninterrupted training, it's of high priority. So for instance, I'm moving this summer, I was going to Europe for almost a month, an August to present a conference, and then the Barrow Medicine Seminar and Berlin, plus our older domestic Seminar, so I kind of just wanted to get a meat under my belt, while training was going pretty well. So I found this meat down about two and a half hours south from where I live right now, and San Luis Obispo, and decided to sign up for it for weeks prior to the meat. So not necessarily a ton of prep for this meat, but training was going well, and I kind of had an inkling that I was either going to test or go to a meat relatively soon, so no excuses there. So anyway, I wanted to take you guys through my meat day and give you guys a glimpse into what it was like. So first, let's talk about my weight. Normally I sit between two, three, two, five, that's like my standard walking around, weight, and for the USAPL and IPF, that's nicely to the 93 kilo class, but this is actually my first USPA meat, and again, just on short notice, I was just looking for a federation that had a meat nearby. So I realized they have a 198 class, and I was like, that won't be a big deal. So about a week out, I just reduced my calories a little bit, and I got down to, I guess it was 202, 201 and a half, rather, the Friday before the weigh, and so they do a 24 hour weigh. So anyway, I went to the sauna. Normally, I could get a two or five here, say, gill, this is the USK meat, 288, so if you have pounds over, you would take care of that right now, and it's on. Alright, we made it, I feel like a wet rat, but got away in Maro, and then he don't send it. And then the morning of the weigh-in, which was Saturday, May 11th, I was at 1.98.5, when I left the house, and it's again, it's like a 2 1 1 1 1 1 out drive, so I figured it wasn't going to be a big deal. Many of that. It's a little less comfortable that I'd like to eat, but I'll feed that until I can sit in the sauna, and I feel like to a little water, water can kind of make a check. It's just a wonderful battle, it's like that. It's an description of, for you guys, but many of it, the main problem is, I have a coffee and this is a big, so, I'm just trying to, I'm going to let it go. But, things we do for games. It was interesting when I got there for the weigh-in, we had morning weigh-ins, and so I stripped out, I get on the scale with the official right there. I stepped on the scale, says 90.2, and I was like, okay, this is not what I planned on, and then I stepped off the scale, and I stepped on the scale again, and it flashed to 90.2, and then down to 89.5 and stayed there. So, I don't know, you know, the scales, the digital scales are usually pretty accurate, and I have a competition scale here, the tenita comp scale that I spent way too much money on, but I just got sick of playing this weigh-teen game. That's a dad joke, you shouldn't laugh at that. But anyway, I was pretty confident that my weight was dead on, and so. So anyway, after I weighed in, I just went about my day, found a cough-is, ate normally, and the real thing was just getting more fluids back in me. So I didn't take a bunch of video of me just chowing down on food, but I really didn't do too much, because again, I didn't have to cut that much weight. So, that rest of the day was pretty low-key, normal Saturday for me, Sunday, and it went up pretty good breakfast in the hotel. Right to the just here in the morning of the meat, we'll go get some breakfast and just realized that it didn't make us meat-carb. I usually bought all my tenita and form up everything. So, I'm gonna do that. It's just fine. I'm out. I'm doing a beautiful day here in San Francisco, Tompsey, and then we're together. Then, yeah, just ready to go today. Then, went to the meat venue. Now, there were three flights. I was actually the first flight I expected to be the last flight, because I had a feeling that I was gonna be opening heavier than anybody else, but because I was a 198, the 180 weight class, I was lumped in the first flight with the 181s, and then the heavier competitors when the second and third flight. Now, if they had been going just by weight on the bar, I would have been in the last flight, but, you know, you don't get to pick these sort of things, and so is in the first flight. I would prefer to have been in the later flights just because, you know, I don't like lifting first thing in the morning, but it was all good. So, let's see on squats I opened at 250 kilos, which is 5, 51, and warmups felt okay. You know, no big deal there, and then I took my first attempt to 50. And I was going to show us, look at this, 551 pounds of defying weight of 1.97 super and impressive. Mixing weight is for joy. But, proud Jordan. Thank you, my dear. The 250 kilos felt good for the first attempt, and then I think my next attempt was what to 62, 5, which is 57, or something like that. Jordan. And that actually moved really well. I wasn't necessarily surprised with how well that it moved. I expected it to feel heavier, and I know you're thinking, wow, your face looks like you were straining pretty hard on that, but the speed was pretty good, and no big deal there. So I'd actually consider jumping to 275, or something like that, but then I decided to be conservative, go to 272.5, which is 600, which would have been an all-time meat PR for squats in knee sleeves. I've done 640, and it made before with knee wraps, but this would have been a PR in knee sleeves. And honestly, I was pretty confident that I was going to get it just based on my second attempt, then obviously that didn't work out so well. So I was already kind of bummed, because I did the meat because I wanted to PR on my lips. It's not just to go to the meat and try to win. That wasn't really that important to me. I just wanted to PR. So I was pretty bummed on that, and I'll be honest for like the next 10, 15 minutes. I was just bummed out about it. It's like the whole meat was ruined, but that wasn't true. And I had my pity party pouted a little bit, and yeah, I don't have any sort of inkling as to why I didn't make my third, it just wasn't there that day. So anyway, got ready for bench press, and I was really confident my bench training going into this meat. So I actually bumped on my open right planned. At opening at 185, it was just 407, but I wanted to make a bigger jump from my first to my second, at least that's what I was thinking based on how well my bench training has been going. So I opened at 411, 187 and half kilos. And I felt way worse than I wanted it to feel. Just way worse. And you know the interesting thing, I wasn't aware of this, I should have read the rulebook more thoroughly. The USPA meets you to supply your own liftoff person. And yeah, I would have preferred maybe more of a liftoff. I also noticed that on my first attempt in particular, I was way under the support, so I was way too close. So I needed to actually move out, although then it's harder to lift the weight out to the liftor. I don't know. It was finally a great hand-off. So I just, I would have liked to know, I would have liked to be prepared for that. So anyway, 187-5 moved not as good as I wanted it to, so I jumped to 195. And that felt actually better than my first attempt, because I think I pushed the bar back a little bit better. And then on my third attempt, I just jumped to 195, 2.5 kilo in cramming it just because 195 didn't feel great. I didn't go. I tried to move out even further on the bench press further away from the hooks, so I could actually push the bar back. It wasn't there that day. I don't know, even if I had Ray Williams giving me a liftoff, I'm not sure that I would have gotten that. It wasn't there, which was really surprising, because again, in training, I'd pin benched 200 kilos, I'd benched 190 to 195 a bunch of times in the two or three weeks leading up to the meat. So I was really confident in my bench press. I had, compared to my squat or my deadlift, which also were going well, so that was another bummer. So between missing my third squat and my third bench I was kind of, it was hard to get rally for the deadlift. But got had some food, and then got ready for the deadlifts, and I figured, if anything is going to go right for this meat, it's going to be the deadlifts. So the warm up room, they had a Texas deadlift bar, which is, you know, it's a whip If you're bar then some of the other deadlift bars that are out there like the rogue deadlift bar which is not quite as wippy and also has wider hand spacing and not quite as wippy is the and in the Oki bar which is less wippy compared to the Texas bar. And any event, a well-used Texas bar is just fun to use if you're used to it because the bar just you know it's you pull on the bar and it gets to below your knees before the weight to leave the floor. So that's kind of fun although if you're not well-practiced on it sometimes you're list don't go up in any event. So in the warm-up room my last warm-up I think was 5.85 it that thing flew it was fine and then my opener was 6.60 but it's funny when I got out onto the platform and I went about my normal deadlift setups I thought they were using a stiff bar which is fine because I actually prefer using a stiff bar just if I especially if I'm trying to on a deadlift bar but it was a deadlift bar just it felt much much different and I'm not sure if it's because it was new or different brand or whatever you know it's just kind of a weird deal. 6.60 flew no big deal so I jumped to 700 that flew as well that was probably the fastest I've ever pulled 700. Come on Jordan and I honestly don't know what happened on the third pole I went to three I guess it was three thirty let's THIS And honestly, it's like I didn't even give it a good try. I don't know if I was tired or just kind of bummed out. But after my second pull at 700, I kind of felt like, oh, I'm gonna all pull this PR no big deal. It just wasn't there. So hard to say, like, I didn't hurt myself. You know, I felt fine. It just wasn't as strong as I wanted it to. So overall, the meat is not what I wanted, but it's what I had that day. I mean, it wasn't a bad performance. It means squatting five, seventy eight and benching four, twenty five and lifting seven hundred and one ninety seven and a one ninety eight weight class. You know, it's pretty good. It just, they, none of those were PRs for me, and I really wanted to do that. And when they're gold, that'll 7,725 kilos, but it's been four day and five. I'm called. On the other hand, I haven't really done a powerlifting meet, you know, in a long time. So this is a pretty good return to the sport. I can't even get a strong power with the open division. But they swallow it so four hundred and ninety four point five five five eight. So see Jordan, I'm called. And I'll probably do a meet in October. That's the plan right now. Just kind of looking at my schedule. And there's, I know there's a couple of meats in the area where I'll be living. So we'll see how I do. But first, I got a strong man meat. This idea that I was going to try to do these competitions before I ended up moving and Allen, and I'm going to throw all one of our barbell medicine coaches you guys know is the train on the team guy. This got a powerlift or a strong man meat up at his gym. And so I ended up signing up for that. So I've been doing a bunch of strong man stuff. And honestly, it's beating the crap out of me. I've got these crazy marks on my arm that I don't, yeah, I don't know if I can show those to you guys. And then on my back from the yoke and then my hands are all beat up from the farmers walk, which is fine. It's like strong man is is a whole new deal. So we'll see. I'm excited to go out there and do that. And if you're in the area in Sacramento. June second, I think is what it is. You know, comes, come see me flounder in the, just strong man competition. It'll be fun though. I'm excited to do it. And I was excited to do this powerlift in me, USPA put on a great meat and had strong gym balance sandwich with this boat. Like a great place to train to really appreciate them having me out there. And it was, it was a great, it was fun. You know, again, I left the meat, you know, feeling like I wanted to come back and compete and do better next time. So we'll see maybe October, maybe sometime other times this fall. And anyway, thanks for tuning in to the barbell medicine YouTube channel. Thanks for watching my meat recap. If you guys like the video, drop a like and a comment below share it with your friends if they want to see me lift. And we'll catch you guys next time. Thanks for watching. Bye.

=== FILE: Training VLOG #33： Static stretching, cancer and exercise, plus meet prep! [sG02f7uBNSU].txt ===

Hey everyone, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel where we bring modern medicine to strength conditioning and strength conditioning to modern medicine. I'm your host, Dr. Jordan Fagan-Mom and this is training blog number 33. I'm getting ready for this powerlifting meet that's a little over a week away. We've got some questions that you guys have submitted and a bunch of form checks on both my own lifts and then some lifts that you have submitted as well. So let's not waste any time. Let's get right into the questions. First question is from Perry Tate and it is on static stretching. So I decided to call up Dr. Michael Ray, get his input on this because he wrote a great article over on a website called Mobility Explained. So let's see what Dr. Ray has to say. Art's with got Dr. Michael Ray on the line right now. So we've got a question here on the Barbell Medicine blog from Perry Tate. The question is what demographic would benefit from static stretching when and how should they stretch? And no stretching doesn't prevent or treat pain and injury and I know it's not the most specific way to get better at the squat or deadlift since most form difficulties are a result of improper coaching rather than poor mobility. My come back to that one. But I'm still curious to know when it might be useful. So Dr. Michael Ray, what do you think about static stretching? Yeah, this is an interesting discussion. It's typically defined as I must hold taking an end range while LinkedIn and then held there for some period of time as static stretching and I wrote a really lengthy piece called Mobility Explained last year that really dives down the rabbit hole with this topic. I can't say that I recommended to any population currently, whether we're talking clinically or for talking for just general training for athletes. And that's not just Barbell or is this in focus athlete, that's also sports specific like team base sports soccer rugby. So it doesn't seem to have any meaningful long-term effect for the populations that engage it and based on the research that we currently have on it. So it's difficult. I don't think I would recommend it for anyone at this time. I mean, that's certainly a change in the future. But the way I look at this is it's kind of return on investment. So the cost of investment would be lifetime effort and potentially money if I'm playing someone else just statically stretch me. And then what's the return on that and right now the return just doesn't seem meaningful enough to put time into it. It doesn't improve performance and in fact, if we're specifically just talking about static stretching, we have evidence that it decreases performance for strength and power focused athletes and will speed agility athletes. And so I wouldn't do it because we're going to have a negative out of that for those athletes. Specifically, it doesn't reduce the risk for injury. Yeah, interestingly, some data actually shows that it increases the risk for injury. Yeah. And so those are the kind of the two big ones and the third one people are like, oh, well, jobs and it turns out we actually have a copper review on that and it's no positive benefit for delayed onset muscle soreness in a meaningful way. So and then that's kind of what mobility explained that block goes through. It's like it just knocks down all the common narratives based on what we're seeing in the evidence. So I can't think of a reason to recommend it at this time. Usually where this goes back to is people asking all the time, well, what about yoga and my kind of thought processes if it gets you doing something something is better than nothing. So much rather, see you be active through doing yoga and some of maybe the positive kind of cognitive and mental size of that engaging in that process. And I would be much more inclined to be like, well, if that gets you doing something, then I'm okay with that. And oftentimes, yoga is not just statically held positions at in-range. But people think what's statically a lot of times it's ice and metric as well, holding a position like warrior two or something, you know. So I'm much more okay with that, camp then versus like, oh, you have low back pain because you have a quote unquote tight hamstrings and we just see to stretch them or tight so as that's a really, really bad narrative that can instill some not super ineviors long term. Question number two is actually on to particular cancer. And so we're going to cover some of the nuances of that particular condition and then expand it towards training, considerations for cancer patients in general. So let's start off with the question is from Steven. He says I was recently diagnosed with testicular cancer at 24 years old and went through an orchieth academy of one of my testicles this past week. I was wondering what the long term effects of this may cause for my strength pursuit with only one testicle going forward. Is this going to limit my ability to gain and maintain muscle slash strength at all? Should I look into T RT treatments? Any feedback would be much appreciated. This is a great place to actually say that none of this constitutes medical advice. This is all for infotainment purposes. You should definitely follow up with your doctor with respect to management, treatment, an evaluation of any medical condition. So this is more of a discussion in general sense. So again, I'm not your doctor. This is not constitute medical advice. Please follow up your own provider. So with that in mind, let's talk about this in a more general sense. So when orchieth academy is a surgical procedure to actually remove one or both testicles one is called a unilateral orchieth academy and then if both are moved that say bilateral orchieth to me. Similarly, this is the initial treatment for most testicular cancers and then also tends to be diagnostic in that you get to send the tissue off for pathology and then further evaluate the patient for staging. And any event the survival rates pretty good, five years of average, greater than 95% were pretty good at treating this sort of stuff. So after the orchidectomy, we have some good news and some bad news. The good news is most of these cancers are curable. In fact, the five years survival rates greater than 95%. The bad news is that your risk of having low testosterone is significantly increased with a unilateral orchieth academy where we remove one testicle. And the risk of low testosterone is even higher for those undergoing bilateral orchieth and we're both testicles removed because you're removing the specialized tissue that produces testosterone, the light excels in the testies. Dr. Gilligan of the American Society of Clinical Anthropology says we can cure about 19 out of 20 cases of testicular cancer, but a significant number of testicular cancers survivors have low testosterone and economic other aspects of health. So we look at a study on 1200 men who all had testicular cancer, how do unilateral orchieth academy? And you compare them to 200 matched controls, age matched controls. And you look at the sort of risk of male hypogonetism. It was increased by almost fourfold in those who had the unilateral orchieth academy and the risk was increased with the intensity of treatment. So increase amounts of chemotherapy, radiation, or additional surgical procedures all can't confer increased risk. So the question then becomes, what do you do with this information? And this is really similar to the recommendation we give towards the general population. If you have physical signs of male hypogonetism, it should be assessed properly via appropriate testing and additional medical history gathering. So these symptoms would include decreased vigor and libido, depressed mood, decreased muscle mass, and body hair actually less common takes much longer time for those things to manifest. And there are additional signs and symptoms that your doctor will work you up for. These are all non-specific symptoms, meaning that they don't always correlate to a low testosterone. And so what you would do if you have these symptoms is just talked to your doctor about them and you would be evaluated appropriately. Now if you have a patient who's recently undergone a unilateral orchieth academy, then you might be a little bit more vigilant about, hey, I need to monitor this a little bit more closely compared to somebody you hadn't had that procedure. For more information on male hypogonetism, I've actually linked an article from Dr. Baraki in the description below so you guys can check that out. So shifting away from specifically testicular cancer to the more general question of cancer and exercise, what do? There's an interesting trend for people with cancer actually decreasing their physical activity. So 75% of individuals report decreasing their physical activity levels after the diagnosis whereas only 4% report increasing their physical activity after the diagnosis. So the main predictors of people decreasing their physical activity after a cancer diagnosis are undergoing chemotherapy, being diagnosed with metastatic disease or having undergo surgery. And similar to other diseases, it's very important for those with cancer to actually maintain or increase their physical activity levels to meet the sort of minimum requirements. We'll look at mortality and cancer and physical signs that predict a poor outcome, weight loss history, loss of muscle mass, loss of muscle size. So looking at a study on about 1500 individuals, either GI or lung cancer, if individuals had all three of these poor, prognostic variables, they survive for about 8.4 months, regardless of their BMI so that means it doesn't matter if they were obese, if they were overweight, normal weight or underweight and if they had none of those features, their average survival was about 28 and a half months. And I think a lot of that comes back to having increased anaabolic resistance. So when you think about anaabolic resistance, that just means a sub normal response to anaabolic stimuli, dietary protein for example, training for example or the hormonal milieu. So testosterone and other anaabolic hormones. So when you think about individuals with cancer who are undergoing treatment, they have a lot of things that are actually promoting anaabolic resistance like chemotherapy, which causes inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, fatigue, weight loss, radiation therapy, has systemic effects, again, making people tired, weight loss, et cetera. And they might also be on medications like that deprived them of angergen, so reducing hormonal concentrations in the case of this bilateral or kiectomy for example or other conditions. Whether it might be taking glucocorticoids, which also promote anaabolic resistance. On the other side of this, we have tools that we can promote anaabolic sensitivity. So the first sort of arrow in our quiver would be resistance training. There's a dose response relationship between the amount of training that you can get somebody to do and their improvement in strength, in lean body mass, in skeletal muscle index, all of these things. One of the problems with recommending exercise in cancer patients who do tend to be older is that it's underdosed. And when we look at this choosing wisely initiative, which is from the American Board of Internal Medicine, and in this particular case, supported by the American Physical Therapy Association, they specifically say, do not underdose strength training programs for older adults. And instead match the frequency intensity and duration of the exercise to an individual's abilities and goals. What we'd like to do, again, is to increase the amount of resistance training, increase the amount of total physical activity that these people are doing to start combating some of that anaabolic resistance. The second strategy we have, or the second arrow in our quiver, is to engage in a dietary change that would overcome some of those anaabolic resistance. So right now, the RDA for protein intake in the United States is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. However, this fails to account for anaabolic resistance and protein quality. And contrast to the RDA, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism actually published in different guidelines for healthy aging and adults, and also specifically makes mention of cancer patients. And so they're recommended protein intake is 1.2 to 2.0 grams per kilogram body weight per day, which is almost double that of the RDA. The idea is that the amount of essential amino acids that are concentrated in a meal, and that includes the branch channel amino acids, specifically loose-scene. The idea is that you'd want enough of those per meal in order to overcome this anaabolic resistance so that you can maintain or even improve muscle mass and skeletal muscle index and skeletal muscle function and prevent some of that weight loss associated with cancer treatment. That's 1.2 to 2.0 grams per kilogram body weight per day, which breaks down to 0.4 to 0.66 grams of protein per kilogram body weight per meal. And so the benefits of engaging in this resistance training and increase in dietary protein obviously increase lean body mass, increase muscle strength, increase muscle function in cancer patients. You get a reduction in cancer related fatigue, improvement in their quality of life. You also get increased rates of chemotherapy completion, meaning that individuals who are undergoing the physical activity changes and the dietary changes are actually able to complete all of their chemotherapy course, which is obviously beneficial for other cancer outcomes. And then finally, there's a reduced risk of cancer-specific and all-cause mortality for individuals who are engaging in these physical activity guidelines. So what are the recommendations? The 2018 Physical activity guidelines for Americans suggested on 2 to 3 days per week, adult should perform resistance exercises of moderate or greater intensity for each of the major muscle groups. They also suggest that individuals obtain 150 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic training or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic training. And for a more thorough discussion on that, we would recommend that you read our free beginner prescription text. We talk about that extensively in there. This recommendation is also supported by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. That'll be instead there are some special populations that we should make specific considerations for when we're talking about exercise programming. So for instance, there are treatment related complications such as lymphedema. It's basically swelling that occurs in an arm or leg or sometimes both arms, both legs, usually due to removal or damage to the lymph nodes as part of cancer treatment. That being said, we do have data suggesting that high intensity resistance training is safe in this population. That doesn't mean we should ignore that somebody has lymphedema, but rather we can encourage them to exercise and then manage the actual training based on the symptoms that they have during the exercise. There's also a concern for fracture in cancer is that either invade the bone from a primary tumor or from a metastatic cancer. However, early evidence suggests that resistance training is safe in metastatic prostate cancer. And there's established safety and efficacy of high intensity resistance training in other conditions where there's bone loss such as osteoporosis. That being said, we probably shouldn't ignore that somebody has this condition, but rather be cautious and monitor symptoms over time, adjust training as needed. And there are a whole host of other side effects that may be caused by cancer treatment, for instance peripheral neuropathy, which is basically an issue in the nerves carrying the signals from the brain or spinal cord to the muscles they can become damaged due to the medications. This is called chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy. That being said, there's actually evidence suggesting that exercise may reduce the peripheral neuropathy symptoms. And despite the sort of widespread relief that physical activity is not safe for those with peripheral neuropathy, there's substantial evidence, particularly from diabetic patients, suggesting that exercise is not only safe, meaning that they don't have an increased risk of injury, but actually is, again, beneficial to those with peripheral neuropathy. This is definitely not an exhaustive list of all potential side effects that people can have from cancer-related treatments. That being said, the underlying premise here is that there's a known benefit of meeting these physical activity guidelines or exceeding them in this population. And so, combined that with the known risk of being sedentary and it appears that the risks probably outweigh the benefits, although, again, each case is going to be different and we would recommend that you have this conversation with your physician. Overall, though, we should be encouraging increased physical activity and dietary changes in this population. All right, so we talked about stretching and we talked about cancer and exercise. Now let's go to some of these form checks and see what we can do. All right, so we'll start up here with Col G. This is 370 for 5. Camera angles weird because it's above your hip, so it's hard to tell depth. Yeah, it looks close. I wouldn't probably argue with you about that. It doesn't look like you're shifting your butt back out of the bottom yet rather than straight up, like you're scooting your butt back. Your feet are staying flat on the floor, so that's good. But I can see your knees are also caving in from here, and I think it's because your stance is so wide. It's hard to keep your knees out. So I would probably narrow your stance just a little bit, and instead of thinking hip drive, like hip-scope back, I think leg drive, hip-scope straight up. You could also think about keeping your knees forward out of the bottom. That was a little bit better. But, all right, this next video is from Andy. That's my whole choose. I sold my old Reebok legacies. This is 405 for 3. Let's see. Now, on your toes a little bit on that one, depth is good though. Yeah, it's still on your toes a little bit. I can see just because your heels are coming up just as a smidgen. Yeah, same on that one, even though you cut that out of the video. So I try to get off your toes when you're squatting. Unknown weight is Madeline, high bar squat. Your elbows are way high, just right off the bat. It doesn't make you bad person, but I would just bring your elbows down. Yeah, tuck your elbows down the side. Yeah, these are like well below parallel. You know, if you want to squat that deep, that's fine by me. But these aren't, they're not bad. I would just adjust your elbows. Yeah, so bastion 391 freedom units for set of five. Yeah, your heels are coming up off the ground at the bottom. I like those socks though, three stripes. Yeah, so it's what I would do is try to get off your toes. And your shoving your butt back as a response. So I would probably try to push your knees further forward and keep them there at the bottom. Yeah, see how you're shoving your butt back. And it's kind of you're getting that good morning-esque thing. I know that because I've done that a bunch. But yeah, I see daylight underneath your heels underneath your feet. Doesn't make you bad person, but this is Kristen. I think it's 195. I wish I could see all of your foot and the silhouette's kind of difficult to judge here. But it is what it is. Yeah, the depth looks right. I mean, it's right on there. I actually don't think it's bad. I just think that the silhouette is tough to tell. Yeah, you see how you're, again, shifting back out of the bottom. I would aim to try to keep your knees in place coming out of the bottom. Push your hips forward on the way up, rather than thinking about. Yeah, that would see. There you go. It hits go forward. That was a little better in the last row. Okay, pause squats. It's 345. I said a four. There's a good angle. Good diagnostic coaching angle here. Yeah, the pause is pretty good. It's just right at parallel, which I'm not concerned about. I think you're okay. I look at your feet. Yeah, the pause is good. It's just right at parallel. A feet are good. Back angles good. I can't see your elbows from here, but that one was deeper. Yeah. And it's like you're sinking a little bit. Just a, you're just sinking a little bit at the bottom, like while it's moving. Yeah, so those are fine. Those are fine for set of four. I call that RP7 or eight. This is Mani 155, I think, this is what this is for five. Yeah, I wish I would go to see you pull your shoulder blades back before each rep. Because it looks like your pro-tracted. And I would just try to have you pull your shoulder blades back, push your chest up into the bar. Yeah, let's see the only thing I'm seeing right now. We don't have much leg drive here, and it's not bad. It's not bad. You hit the rack, I think, on the way up to there. So it's hard to kind of do this with the self-handoff and everything. But I would have you scoot down away from the pins a little bit, where you can still unwrap if you're not going to hit the pins. Yeah, it will bridge there. And then pull your shoulder blades back and take a big breath for each rep. Not bad, set though. It's 375 for 3. Sumo. We're doing the devil's work. Fap A, I see your knees cave in in a little bit off the floor, and if you can keep them out, I mean, it's just minor. It's just real light. So not a bad set. 355 before, this is Jason. It looks like 335 from here. Unless there's a 10 somewhere else or a 55 pound plate. Yeah, so let's just watch the logo on the plate. See if he moves him at all. Yeah, it's not bad. But look, you're just taking too long between reps. Go, hurt 3, 2, 1, pull. You think about it. You're going to make it heavier. Yeah, also don't change your gaze position. Pick a spot, look at it. Yeah, none of these are bad. That's not even, I mean, Rp7, 8. Nice job. 331 for set of 5. Yeah, so lock, I want you to stand up the top of every pull. Yeah, you're just like a little short. Stand up, lock it, wait for the applause. And then I would try to get you to set your lower back just a little flatter. It's just, yeah, it's almost like your hips are like a half inch low. It's hard for you to get that last bit of extension. So it raises your hips up a half inch. Really squeeze your low back into extension. And then yeah, that lap, just lock them out all like that last one. Sick belt, man. Okay, this is, uh, yeah, three weeks ago, two weeks ago. It's 5.73. Fine. It's all I can say. This is 601. This is the last week, I believe. Yeah, so I ready this in eight. Move pretty well. Now we get to watch it in slow mode. Yes, you can watch the feet. So the heels, you don't see the heels come up. You don't see the toes come up anything like that. That depth is good. Good eyebrow drive. Oh yeah. There's 190. Yeah, you get to see some bench presses that are overshot. I don't know. I'll show you guys my whole bench set up and some of these videos. But yeah, bench hasn't been feeling the greatest, but I think it's coming around. They were turning corners. Just 1490 kilos. Yeah, pause a little short and then I punched it a little forward. That's why it kind of slowed down on the way up. But still went, this is 190 a week later, 192.5, 425 pounds. Claire is not impressed. But you know, what are you going to do? Not bench press. You can see my whole setup. All right, so just watch to see how the borroth is here. Yeah, the pause was short and I actually think that's hurting me. So yeah, pause was short. Luckily, this week I had some good benching in, so we'll say that for the next vlog. All right, so this is 180 kilos. Two count pause bench, overexposed. Yeah, she got some more of this bench setup. We'll talk about it in detail. Yeah, so the idea is that you want to push the bar back off the chest. You can see it on that video pretty well. And now this is 358 for a triple. Yeah, and just watch the bar, you want the bar to go back off the chest first. So it's not up and back like in a diagonal. Like you're only scooping it back that initial, that initial movement. Yeah, and this is the next week. So this is last week I believe. 413, 2 count pause bench, paused. Yep, I might have been better in my comp bench. 170 kilos, 374, more two count pause bench. It must be the pink. It must be the pink, you know? Yeah. So again, just right off the chest, shoving it back, this is pretty good. I'm happy with those pauses. Happy with those pauses. All things considered. Okay, so we're just going to watch this. This is a 363 plus 100, some change in chains. Now they all come off the floor. So who knows what this is? Probably like 43440 something like that at the top. So watch in slow mode. And now watch this in slow mode, go through this step. So take a grip. Mine's about pinkies on the ring. Maybe a little narrower than that. Step two is going to be to take your arch now. I do this by levering myself against the bar. Now this is mostly in your lumbar spine. People say it's the thoracic thing. No, it's not. Pin your shoulder blades back to the bench. That's active shoulder retraction. Get the lift off. Big breath. And now you're going to initiate the descent. The descent. And then to drive the bar off the chest, you're going to drive your heels forward. Push the bar up and back towards the rack. Rack. Step 10 is not in here. Profit. So that's my little bench set. If you can watch that again, if you like. Close grip bench, pause. Yeah, that was good. You see the bar go back on that one. This is the week after. Looking thick with three seas bro. This is 185 kilos 407. Yeah, it's been hot. It's been hot, man. I feel like there's just too much hair. Yeah, what are you going to do? Yeah, and you see that scoop back. That was actually a little late, but I'm happy with that. Considering the weight and yeah, close grip bench is going well. Our dead lift time. I like that I set up these videos like a power lift to meet. This is 700. This was two weeks ago. I think yep, something like that. So 317.5 700 pounds. People ask me why do this like these hip things? I think it's just to get mentally prepared to pull this weight. But yeah, it's moved pretty well. Kept it on my legs. I looked at the Ivanka on, didn't kick it forward. Okay, what is this? 325, 716. I think there's a week ago. I'll think I'll think. Rock. No, I'm gonna kick it forward. I feel it. There it is, yeah. And all that flex in the bar is off my left leg. And I could have looked it out better. That's this is 66. Yep. That's second one's a little forward. And tell you, just because it's a little slow off floor, but that plates aren't moving so I'm not kicking anymore. Third one. Hey, good luck out. Look at you, you're capable of it. On 60 off of deficit, I actually did this after I did my pin squats and I have a bench press, so kind of a weird schedule that week, but that's good. More deficit pulls is 550. So you're gonna just look at the Ivanka logo and just see if it kick it forward. Yeah, you're pretty good. That's light. So now this is 600. I might write knees, came in a little bit. I don't know if my stance is too wide, or if I'm just standing awkwardly. Is the platform or something? And it's all right, still move quickly. All right, what is this? 290. Again, looking at the logos on the plates. And a little bit, that was a little touch forward. Yeah. That was better. I guess this actually is heavy, huh? Yeah, third one was best one. Nice, cool. And then now, what was this? 672? I probably overshot that. Not bad though, not bad. So what I ended up doing on this particular day, I didn't want to overshoot my single, the day before I had Penn Squad at 585 for one, and that was, I overshot. And so I didn't want to do that again. So I just did my tripals all the way up 37, 380, 380, 380, 9, and then pulled my single afterwards. And so that's how that worked out. The single at eight, probably was probably higher than that, probably a single at nine, but given the fatigue building up, I was okay with it and accomplished the goals for the day. In any event, it's first training vlog in a while. We got another one drop in next week, then the meat training vlog, and then a bunch of other new content coming up.

=== FILE: Training VLOG #34： 2019 San Diego Fit Expo Powerlifting Meet Recap [XMiRkKxjqt4].txt ===

Hey everyone, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel where we bring modern medicine to strengthen conditioning and strengthening conditioning to modern medicine. I'm your host, Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum, and this is training vlog number 34. I want to apparel with you, meet, and I want to bring you guys with me. All right, walking to the East San Diego FedEx, but we're going to weigh in. Actually, right down the street from my place, like a 20-minute walk, so I figured, get some steps in today. Enjoy the scenery and sounds of San Diego, so try to figure out where this thing is, go in. I'm going to guess 205, 205, 205 something like that. We'll see how right I will. I don't want no cover, I want change. I don't want the second, I want dance. I'm burning my ass where I'm all right. I'm in moving like a hug. All right, just wait in, 93.6 kilos, so 205, I've got a lot. I'm going to go home each second practice, the day is morning, and yeah, chill out, rest day, come back tomorrow, and you can do it. So obviously, I did not cut to the 90 kilo or 1.98 class, like I normally do, rather I just wait in when I normally weigh in at, which is about 93 kilos or 205. I'm about 5, 10, and I just walk around at 200 to 205. It's my normal walking around weight, and I just didn't want to cut for this meat. Rather, I was more focused on the performance at this meat. I really had some all-time PRs that I wanted to hit, and I just didn't want to mess around with cutting. In fact, I just ate what I normally ate throughout the week. I ate breakfast the morning before I weighed in. Could I have cut to 90 kilos? Sure, it probably wouldn't have been a big deal. So the reality is I just didn't want to add any extra stress to this meat. It was super convenient. Going to this meat right down the street for me, I walked there. The venue is nice. A lot of people there, big crowd. So yeah, it was going to be a lot of fun. I didn't want to, like, sell it any of that by cutting weight. Well, I ever go back down in the 90 kilo or 1.98 class again. Maybe it really just depends on what the focus is on the meat. If I want to be competitive to win the meat or win best-lifter, which is usually scored on Wilkes or something like that, or set an all-time top 20 total in a particular weight class. Yeah, obviously, I would want to do that at the lightest bodyweight possible with the highest total. That means that I don't know that those are my goals right now. Rather, I just have some numbers that I want to hit. So for the foreseeable future, I'll probably just weigh in at my normal walking around bodyweight. And as I keep trying to add lean body mass, slowly, but surely try to get a little bit stronger. I don't know that my body weight is actually going to try and down. All right, day of the meat. And to the actual spot where we're going to live, but we're in the middle of a fit expo, convention center. It's like a ghost town in here right now. Like, where's everybody at? Where are all the fit spos? I don't smell the white rain and I don't see any glitter dust in the air coming up on the venue. Here we go. That's it. That's where we're going to be. So get a setup changed. And now ready to do battle today. All right, so we'll start out here on the squad attempts. All right, so we start off this is 260 kilos, 5, 7, E3. Now Leah's filming from the front using my camera. There's like this barrier though. So some of the videos are actually cut like at the bottom. There's been nice pan down, but we have some side views that Claire took Claire. Zai was actually handling me. She's a big help. You see her in the background there. She's actually competing this weekend. So good luck to Claire. Good depth. Good speed. I can't see my feet. So I want to see if I actually shifted back at all, but yeah, good squad. Nice way to open. And so from there, I jumped to 272.5. But let's watch this again from the side. So again, this is 260 or 573. Good walkout. Probably too many steps, but that's just, you know, what I like. That is good. Yeah, no problems there. Okay, so second attempt was 272.5. Just trying to get that bar nice and low on my back. I have a tendency to sometimes have it a little high, like about a half inch high. It's not so great. This is 600 pounds, 601. You notice I look up to get the squad command. And so yeah, from this angle, I mean, that's pretty good speed there for 600. I wish that guy would stop touching me. It was kind of weird. But actually, miss that squad. So it was two reds to one white. They said that I was at parallel. Did I didn't quite go low enough. So we'll check it out from the side. This is again, not that greatest angle because it looks like it's above hit level and also from behind. So it can kind of lie to you. Preferting goes directly from the side if you're going to look at depth, right at hip height. But we'll check this out. It keeps touching me on my belt. I wish I don't like that. Yeah, so I mean, I agree that it wasn't buried certainly. And so I agree with the ruling. So I stayed the same. I was hoping to get up to 280 on my squad. So, you know, it took some San kilos off. But I just repeated 601 again. This is 2002 and a half kilos. And, you know, the problem after you get called on depth, I've never been called on depth for my entire life. Is that it's hard to do the same squad. You really want to focus on depth. So yeah, much slower tempo. And then, you know, that's probably harder than I wanted it to be. But I got depth. I got three whites. And I was pretty psyched about that. Yeah. So that's a meat PR for me in knee sleeves. So the most I've ever done in a full powerlifting meat prior to this was actually 573 in knee sleeves. So that was a 27 pound PR. And we'll watch this again from the side. So yeah, I had to go much slower just to make sure that I got down there didn't rebound off that. But yeah, that was a good squad. Three whites. So went into bench. Opened up here. This is 185. Give my grip set. Set the arch. Yeah, so no problems there. I felt like that was, you know, right on par for my open or should be. So this is 190 2.5 or 30. I've actually hit this in a neat twice before. Clairs give me good handoffs. Yep, good pause. And I thought that was pretty easy. I thought that moved very well. So I rated that like a 8.5. So after one 92.5 moved so well. Jump up to 197.5. Just wanted to make a nice conservative jump. Yeah, touched a little low there. Yeah, that makes sense. Then this is actually the first time I've watched any of these videos. So yeah, the bench thing, I hit 190 2.5, 430 in competition twice prior to this meet. So once in 2014 and once in the meet in May, and I missed 190 5 at the meet in May. Bench actually this training cycle didn't go that well. So 197.5 out of taking that meet PR that have been great. I've hit 240 in training before and I didn't want to get greedy. As fast as 190 2.5 moved, I had considered calling for 200. So I would have put me on track or at least back on track towards hitting or a tie in my best total. And any event, I thought 197.5 is going to be conservative on that particular app. I just touched too low and I think it's just too heavy to mess up. So that was me. That was my fault on that one. So definitely one thing to work on going forward. You know, just in addition to getting stronger, but just making sure to execute. Would not recommend touching the bar to low at PR or near PR levels. All right, so moving on to deadlift. This is 305, 672. This ties my best triple in the gym. Pretty conservative. Opener, I do like making big jumps on the deadlift. So let's check this out. Yep, pretty good. Move fast. You see I get one red in the background. My right knee apparently wasn't locked all the way up. I'll take the two to one decision. I was a decent pull. So that being said, my warm-up's actually didn't feel that great. And on the platform, that didn't feel that great either. So my plan was to jump to 330, which is 727. But it's then I jumped at 325, which is 716. Effectively, I thought 325 would be a hard rep, but not a limit rep. And then 335 would have probably been my max for the day. That was the plan. So next attempt here was 325. Little, little barking during the walk-up. And smile. Got a smile. You know, you're supposed to be having fun. See how this looks. Yeah, it's a little a little forward. The bar is a little forward. Off the floor. Probably made it feel a little slower. Yeah, but I got 3 lights pumped about that. Yeah, so I jumped actually to 330 because again, 325 didn't feel like this total smoke show where it's like, oh, you have so much left in the tank. You could go tie your best training pull. So I thought again, I'd be conservative and just go to 330. So that's the plan. 330 is loaded on the bar. That's 727. My best pull in a meet is 725. So what have been two pound PR? Although those were not on calibrated kilo plates. So the further the plates are spaced up off the bar, the more it'll whip and calibrated kilo plates don't take up that much space on the bar. So there's some discrepancy there. Yeah, net bar. I mean, I'm just behind the bar. I can tell super frustrating. Honestly, deadless were going the best out of any of my lifts all throughout training. I pulled 700, a number of times in training. I had rep PRs. I hit an all-time PR of 3305 kilo 738. The next one is the one that's been on the top of the bar. The next one is the one that's been on the top of the bar. The next one is the one that's been on the top of the bar. The next one is the one that's been on the top of the bar. And yeah, so deadless were just going super well. I'll unsure why things felt like they did at this meet. So overall, the meet was good, but not great. And that's kind of what I told Claire and Leah and anybody who's been asking, you know, hey, how to go. It was a good meet, but not a great meet. I performed well. I said a squat PR. My total went up about 50 pounds from the last meet I did in May. So I can't be upset about it. I'm just not satisfied with the numbers that I was actually shooting for and that my training actually kind of indicated. First, having to take my second squat again because it was high. It didn't rattle me. It just definitely threw me off the plan. The plan was to try to go up to 280 kilos. That would have set me up for success there. So it was problematic having to repeat 272.5 because I already I was in a hole. So definitely want to work on making sure that each rep that I do no matter if it's a rep effort set or pin squats or competition squats that all them are done to competition depth. I mean, sometimes this happens. I've never been called on depth before. So it was really surprising, but you know, it do be like that sometimes. On bench, my bench actually was not going very well in training. The heavyest bench that I had performed in training was actually 192.5. In contrast, my bench training prior to the meet in May, I'd actually pin benched 200 kilos. So things weren't going terribly well. Like, oh my gosh, I'm going to set an all-time bench PR at this meet. But that being said, at the meet, things really did come together for my bench press. 192.5 felt so good. 197.5. I was sure that was going to go. And honestly, if I wouldn't attach it to low for what I made a technical error, I think it would have been there. So that's my bad. I really do like the taper that I did for my bench for this particular meet. So I think I'll use that again. I do think that the training leading up to the meet is going to be a little different with a little bit more volume. And maybe use some of the variations that I prefer a little bit more like pin bench. I didn't use this time around where I did use like a five-count pause bench. I did bench with chains this time around where as last time I was using the sling shot a little bit more. So I think I'll have some variations be changed and then I'll still use the same taper. The OXER worked really well. Squat programming I think was spot on, squat taper, spot on. The only real thing that was confusing to me was my deadlift. I'd pull that 738 in training that felt so good and then to get to the meet and my deadlift was kind of flat. I mean even during warmups. And I don't know if I was just tired, you know, just from the squat, from the bench press and then being at the meet. It seems unlikely. I mean I have a few squat bench deadlift days in training. So there one option would be to increase the frequency of doing the squat bench deadlift days to make sure the conditioning is on point and that kind of use to doing those when you go to the meet. So that's one option. And then to the taper I use this time for my deadlift. I don't think that I would do that again. One thing that I've been worrying about is we're thinking about the least is that like the more well-trained you become, the better you are at tolerating the training, general and recovering from the training. I was worried that if I didn't pull anything during the week leading up to the meet that I actually would get significantly weaker, detrained a little bit. And the meet was on Sunday. So on Monday actually pulled my opener and then I pulled some backoffs like five, sixty-one or something like that. Some sets of five and I didn't think anything of it. And you know, maybe it doesn't mean anything but I know that traditionally my taper on the deadlift is I actually don't pull anything that last week. When I get to let my hands heal up too, I just typically have not done any pulls and I get to kind of recover a little bit better by not pulling. So I think the next meet I'm just not going to pull the week before the meet. Even if it is on a Sunday, I just, you know, that's worked well for me historically. I just, you know, thought this time maybe maybe take it up a notch with respect to performance. So I messed that one up. That's on me. And maybe some more squat bench deadlift days and we talked about squat at the bench already. So overall, good meet. Not a great meet. Still chasing this 1800 pound unicorn total. So I'd like to do that and we'll look for a meet maybe first quarter 2020. Got a lot of travel coming up. A lot of barbell medicine events. Hope to see you guys there. But yeah, we'll plan for something first quarter 2020. Take another run at this 1800 pound total. And then finally you guys write so many funny comments on these videos most of the time. Most of the time they're funny or they're questions. So we answer them. But I wanted to read some of them because these are great. So this is from the last training vlog. Druce saying he says, I lose brain cells when you don't post vlogs. I lose brain cells when I don't post vlogs or maybe I lose brain cells when I'm editing the vlogs because I stare at the screen for too long. I don't know. But I'm going to keep posting them. If I start getting done or just let me know. Huff entry says, could to see you Jordan and your parents on the iron culture podcast was great by the way. I enjoy it when you mingle with other fitness personality and expose them to barbell medicines approach. Thanks man. Yes. So I was on the iron culture podcast with Omar Isof and Dr. Eric Helms and Dr. Quinn Henach and Nick and Omar Isof. It was a good time. So if you guys haven't checked that episode out, it's literally all about pain. And we talk about the biosec social model, the biomedical model. And there's a lot of practical little pearls in there. And apologies to Nick and advance. I've forgotten your last name and I'm recording this thing and I know your great guy. I'm sorry. It's a really cool episode though. So check to check that out. Back to basics says, I'm just saying, grow your beard out. It will definitely add 10 kilos to your current lifts. Like if I had a beard that came down here, I just feel like as much as I travel, I don't want to be on a TSA no fly list. I feel like, you know, it's got potential. So maybe, but you know, Alan does fine. So maybe if we had matching beards, people would either think that we're easy top or, you know, I'd be fine. So maybe, maybe.

=== FILE: Training VLOG #35： 2019 USAPL Raw Nationals [-fu4oqOuXZo].txt ===

Hey everyone, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. We'll be bringing modern medicine to strength conditioning and strength conditioning to modern medicine. I'm your host Dr. Jordan Faganbaum and this is Train of Long number 35. This is our recap of the 2019 USAPL RAW Nationals held in Lombard, Illinois. So for this vlog we've got meat footage from Lorraine Baraki Sam Cowham and Charlie Dix and Lea Lutz and Claire Zai. So what we'll do is we'll take a look at all the footage that we have. Sometimes we use the announcers commentary if it's relevant, audible and good. If it's not you'll hear me narrating, trying to set the scene and then we have some other cool stuff in turn mixed and at the end there's this or that section where Dr. Baraki and I go back and forth on some users submitted questions. So hopefully you guys enjoy that. Thought of you further do. Let's get into it. My name is Lorraine Baraki. I am a captain in the army and I'm also an OB-GYN physician. I have been powerlifting for six to seven years. My husband, boyfriend at the time in medical school, Austin, I think we all know, was teaching himself methods of lifting weights after he finished college. We met in medical school and as he was learning more it just peaked my interest to learn how to move a barbell around so started to get some exposure with that through him essentially. It depends how you define recently. But if we think about this time last year, national's last year since then I have completed my OB-GYN residency after four years and I've also transitioned into being a staff OB-GYN currently in Fort Polk, Louisiana. It's been marked by pretty significant schedule changes for sure, being on call in the hospital quite frequently. But I actually see it as a positive thing, surprise, surprise. Just because my life has become kind of regimented and either at work or I am leaving work in training or I am resting recovering, refueling to do it all over again. So it's not a lot going on in Fort Polk, Louisiana. But in your numbers have been pretty well in training. I have been going pretty well with my bench specifically. My squat and Dudlift have held steady, I would say. I know that I have more room to grow in both of those. I have some kind of waxing and waning low back pain that I've been consistently working through. So that's played a little bit of a role here recently. Well, I have an English choice and a Spanish choice. So great. So just depends. But my English choice would probably have to be that the Anna Blueface Baby, featuring Cardi B. I have no idea if lots of it. Noted wise, a loss for a Cardi B. And then my Spanish choice would probably be Ector Novo, me, and de. That's also my favorite song. My people. My right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, show them. Let's just see. See what happens. See what future me does. Alright, so this is Primetime Day. Three, so first night we were there Friday night. 63 kilo women's classes, Lorraine Baraki, opening squat attempt. Now what they did for Primetime is basically take the top. Seven or eight or something like that. Lifters in each class and put them together so that they would all be on the same platform, competing together, actually made for really nice view and experience. This is the only platform going and you could see her on all of the background videos. So very cool. This is 150 kilos, 331 smokes it. That's what you want your opener to look like. About Rp7 when we say that. It means like easy opener. Alternatively, if you're trying to pick a weight, well, this would usually be something you could do for a comfortable triple. Particularly this weekend, they were being very, very harsh on depth, which is good. That's what you want in a competition at this level. I think they had like 1,300 competitors and so you'd want the judging standard to be very, very high. So anyway, she moves up to 155 kilos. This is 341 in the American. Gives the squat command. You'll notice what she did there should take. She took two breaths and one out of the rack and then one after the squat command. I'd probably wait to take the breath till after the squat command. But no problems here. So she moves on up 160. Again, this is under her best squat. I don't think her training was actually going to well for this and some of the interview that we had before this actually asked you about that. And it is what it is. And 160 would be a good number for her. So let's look at this one. Gives the squat command. Takes that second breath. Yeah, and she looks like it almost got a little behind her. And it's weird before she actually stopped moving the bar. They took the bar. So theoretically, she could have retaken that weight if she wanted to. But Austin decided to wave it because she'd rather have a bigger deadlift and not fatigue herself on another lift. So moving on the first bench is 97.5, which is a monster bench. So it's 215 smokes. That is her opener. She's one of the heavier ventures in the class. We'll watch it on replay. Comes back off the chest. Very nice, very nice lift, Lorraine. And they were very expedient about getting the weights changed. This meat moved pretty quickly actually. As you can imagine, that a meat with, you know, something like 1300 lifters would have to move in order for it to get done over the course of four or five days. So yeah, now you can see her grip. It's a pretty moderate grip, especially compared to her competitors. And she's very, very strong. So there's one or two and a half, two, 25. The bro way, two plates. Gives the bench command. She sees her ticks up right after that. Long pause. And yes, smokes it. Back off the chest very nicely. Three white lights. All systems go here. And so she's going to go up on her third. We can watch this second again in slow mo. Again, really cool when they did this for the prime time. A meat that the prime time lifters. It's nice to watch again. Right. And then Lorraine on our third bench. This is 105 kilos to 31. Gives the hand off. Now she's going to wait for the bench command. The star command gives the star command. Yeah, she probably had 107.5. But that would have been a hit or miss 105. What up nicely? Very good bench. Believe that's a PR for her. So now she's going to move into the deadlifts. You know, with her subtotal, she's just wanted a 155. And then 105 there. She's a right at 260 kilos for her subtotal. Open it up 165 kilos. 360, three smokes it. See if they give us a little replay for this. And no replay on this one. Uh, okay, moves up to 175. So this is 385 pounds. It's cool. Watch this bowl. Yeah, a little bit off her legs off the bottom. But no problems. Her dad was actually sitting right behind me. Just going crazy. It was really cool to watch. Yeah, she holds her back in a great position. Then gets the bar back on her legs. Smoke is 385 pounds at 63 kilo body weight or 138 pounds. Very impressive to watch now up to 396 again at 138 pounds. Also, she's a doctor, which is awesome. And I think, you know, for my money, she smoked 180 faster than 175. What's the what's the recap? Recampus. They have got your paper. No, no. You've been new and I'm about to get it. How'd the meet go? Me went very well. Are you happy? Obviously. Are you satisfied? I'm satisfied. Oh, man, I was really going to hopefully, that you're going to say no. I could do an Alexander Hamilton reference in there. But I mean, ladies. Perfect. Yeah. Very cool. Well, say goodbye to the YouTube. You just do since Cardi B out. So Lorraine had a pretty solid day. She came in feeling very confident on her bench. Her bench training has been going awesome. Squat and deadlift. We've been making due with her kind of some back aches and pains. They kind of come and go with training intensity, life stress, sleep stuff that seem to make it flare up. But ended up putting up a 440 kilo total, which is five kilos under her best total. From when she's actually heavier. She has two kilos underweight for this meet. All time meet PR on the bench with a 231 bench, which is pretty good. Very good for that weight class. And Squat did 341 on her second and just miss her third and then pull 397. So I think that our plan moving forward is going to be to get her back symptoms, kind of desensitized. These her back into things, build up her training volume again. And then I really, I mean, her potential is really high on the squat and deadlift. She's nowhere near her potential there. I think she could probably get up to squatting, you know, 165. She could probably get up to deadlifting. Probably get close to 200. I think is possible in her future. Just has to be a matter of training, getting her to tolerate enough training to get there. So that's what we're going to be working towards with her. Sam had the meat of her life. She her prep for this meet we experimented with some different approaches, particularly on her deadlift training. And things seem to go really well. Easy. Smooth. She hit all time, PR on the squat. All reds on the bar. That's, that's a pretty load all over the chair. Oh my god, she's that was so easy. She's got it 391 or 177.5 kilos, which went up faster than any of us expected. So that was awesome. She benched a meat PR of 107. And a half kilos. So she gets this today. So we actually have to be a pure, half kilo PR from there. Largest. You're the over 100 kilos. Well, if you look at her meat history, then. Nice look. Look at that. We are for Samantha. Nice work. We've been benching 105, 105, 105, but multiple meats trying to get a few more kilos on the bar. So finally got that done. And then she ripped a 226. American record, an official world record deadlift. Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, we are alive from Lombard, Illinois. 2019, we're on nationals. All the way up, Sam. Come on. Holy crap, Sam just took, let's wait for the white lights. But three white lights have been fogging ahead of us. To seal the deal for all time, PR total, 511 kilos. At about 62.7 kilos body weight. So incredible meat. Really, she has matured a lot as a competitor. Her mindset, her preparation, her just everything about her is come together really well. To be able to perform at this level and repeat as national champion. So we're very proud of her. I'm very, very happy with how the weekend went both Floreen and Sam did a fantastic job. We've had a bunch of other awesome performances from our folks, including Charlie and Leah and lots of other lifters on our team. So we're happy. We'll grab. Charlie Dixon successful on his first 290 kilos. Got calls for depth on his second. So let's see if he can nail this one and get that 307.5. Charlie with his SPD equipment. All the way down. Let's get it. Oh nice. It moved fast. So let's see what the judges have to say about that. He is credited with 307.5 kilos on his third attempt. We have Charlie six in top now. But I just want to. Two hundred five kilos. That was a beautiful. Oh, drives it all the way up. Yes, the worst. Two to one. Anyway, that was an amazing. Yeah, they were super cool. They're watching. They're watching. They're watching. They're watching. I mean, just sticking with it though is. Hey, you got a fight. Got a fight. We're all here because we fight. Charlie three 32 and a half. So Charlie six in with three 32 and a half. So he's also so he makes a look easy. Easy, easy. That is under his best. Oh, however. referees three white lines. That puts him in second place. So that is absolutely amazing. That's probably why they made that call. It was a silver medal winner Charlie Dixon. All right, Saturday morning here. Lambert, Illinois, Lea Lutz, Claire, Zai, set to do battle day, Lorraine, Sam, and Charlie all did extremely well last night. So we're just going to walk over to the venue now. Meet Lea for this morning session. Trying to grab some breakfast. Something for my voice. So I've been screaming my face off. And yeah, so they got a day for a barba medicine and all of our athletes. Great part about having breakfast. What we'll be a lot is she will be impressed with your breakfast order because you're the epitome of health. Lea, we're here before you're session. Are you impressed with this order? Oh, I am very impressed. I mean, I'm only really an unobestly amount of cheese. I've got all my butt. You can afford that fat. That's right. But they are egg whites. Yeah. And then I got this. You'll cut oatmeal. Right. And it's got nothing in it. And it's acceptable. Solidarity for those who have to cut away. So my name is Lea Lutz and I am a coach with Barbel Medicine. I also make sure Barbel Medicine runs behind the scenes. So we don't want to forget that. So I've been powerlifting for six and a half years now, I think. I think this is my fifth raw national. Numbers I hope for tomorrow. So a bunch of people asked me this on Instagram. And I wouldn't tell them. Right. But yeah, this is for the tubes. I big goal is I want a fairly sizeable PR total this meet. And I'm excited about that. So I will be really excited if I hit a squat 1575. Bench, 90 or in the back of my mind. I think I could do 90 to five but that may or may not be in the cards. And then I hope for my biggest pull ever in the 170s. I'm Lea Lutz which may lack. So now this is day four in the morning. Lea was in the morning session. Platform five. She was the last flight in the morning session because they were lifted the most weights. That's how they did it. Masters one class opening up 142.5 kilos. This is like 313 pounds. Get to Squaw Command, take your breath. Yep. Move drill quick. So I wanted to put her in a position to take a PR third attempt. So I had to pick 152.5. She got one red light on depth on the side. But sometimes it do be like that. So we were not worried about that. She's never gotten called on depth. Enemy. And so we moved up to 152.5. Planned was for 157. And a half on her third gets the Squaw Command. And obviously you can't tell depth from this angle. But you'll see they actually gave her two red lights from the side on depth. Center judge said it was okay. Which is usually how that goes. So we retook it. Wanted to get this 152.5 kilo on the scoreboard. Gives these Squaw Command again. And to me, it looks like she buried it, you know. And got a little lot of position. It was able to stick it. And then now she's get two red lights. One from the front on depth, which is very odd. But yeah, it's out of our control. Can't control the outcomes here. Only can control the process. So regrouped. So she opens up here. 80 kilos, smoke show, 176 pounds. Not too long ago. She actually had a slap tear repair. Surgical age. She couldn't even bench, you know, the pink dumbbell. So very impressive to see her come back for this. 85 kilos smokes that. It's 176. And now we're going to go up to her third. This would be a meat PR here. 90 kilos, 198 pounds. You can see me creeping in the background. All day. Yeah, 90 kilos was the right call. 92 and a half, you know, it might have been a little too much for the day. And a big celebration. Nice meat PR 90 kilos. All right, moving on to deadlift. So this is 160 kilos, 352 pounds smokes it. No problem. And what we were doing, we're doing a lot of math on sub-tools to see how can we get leonopotium. Top five is podium. Position in the 72 kilo class or in all these classes. And so, head to do a bunch of math and try to figure out like what do we need to pull? And so, I bumped her up to 167 and a half. This is 3, 68 at a 72 kilo body weight, master's one division. And yeah, from here I was like, you know, 170'd be a really easy third, 374, really solid third. But we had to go up more than that. I was thinking maybe 172 and a half would be like a limit third, 175 was going to be pushing it, but that's what we had to call for to get her to get in that number five position to get a metal. So we took it, you know, 172 and a half and 178 was I was 100% sure of 175 created a little bit of drama. So let's watch what she does. 185? Yes. Come on, stick with it. Look at it. Patience, patience. That's that hard part. Is that skin, full-to-right underneath the single it? Lock it back, lock it back. And you can see me leaning back at the background. She gives the white light. She's a good lift. All-time meet PR, 385 pounds, master pull, great job, yeah, great job. Moving on to master's one, 72 kilo class by popular demand. In fifth place, Leah Luce. Hopefully she's still here. A barbell medicine fame, release. These are your master's one, 72 kilo champions. So my name is Claire Zy. I'm a competitive power lifter and a researcher. I was in grad school and one of my friends, I was always a gym rat and one of my friends recognized that I had some competitive numbers and kind of entice me with some records and said I could break them and went out and caught the bug and never stopped. I started Burma Medicine a little over a year ago doing group programming and then I ended up switching to one-on-one programming right after California State Championships, which was about three months ago. And my last meet, I totaled 452 and a half kilos and this meet, my goal is to go 9 for 9 and I don't know, I think at 475 total is my goal for this meet. And welcome to the prime time session for the 72 females and 105 males here at the USA powerlifting raw nationals 2019. So this is a day for prime time session Claire Zy, 72 kilo open class, opening up here 157 and a half kilos 346 again. Notice you had to take two breaths. Always want to take the breath after this guacamole. And yeah, they actually redlighted her on-depth again from the center judge, which is odd, but you know, that happened. So we retook it, really want to get on the board and not to attempt the barbell gods by going up even though she's much much stronger than this, as you can tell by the bar velocity. So basically I told her hey, take your breath after this guacamole, and make sure to bury it and then you'll be, you'll be all good. Now watch what happens when she walks the way out here. So in order to get the guacamole, the two side judges have to drop their arms, basically signifying that you've locked your knees out. And so the side judge you can see in this frame never drops his arm, so they make her re-rack it, clock still running. All right, so you get a minute to take each attempt. So she has to basically do this whole thing again and lock her knees out. I would be interested to know what was going through her mind when this was happening. And this has happened to me before, but you know, you should regroup and go ahead and do it. It gets a squaw command again, really fast reps, very strong lifter. And yeah, she gets two to one. That's a good lift, moving up on the third. So already we were in a kind of a precarious position, based on what we had done in training. So it went to 165, really wanted to just increase her totals. She buried this one. And again, two to one, that side judge, just not loving her, but we're on the board with her third attempt at 165, 360, eight pounds. So now we want to bench press. This is 97 and half kilos, 215 pounds, 72 kilo body weight, gets a star command. Now notice she's got a much wider grip. Also notice me in the background with no hat, apparently you can't wear a hat when from the coaching platform, but three white lights. So all systems go here, moved her up to 105, 231 pounds. And she gets the star command and let's watch the bar velocity on this one. Yeah, so from here, 110 would have been a match her best in the gym and would have been a all-time meat PR. So we went there again, a little more aggressive than we wanted to be just based on what she did on the squat and then just gets out of the groove and the bar went too far back, actually hit the rack. So unfortunately, that's how it went. Didn't make that lift, but still in the mix for this potting position again, top five gets metal. This is the biggest class all weekend long. opens up here, 385 pounds. I actually thought they might troll her with that little movement at the end. I wanted her to kind of hold it and add lock out and be a little bit further behind the bar, but no problem. They gave it to her and it was a good lift. I moved up to 185, 407 pounds, 72 kilo body weight. Watch her pull this. Yeah, again, good velocity and I had a lot of number crunching to do in the background, actually changed her third deadlift attempt twice. So 185 was good, had to change her third deadlift twice to get her in position to pull for that top five position. And again, largest class all weekend, it's men or women. So she goes to 192.5. This is a 423, I believe. I'll talk to my head originally wanted it 190, but had to bump her up and then bump her up and back down. So originally put in 1951 in her first change, then I did 25 to make the other people take there, third deadlift up. And yeah, she smokes this nice pull. This is for fifth place and her first runational gets the fifth place overall. The open 72 kilo class fifth place, Claireえる as long as the shift has beenığını d on the second leader. Okay, this is the this or that section. This is the this or I got trapped in my own sentence structure. So basically what we did is we asked you guys that gals on Instagram to submit this or that style questions so that me and Oberaki here can battle it out. The Gentay Montay. How do you think you say that? Vicente Montes-Sac. He asked chicken or beef. I think I eat chicken more often but I probably like beef more. I feel the same way which actually does tails nicely into our upcoming podcast with Alan Flanagan on red meat intake and we cover a bunch of different stuff. Basically red meat intake recommendations, saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, diet and heart hypothesis. We go deep. But yeah, I think if I had to pick one for like tastiness, I'm going to pick the beef. Yeah. In particular, an A5 Wagyu cut. But what I eat more frequently is chicken. All one SS asks safety squat bar or hacksquat. I'm going to pick safe squat bar squat. Same. Yeah. Just because I prefer squatting to doing like a machine-based exercise but that's just me. If you asked me like should somebody do hacksquat or safety squat bar squat, I don't care. Yeah, for what? Yeah. I mean, I think we've covered this just the benefits of like freestanding movements tend to be you do train your balance on some component and then usually there's more global muscle mass involved but that may not be a concern if it ultimately prevents people from adhering to training. Yeah. So if the question is you're using this in a program for somebody who trains like a bar bow athlete and there's squatting on some day of the week and you want to introduce something else on a different day. Same to squat bar versus hacksquat. There's no automatic answer to that that I would give that where I would feel strongly about it if they, you know, if they want, I have actually a few clients who hacksquat in one slot. Yeah. There's a of their week and then others who don't do any kind of machine-based stuff for it. Hacksquat or belt squat. Does the same thing? Yeah. You'd say overwhelming shrug. Yeah. Okay, Natty 24 run a marathon or do a bodybuilding show. A bodybuilding show. I mean, like, I don't like being hungry and I don't like shaving. Yeah. Yeah. But I hate, I don't like running long distances that hurt me even more. Yeah. So lesser two evils. I feel like probably if this was like 10 years ago, I probably would have just done the marathon. Just because I moved the marathon. In sufficient shape to do it. At this point, the amount of training required to do a marathon would be substantial. Yeah. Versus. There's no specification here as to how well you'd have to do it the bottom. Yeah, you could literally just get up and be completely unremarkable on stage and take that box. Yeah. There's it's true. Yeah. I guess they don't have like a quality control checkpoint. So I just like go up there. It's like a meme of a dude who just this like show how you look and do to got him next to Larry Wheels. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think it's more stuff for the do you think he'd be better bodybuilder or better marathoner? It's hard to judge the competitiveness in something like bodybuilding, of course, just because of the nature of the sport as pose in terms of, you know, who shows up in the subjectiveness of the aesthetic, whatever. I mean, knowing that my endurance background, I was decent at it. I think I'd be decent at marathon, but I think it may take longer than a year to get good enough at it. Transfer all those previous adaptations over that you've likely either lost or tucked away somewhere to another sport. Yeah. I think it'd be a better bodybuilder. Not that I'm like particularly aesthetic. But you know, I'll be training the arms. No. Yeah. That makes one of them. What do you do for arms? Like not like have them? Pivot block or traditional d-load. This is just labels. Right. Yeah. They're just made up. What does traditional d-load mean? So like, if you're defining that as when people, you know, say, oh, I'm going to only do 70% for like a reduced volume, so reduction in intensity and volume. I mean, that's kind of what a pivot block is. You can make an argument that some iterations of a pivot block actually have less discrepancy in the volume. But the intensity usually is significantly lighter meaning then you're previously doing like heavy sets of five or three or something like that. And now you do a week where you're just doing tens. So the intensity is lighter. The volume may be similar. And the movements tend to be different. I think that's probably the bigger thing in terms of the way people think about these as exercise selection stuff. But these are just words. Like, you know, the words matter. Like, I don't know that there's such things like traditional d-load. Unless you just go by the literal definition of d-load and you just decrease the load. Yeah. That's the only traditional way that I would view it. And, you know, I don't think that there's one that's better than another. It's kind of a depends on what the person needs. So for example, if somebody is complaining of tons of accumulated aches and pains that I think are, you know, the result of a, you know, over accumulation of fatigue or something. Yeah. I'm probably not going to switch them over to a block where I just like switch the exercises. But the reps and keep the intensities that like nine or ten RPEs. Yeah. I'm definitely going to pull back on the load, decrease the load and hence maybe I'd use a traditional d-load in that sense. Especially that. Another situation where somebody is like, maybe feeling fine, but their response to the training is kind of waning and, or maybe there's some psychological stuff where they're not enjoying the training is much anymore. And I might switch them to something where they're doing different movements, different rep ranges that they haven't been exposed to, that they can PR and anything, get excited about training. Yep. But they can still tolerate high intensities. I don't care for the labels for either of those things is just different ways of altering the training based on the response. Yeah. Yeah. I think that context, those, those examples that you mentioned are, I feel similarly, like those are good rules of thumb. And then also, when decreased specificity is actually warranted for the particular goal that your program in around and that is important. And I think you can use pivot blocks or pivot weeks more liberally. So, but, you know, for example, if people are going into a powerlifting meat and, you know, you're three weeks out or four weeks out and you're changing training just a little bit and you need like this lower fatigue week. That's mostly more going to be a traditional d-load that's how I tend to program it. But if I'm separating different blocks that are have similar goals or both developmental blocks or GPP blocks or whatever, I tend to use just a pivot where movements are different. The rep ranges are significantly different. It's kind of like a washout in a way. Or if people aren't going to powerlifting meat, I tend to not use the traditional d-load as much unless they're really geeked out on testing their 1rm. All right, this from Annie Paladino, our friend from Pacific Northwest. Oh, we have, she has a bunch. Okay. Yeah, this is a for some. Uh, now, teen off. Not that. Look, the golf. What was the question? All right. Star, star, star, star, wars. Uh, I guess I've not seen like enough. Of either to call myself like a trekky or a star wars like person, like, you know, fan. Yeah. So I'm just going to say star wars because I've seen, I've definitely seen more star wars and I think George Lucas did something really interesting that had never been seen before at the time when he came out the original star wars. Yeah, I've seen all the star wars multiple times. So I'm going to go with that. You know what I think star trek is. Not for me. Not for you. Yeah. You have passed. Poor over or espresso. Poor over easy. These espresso is a pre-party. Everyone's like, what's your coffee or what do you mean? I'm like, pour over with an espresso on the side and you get the espresso first because it doesn't take as long a make. Right. And then it's your pre-game. And then you have a made event. I'm going to go espresso. If I could get like a mug of espresso. Perfect. That was not that. I think the the odor and the the tang of it. I really enjoy. Uh, have you ever done like a coffee cup in or tasting course? Oh, my gosh. So they make you like slurp the things. You're like, That's why I don't think I could do it. No, yeah. Yeah. They're like you're aerating your pallets. So you get all these notes. I'm like, I just feel like a fool. Uh, beat your mountains. Um, well, I, yes. I live by the beach. But I also am not far away from mountains. Thank you, California. Yeah. And you pay extra for that. Yeah. To put you into that location. But if I had to pick one of the other, I'm going to pick the beach. Yes. You're up at near a beach. And mountains are there. What we did is that tend to be colder and snow, which I'm not a fan of. Sure. Yeah. Versus more temperate. Stuff by water. Phil James, Paul Sumo or Squat High Bar for the rest of your life. I'd probably just pull Sumo. I don't, I don't particularly dislike high bar. But if I had to pick one of the other, I would probably just pull Sumo because I find that to be more comfortable than I do squatting high bar as my dominant squatting movement. What's your best high bar for like a single and then for reps? I actually don't know that I've ever had high bar single. But I could probably high bar. Like when I was at my strongest low bar, I would be surprised if I could high bar squat in probably in the mid 500s or so. I could probably have high bar 550 or something then. I had to guess. Yeah. But I was low bar in 6.5 then. Yeah. I have high bar 500. No belt. And no knee sleeves. That was my no no no. Yeah. I felt like the my low poster. And then I did 195 for 10. Okay. Just for 30, I think. Rips. Yeah. Just two sets of five really. Yeah. Tim. Doritos or Ruffles. Hmm. Can we get to stipulate the flavor? Because I'm trying to remember what Ruffles are. Those are the ones that... With bridges. No dude. No. Quirk Street. You talk about like bugles. I did enjoy those. Yeah. I thought they look up what Ruffles look like. Ruffles have ridges. And what's their... That's their slogan. Yeah. So they're just like a potato chip with the Ruffles. So look here's if I could pick the flavor. I'm picking Ruffles. A sour cream and onion. Okay. But my favorite potato chip is going to be salt and vinegar and their lays. Salt and vinegar are pretty good. Yeah. But he said Doritos. So they didn't have to be cool or ranch. Yeah. Not the cheddar. No. Those get old too quickly. Another ranch Doritos or sour cream and onion ruffles. I think I'm going to pick the cool ranch. Yeah. Although the correct answer to this question is lays salt and vinegar. Costco hotdog or Ikea meatballs. I don't like... I don't like meatballs. Just either. Yeah. I've never had either. But I don't like meatballs. So I'm going to default to the hotdog. Yeah. I've never had a Costco hotdog. Yeah. And I've been to IKEA once in my life. So. Oh yeah. And then I've just got a score barbell medicine. And you know her? Yeah. I know her. Puerto Rico or Cuba. Like, I wish there was more to this. Like, to visit or like, which, like, for a government do you work for or like. I've been to any career in islands. I've been in Puerto Rico. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'd go back. Yes. Also, I could move there if I live there more than I think it's 40% or 50% of the time. You know, like, qualify as like a Puerto Rican. Like, like, that you live there and get a tax break on that because you're moving a business. So I pick all of that over Cuba. Not that I think there's anything wrong with living in Cuba right now. I just, yeah. I like the amenities. Yeah. Puerto Rico is a great time on them with there. And I also would like to go back. But we haven't had a chance to. And there was the whole hurricane business that decimated there. Yes. Yes. Yeah. That's a thing. That's a problem. Yeah. CNS fatigue or adrenal fatigue. Well, only one of these things actually exists. So, and CNS fatigue really is a misnomer as far as how it's actually stated. You call it central fatigue. Effectively means that the amount of a neural stimulation that is transmitted, like, little electrical stimulation that's transmitted to the level of a muscle is decreased. And this is a protective mechanism so that you don't go into the rev zone into the danger zone. That's contrasted to peripheral fatigue. It means there's actually something wrong with the muscle. The nerves are sending the same signal to the muscle, but the muscle goes, not dog, I'm out. Yeah. So, that's a thing. I wouldn't call it CNS fatigue. I would just call it central fatigue. If we had these two brought them, like, big umbrellas, big buckets. Central fatigue peripheral fatigue. Adrenal fatigue is wholly made up. Yes. You can have adrenal insufficiency. Yes. That's a thing. That's a real thing. Yeah. And, like, requires objective signs, symptoms, confirmatory lab testing. That is validating. That's reliable validated and requires, like, medical intervention. People, you know, so... So hopefully, like, for an ing. Yeah. So the adrenal fatigue thing, yeah. You can't just tell people, though, that it doesn't exist. Like, that's the wrong way of going about counseling. That's a good way to, backfire people. You ride exactly. Just like telling people that they're low back pain doesn't exist. Like, don't do that. There's, you know, different ways to counsel this. But, yeah, as far as we know right now, based on evidence, and evidence exists to basically suggest that this is a wholly made up condition. And then treatments for this condition that are, you know, advised are completely made up, baseless stuff. Although, you know, the lifestyle stuff I get behind, like, sleep more. Sleep more. Yeah. Make sure to eat a healthy diet, you know, whatever they wanted to find that is. But, going around telling people that have adrenal fatigue, or they're overstressing their adrenals, or whatever. It's like, no, man, that's why they're there. Yeah, literally there to deal with stress. Yeah. Yeah. One of these kind of reductionists are the point of being wrong things. And then the CNS fatigue thing, it always kind of cracks me up because I think about, like, real things that could be labeled as such, the best example being like a post-dictal state after somebody's had a seizure. Oh, yeah. So after people have a real true, like epileptic seizures, they're usually pretty drowsy for a, for a decent amount of time at the doors. And that's called a post-dictal state. I was thinking about that as like true because they're brain just kind of electrically fried. It's literally fried itself. Yes, catatronic states. Yeah. You're just, you know, but, you know, You can chop it with it. They're frying themselves from doing a few sets of squats. It's kind of amazing to me in a sense because you don't collapse. Post-dictal, like you do after a seizure when you're done with it. No, usually not. Usually not. Javan asks, flats versus heels for squats. I don't care. Yeah. I mean, I'd probably like to use a heel chew, but it doesn't matter. But when we go train in an hour now, I'm going to go squat in Sanities sneakers. Well, I brought my nanos because it's open season. Yeah. So, that's fine. Don't care. Do we mobility drills every workout or never be able to squat again? Is this question a threat from squat you? Yeah. Where do you get your evidence? Yeah. Got you. Shots fire. Uh, if it's more than like 30 minutes of mobility, I'm just saying I'm not willing to sacrifice that much of my life just to squat. Just start entering. There's no need to go do that. Yeah. Yeah. So, 30 minutes is my cut off. Yeah. And that doesn't mean you should do 30 minutes mobility. Like you shouldn't do any mobility. Just when I say doing mobility, just don't do it. Yeah. You can do like dynamic movements that are specific to the task you'd like to gain more range of motion in. Do that. If you want to call that mobility, that's fine. But that's not what other people mean when they say mobility. I mean rock, rock. Or like the stupid warmup stretches. Yeah. Activation drills. Ah. Long sigh. A world without no C-bos or a world without anti-vaxxers. Uh, well, I think the death toll would be better if there were no anti-vaxxers. And I don't mean that these people, like, I'm not aggressive threat on them. I just think that they should change their mind and be open to actual, like, scientific evidence. This is an interesting question. Because I'm wondering, this is basically a question of morbidity or mortality. Yes, correct. Yes. So you would reduce mortality. You would, uh, uh, get save a lot of lives. If there were no anti-vaxxers out there, um, just to be clear, there's no scientific evidence that supports that line of thinking. Yeah. So when people start talking about, well, this person said this. It's like, yeah, that's not based on actual evidence. So, gotcha. Um, but there are those people, these people aren't interested in actually having a discussion on the science. No C-bos, though. I mean, you would argue maybe that the quality of life that does. Correct. Yeah. We've less morbidity quality life would likely be improved. Uh, and this is like when I go, I cite a lot of the landscapes. Global burden of disease data and some of the talks that I give and, uh, some of the stuff that I talk about leans on the mortality side where they have like rankings of the top causes of deaf. Worldwide the WHO has their like top risk factors for mortality, like bloodshed, sugar, high blood pressure obesity and activity. Um, and tobacco use are the top five from the WHO. And so, you know, you know, uh, the vaccine topic and immunization and stuff isn't necessarily in that top five. Sure. Um, see the blood say was mortality. Yeah, I think they're just bigger big, big, big targets. And so you could even make an argument that without no C-bos, maybe some people would be less reluctant or have fewer barriers to engage in health promoting activities that they're afraid of doing. And you may be able to round about kind of interesting to think about. Yeah, I think I'll probably take the world without Nasibo's thing myself. Yeah, so you made your point. Yeah. I think I agree with you because initially I was thinking antibiotics or yeah. But I think maybe you end up causing less people to become a hand-tive haxers without the Nasibo's. Yeah. Uh, I think that's it. Yeah. Cool. All right. I'll go lift this or that segment. Dr. Baraki, Dr. Jordan Bygmong. We're going to get back to the lifting. Thanks for watching. I'm Tom Kampotelli and I'm a part of Medicine Coach. The question is, uh, how do I come up with the witty captions? And I would assume that you are talking about on my personal Instagram account because, again, I cannot confirm nor deny that I am involved with the Barbel Medicine and Syrian account. But I will say this. Uh, it often comes from the bits of detritus that are bouncing around my head during the day, uh, which through a process of, um, great stupidity, I embellish upon and add a relevant cease to until I have reached a character limit that is too big, and then I'll dial it back a little. Thank you.

=== FILE: Training VLOG #36： Is It Safe To Go Back To The Gym？ [Okgj2QuY8nQ].txt ===

Hey everyone, welcome back to the Borble Medicine YouTube channel. We bring modern medicine to strength conditioning and strength conditioning to modern medicine. Underneath of the doctor Jordan Faggin mom and it has been a while since we've done one of these training vlogs. This is training vlog number 36. I don't even remember when the last one was, but we're back in action. We've got a gym, we're showing you how I built that. I'm going to answer one of your questions about going back to the gym now that some gyms are opening again. And then, you know, we're just going to watch me with weights. And hey, if you stay tuned to the end of the video, we're going to show you how to submit your own questions to be answered right here on the YouTube channel. Also, some ways to submit your videos for form checks right here on the bottom of the medicine YouTube channel. So, thanks for tuning in. Let's get to it. In some states, gyms are opening up again. Is it safe to go back? So, this is a very complicated topic. Let's see if we can provide some insight. As you guys all know, coronavirus has dominated the news and has also polarized most folks on this topic. Unfortunately, it's become very political and I'm trying to stay away from that on this YouTube channel. Anytime we've posted something that's controversial in any way, just the comment section, it's all over the place. So let's try to stay out of politics and we'll keep it in the science realm here. So a few thoughts on whether or not it's safe to go back to the gym with a little background that helps you guys realize how I formulated this answer. So shelter in place orders have likely mitigated the severity of the pandemic compared to what we would have experienced with unmitigated spread, although not without heavy costs of its own. This is not a long term solution, which would likely require a vaccine and or new treatments for the disease. So the next step is going to be a gradual easing of restrictions, which has already taken place in some countries like China, Italy and Spain and also in states like Georgia, Tennessee and others. Other states are likely to eventually open up some businesses, which includes gyms, thankfully, over the coming weeks as well. So what do? To start, I think I should make it clear that most, if not all of the health benefits from exercise, including introduction and hard disease, reducing blood pressure, reducing the risk of developing certain types of cancer, reducing the risk of developing depression, can likely be achieved using an at home workout program to the extent that an individual can meet or exceed the current physical activity guidelines. In other words, most folks probably don't need to go to a gym in order to see health improvements from exercise, though there are some who would clearly benefit from additional equipment availability either due to personal preference or needs in order to suit their current fitness levels. Unfortunately, most folks are either sedentary or insufficiently active, meaning that they don't meet the current physical activity guidelines that includes both aerobic and resistance training components. For perspective, the current data indicates that only about 10 to 20 percent of the global population meets the guideline recommended activity and insufficient activity is responsible for about one and every 10 deaths or over 5 million deaths per year. In other words, not only do we have a coronavirus pandemic, but we also have a physical and activity pandemic that's been going on for a very long time. So ideally, we would use this time when much of the world's population has some extra time and is turning into public health authorities to heavily promote exercise and dietary changes as part of a national health improvement campaign to not only combat COVID-19, but also reduce the global burden of disease due to physical and activity and obesity. Despite the potential efficacy of a home-based exercise program for health outcomes, many will understandably prefer to go to a gym for a variety of different reasons. And they want to know, is it safe? As is the case with most decisions in life, there are risks and benefits that should be considered on an individual basis. So on the one hand, the risks of going to the gym are pretty clear. Your risk of infection from others goes up the more people that you're around. Alternatively, you yourself may be an asymptomatic or prescientomatic carrier of COVID-19 and you could infect others inadvertently, although this risk is difficult to assess. In any case, some steps can be taken to reduce these risks by both you and the gym. From a personal standpoint, you can reduce your risk of infecting others by wearing a mask when you exercise. You can also refer to one that you wash regularly and you get bonus points if you add an additional layer of pantyhose around the outside that actually increases the surface area that protects some particles from entering or leaving. Additionally, you should stay at home if you're currently experiencing symptoms at all, which now includes cough, shortness of breath, fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain, sore throat or a new loss of taste or smell among others. Same goes for if you've been in close contact with someone who has these symptoms, even if they haven't been formally diagnosed with COVID-19. You would also recommend avoiding the gym for now if you're over the age of 50, or if you have medical problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, harder lung disease or any condition that results in a compromised immune system. Unfortunately, while these individuals would likely stand to benefit the most from regular physical activity, which may be increased, given access to the gym, they are also at the highest risk of a medical complication secondary to COVID-19. Additionally, if you have regular contact with individuals who are over the age of 50 or who do have any of these medical problems, you're probably increasing their risk of a bad outcome from an infection with COVID-19 by being in regular contact with others. So we would recommend probably not going to the gym if that is something that you do. Gims can also reduce the risk of spreading the infection by increasing the amount of clean supplies available to its members, as well as increasing the number of scheduled cleanings that happen per day. They should also provide staff with adequate protective equipment, limit the number of patrons allowed at a given time, whether that's 25% of normal occupancy or 50% no one really knows, but limiting the number of people who can be at the gym at one time is likely a way to improve the ability to engage in social distancing while being in the gym. Also spreading equipment for their part so that people can be a separate from each other's probably a good idea. And again, requiring all individuals to wear a mask in order to enter the facility in addition to potentially screening folks who are coming in the gym. If you need to take the temperature or ask if they're symptomatic, all those things would increase the likelihood of picking up somebody who might be infectious and should likely not be able to get into the gym. So while there are certainly some risks and some ways to avoid those risks, it's reasonable in my opinion that young healthy individuals that do not have regular contact with their high risk groups and have access to a gym that's stepping up their health policies could probably go to the gym and minimize the amount of risk that they have. But again, there are no free lunches here. As with most things that pertain to this virus, these opinions will almost certainly change when new data becomes available. If you are looking for information on how to exercise at home, we have an article on this on our website. I've linked that in the description below. And if you're just about to get back into the gym after an extended break, I actually put out a little free template and some guidance on how to do that in our latest newsletter. I've linked that in the description below as well. Maybe we'll do a YouTube video on it if you guys choose that to be a topic that you're interested in. Okay, so look, that's my thoughts on hey, gyms are opening up what do. Let's talk about my training because you know, the barbell medicine, YouTube channels got to be a little bit about me at least just a little bit. So first off, what happened with the gym? How did I come into this sweet home gym set up? Well, first, I already had this alico bar. I've had it now for almost a decade. It is the competition IPF power lifting bar and I love it. It is my favorite barbell of all time. It's probably outside the budget of most folks. It's way, way expensive. I like the rogue Ohio power bar just fine, particularly the 20 kilo version, the stainless steel version, the Texas power bar is probably my favorite, non-alico bar of all time. But all, either of those would have been fine. I just already had this one so I didn't have to buy something. I did buy weights, the reason why I bought alico weights and not rogue weights because like I had them in stock and they shipped to me within two days. So that was great. That being said, the price point for the rogues make them hard to pass up. If you want calibrated kilo plates, but the like a one-to-do look nice. Also, I ended up borrowing a Texas strength systems combo racks and seemed like every place was sold out of regular rack or even a combo rack. But it's getting the job done so far. So I got, we have 330 kilos worth of weight, which is enough to train with. I picked up some horse doll mats from tractor supply company and I get people asking in the DMs all the time like, hey, do you actually need a wooden platform to lift on or can I just use horse doll mats? Well, you don't need a platform to lift on, but I will say it is much nicer to lift on. It reduces the reverberations from heavy dead lifts, trust me, and it's just overall feels a little bit better in my opinion. That being said, for the amount of time I think we're going to be spending training in storage unit or in this case a garage, I was cool with just using the horse doll mats, so that's working just fine. I'm not worried about damaging the concrete because I'm not dropping my dead lifts even though they are reasonably heavy. That's a weird flex, but okay. All right, so with that in mind, let's get into some of my form checks from the last three weeks. I tried to put everything in order for the videos that I had of the last three weeks, so basically all my comp squats, so week one, week two, week three, comp edge, week one, week two, week three, et cetera. Stuff like that so you guys can see the progression and again, this kind of mimics the template that I put together for like how to get back into gym from an extended layoff, maybe due to COVID-19. So first up, all right, this was in the storage unit. I, yeah, the first week I came back. These things felt really heavy in awkward because at this point it had been almost four weeks since I had squatted. So this is only 200 kilos. I basically wanted to work up to a set of four in RP7 or five in RP7. So depth looks pretty good. Now I can also see my toes, you especially see the left one here. The toes are coming up on the way up. So it looks like I'm driving my hips back at the bottom. Also, I'm definitely off-centered under this barbell, which I think I fixed on the next week. But again, the goal was work up set of five at RP7. That was it. And so yeah, I got to fix that hip shift. All right, this week two, this is 215 kilos. So yeah, just add 15 kilos. The idea here was to work up to a set of four at RP8 and then do one back off set. The depth looks pretty good there. Bar path looks pretty good. I can't, I'm looking at, I can see my right foot. And yeah, the toes are doing a little bit better job staying on the ground. So I'm not shifting back as much here. That's pretty good. That one, that last trip, was a little bit too far back. So instead of cueing hip drive or anything, I like to cue leg drive through your straight-up rather than swinging back at all. In any case, this is this third week of this same like get strong again, template. This is 220 kilos, 44. That looks pretty good. First rep was good. Second rep was good. Except for, again, I see my toes coming up. I'm going to work on keeping my knees forward out of the bottom. So I think my thought that I'm going to think about, obviously, is going to be keeping these forward out of the bottom leg drive instead of thinking about driving with my hips. Also included some pause squats. So these are the pause squats, pause at 200 kilos. So the same thing I squatted on day one. Yeah, that'll look just a hair below parallel. I probably want to go a little bit lower. That's fine. Yep. Notice that I'm, for the most part, holding the bottom position like, and I didn't do such a good job on the last one. I was going to try to brag about holding the bottom position like perfectly still rather than going down and up again. That'd be ideal in a pause squat. All right. So this is 200 tank kilos, 464 pounds, 63 pounds for our American friends. Yeah. Good depth. I wish I should have moved these 25 kilo plates so I can see my feet not a great angle. And you can see here, I'm getting one that little, that little bounce out of the bottom for the pause squats. I need to stop doing that. So it's kind of getting rid of the training effect that I'm looking for. All right. So now we're on a bench. This is 140 kilos. This is all I worked up up to on week one. You can see the inside of the storage unit is excellent. 140 kilos set of five. The idea was again, work to a set of those RP7. This is a 18 or 16 millimeter focal length, which is why everything looks oddly distorted. But yeah. And also this is a trash angle for coaching. So sorry. I just, this is all we had in the storage unit. So that's week 140 kilos for a five. This is week two, one up to 150, two and a half kilos. Not a good pause on that first one. As a decent pause. Yeah. Not a great pause on that third one either. That was okay. Yeah. Barpath looks good. I just am rusty on the on stay and tight on that pause. All right. So it must be missing the third week for my comp bench. But yeah. So this is first week of close grip bench. 150 kilos. So again, I think it was doing up to set of four at seven or something like that or four at eight. Let's get back into things. I should probably try to keep my elbows a little bit closer a little more tuck on a close grip bench. That's what you're going to keep your elbows in a little tighter touch a little lower. All right. So this is the next week. 150 five. It looks pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. Notice the elbows are tucked a little bit more at the bottom. I like that a lot better. And then this is week three for close grip bench. So this is 157.5. Gonna do this for a set of four. Notice there's no clamps on the bar. So if I were to get stuck, I just shimmy the weights off. All right. Pretty good. 157.5. All right. Week one of dead lifts. Look. So I'm not sure what's below the storage unit. So I was like pretty afraid of like going ham on poles. But this is only 240. So 528. So I was kind of doing this little tempo descent. Yeah. So obviously none of these look very hard. This angle is not great from coaching perspective. But if you get a video of your client or you from this angle, you can look at the logo on the plates and you can see, hey, am I rolling the bar forward? That's one thing. You can also see where you're looking. And then also make sure that your grip is, you know, even those are like the things. And in addition to what your knees are doing off the floor, those are things you can see from this angle. All right. Week two. This is a 585. 265 kilos. And you can see right at the last instance, I put my shins to the bar. And I just kicked the bar forward just a little bit on that first rep. Second rep, the bar was off my legs. Third rep that was pretty good. I wish I would stop at the top just pause for a second. Fourth rep was way out in front of me and the left side off my legs. It's like I forgot how to lift a little bit. Just get back into the groove. Those are week three of my dead lifts. So this is what 280 kilos, 618. Let's see if I see the a legal logo. Yeah, just kicked it forward just a little bit there. Got it off my legs. Yeah, rep two is better. Although the left side, the underhand side was still off my legs a little bit. Yeah, rep three was better. And rep four. Yes, same thing. So I need to consciously think about getting my hips higher, staying closer to the bar, and keeping the bar on my legs. All right. So this is week one of paused dead lifts. Two count paused dead lifts. So this is 250 kilos. Not a great coaching angle. You can see where I'm pausing. People are like, why don't you pause one inch off the floor? It's like, well, that's not where I lose a lot of my velocity, where I lose a lot of my position that caused me to miss dead lifts. So for me pausing just under the knees, so where I pause. So there's nothing to see there on the 550 is too easy, too light, but just gradually working into things. This is 285. Yeah, that one was forward. Less forward on the second one. Just see how low my hips are. You've got to go up just a little bit when you all lose four. Yes, all of those reps are all over. Not quite dialed over. And last week of mine, two count paused dead lifts. 77.5. Oh yeah, that was great. Notice I'm letting my hips move up before. Yeah, same thing on the second rep. Nice, tugs. Must be the pink socks. The third one was forward. Go figure. I start bragging about myself and then that happens. All right. So look, hey, that those are my lifts from the last three weeks for the most part. I'm going to change my program and just a little bit for the next three weeks. As I kind of work back to my previous level of strength. But hey, thank you so much for watching the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel.

Nico I need a city and return with my trade-in Hey, dude. Dude, what are you doing? Pulling something heavy today. Oh boy. Are you gonna call your own shot today? Yes. What are you doing? I'm a thing to feel in quite light. If the fear is there, I'm gonna take it. I'm always 7.15. Maybe. I like it. Oh, 5.85. Alright, see now you're gonna 6.75. Yeah. I'm telling you dude, 7.55. 65 now. Well, there's just another plate. Oh, thanks. That's the idea. Oh, cool. Cool. Dude. Pretty good. Okay, once it unsticks from the floor, it feels good. Is 7.75 your best? Yeah. So 7.15. 7.25. I mean, it's just loading. It becomes stupid. Yeah, it's probably 20. Alright, here we go off the rock. 7.120 pound. Yeah, this 15 pound PR. Oh, right, buddy. Yeah, man. Good. Yeah. How do you feel? 15 pound PR. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man. Good. That's cool, bro. Yeah. How do you feel? 15 pound PR. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man. 15 pound PR. Yeah. Without slides, even. But I brought it out slide. I brought it out slide. Yeah. Nice job, buddy. Thanks, man. It's still like kind of. Yeah. In a day. Deadlift, brain. Yeah. When was last time you hit a deadlift PR? About a little over a year ago. Oh, man. 15 pounds a year, though, not bad. Shit. At this point. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, can't complain. That's you. Just deadlifted 720 pounds. And now you're back down sets or 495. Yeah. I'm no mathematician. That seems like about 70%. 60%. That's about 70%. Yeah. Wow. Maybe I should be a mathematician. Well, so what's the deal, though? We just had this little stimulus fatigue convo. Yeah. So for the past, I don't know. Three is months or so. I haven't really pulled anything over in our P7. Yeah. I worked up to, I was doing set the five until those the effort required to do five started to get a little too high. And then pulled that back a little bit and started to do in doubles at a seven or a top set and back offs in like the 70 to 75% range. And then that kept going up. Then transition to singles and pulled. Six, 89 last week for a single that was not, it was probably about an eight, eight and a half. In terms of like single level effort. And so I had a feeling that a PR was coming soon. But yeah, I've definitely not pushed. Push sets to close to failure. I mean like a, you know, a RPE 9 or 10 in months. Yeah. If you keep the velocity higher on your working sets, you can still impart a good stimulus with less fatigue. So that you can do more sets. So it's more stimulus. Yeah. That's the idea. Yeah. And I was mentioning how I haven't needed to take a D-load or a back off low stress whatever you want to call it kind of weak in quite a while. Yeah. I think just because the fatigue and stimulus are better, kind of distributed, I guess. Yeah. And you get more cumulative stimulus because you have to take less breaks. Yeah. That's the idea anyway. Yeah. Caviot and Tor, people are different. I mean, it may not work as well for you. It did for me and maybe it works better for you than it works for me. Yeah. I mean, it works forever. That's how they can go. Yeah. It's called a mouser block. A what? A mouser block. How you guys name it? I think it's Paul. Okay. Mouser. He's a strong man who makes this stuff. But this is a piece of equipment. What do you do with it? It's a loadable block, press or carry. So you can put weight in there? Yeah. You can take these off and put weight in there. I'm not going to net root. I'm not going to change weight, but I just want to press it. Pretty fun. Did you press it already? Yeah. Oh. Okay. I do. Yeah. I do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alan for all! Who's a Phil stone? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. the one more all let's go somebody please admire my ninja steps come on Allen come on Allen what a what a how's my form yeah it's great look good and very good low bar who's a felt stone carry what a what RPE Ray that yeah trunks of tricks that was RPE 10 I couldn't go back down yeah I heard that you had a little interesting experience at the airport yeah yeah so checking in and I check my bags with my on-tem train business debit card and the lady is pointing to the card she says is this she's pointing to on-tem train she says is this your business do you work with animals or mental health patients and I did not just pause and thought is she trolling me right now maybe she knows I said yeah so I thought my idea I guess kind of both but I said no it's a the name of a gym that I own she said oh I see I saw the untamed and I was trying to put it to her so she doesn't she doesn't see the name I see it but anyways it only to me they go a little barbell barbell barbell medicine really bad thing like when I go get coffee and they see that they take my name from my card and they're like a coffee ready for barbell and it's like come on down no my name mr. medicine mr. medicine mr. medicine please me doctor medicine mr. medicine mr. medicine mr. medicine mr. medicine hey I'm Cassie Neiman I'm a you can wrote to master Rowan instructor and I know you guys are probably already using the Rowan machine for your conditioning so what I'm going to do is give you a few tips to make it a little bit more effective and probably make you feel a little bit better on the machine as you do that number one we're going to look at the damper I'm going to tell you how to set that thing number two where are your feet going to go number three how are you going to sit on the seat and number four we're going to talk just a little bit about the order of operations in the way that the stroke works best number one I want you to take a look at the damper so when you come to sit down on the machine you need to make sure it's set for you and one of those things is making sure there's damper is set in the place where you want it to be set this is not the resistance when it's on a one that doesn't mean it's going to be the easiest when it's on a ten that doesn't mean it's going to be the hardest this is a variable resistance machine which means the resistance it gives you is based on the work you put into the machine this just represents the drag so it's pulling an air when it's at a one it's not pulling in in any air when it's at a ten it's pulling in a bunch of air I would suggest most people start with it between a three and a five that's a good place to start but definitely play around with it but also definitely just look at it before you start throwing it up at a ten doesn't mean you're going to get the most out of your workout number two where are you going to put your feet first of all don't row in your lifting shoes put on some regular old ten of shoes it doesn't matter just nothing with that lifted in the heel and the super rigid sole so when you put your feet in the straps you're going to put it so that the strap is over the widest part of your foot then you're going to pull those straps nice and tight so that straps going to sit over like the bottom of your shoelaces where the the widest part of your foot is and that's going to put your foot in the best position so that you can pick your heels up doesn't mean you need to but you can and it's going to put you in the best position to mechanically apply force to do each stroke number three how to sit on the seat seems really simple but there's actually a few things you can do that might make your whole stroke way better just by adjusting how you sit on the seat what i like to do is go ahead and straighten out your legs and reach over try and touch your feet it could be a nice stretch when you first sit on the machine but also it's just kind of a nice segue into picking your butt cheeks up so you're going to actually pick your butt cheeks up to kind of rotate your pelvis into a more neutral position so instead of sitting on the seat like this i'm going to adjust so everything rotates forward this is going to put me in a much better position to hinge from my hips and get more out of every stroke when it comes to rowing what we're trying to do is push through our legs and hang on this handle to produce force to make the machine move right make that flywheel inside push the air so starting up in that catch position which is this front position we're looking for a shin's vertical with the shoulders and front of the hips arms nice and long shoulders down chin up neck nice and long from this position think of using your biggest movers using your legs you're going to drive with the legs then swing the body open then pull the arms in so it's really simple mantra arms come away body comes over legs bend so it's a legs body arms arms body legs a lot of people like to skip that body swing right here and they don't end up in this body over position up at the front at the catch and so then they end up missing a lot of power from the legs as they drive it back so as you get started rowing once you're in that perfect position your feet are in the right place and then dampers in the right place then you just break it down and you row a little slower just for a little while all right and you get that legs body arms arms body legs and that's going to get you a much stronger stroke because when you're in this position you can push through your legs and transfer that force from the legs through your body into your arms into the machine all right so legs body arms arms body legs thinking about using the legs to drive to get the most out of your stroke and hopefully you'll have a much better time in your conditioning good luck hey dad hey do a man you ready to do this thing well I think we're going to be a little rusty but we'll make it work I'm more optimistic I think we're going to be fresh fresh yeah so this is the difference we've had a six month the six month dealer do you know what about it let it marinate had to probably explain the same things you know it doesn't times differently yeah it's great we'll be right are you more excited about doing this seminar than your 720 pull yesterday you don't have to be I think there are going to be diminishing returns at the high end of how much activity you're doing but if we can get some initial buy-in with a low amount that's fine we'll start there and then we'll see if we can nudge things in the right direction by continuing to work through that behavior change cycle what's keeping you from adding another day of activity what's keeping you from doing an additional session of the rubic activity right what are the pros and cons that play here is it because you work three jobs and you have five kids and you know you have real significant barriers to actually doing this or is it just that you haven't found an activity that you enjoy enough to do that much yet so not only is there no minimum threshold for benefit any amount is better than none but we see what is called a dose response relationship what that means is the higher the dose the higher the response you get with respect to training volume and health related benefits are our pre-existing ideas about pain and how it works right so if you are still stuck in the old school interpretation of what pain means where pain always means tissue damage right that's going to be more counterproductive you're not going to be able to function as well because anytime you experience any sentiment you're going to be like oh that means something that's happened right so you're pre-existing understanding can be problematic here and that's one of the avenues that we target when we're working with clients and patients we try to provide a lot of this education in a way as to reframe their ideas their beliefs and their understanding about pain and what it means and what they can do about putting them in charge of the situation building up that self-efficacy that they can actually benefit for example we talk about exercise technique we try not to talk about it in a way that unnecessarily makes exercise threatening in other words we don't say you must move this one perfect way otherwise you will develop pain that is unhelpful not only is it unhelpful if potentially harmful if people begin assigning threat value to exercise because you can't control how much threat they assign to it right this is where dead looks for bad for the back squads are bad for the knees comes from not only do people come to believe those but they come to believe that there's so dangerous and so threatening that the risk of doing those outweigh the potential health benefits of doing those things which is not the case right so we want to tilt the scales back again so people can say the benefits of doing these exercises far outweigh the risks in many situations regardless of the fine minute details of how I'm moving whether my knees are an inch forward or an inch back whether my back is a centimeter flex or a centimeter extended particularly if the loads that you're using are reasonable for the person

=== FILE: Training VLOG #40： 5-Weeks Out , Progressive Loading, and a Powerlifter Almost Shoots Par From The [Lr7mSyreumU].txt ===

Music Hey everyone, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fyganbaum. This is Training Vlog 40. We're recapping my training from five weeks out prior to my meat. In addition, we'll talk about progressive loading, versus progressive overload. And first, we're going to place them golf. If you don't like golf, just skip the next 10 minutes of the video, get to the good stuff that you might like, but if you are in the golf, you're going to see me swing a golf club. We're going to do it. All right. We're out here at Journey Pachenga to vacuillitis my favorite course in San Diego area. That's not three pines. Yeah, we're going to place them golf. All right, here at Journey Pachenga started out number one of the par, uh, the four, 476 yards. Pretty straight, although every time it goes off to the right. So if you're trying to go down the left side, get the windman. You got to set it. Absolutely perfect. As requested down the left side, and it will actually start taking off to a right a little bit. This is Leonard, my father, making his debut here. The barbell medicine YouTube channel. Yeah, 26 off the tee into the fan. And I'm not really rolling. It's kind of soggy out here. Got 175, front, 200 to stick, begin into it. Some of take a six-nine. The trouble is left. The bunker, long as dead. Check it out on the front here. But we're in the fairway. All right, we're two over through. This is six, or this is seven. Whatever, two over. Okay, I have a really good plan on it all over. My last round before. Anyway, this is maybe one of the signature holes out here. So this is the mechula. I don't know if you guys can see maybe the fairway down there. This bunker is down the left. You've been flirting with those bunkers. You're dead. We're just going to try to go over the bunker that bar bunker on the right. Go over it. Catch the speed slot. We can't even want to play honestly on that. I think the last time that I caught that speed slot is like 394. Long way. It'd be good. They got. Yep, fighting center. And step in here. Just stop at the top. About 120 yards in. We'll be good luck for the first. We got 137 stick, and back, down, hill, down, wind, wind off the left. What are they saying? Give it your best shot. Look at those goodCheerberg. Two minutes underground at ½t and these walls. This building is a huge difference with 165 total. Six thirds left street. One keymer. Six out of air clearance Berryen, as you can tell. Like I said, it was the overhead level. I was trying to realize what area it's gonna be. And the on board of the truck ya'll be beating for 250 feet. All right. There's the original daddy. All right. Pop. Yes. You bet. I told someone over for nine. I wish I could say the same. Yeah, they have to add a zero to it. At least a drivable par four. So we'll do this whole two and then 18. I think everything is just fine. We're out here together. Chango. That's also three eleven. We're here. I don't want to go over the clock. I think I can carry it all the way there. But I don't think we can do that. Three eleven carry it in. Pretty. It works down. So we're playing nice. We're going to get all the other side of the street. We'll call it golf management. All right. So get it on to the first cut here. But you guys see the stick over there. So see if we can play something. I don't know. Get it close. All right. We're here in 18. It's getting dark. We had it back to even. Getting dark. It is getting dark. We'll win the yellow collar. Yeah. Now we're five over. Hey. Three bogies and a double. Back nine is not looking great. But hey, teen. We are having fun though. Oh yeah. All right. 18. 431 yards. Maybe see that bunker back right. We're trying to go left with that. You can carry it all the way up there. You have like a hundred yards shot in. You fall down, though. I get par. 277. Great. So we're about three ten off the tee. Got a hundred and twenty nine left of stick. And back like a little swell front of it. It's a little downwind. I'm going to hit a gap wedge. Try to fly it. One twenty five just right of the stick. And like I said, get out of here with the car. I think good. Just like that. See that just like that. All right. So pretty good round out there at Pachanga again with my handicap and how difficult that course is. Braking 80 is a great score out there for me. It's really challenging and so is happy to be able to put it together on camera. We'll nervous not going to lie. But yeah, I love golf. It's great to get out there and especially do to play with my dad. Um, ton of fun. I picked it up about two years ago. And I was playing about three to four times a week. Uh, tapered down to once per week. The last few weeks getting ready for this meat. And then now I'm on no golf for the last three weeks prior to the meat. Um, so yeah, we'll get back to it after the meat. And so if you watch that and, uh, you know, yeah, I know I need some work on the swing. Um, work with a coach trying to get a little more shallow, a little more from the inside. And, uh, fix some nasty habits I picked up when I first picked up the game. I'll get about two years ago. But yeah, I can get around a course. Okay. And, uh, if you liked that, let me know in the comments below. Uh, let me know what you want to see next week. Um, for training this week. Because the time thing. Okay. So training from five weeks out will get to it just here in the middle of the day. Just here in a second. But first I want to talk about progressive loading versus progressive overload. So in the context of strength training, I think the central tenet of progressive loading is that you're able to increase the weight on the bar while keeping the rest of the program. All of the other constraints the same. That is the reps scheme, the volume, the rest periods, the range of motion, the exercise, etc. Uh, and including the rate of perceived exertion or what other subjective metric or even objective if you're using a velocity tracker or something. You're able to keep those things the same from work out to work out and increase the weight. That is a demonstrable increase in performance. You're able to progressively load the person. So increase the training stimulus without necessarily altering the training stress. The training stress is about the same. So this is going to require us to go over some definitions. So let's talk about those now. First definition is going to be training stimulus. These are the nuts and bolts of a program like the exercises, the reps schemes, the rep ranges, the intensity, rest periods, the tempo of the movement or velocity, range of motion, etc. This can also be conceptualized as the external load. The training stress is the resultant load placed upon the individual based on their current level of fitness and performance potential and everything that goes into that. Like their mood, their training expectations, nutrition status, fatigue, etc. This can also be classified as the internal load and can be measured by rate of perceived exertion, changes in heart rate, etc. Fitness adaptations are the positive, physiological, and psychological effects of exercise, like strength, hypertrophy, cardiovascular fitness, improved cognitive performance, etc. Fatigue can be conceptualized as the negative, physiological, and psychological effects of exercise. Things like soreness, muscle damage, reduced force production, tiredness, etc. Performance potential is the ratio or balance of fitness adaptations relative to fatigue at any given point in a specific environment for completing a particular task. Thus, training stimulus produces a given training stress that is unique to the individual, which subsequently results in both fitness adaptations and fatigue. If, over a given period of time, fatigue is greater than fitness adaptations, performance declines even if fitness adaptations are accruing. They're just being hidden or cloaked by fatigue. If fitness adaptations are greater than the resulting fatigue, performance potential can be realized if the environment is correct. Overall, the goal of training is to develop and realize fitness adaptations over time. So how does this fit in with progressive overload? The principle of progressive overload suggests that the human body must be continually challenged by greater and greater training stimuli over time in order to drive fitness adaptations. If taking at face value, I would pretty much agree with that. Though I think in practice, this gets misunderstood and misapplied, because really the adaptation rate determines the rate at which the training stimuli must increase. Rather than the increase in training stimuli determining the adaptation rate. In other words, applying the right dose of training stimulus based on individual's goals, their current fitness and performance levels, the environment and so on, is of primary importance. If the increase in training stimulus occurs too quickly, we're likely to also get too much fatigue on board, which reduces performance potential, can increase injury risk and may not actually lead to greater fitness adaptations anyway. Similarly, if we increase the training stimulus too slowly, the rate of fitness adaptation accrual will be decreased. In both cases, if the training stimulus is not matched to the individual's current fitness and performance potential, they're unlikely to get the best results. That can also work in reverse, that in order to get the best results, the training stimulus must be matched to the individual's current fitness and performance potential. In other words, the person's adaptation rate, which is reflected at any given point by their performance potential, should determine the training stimulus for the day. Because we have tools that allow us to determine an individual's performance potential on a given day, things like RPE, Reps and Reserve, Barvelocity, we're able to tailor the training stimulus on every training session for every movement in order to get the right dose. If fitness adaptations have accrued relative to fatigue, then an individual will be able to add something like weight, reps, reduced rest periods, something like that, while keeping the rest of the program the same. In other words, training stimulus has gone up while training stress has stayed about the same. So RPE has stayed the same, heart rate change has stayed the same, barvelocity has stayed the same. Again, the performance potential should determine the appropriate training stimulus on a given day. So what does this look like in practice? On the left, you have me squatting 600 pounds on the right, you have me squatting 6006, there are one week apart. The barvelocity is the same. I'm still doing the same reps, came it's a single rep. The RPE was about the same. I rated them both at about RPE 8 7 1.5 something like that. And so effectively, this is a demonstrable increase in performance potential that has then determined the training stimulus, the load on the bar. Because everything else about the program is static. If I had had an even greater increase in performance potential, I'd add even more weight to the bar. If I would have a decrease in performance potential, I'd have to take weight off the bar. And if my performance potential didn't increase at all, I would have to repeat the weight. And that's fine. Again, it is the performance potential, which is a proxy for the adaptation rate that determines the appropriate training stimulus. Not the training stimulus and increase in training stimulus determining the adaptation rate. Alright, last example is going to be my deadlift here. So we have 705 on the left, 7 17 on the right, doing them both for a single. They should be about RPE 8 and we'll look at the barvelocity. They're about the same. If not, maybe a little faster on the 7 17. Again, this represents a demonstrable increase in performance potential, which is then determined the training stimulus. So why do it this way versus just adding weight to the bar indiscriminately or changing weight on the bar or changing rep schemes indiscriminately? And by indiscriminately, I mean irrespective of what the RPE is, what the RIR is, what the velocity of the barvelocity is. Well, the point is that if you are generating too much fatigue out of proportion to the fitness adaptations on board, then the reality is you're trying to maximize performance on a given training session. And for most training sessions, particularly ones that are far away from a competition, a test, a need. You're really trying to just generate as many fitness adaptations as possible over time without generating too much fatigue. If you're generating all this fatigue, just so you can have the max performance on a single session, but that session wasn't really that important, that's kind of a waste. And so I think that most of your sessions should be sub-maximal, should be not too fatiguing, and you can only go to the well so many times before it goes dry. You'll see an example of me going to the well and overshooting and trying to force weight on the bar. And I think that's appropriate when you're getting ready for a test or a meat, and you can only do it for a short period of time because again, the fatigue cost is very, very high. The meat coming up though, I'm willing to kind of do that in some settings, not obviously all of my lifts that would not work, even though I'm getting really close to the meat, but here and there, I'm okay with making that compromise. But if I was 16 weeks out, 20 weeks out or had no meat on the schedule, I wouldn't do that at all because again, all I'm doing is trying to maximize the performance of a single session with, you know, disregard to other upcoming sessions or past sessions. Again, the fatigue that I'm going to generate is just out of proportion to the potential fitness adaptations. Again, the take home from this is that your adaptation rate, and we can use a proxy performance potential to determine that, is what's going to determine the change in training stimulus, not the increase or change in training stimulus determining the adaptation rate. So hopefully that makes more sense from what progressive loading is, and I think where people get off track is when they hear the term overload, they're like, oh, I have to do more. It has to overload the body. Really, it all has to do is stress the body enough to drive the fitness adaptations that you want. And principally, it can't drive too much fatigue because if it does, then you're not going to realize those fitness adaptations anyway. So maybe we should just call it progressive loading and get over this whole progressive overload thing. I don't know. Let me know what you guys think in the comments. I'll talk about it more. We do have a podcast on this and I've linked that in the description below. Maybe we'll write a long form article on this if you guys want. Let me know here thoughts. Finally, let's get into some training from last week, again, five weeks out, and I'll be interested to hear what you guys think about next week's vlog with the training from four weeks out. It gets a little dice in there. All right, so this is day one starting off again. It's a score up or so this is 275 kilos or 606. I'm going to do this for a single. I had done 600 of the week before pretty happy with how that move that might be last warm up. This is just a back offset. This is to 20 kilos, so 484. I did a couple sets of five with this. I'm just trying to get some volume in and make sure to keep the velocity of the barbell pretty high. I don't want to do anything super fatiguing, but I wanted to get enough volume in to sort of drive or at least support this fitness adaptations that I'm trying to get, which is strength development. On the bench, this is 185 kilos, 407. That was okay. I think the pause needs to be a little bit longer. Did my back offset here with 352. But this point of my training, my bench still was not feeling great, just relative to my normal, but still got to go to the meat. On the trap bar deadlift, I went up by 10 kilos, so this is 550. I did two sets of eight here and yeah, you know what I don't like about the trap bar deadlift. I don't like, well, I don't like when a person walks right in front of me will undead lifting, but that's not either here nor there. It just feels kind of like a weird snatch grip deadlift to me, but anyway. Pennlight Rose went up 10 kilos here, did 308, the previous week, this is 330, did three sets of five here. I already had these like RPE6, RPE7. So this is day two starting off with a 280 kilos, 606, instead of deficit poles, these are two inch deficits. Notice the bar coming off my legs. That's one of the challenges here. That third rep was better. The second rep was kind of loopy. See how we doing the fourth rep. Yeah, not bad. Yeah, I read it at that in eight, the plates are all fallen off on the left side, even with the collar, it's like a collar failure anyway. Second exercise, feet up bench press, and this is really just trying to get you to set your arch and maintain it, even without a lot of leg drive. I think some people get a little overzealous with the leg drive and they can get their butt coming off the bench. So this is what to 281. Yeah, that's fine. And then close grip floor press. I, you can do these either way, you can pause them if you want. If you're able to pause your elbows on the floor, just really depends. I find that I don't really notice a difference in the weight that I'm using, just my elbows seem to prefer like a brief pause. You can also do with your feet off the ground or like I have them there. I don't really feel strongly either way. Some people do with their legs laying flat, but I don't think it matters. This is day three, 717 on the deadlift. I already showed you guys that it moved very similarly to 705 a week before, pretty happy with that. All right, back offsets to 90, so it's 638. Yeah, I can even tell from here that I'm keeping the bar on my legs pretty well. You can see my kind of shorts coming up. I should probably hold that lock out a little bit longer, just wait for the crowds of ploughs. Did two sets of four here after the single, yeah, I'm fine with that. Basically, I pull my top single without straps and then my back offsets with straps, keep my hands nice and fresh. At least try to, especially since I tore my hand up, pin bench. That was 187.5. And back offsets I did is at 167.5, which is 360.8. So yeah, I just like to stay tight when I get down on the pins, especially some of the, you know, the bar wants to like bounce and move all the way around. So if you squeeze the life out of it, it's a pretty good way to do it. J.M. Press, again, with chains. Yeah, so basically I try to like bring the bar down like a bench press and then kind of roll it over my face, kind of like a skull pressure. I think it's a good way to think about it. It's really, you know, anytime you can feel the triceps, what would the elbows feel like that's going to be good for me and my bench press, which has been trending up, which will see in subsequent vlogs. But this vlog was, my bench was still not feeling great. So this is 230 kilos, 507 high bar squat. It's kind of high bar for me, for sure. Basically, my Q on high bar is push my knees forward further than I want them to go right off the bat. So knees go further forward and try to push my hips forward on the way up. But anyway, I rate it that in eight. I posted a five and eight. I did that. Took some weight off. Did one more set of five. All right, on the close grip bench, this is 165 kilos, 3603. So yeah, switch to a pause bench this following week, not here. And then also, I think I'm bringing the bar down a little too low. I don't really like my wrist angle here. I would like to keep my elbows in tucked in a little bit more, but not unhappy with that. Rated that five reps at RP eight did some dips added 45 pounds. My body weights like 210 to 11 right now. And I rated these RP six. I ended up doing four sets of 10 here. Again, try to get the triceps involved. Lean forward, push my chest forward. And finished up with some RDS did these at 190. And then I'm really tired at this point of the week and the training week. Five to six exercise per day. Big things on the RDL. Again, I think don't try to do him stiff leg, they're not stiff leg and dead lifts. Trace the barbell down your leg, feel the steel on your legs. Squeeze your back as tight as possible, and squeeze your butt at the top. And profit. That's how you do RDLs. I like taking him down just below the knee, a couple inches below the knee. That's my preferred way to do RDLs. All right, that's a wrap on training vlog 40, five weeks out. Let me know what you want to see next week. When we do training vlog 41, four weeks out. Again, training gets a little dicey there, so excited to show you that. But things are rolling, we're getting closer to the meat. And I'm getting excited. So thanks for following me along here. And let me know what you want to see in the comments below. See you guys. Thank you.

=== FILE: Training VLOG 38： 7 Weeks Out [HiG2hsoNZA8].txt ===

Music Hey everyone, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagamon. This is training vlog 38. That's right. We're back with a training vlog. I figured it would be a good time to chronicle my preparation for this upcoming meet. It's the 12th of November. So I'm about five and a half weeks out now. This week is the sixth week out. Last week, which is what we'll review here. I was seven weeks out and I'm just going to release videos every week, chronoclean the previous week and we'll go through the meet, go to the meet together and then, you know, recap, after it's done. So pretty excited. It is the USPA Desert Wars meet is just outside of LA. In the middle of November to answer some questions. I am going to be entering the 100 kilo raw class. I usually weigh between 95 or 93 to 95 kilos so to a five to two ten and I'm going to weigh the same. I like this weight. I feel like I'm pretty strong here. I have no desire to really get any bigger and I feel like I can lift what I want to lift at this body weight. So I'm not going to cut any weight to go down to the 90 kilo or 198 pound weight class. I'll just hang out here, walk into the meet and go lift some weights. So it's the open division. So you can use knee sleeves. You can use about wrist wraps, but no knee wraps. And the idea here is I'd like to beat my best total. My previous best total was in 2014 with knee wraps. It was 1795 pounds or 815 kilos. I squatted 640. I benched 430 pounds, which is 195 kilos. And then I deadlifted 725 pounds or approximately 330 kilos. So training actually has been going pretty well. My squat. I was able to beat my all-time best squat PR of 640 pounds. I did that in knee wraps and this time I did it in sleeves. I actually chipped it. So it was 291 kilos, 641 pounds. So that was great. Right, yeah, cool. My bench press has been doing okay. I've been playing a lot of golf recently three to four times a week. And I feel like that's been just generating a lot of upper body fatigue which has kind of been holding my bench press back. So I'm cutting down my golf to once a week until I'm like two or three weeks out from the meat and then I'll just cut golf out. I know like golf is not that stressful that's true. But yeah, as far as upper body fatigue, I probably don't need any extra fatigue compared to all the training I'm doing now. Really excited for next week's training vlog where you get to see what I'm doing this week. Because it's a substantial departure for what from what I normally do leading into a meat. And I'm pretty excited about it. So I think I think things are going to go well. So in any case, my best bench, I think for the the previous block was 187.5 kilos or four eleven. I did that for three singles on that day. And that's a fine place to be going into this final meat prep. And then my deadlift, the first week I switched to a deadlift bar, which does have a little bit of a learning curve. I was able to lift 715 pounds. It's pretty easy single. So a goals for the meat. I just want to beat my best total. 815 kilos. It was my previous best total of 1795 pounds. I'd like to total somewhere in the 84850 range kilos. And then I'd like that's, you know, somewhere in the 1850-ish pounds. I'd like to squat about 295 kilos. That's my goal. So 650 pounds. If I can beat or meet my best bench press in the gym, which is 200 kilos, 440, that'd be fine. I'd beat my best meat bench press. And time I best gym bench press. I just don't feel like there's a ton of upside in my bench press right now. Like 202 is not going to make really a huge difference. And the idea is to maximize total, take what's there, build the best total you can. That's, that's why I'm going to the meat. And then I'd like to pull 340 kilos, which is 748. I've pulled 738 in the gym before. My best meat deadlift is 727. 725. So yeah, we'll see if that's there. If I can hit my numbers, I'm going to be super excited. But like I said, we'll take what's there. See how training goes. And excited for you guys to take this trip with me. Now, this training vlog is going to be a little bit different than previous training vlogs. What we used to do, what I used to do is take questions that you would submit and answer them. You know, there'd be a whole list of citations and a bunch of science going on. We're doing a lot of these Q&A, you know, releases as you've seen on our YouTube channel. So we're doing a lot of the science stuff. And I think that's great. Time to place for that. So let's keep the scientific questions and scientific review stuff kind of separate from this more lifestyle stuff, the training vlogs. And so what I'd like to do is make the training vlog a little more personal. I want to show you guys like this week. We're going to go over what's in my gym bag. What I take to the gym every time I go train. Provided I don't lose my gym bag or forget it in one of my vehicles in the other car. So that'll be this week. I'd love to hear what you want to see on next week's training vlog. So leave a comment below. Otherwise, you know, you're going to see how I make coffee or see what's in the bag for my, that I go golfing with, you know, see what kind of clubs I'm playing with or something. Whatever you want to see, we'll see if we can accommodate that. But it more lifestyle personal stuff. And then we'll keep the Q&A drip and science questions kind of as their own things so that way people can search them and I access them easily rather than them being like buried in a 20 minute training vlog. So yeah, excited to see what you what you come up with. All right, so now let's see what's in my gym bag. Hopefully no surprises. All right. This is my gym bag. It is from Lulu Lemon. I actually don't know the name of the bag. I just know that it's big and it keeps all my stuff in it. So we're just going to crack her open. Yes, he would's in there. So first up, these are the re-box legacy liftor twos. I do change out my shoes quite often, just a new color way or style or interesting design comes out. I do really like these shoes. I've had the Nike Romalayos ones, twos, threes, leather edition. All that stuff I've had the re-box legacy liftor ones. I've had no bulls. I've had a D-dice power perfect twos and threes and adi powers, like all of them. Right. These are my favorite shoes so far. I think they're they're most similar to the Nike Romalayos twos as far as support in the heel cup and the heel elevation but they're lighter. And I like that. They're not perfect. I did the little tab when you pull across with the pull it real tight. I ripped some of the leather off but otherwise I've had these shoes now for almost a year maybe a little bit longer. And yeah, they're going strong. I actually have a brand new pair of the, uh, what if they're the ante, altar? I don't know. I forget the name of them. The weight lifting shoes that I may switch to next just to try them out. But so far these are my favorites. I don't think these are adding any weight to my, to my lifts. I'm outside of using a different type of shoe but these are what I'm lifting with. Straps. So these are wrists straps. I got these from Rogue. I used to have the iron mines so easy, the short wraps. And they were one piece, uh, like sewn together. You can see that these like slide like this. They were actually kind of fixed so there was no like stitching there for to break. Um, but these are fine too. They're nylon. So when you're using these, you're going to want to use a little bit of chalk too. Um, particularly if your hands are sweating or there's not chalk already on the implement. I actually don't know how long these are, but there's one version that's longer than them. Um, I tried to use these on an axle and they're not long enough to use on an axle comfortably anyway. Uh, but I tried to use them in a strong man meat and they were barely long enough for me to use. It worked. I still won the deadlift event. There's a strong man video. If you want to see me do strong man, but uh, these are fine. I don't really like the leather straps in general. They don't feel awesome. They don't smell awesome after a while, but again, my preference would be the iron mine. So easy, uh, wrists, uh, wrist straps, but I lost them. If you if you have them, if you stole them from me, uh, I'll take it back. Uh, right, uh, these are wrist wraps. These are the SBD1 meter, uh, believe they call them firm or stiff that, as far as, uh, yeah, top how stiff they are. Uh, I got these back in 2014. So I know that that was like the first year the SBD came out and, um, they made great products. I liked them. They were like an innovator in the field, because they were the only ones making a left and a right wrist wrap, uh, that was IPF and USAP all approved at the time. Tighten only makes like left sided ones, and I'm like, why can't you just make the left and right wrist wraps? But, um, I really like these. And, uh, yeah, I've had since 2014. I see no reason upgrade the Velcro still holding out holding, uh, well, um, I guess if they come out with another color way that I want, maybe I'll get them or if Pete, if you're watching this, if you want to hook me up with some of the latest SBD gear, that, hey, that'd be great. Uh, right, have a little chalk. This is actually just like a little climbers chalk. I keep it in here in case I go to a gym that doesn't have chalk, um, which is rare, but, you know, find it. I don't love climbers chalk. It's not, I prefer the loose chalk. Um, I don't have a favorite type of chalk other than in fact, it's loose and I can like, you know, rub it on my hands, um, versus like powdering it, but, uh, this will work in a pinch and it's less messy and doesn't get all of my gym bag. So, you need some chalk. Uh, knee sleeves. These are also from SBD. These are the eclipse. These are the black ones. I turn them inside out because, uh, that's how I take them off. Um, these need to be washed. Uh, you guys can't smell this. They don't smell terrible, but these, uh, have been, uh, out of the wash for a couple months now and, uh, they, they're, they're, they're neat. Now, I just put these in my washing machine and I dry them to and I've noticed no decrement over time. I've had a bunch of these pairs of knee, uh, knee sleeves and they're fine. Austin, uh, believe sometimes puts them in a shower. I don't know. And I've heard other people put them in the dishwasher like whatever, whatever you like, just make sure you wash them from time to time. These are, yeah, now a lot better out. I'll probably upload a wash. All right. In other old school stuff, I've got a slingshot. This is one of the original slingshot. This is from like 2015. Um, it's an extra large, um, about 200 or five pounds, 210 pounds, five foot, 10 and a half. And, uh, this is one I use. My best bench is 440. Um, interestingly with the slingshot, I've never actually benched more than my best touching go bench press. I've been able to handle more for reps and definitely on days where I wasn't quite as strong. I've been able to use more weight. Do some overload stuff and definitely does take, uh, some tension and pressure off the chest and shoulders at the, you know, bottom end of the range of motion. But I've never actually like been able to bench like 450 or 60 or anything like that in this. I just use it as a training tool. Um, and yeah, so, is it my best single on a regular bench press is apparently quite well developed. And I really haven't done a lot of singles in a slingshot. It's not really how I train with the slingshot. Uh, another pair of knee sleeves. I don't know why I have a second pair in here other than I just forgot to take them out. But these blue ones, um, also probably need to be washed. Uh, they go well with our singlets. We found a bunch of singlets when we were moving warehouses. So we have SBD singlets, um, that are brand-out barbell medicine, um, over on a website. There's a link in the description below. If you guys are having a meet, they are approved for all federations. Uh, and our logo is too. And, uh, yeah, if you want to rep us at a meet, get one of our singlets. Uh, this belt is a best belt's prime cut 13 millimeters thick single prong. I've had this belt since 2012, uh, and the meet first meet I used this in. I weighed in 178.6 pounds. The center on this used at the sticker. Yeah, the center on this was cut on 29 and a half inches. And I'm still using the same belt even though my waist is now 31 inches. I think something like that when I measured it last on camera for how to measure your waist video and article. Um, so yeah, this belt is fine. When I tell people to get belts, I just have get a 4 inch wide 13 millimeter thick belt. If you want to lever belt, that's fine. I don't particularly like lever belts. Um, single prong is what I prefer. I don't see an advantage to a double prong, other than it's kind of a little bit more difficult to latch in. But if that's your preference, I won't argue with you about it. You can live a full and complete life with one prong, two prongs, no prongs. Do your thing. I don't like Velcro belts outside of maybe a Olympic weight lifting, but even that I would prefer one of the old leather thinner belts with the single prong. But yeah, people you have used Velcro belts and success with success. I just for powerlifting. I've busted a lever lever belt and I've definitely seen belts come on done, uh, that are Velcro in squats and that seems concerning. Okay. What else we got in here? I got a pair of bands. Um, sometimes I do banded work. Um, and I just want to pair of bands that are matched meaning like they're the same level of like stretched outness. There's a technical term for that, but it is eluding me right now. So I just have a pair of mini bands. I use mini bands on pretty much everything. Um, if I'm using, if I'm doing banded work. So squats against bands, um, deadlift against bands. I pretty much always use these. Sometimes I'll use micro minis on the bench press. Um, but the idea is you would have like about 20% of your one rep max in accommodating resistance, whether that's chains, bands, et cetera. And, uh, these depending on how you anchor them if they're doubled up, single up. Uh, yeah, you're getting about that. And again, I just don't want one side of the bar to be like, wow, that's way harder and the other one's way easier because one band people use to stretch with all the time and the other band has been sitting there. So I just have my own carry them around pretty pretty portable. What else isn't here? I got another pair of wrist traps. There's same SPD ones. These are actually new. Um, I thought I lost my old pair and I was so bummed about it, but then I found them. It's a recurring theme. I think I lose something and then have to replace it. But yeah, these are brand new. I just never use them because I just like my old ones. If the Velcro starts to fail, at least I got to pair them back up. Um, these were given to me as a gift. These are SPD wrist traps. These are the smaller, like, flexible ones. If I had to do like front squads or Olympic weight lifting or something like that, I'd probably use these. Um, a little bit more flexibility rather than a full cast around the wrist. But since I don't do those, I don't ever use these. What else? Shh. I have some pink athletic tape that I use if I tear my hand open or otherwise need to cover something on my hand. Um, so use that. This is just K tape. Can you see a tape? Um, I just find it as a little more flexible and it's kind of sticks to the hand a little bit better than like regular white athletic tape. But you may have a different preference. What else? Oh, it looks like a baby powder thing when often here because I think that's exactly what happened. But I believe I threw that away. There's nothing in that one. All right, what do I have over here? AirPods. These are what I use. They stick in my ears at maximum attempts. They are noise canceling. They're fine. I've had beats that've had the regular AirPods. I've had the, what was it like fly wire or something like that? Some other brand. They're all fine, right? But these are just convenient. I use them when I'm lifting, when I'm working, um, when I'm on a plane, whatever, and pretty versatile. So I keep these in the bag. Nothing else in there. Just curious like did I leave anything in here? Oh, I got some smelling salt. Yeah, cool. I don't have to buy this for the meat. So I only use smelling salt at a meat on 30th. I don't use it in the gym. Even under testing situations, I just find like I want to keep that in the meat for the meat for 30th times where it really, really matters. It just really doesn't matter in the gym. Not to say that, you know, PRs in the gym are important, but it's like, you know, the money's online, the win is online. I just want to have that little extra, you know, final gear to shift into. That said, if you've never used it before and you want to like see if you like it or not, you can use it the gym. That's fine. Um, I just don't use it for everything all the time. Otherwise, you know, where is that next level you can take things to? I think that's it. So that's what's in my gym bag. Hopefully you found some of that interesting. Oh, oh, yeah. The final thing I bring to the gym is this camera. This is definitely overkill. This is a Sony A7R4. I have another camera that I'm filming. This thing on this YouTube video on, but yeah, this is what I take to the gym. Sony A7R4. It's got a size 50 millimeter 1.4 lens on there. That's what makes me look half way presentable. When I'm lifting weights, got a road video mic pro mic on there and then this is a newer tripod. And it like extends and whatever. All right. So now let's take a look at this past week's training, again, a seven weeks out last week, six weeks out this week. So last week was actually a D load week. It was my first D load week in about 20 weeks. So the previous mesocycle is actually very productive. And so before we kind of dive into the lifts, I actually did just a brief word on D load weeks. I don't think that we should be taking D load weeks on a regularly scheduled basis. Unless there's like a firm concrete, not arbitrary date that you need to peak for a meet a test competition, something like that, and need to transition your training before that to prepare adequately for that test meeting. If it's a pilot meeting, you're doing more singles, you're specializing the training to the movements that you're going to be tested on, stuff like that. If you don't have to do that, or if your test is kind of flexible, meaning that you could go test your lifts in the gym whenever you want to, I don't think that you need to plan D loads. If your training is working for you right now, you're highly motivated for what you're doing, like carry on until proven otherwise. On the other hand, there are two basic categories that like would prompt me to give somebody a D load one is psychological and one is physiological. So psychological, if somebody is bored, they are not motivated, or they are otherwise like having compromised adherence or really stagnant with respect to their attitudes towards training. Hey, let's change training up and two transition into that next block. Let's do a D load week. On the physiology side, I'm thinking more like persistent soreness fatigue, maybe an injury, or pain that thing that's kind of crept up and we need to transition anyways into something that more meets the person where they're at. But the idea is that if your programming regularly requires D loads like every fourth week, I don't know that the thing is programmed very well. A lot of our templates do have regularly programmed D load weeks. But the idea is that we're trying to build a template for the general population and on average, most mesocycles that are well programmed are going to last somewhere between four to eight weeks depending on the goal and the population that you're applying the training to. But like I said, my previous mesocycle lasted 20 weeks. And again, the only reason we kept running it with just small tweaks here and there to maybe movements and maybe total training stress, yeah, it just kept working. So if your training is working and you're motivated and you're not having this persistent fatigue or soreness or anything else that's compromising your training, like carry on. That would be my recommendation. Okay, so with that out of the way, what are the goals of A D load week? What you'd like to do is to prepare the individual or that lifter for the next training block, whether there's new movements, new rep schemes, stuff like that. That's a good place to kind of introduce those things. So that way they can hit the ground running. Another thing that is pretty consistent across all different types or styles of D load weeks is to reduce the amount of fatigue that the individual is carrying so they can be more fresh leading into the next training block. And so what you're going to see is a reduction in training stress, training stress being the training intensity. So how heavy it is, the training volume, you're going to see market reductions and usually both of those things. And though the reduction in sort of training stress typically leads to a reduction in training load, which leads to a decrease in fatigue. Now the thing is if you just did nothing, no training at all. The problem with it isn't that you wouldn't dissipate fatigue. You certainly would. The problem is that you're also decaying a lot of the fitness adaptations or reducing a lot of the fitness adaptations that you previously built over your previous training block or blocks. And so you'd like to preserve those to the best of your ability. So we're talking about things like strength. We're talking about things like power, things like lean body mass, cardiovascular risk perifitness of those power and strength probably are the ones most likely to decay without any sort of training because of the skill component there. Meaning that you're unlikely to after-feed significantly, even if you don't train for a week, provided you're eating enough protein and not, you know, confined to bed rest or ill, same thing with cardiovascular fitness. But you can definitely get weaker, noticeably weaker in a week if you're not doing any sort of training, just because of the high skill nature of resistance training, particularly maximal force production at low velocities or like power lifting. Same thing, a little bit with a Olympic weightlifting or power sort of exercises like that that do have a high skill component. So in this context, in a D-load week, you'd like to give people a little bit of strength work to maintain their strength, right? Make sure they get a pretty decent pump, get some blood flow, and overall lower training stress so that they can be less fatigue for the next training block. And that's what we're going to see this week in my D-load week. All right, so this is a day one, pretty much every training day. There's a bench, there's a squat and then some sort of pull or row. So this one's supposed to work up to a set of 10 at 8, believe this is 320. Again, I guess that my bench hasn't been feeling great and I believe I did this on Tuesday because I played golf on Monday because it was D-load week and, you know, no, this is on Monday and I played golf on Sunday. Anyway, 320 for 10, pretty decent. Then I moved on to deadlifts. This is supposed to do 70% for 1 set of 4. I think this is 535, which is about 70%. And yeah, this is fine. I probably should have used callers. That's how lazy I am. And yeah, no surprises there. And then finally finished off with this high row. Now I was supposed to do pull downs, but the gym that I used to go to was sell it has sold nearly all of its equipment or at least a good chunk of it. So this is as close as I could get. I could have done 10ly rows. It could have done lever rows or dumbbell rows, but I thought hey, like a lap pull down. It's kind of vertical. It's used machine. It's low or supposed to be lower fatigue. I can do this with this high hammer rope. So this is day two. First time using a squat bar. So that's kind of funky. This is 515 because the bar is 25 kilos. And again, I'm supposed to do a set of 5 at 8. And based on the velocity of the first rep and the second rep I'm like, oh, easy day. And I think honestly, again, the d-load mentality just kind of gets in your brain or like, nah, I'm going to mail it in. So I didn't even brace for that fourth rep really. And then fifth rep. I did decided to brace, but then yeah, this little struggle there. That's probably more of a 7, but I didn't want to go up. Then on this day, so again doing some funky stuff, Mike actually had me squatting 30% for 40 seconds straight. And then it was 40 seconds or 30 seconds, something like that. I think it was 40 seconds. And you take a minute break and do three rounds. So I'm not going to show you all of that stuff. So we'll just fast forward through this. But that's what I'm doing here. And let me tell you, uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Okay. The next exercise that I did was feet up bench. And I was supposed to work up to again 5 at 8. That's some of that strength maintenance stuff. This is 3 20 again, but with my feet up rather than feet down. So 5 at 8. And yeah, that looks hard enough. And then again, same sort of thing, 40 seconds, 30% of the one RM just keep moving. I'm not going to show you all of this, but I will tell you that 135 was very humbling at the end for this power lifter. And all right. And the next exercise I did after this, after that was that high pull down again for the 40 seconds of effort at 30% minute break by 3 rounds. So that was the end of day two. This is day three. I'm doing cannibal squats or plat squats. So my heels are elevated. And I'm supposed to be doing my reps. I'm just going to show you the first set of 15. This is 140 kilos, 308. And so with this, heels are elevated. Trying to push the knees as far forward as possible. I wish you would have brought my lifting shoes, but I changed gyms and I forgot my gym bag and my other car. So just doing these. First time ever doing them, they're okay. I think I could stay more vertical, but again, just more strength, maintenance stuff, get a pump, can't confirm. He started feeling very uncomfortable. So I did 15 here at 140. And then I did two sets of four after that. And I was like, yeah, that's enough. And then I did a second mile rep where I did 12 reps and the one set of four and was tired. All right. Second exercise. I was done bell bench. So the idea was just work up to set of 15 at RP-8. Do a couple sets there. So use 100. This is heavy as they go. So yeah, nothing special here. The exercise after this was a seated row mile rep, which I'm not showing you that because it's very boring. But this is D-Load. We basically each day I did some sort of squat or lower extremity dominant exercise. I did a bench press and I did some sort of row. And I made it challenging by either doing a mile rep or higher rep sets, set like an eight. Or I would do some strength maintenance thing, which is like a 10 at eight or five at eight. And then the back off work was this timed interval set where you're just working for 40 seconds. Or you could do a circuit, you know, where you're doing, like 30% four or five to 10 reps of squat, bench, deadlift, or squat, bench, row or something like that. All right.

=== FILE: Training VLOG 39： 6-Weeks Out and How-To Make Coffee [t64iLQ2LeBs].txt ===

Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum. This is training vlog number 39. I am six weeks out from my powerlifting meat and we're going to recap my lifts from the week. First, we need coffee. First up, let's start with the gear. I'm using a Baratza On-core Burr grinder. On the Burr grinder, I have the setting set to 15. Basically, there are two steel burrs that grind the coffee and the grind size is regulated by the distance between the two burrs. So, higher the number, the further the distance between the burrs and the course are the grind. The pour over that I'm using is a kaleeta trai wave pour over and it does use a paper filter that slows down the flow of water, but not a whole lot and then it waves inside the drippers well and that basically speeds up the flow of water. So, to get the right extraction to get the right flavor for me, I like to use a medium to find grind. It basically slows down the passage of water through the grounds because it's a little finer consistency. So like I said, I'm using a kaleeta trai wave pour over and I put that on top of the time more electronic scale. It not only tells you the mass of coffee grounds and water that you're using so you can get the right ratio, but also there's a timer on there. I'm also using Verf coffee, Verf was a local brand. I started in Santa Cruz, California and I was living up there for a little bit and got addicted and I can find it at my local Whole Foods. So that's the coffee that I'm using. So in any case to try to get the right amount of extraction, basically we're trying to get the right flavor notes from the beans. So I use this one to 15 ratio. You can use anything from one to 14, one to 16 and that's grounds to water. It's 40 grams of coffee to 600 grams of water when I'm making two cups or when I'm making one cup I'll use 30 grams of coffee and 450 grams of water. The main thing here is to use enough grounds to actually restrict the flow of water. So you actually have to have enough coffee grounds in the filter to make sure you're slowing down the passage of water enough. So I can't make a smaller cup with like 20 grams of grounds. So I kind of cut it off at 30 grams. That's the minimum amount of coffee that I'm going to make using this brew device. Another thing that people will tell you to like rinse the filter basically you're trying to rinse away any filter flavors. Maybe preheat the brewing device in this case to clean a dry wave dripper and maybe that helps maintain a constant flow rate of water if you preheat it. But I'm not convinced that any of that is real. So I don't want the filter. I don't do any of that stuff. In any case I just put 30 grams of coffee grounds into the filter and then I'm ready to start my pour. To do the pour I'm using the Stag EKG electric kettle. It's really great because you get to set the temperature and you want somewhere between 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit or 90 to 96 degrees Celsius. When I do the pours to make the coffee I'm trying to do four pours on average. I start the timer on my scale just to make sure that I'm taking enough time to for each pour and between pours. I'm usually trying to do about 60 grams of water on the first pour to get a bloom. That's basically the release of carbon dioxide from the beans. So I'm looking to do that over about 15 seconds and then wait about 40 seconds so at a minute I'll do my second pour which is usually 100 to 150 grams of water. Something like that. In another 20 seconds and then I'm going to wait a minute. Then I'm going to do about a similar slice pour maybe a little bit smaller because I'm just making one cup here. 15 to 20 seconds, wait another minute and then I'm going to finish it up to make my single cup at 450 grams. Again I'm using that one to 15 ratio and kind of let it finish dripping. It should take about three to four minutes to do this whole brew. This is a light roast until I'm shooting for three to four minutes. It's a dark roast maybe a little bit longer but yep that's how I make coffee. Just because I know it's going to come up if you have any questions about caffeine and how it pertains to health I did a YouTube video on that and I've linked that in the description below. A few announcements before we get into this week's training blog did a really great podcast with Coach Jake Sipkin of NRK's training methods. I've ever wondered about CrossFit, how to program for CrossFit, the differences between programming for a CrossFit athlete who's like going to the games, regionals versus recreational CrossFit, injury risk, all that sort of stuff. That's the podcast. It's the CrossFit podcast. I've linked that in the description below as well and then finally you may be digging this new spruce maybe is the color hoodie. We have a bunch of new apparel that is dropping tomorrow. This video should go up on Friday the 15th and then I believe the apparel drop is the 16th. Depending on when you're watching this, head over to the barbell medicine website and check out the new apparel if you want to rep barbell medicine. Okay, so let's hop into this week's training. It was technically last week's training because again that's how time works. So this current week, which you'll see next week, has also been going great. But last week was my first week of a new training block. I wanted to answer a question that actually got a lot of likes from the last video because it does pertain to starting a new training block, particularly for a meat prep. So Matt the Furn writes would love to see you troubleshoot training and stuff during meat prep in order to stay on track to hit your numbers when things don't go as planned. So just first and foremost, I don't know that there's a way to manufacture a weight on the bar, meaning that if you go into a training session and it's not there, I don't know that I have any tricks to give you to just spontaneously put more weight on the bar. Really, I think the most important thing that I could impart to you guys, the audience is when you're starting a new training block is I would be a little bit more conservative in picking your initial weights. I think it is also useful, particularly if you're a trained individual and if it's a meat prep, there is a firm end date to your training block to have goals that you're trying to achieve by the end of that block. Now, most training should be process oriented and I get in all the training in and I do all the sets, I'm sticking to the RPE, stuff like that. But I do think when you have a firm end date to your training block because you have a meat, it's okay to also have some of those outcome-based goals. So for me, I do like starting conservatively on week one and I'm kind of basing where I'm starting at particularly for the lifts that I've had prior exposure to based on the last block. So the last training block I finished up with a 291 kilo or 640 pounds squat on the bench press. I did 187.5 kilos, which is 412 pounds and then on the deadlift, I did 320, 4 kilo deadlift or 115 pounds. So I don't want to start there because that's as high as I got on the last training block. I want to start a little bit under it and the idea is that through this block I'll be able to surpass that and then do that at the meat. And since I have meat numbers that I'm kind of thinking about, I also know like, okay, I can't start any lower than this and reasonably add a little chunk of weight each week. So to do this in practice, I think the RPE is going to be very useful. So generally on your prescription for training, you're going to have rep set an RPE sort of prescription. Mine, for example, this week for squat was a single at eight and then do a set of five at eight and then do one back down set. That was on competition squat. I had multiple other squats, slots throughout the week. So in picking that weight, if I want to end around 290 or maybe a little bit higher before I go to the meat, I know that the most I'm going to feel comfortable adding week by week is about five kilos. Sure if I'm really feeling it, I could add a little bit more but the idea that I'll be able to add seven and a half kilos or ten kilos per week is just unlikely. 1% 2% that seems like a reasonable sort of gain, particularly if I'm building momentum, which is probably the most important thing you can do in a meat prep block. You want the person feeling invincible when they go into the meat, have a lot of positive jugeo, a lot of momentum rolling into the meat if you can. So I couldn't start any lighter really than like 270 or 270 2.5 kilos, which is 595 or 600 pounds. The idea would be, I'm going to try to add five kilos each week and then if I do that, the duration of this meat prep block I'll be at 290 or so by the end of it before I go to the meat. I would be totally fine hitting 290 again and going into the meat and then trying to hit something like 295 at the meat if it's there. So the benchmark, how do they get to 290 kilos or 638 pounds as like my sort of target? I'm looking at like a conservative third attempt. Something that I'm pretty sure I can get. I'm really confident in and I would like to do that in training. My reach number is like 295 kilos or 650 pounds or maybe even 300 kilos, 660 pounds. But I just don't think it's reasonable that I'm going to hit that in training without it costing me a ton of fatigue. If I didn't have a meat coming up, then you know, yellow, let's do this thing. But so that's the way I kind of bracket like where do I want to get by the end of a meat? What's the conservative third? So for a squat, it's 290 kilos or 638 pounds for a bench. Some around 200 kilos or 440 pounds and on deadlift I'd like to pull 340, which is 748. I believe so yeah, I'm going to add, try to add somewhere between 2.5 to 5 kilos per week to each of my top singles there. And so in order to ensure that at least the first 2 or 3 weeks of this meat prep block, I'm building some positive momentum, I'm going to start conservatively. Doesn't mean to ignore the RPE. It just means that you don't have to concentrate on making sure it's really a single of 8. If it's a single 7 or 7 and a half, that's fine. Try to build some momentum this first few weeks and then ideally you have all those good vibes going into the final few weeks. Make sure at that point you might go do a single at 8.5 or a single at 9, over a shoot a little bit to hit your target. But the point is to, at that point you're very close to the meat, it's probably a good trade-off at that point rather than doing it at the start of a meat prep block. Again, I don't know a way to manufacture weight on days that it's just not there, but I do play some games with myself. For example, I can't add weight to the top set or top single or something or it don't feel comfortable doing that, I'll try to do it on a back-off set or something like that. So at least I feel like I'm improving, I can rationalize things, I'm still trending that way. Now this assumes that I'm not injured or feeling just very, very fatigued. If that's the case, I'm probably going to try to change the programming in order to again, try to build some momentum and dissipate fatigue. So if I'm injured or very, very fatigued, I may start my taper earlier, maybe 10 days out, 14 days out, which is about twice as long as I normally do, just like three to five days, it's my normal taper to go into a meat. Or if my training numbers are just kind of tanking and I don't really feel that tired, I don't really feel that that beat up that I'm kind of like, all right, well this programming isn't really working, maybe I need to go back to a more sort of developmental phase where I'm doing maybe a single, seven or single, eight, and then more volume sets a five at a lower RPE or sets a four at a lower RPE to kind of again, try to build some momentum where I can add weight week by week versus more of a specialization block, which is what I'm in now with a single, eight, and then more some higher intensity work. So that's just kind of how I start a block and I do think that it's important to be relatively conservative when you're starting out, give yourself some room to grow, it's okay to understute, I'd much rather have you understute the initial weights than overstute, and then as far as how much can you understute by, well it just depends on where trying to go and how much time you have. And what you feel like is a reasonable target for yourself to actually add weight to the bar each week. It's unlikely that you'll be able to add weight to the bar each week indefinitely, that linear progression thing kind of falls off, but you know, we gotta make a while of the sun shining and for me right now, my confidence is at all time high, my training has been going really, really well and I feel like it's reasonable, I can add two and a half to five kilos, two my competition lifts each week for the next few weeks as I go into the meat, hit my targets and then do some damage at the meat. So hopefully that's helpful. Let me know in the comments below and which you guys want me to talk about next week, otherwise we'll just review the lifts, which is what we'll do now. All right, so we're starting off on squats here. So this is again the first week of new meat prep block, this is 272.5 kilos, 601, using the squat bar, that looks crispy, good velocity. I mean I probably rate this a seven or seven and a half, but again trying to start conservatively and these are the back offsets, actually done at a little bit lower intensity this first week. So this is only 215 kilos, 463 pounds, if my kilo to pound math is good off hand. Yeah, this second week it actually bumped up to a five at eight, but just had some lighter percentage back offs. This is my comp bench, which I did also on day one, 180 kilos, 396 pounds. This is probably going to be either my last warm-up before my bench, and then I had penalty rows, this is 140 kilos, 388 pounds. I don't really like these platforms are super bouncy, but whatever. And then after that I had track bar dead lifts, so this is 240 kilos, 528 pounds I believe. I had these for eights. So the biggest difference between this block in my last normal meat prep block is I'm doing a lot less volume per lift, but a lot more lifts. So I normally do three lifts per session or so, this is five to six lifts per session, and the overall volume ends up being the same. It just, there's just more lifts. And then I finished up with dumbbell bench. Again, these are hundreds and I'm supposed to do 10 reps at seven. The problem is they don't have any heavier dumbbells, so I actually swapped this out on week two for a duffle of bar bench. Just trying to get that added range of motion. I think that's the real purpose here in addition to some unilateral work. I couldn't find a way. If you're going to wait to do unilateral work, so anyway, all right. So this is day two, 606 or 200 and 75 kilos. About a two inch deficit. And I'm going to do this for a set of four at eight. Yeah, I feel like these are pretty good. Again, with the bouncy platforms, the bar just kind of like jumps all over the place. It actually doesn't feel great on my arms because it's really hard to like just relax your arms at the bottom. So that I went to feed up bench press. It's 130 kilos to 86 pounds. And the biggest thing for me here is to try to keep my shoulder blades pulled back. So when you're doing this feed up stuff, really trying to keep your shoulder blades back. I'm not doing a great job here, but doing sets of 10. So it's hard to keep that going, but just something I'm seeing. Still on day two, same outfit you see. Beltsquats, some doing these with a much narrower stance than I do. Most of the time because it's supposed to be close, close stance, beltsquats. This is actually a myel rep. I can't remember if it was my first or my second myel rep set, but do three 15 for set of 15. It's me somewhere close that eight to nine range, RPUIs. And then I do sets of four after that. So I did two sets of four. I believe one of the first one. And then one set of four and called it on the second one. Myel reps are tough. And for me, particularly because I'm really good at doing singles and low reps stuff, particularly now on my training. Myel reps just gas me. So, but cool shirt, all right. Okay, so this is day three, comp deadlift. This is 320 kilos, 705 pounds. So again, just starting here so that I can add, you know, about five kilos per week as I go into the meat, hit 340 before the meat. Little torque in the mirror. If you guys saw this on Instagram, that's kind of funny. And yeah, I'm happy the way this moved. Starting out over 700 pounds, rated RPA, maybe a little less than that. This is 280 kilos, 16 pounds. I'm going to do this for a set of four. So the prescription was a single at eight and four at eight. This is probably a little bit lighter than an eight. But, you know, again, being conservative on week one so I can build some momentum, manufacture momentum for sure. I don't know how to manufacture weight on the bar when you don't have it, but manufacture some momentum. I can start out a little lighter and then kind of at least give myself a few weeks to grow into a block. Second movement of the day, this is pin bench. This is 182.5 kilos, 402 I believe. And I think that actually moved a little bit better. Even though I hit the I need to move out further from the rack. I think that moved better than my comp bench. So that's reassuring. 165 kilos, 363 pounds. Yeah, this moved pretty good. Again, pin bench is not stronger than my regular bench. It just for whatever reason on this particular day felt better. And these are the GM presses. So another upper body slot, press dominant slot. And I use chains on there to make a little harder at the top just because I'm trying to focus on the tricep. So this is kind of like a hybrid skull crusher, bench press sort of thing. It's trying to really keep the elbows forward and tucked and not hit myself in the face. Did that for sets of 10? Then I did close stance hack squat. This is two 95. I believe these are my o-reps. No, I think these are just sets of 10. You can see my low back actually coming off the pad on some of these reps. And I think, I mean, I haven't ever had never used this particular hack squat machine before. So I did them again this week and again, really Q and myself to kind of push in the pad. Maybe a little bit more comfortable, but, you know, just trying to get some extra leg work with a little bit less back fatigue than another squat slot. These are fine. Squats, squats moving. So can't can't complain. Finally, on a day four, start out with high bar squat. Like the Halloween shirt and the contrast here. A lot of fast fall off. So the idea here was to just set a five and eight. This is 500 pounds. Yeah, haven't done high bar on a while. I think I could do a better job keeping my elbows down, particularly my right elbow. I don't know what it's doing all the way out there. I think the bar is just off centered a little bit if I see. But yeah, that was probably the less than an eight, maybe a seven. But again, conservative, build momentum. Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, you guys know the drill. This close grip bench says 350, 8 pounds or 162.5 kilos. Instead of five, you're like, why are you coming and bringing the bar down so fast? Well, I've been hesitant to actually bring the bar down fast on all the rest of my bench work. And that was my cue. That is bench go faster. And that was a pretty good place to start. Then I had RDLs for sets of 15. And I'm not gonna lie to you guys. My back was lit at this point. So it kept a pretty light 185 kilos, 407. Got some work in. Biggest thing people do wrong in RDLs, they keep their knees straight. It's not a stiff like a deadlift. It's kind of like just a three-quarter deadlift from the top. And yeah, so I come down as low as I can without touching the plates to the floor unless I'm programmed a different depth. But mid-shin levels would I kind of aim for? Keep my back flat as possible. And then squeeze my butt at top. And that's my training from six weeks out. This is training vlog 39. So let me know what you guys want to see on next week's vlog. Could be golf. Could be I'd recently sold both of my vehicles and picked up something new. So if you want to turn this into a car show, we can do that too. Let me know in the comments below. Let me know what you want to talk about training wise next week. And we'll have all the training footage and do this thing again. Thanks for tuning in. Here on the barbell medicine YouTube channel. Again, I'm Dr. Jordan Faganbaum. See you guys next time.

=== FILE: Two Minute Tuesday： Resistance Training for Injury Risk Reduction in Endurance Athletes [mA8U-otQlp8].txt ===

Hey everyone, welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel where we bring modern medicine to strengthen conditioning, a strength of conditioning to modern medicine, I'm your host, Dr. Jordan Fyginbob, and this is a two minute Tuesday. We haven't done one of these in a while. We have a very special article series and we just released the first part of it. This is by Dr. Derek Miles and he's got input from Dr. Austin Baraki, Dr. Michael Ray, and a handful of other professionals. This stuff is really good. We're going to talk about resistance training for endurance athletes. Part one is all about injury risk reduction using resistance training. This is a very cool topic. Hopefully I can incentivize you to read the long form article. I've put the link in the description below and I can give you some take home pearls that will be useful to you. Let's take a few minutes and talk about reducing injury risk using resistance training in endurance athletes. To begin the prevalence of injuries in endurance athletes is pretty high between 20 and about 80%. When we look at why injury rates are so high in this group, we should turn to the literature again. A recent systematic review demonstrated little correlation between biomechanical risk factors and injury. Now, the most common subgroup of endurance athletes to be injured are novices with about 17.8 injuries per thousand participation hours compared to more seasoned runners, which have about 7.7 injuries per thousand participation hours. The biggest risk factor for why novices tend to have more injuries than seasoned runners is due to a training history that is they don't really have this base of training that they've built up over time that they get to add stress to. The biggest predictor actually of injury risk in this population is the history of having an injury, which is unfortunate because that's a non-modifiable risk factor if you've had an injury before. Can't really go back and eliminate that. That being said, another big predictor of injury risk in this population would be lack of appropriate prior training and a rapid increase in workload. We see the same thing in resistance training. Now that we've talked about the prevalence and the risk factors for developing an injury, let's talk about some specific ones and see if there's anything we can do in order to prevent these. So first, let's talk about Patelofemeral Paincinder. Also known as runners, knee. It's one of the most common kinds of knee pain. Usually characterized by pain around the knee cap or under the knee cap, not lateralized to one side or another. Another common injury will be tendonopathy is this refers to a continuum of tendon changes that are all related to collagen. Including disruption, inflammation, and cellular responses. Next type of injury would be hamstring strains and this is usually due to high velocity running or occurs in the context of sprinting things like that. The next injury after that, it's very common in this endurance population would be bone stress injuries like shin splints or medial tibial stress syndrome and stress fractures. These tend to happen on a continuum in response to the bones inability to handle repetitive mechanical loading, which ultimately leads to structural fatigue. And overall, the data suggests that 50 to 75% of running related injuries are related to overuse. I.e. an increase in training stress that occurs to rapidly and the majority of these occur in the lower extremity around the knee, which again, if you think about what we just talked about, Patelofemeral Paincinder, tendonopathy, hamstring strains, bone stress injuries, particularly of the lower extremity. These are all again around the knee. As far as treatments at present, we have evidence on stretching, eccentric exercise, and heavy slow resistance training, which is effectively weightlifting. And we can talk about each one of those with respect to reducing injury risk in runners specifically. So let's talk about stretching first. And I know what you're thinking, Barbo Medicine, talking about stretching, it's not what you think. Right now, the most current, a cochlear review on interventions for preventing running related injuries. This is from 2011. Success that stretching, in fact, does not reduce the risk of injuries. Another systematic review of this topic from Laurason in 2014 suggested that stretching is not an effective way of reducing injury risk in runners. And also, that if they were to resistance training, instead, that reduced all injuries by a third and overuse injuries by a half. So potentially big improvement in injury risk reduction with resistance training. That being said, resistance training is fairly uncommon amongst endurance athletes. We look at the data from the National High School Stress Fracture Registry, suggest that 58% of these high school athletes didn't engage in any form of resistance training at all. And that's in the athletic population. In the general population, we see that 2018 physical activity guidelines for adults actually recommend resistance training for all adult Americans, at least twice per week. However, based on 2017 data from the National Health Interview Survey, only 23 and a half percent of all Americans are actually meeting this minimum guidelines. Those who do, however, have a 23% reduction in all cause mortality. So obviously, there's a huge benefit for engaging in resistance training in both athletic and the general population. However, it's likely being underutilized and even underdosed in both populations. Now that we've discussed some of these common injuries in runners, let's see how resistance training can actually reduce injury risk in this population. So for a Patelofemeral Pain Syndrome, remember that was the pain that is around the knee and under the kneecap. The most recent Cochrane Review for treatment of Patelofemeral Pain Syndrome showed that exercise therapy had consistent results for improving functional ability and reducing pain. For hamstring sprains, again, remember this occurs in the context, usually of high velocity running or sprinting. It's typically thought to be due to lack of hamstring e-centric strength. And so one way to develop that is by using the Nordic hamstring curl. Now, you guys may have noticed that I actually have made a Nordic hamstring video how to. That's because I'll rehab professionals and our coaches wanted a resource that they could use for their clients instead of referring people all over the internet. Put a link to that video in the description below so you guys can check that out. We actually have a lot of data on the Nordic hamstring curl as far as prevention of injury and we can calculate what's called a number needed to treat. Now, a number needed to treat effectively stands for how many people do you need to give the intervention to prevent the outcome that you're studying. And so the number needed to treat for the Nordic hamstring curl is three, meaning that you need to treat three people to do the Nordic hamstring protocol to prevent one hamstring strain. And this is really good for a lifestyle intervention number needed to treat standpoint. So if you consider the Mediterranean diet at preventing cardiovascular disease, the number needed to treat for that intervention is 61. And we're comparing that to three for the Nordic hamstring curl. So again, a lot of data, a lot of good potential benefits from improving the eccentric strength of the hamstrings with respect to decreasing hamstring sprain incidence. So the next injury we'll talk about would be bone stress injuries. This would be the stress fractures and the shin splints and similar injuries that we talked about earlier. So the data suggests that endurance athletes tend to have lower bone mineral densities as measured by dexascant compared to their peers who play other sports. And resistance training has been shown to increase bone mineral density. And this is one of the most potent interventions we can give people to actually build up their bone mineral density while they're younger, so that fractures and other issues stemming from low bone mineral density and old age don't crop up. The last thing we'll talk about from an injury perspective would be low back pain. Surle at al analyzed interventions for treatment of low back pain and found support for recommending strengthening exercises for the treatment of low back pain. However, this doesn't mean that having a stronger low back or bigger back muscles actually prevents low back pain. Rather, the actual engagement in resistance training is a good treatment for people who have low back pain to not only get them back to function but also decrease their low back pain. So now that we've talked about the prevalence of injury rates in endurance training, a few common ones and how resistance training can help, what about the risk of resistance training overall? Isn't it dangerous just to lift weights? So one of the best studies on this is from 2016, a systematic review by Q at al found that for most weight training sports, the average injury rate was about one to two injuries per athlete per year or two to four injuries per thousand participation hours. And this included things like bodybuilding, power lifting, weight lifting, strongman, highling games and even crossfit, although it is true that strongman and highland games tend to have higher injury rates. Somewhere in that five to six injuries per thousand participation hours. And when you compare that to the injury rates from recreational walking and cycling to work, which can reach as high as 1.5 injuries per thousand participation hours, maybe we should be more concerned about the risk of injury from not resistance training, than the actual risk of injury from resistance training. I think that resistance training offers a very potent intervention that is underutilized and again, underdosed likely in both the general and athletic populations. So hopefully I've convinced you to go read the long form article over on the boardalmedicine.com website. I've put the link in the description below.

=== FILE: What Types of Meat Are Good Sources of Protein？ [mAw4iZpb4aA].txt ===

Red meat, chicken, fish, or all frequently cited when discussing diet, what about pork or other poultry? Yeah, what about them? This is a kosher establishment, okay? We don't talk about pork. No. So, in general, with respect to red meat, sort of talk about pork, veal, obviously beef. There's actually a pretty expanded topic that includes, or expanded category that all includes those foods and others for red meat. With respect to chicken, fish, other lean protein sources, I'm cool with all of them. There's not really a lean protein source that I'm not like willing to give you the thumbs up on. My, the caveat that I'll give you is that for red meat, which again includes this sort of veal, beef, pork, uh, awful, is it awful? awful? Well, I'm sure. Yeah, whatever. All that stuff, I would recommend limiting that to three times per week, just based on the current guidelines for red meat intake, and we discussed that thoroughly in the article, The Science of Red Meat intake. So effectively, it'd be difficult to eat more red meat than that, more often, and also stay out of that 10% of total daily calories from saturated fat, uh, recommendation that we think is actually important. Okay? And if you want more information on that, read the science of red meat intake article, we go into the, into the weeds there on that stuff. Anything else? I don't think so. What's your favorite protein? I mean, there's only one answer. What do you want me to say, chicken? No, that's for all the answer. Let's stay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So mine's bacon. Okay. This is not a kosher challenge. I'm gonna do it. I forgot to.

=== FILE: What is Barbell Medicine？ [YDCQNMGElU8].txt ===

We have three different types of product offerings right now. We have a new one now from a self-improvement standpoint. We have a very good one. The final newest offering we have is a vegan protein. I am actually one of Barbell medicines first online clients. Through that coaching process went from just having had rotator cuff surgery to then becoming a competitive power lifter in the process. People come to us from all walks of life with all sorts of background experiences, with all sorts of problems. It ends up being a collaboration between client and coach to optimize their long-term kind of health and performance outcomes. On our team we have a great group of folks. We have myself, Austin Baraki, Lea Lutz, Joe Pemortins, Alno Strelia, Alan Thraw, Tom Campatelli, Hassan, Alex, Michael Ray, Derek Miles, Jess Griffith, Vanessa Berman. It's just a great group of people with a wide variety of different backgrounds and we're all working together to help you achieve your goals.

=== FILE: What type of ab work is recommended？ [yeafa2KVFfA].txt ===

All right. Suggestions for ISO metric core work. I've seen Planks mentioned in your content, but try Sips seem to be the limit on those for me. The reason why I prefer ISO metric sort of add direct ad training if you're going to do it for strength training purposes is that that's really their kind of role. In the big four that we tend to get asked the most questions about also this is Barbell Medicine, not like functional fitness medicine, kettlebell medicine was also taken. So like we have to like form our niche somewhere. So as Barbell Medicine, so in general the role of the abs during those movement tend to be isometric. So I like Planks. I like Paloff presses. I like Abwheel roll out, see there from kneeling Abwheel roll out. So if you can do it from your toes, that's cool. I also like sort of V-sit progressions. L-sit progressions are usually beyond most individuals, but so I think most folks can do Planks. You can't do those. Then the Paloff presses tend to be pretty pretty good. And I know somebody at home sitting on a couch saying Planks. I don't need a Plank. Doesn't do anything. I'll just low bar backs, squat my way to top to your high level of domino. Strength. Well guy at home, the recent research on this suggests that a Plank in a 6rm back squat have about the same amount of abdominal activation, which means that a Plank is like pretty good because it's not the same level of fatigue that you get from a 6rm squat. Right, 6 at RP-10 would be substantially fatiguing set for most individuals compared to just doing a 32nd Plank. So I'm not saying that you should do Planks instead of squats, but in addition to, be fine. The other hand, if you said, I don't want to do any additional direct ab training because I find it boring and whatever. That's fine too. Who would say something? Austin does a yearly GPP session. He's just living off previously developed Cardi-Restory Fitness from Swimming. And at some point he'll do it. It'll be by yearly. And then you'll just keep titating it. Keep titrating it up. Yeah, I mean, you're free to edit this out, but yeah, I don't do ab work. Yeah, I'm fine with this, buddy. Yeah, that's fine. I think though if people are asking about it, sure I'm happy with you doing more physical activity and I want it to be the correct fatigue stimulus to treat ratios. So fair. I.

=== FILE: What's The Deal With Seed Oils？ Hype vs. Science. [xwr7uQaVHzg].txt ===

Why is there an idea that olive oil is healthier than canola oil when replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated versus monounsaturated? I don't understand the question. It's kind of phrased strangely. Do you agree? Here's the other question though. Before I'm going to let you finish. I don't know that anyone's arguing over olive oil versus canola oil. There's a canola oil. Well, what I'm getting at is that I don't know that like people in academic academia are arguing about this. I think people who are like big seed oil like, you know, species. It's both serious. 100%. Those are the people who are irrelevant because they make up, you know, very small proportion, but very vocal mind you. So from a social learning perspective, our relevant, but as far as like a policy, opinion, you know, informed status level, they, you know, I'm not unconcerned with their opinions. So what I'm getting at is that actual professionals and experts in the field are not arguing about this. It's only like the seed oil conspiracy theorists. And they're like, I think you're probably right. Olive oil versus canola oil. Again, I'm not, like the olive oil, like, you know, big subsidiaries aren't like, you know, canola oil, you suck. And you know, canola oil is on there's like, no, all oil, we're perfectly help promoting. It's like that's not happening. Yeah. I think that there are, there's a fair amount of research, you know, this to, to lay the background, just as a reminder is that we talked about in the, let's hear what you say. I'll know. Oh, yes. Align. Number and then, like at the end of, sorry, but of course, our professors in LA want to give your an appeal, or maybe be able to be able to have anление in a scratch in Brady. And go home, say anything with your obligations,けど, or you, say, that one would have I, see, Bücher, were not equal to Donald Trump to try the going from that high intake to low shows a very consistent effect. We have plenty of evidence in the Mediterranean diet realm, and that Mediterranean diet is classically associated with foods like olive oil. And so that's probably where that general population idea or understanding comes from is associating Mediterranean diet as a healthy dietary pattern that has olive oil. There you go. But actually, right, when you look at the actual research on this, the actual evidence of these replacement nutrients in controlled trials, can oil oil actually shows further reduction in like your blood lipids blood cholesterol, even when it's replaced. And not just when it's replacing saturated fats, but when it's replacing olive oil. You actually see further reductions in your blood cholesterol levels and blood blood lipid parameters. This hasn't been tested necessarily head to head. These two like oils with everything else in the diet equivalent for actual cardiovascular events, like heart attacks and strokes and things like that. But there is for anybody who is interested in this topic and wants a reference, there's there's a large metanalysis on the topic titled the effects of cannola oil on cardiovascular risk factors. And that's that will be sufficient to find it where they look at cannola oil replacing various other nutrient, nutrient sources and showing the effects on things like blood lipids, blood cholesterol parameters, things like that, and it shows an improvement in risk. So yeah, there is not much controversy over this idea that polyunsaturated fatty acid sources, when replacing saturated fatty acid sources at high levels of intake show the most potent reduction in risk factors and actual cardiovascular risk. But the controversy does exist among people who are less informed on the topic. Yeah, so I just feel like you should see the movie. The other part is like if somebody's super concerned about their seed oil intake, I think that in general, that's like such a privileged level for like their dietary pattern and you know potential for health promoting behaviors. It's like, I don't care, dude, if you don't want to eat seed oils like do your thing provided you're not then subsequently engaging in dietary practices that like juggling butter in your coffee. Correct. Or like eating a carnivore diet that's super high in saturated fat. But if you like otherwise, or like nope, all oils, my jam but cannola oil won't touch and like do your thing. Okay. Yeah.

=== FILE: What's the Most Interesting Research You've Read Recently？ [OgPHWBt87eE].txt ===

Music Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum. We have Dr. Awesome Rocky in the studio live in the flesh. That's real. He's in town this week and we decided to answer some questions from the internet. Alright, what is the most interesting research you've read up on that is outside your normal scope? I will answer first while you ponder. Yeah. Okay. You're like, wait, what's on my Twitter? That's right. Yes. The most interesting research that I've read recently has to do with this gravity-ostat sort of mechanism with respect to like weight regulation. Okay. So they took these, I can't remember if they're mice or rats, but they put a weight inside of them. Like so do weight inside of them. Then saw what happened to their body weight independent of that weight. And these, they lost weight because there's like this gravity-ostat mechanism. It's thought to be produced by a hormone produced from the bones, the interacts with areas of the hypothalamus to say, yeah, you don't need eat as much because you weigh more now. Which I thought was super interesting. And then, funnily enough, I think I said this or like hinted that I read this paper on one of our podcasts or YouTube, something like that. A researcher who works in the lab where they did this DM'd me. Oh, that's awesome. Oh, yeah. I was like, what's going on? This is crazy. So that was so interesting. I remember reading the paper and I was like, what? Yeah. Turns out bones do stuff too. Yeah. I think the challenging thing about this question is that it seems like we have a fairly wide scope. Okay. That's right. Is there's like a bunch of medical stuff, a bunch of training stuff, health related things, what you're doing is technically, that's like a obesity paper, which we're sharing with others. But anyway, it's interesting, nonetheless. There are, there are a few. I think the one that I sent you recently that was a good paper. This isn't necessarily like a primary research, but a paper called obesity and responsibility. Is it time to rethink agency, strongly recommended read for folks, particularly those are in the fitness space, and tend to talk a lot about obesity and the extent to which it's a choice slash a personal success or failing. The extent to which people can manage it. It's super complicated and interesting. I research. Another one that came up just actually, I think it was yesterday earlier today. There's some new studies being done on gene editing for folks. And a sprint. Yeah. CRISPR and related technologies. And I think that that may end up being kind of the future of a lot of medical things. There's they took a group of, I think it was primates of some sort monkeys and did some gene editing a single dose kind of treatment. It was like an infusion that that affected this gene editing process that led to durable lowering of their blood lipid levels for like nine months or something like that. It didn't necessarily like skyrocket, but that was like the duration of follow-up. And so that something like that to the extent that it could be done feasibly in humans that it was safe and you know, didn't have like off-target effects that were problematic. Then that would effectively end up being kind of like, it's like a lipid vaccine. Kind of like a vaccine against cardiovascular disease. So to speak, which is the number one killer in the world is cardiovascular disease. And so durable long-term lowering of blood lipid levels with a single dose treatment would, you know, obviously there's an, there's a role for lifestyle, you know, things managing obesity, exercise nutrition, and managing blood lipid, but for some people for a lot of folks with genetic predispositions to elevated blood cholesterol levels. That's not necessarily enough to address their risk. And so in those situations, they end up needing to either take a daily medicine to address it or take, you know, like an injection or an infusion of some of the more advanced newer agents. But if you could do something like once and it had like safe lifelong durable effects, that'd be kind of huge. Yeah. Super interesting. This concept of gene editing, I think is not going to go away. It'll be pretty interesting to see where that goes in the future. Should workshop the name from like lipid vaccine? Or like, yeah, that's not going to play well. Yeah. I think one other thing that might be useful or at least a question that we get all the time. Yeah, I don't know how useful it is. Okay. So like, how do you get your research? So I know you're big on the on the Twitter's. I'm big on medical and academic Twitter. That's really all I use Twitter for. It's academicians, medical educators like myself and researchers. Yeah. Yeah. That's where you get most of your papers from. Yeah. There's a handful. There are handful that I like scour. So I go to the JCR, like every first of the month. I play a bone thugs and harmony. We go. We go. And then I go check it. JCR. I go to the ACSM's website for the medicine science and health and exercise. And I go to the frontiers website frontiers. Yeah. And I just kind of produce those. All the other stuff, either get inboxed to me based on like keyword searches that I have or like various medical newsletters or outlets that I've subscribed to. And that's enough. Like it's way more than stuff than I'll ever read. So I think my advice would be like pick one or two journals that you the content directly applies to you. Yeah. And then like if you saw happen to sign up for a newsletter or like a, you know, something like that, you'll get updates on and you'll have more than enough to read. I remember it was like in residency, uh, in turn, here they were like, you try to read one paper a day. You know what I was like? How that, do you understand how many papers that would be in the year? Very hard. Yeah. Like I would just be like how many papers you read this last quarter. Yeah. Well, I'm going to get to it. Yeah. All right.

=== FILE: When Should You Seek Treatment For Pain？ [gbT2RaI4B_w].txt ===

Is it ever, ever? This was an interesting word. Worthwhile, to seek treatment for chronic non-specific pain. Yes. Well, I think it's worth while to seek treatment for pain period. I assume this question probably means use of pain medications, but I'm not going to say that that means treatment. So, treatment would be seen a clinician being evaluated for potential causes of pain involving the patient, exploring this bio-psychocossocial model together, coming up with a shared management plan, and moving forward from there. So, I would say if a person has pain and they're concerned about it, see your medical professional. If it's from training, my caveat would be hopefully they're very familiar with pain science. And unfortunately, I don't feel confident that that is the case. I'm not going to try to throw shade at the medical establishment. It's just, look, I'm in the medical establishment, and I know that that's the case right now. So, I think, like our pain rehab specialist team, those guys are the best in the business, and that would be my general recommendation for somebody who's got pain from training. And they're like, I need some professional help. But I think if somebody has pain that concerns them, they're worried about our specific thing. They're like, oh, I have this low back pain and I'm worried it could be cancer. It sounds crazy, but that's not an unusual sort of report. Like, oh, yeah, my dad had the same sort of pain and he had cancer, and that's why I'm afraid. Yeah, seeking treatment, because you're going to be evaluated, and then treated based on fine names, and then, again, you as the complex patient, ideally, that would be a net benefit. I don't know that you need pain medications necessarily, which I assume is, again, what this question actually meant. I don't know what it implied. When I read the question, I said, I hope I didn't convey the message during my lecture, that it's not worth seeking help for pain related issues, because that's certainly not the case. Yeah, in fact, the opposite. Yeah, it's very common for people to need help. I think that we definitely provided you with information, education, hopefully empower you to self-manage many of your, like, common routine day to day aches and pains, type situations, but to the extent that you're dealing with something, a pain related issue, that maybe you don't fully know what to do, or you've tried what you've learned, and you can't make progress, then seeking out some consultation, evaluations, some assistance from somebody you trust, would be a fantastic idea. Now, we cannot guarantee that that person will do, will offer you, will recommend to you, unless it's somebody from our own rehab team. I've definitely seen patients who end up seeing a pain specialist or something, and bad things end up getting ruled out, and they get a prescription for an opioid. That probably wouldn't be the case that I would go with this myself. Nor would it be the way that our rehab team would go. So we have a resource that we can offer that we trust and recommend without reservation. But if you are struggling with an issue like this, then seeking help is definitely the way to go. Would recommend. Would recommend. Yes. All right. Thank you.
