Red meat, chicken, fish, or all frequently cited when discussing diet, what about pork or other poultry? Yeah, what about them? This is a kosher establishment, okay? We don't talk about pork. No. So, in general, with respect to red meat, sort of talk about pork, veal, obviously beef. There's actually a pretty expanded topic that includes, or expanded category that all includes those foods and others for red meat. With respect to chicken, fish, other lean protein sources, I'm cool with all of them. There's not really a lean protein source that I'm not like willing to give you the thumbs up on. My, the caveat that I'll give you is that for red meat, which again includes this sort of veal, beef, pork, uh, awful, is it awful? awful? Well, I'm sure. Yeah, whatever. All that stuff, I would recommend limiting that to three times per week, just based on the current guidelines for red meat intake, and we discussed that thoroughly in the article, The Science of Red Meat intake. So effectively, it'd be difficult to eat more red meat than that, more often, and also stay out of that 10% of total daily calories from saturated fat, uh, recommendation that we think is actually important. Okay? And if you want more information on that, read the science of red meat intake article, we go into the, into the weeds there on that stuff. Anything else? I don't think so. What's your favorite protein? I mean, there's only one answer. What do you want me to say, chicken? No, that's for all the answer. Let's stay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So mine's bacon. Okay. This is not a kosher challenge. I'm gonna do it. I forgot to.
