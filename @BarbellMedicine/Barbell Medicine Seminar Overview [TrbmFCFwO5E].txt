So we look at the media forward because the creative show from all walks of life.

So they can take away the safety of the team management luxury. There's a lot of that information out there and I'm glad I did this because I had learned more things than I had any idea. We have some people who come to our seminars that have never touched of our bill before and we teach them how to lift for the very first time on the seminar platform, which is pretty cool too. We take an approach where we educate people about these conditions from a biological standpoint, from a psychological standpoint and then also the social determinants that can influence people's health and disease outcomes. Our idea is to make the community a better place through these social change agents. Go through our seminar, you learn a lot, you get to go spread that into your community and we're trying to make the world a better place.
