I can't watch Hey guys, this is Dr. Michael Ray, I'm a Barbell Medicine Pain and Reheat clinician I'm coming to you today with a video about our latest blog that we just released regarding exercise and persistent pain Now in this blog I review an article by Plaskiedl titled Exercise and Doose Hyperalegesia, a meta analysis of exercise dosing for the treatment of chronic pain If you're not from the other type of olegesia, it's just a fancy way of saying decreased pain perception Now we know that this is an important issue, persistent pain is estimated to affect about 1.5 billion people worldwide today And to the main stage treatments that are usually recommended are both education to the patient about pain And then also go oriented activity interventions or exercise Exercise the difficult part about this discussion is we actually don't have a lot of solid data and good knowledge on what's an appropriate exercise dosage For patients dealing with persistent pain and in particularly specific pain states That's something that Plaski seeks to share a little bit more light on So Plaski took data from a 2017 Cocken review by Genon and reexamine that data to see if we could have DOSage effects with exercise on persistent pain states Now Genon from the 2017 Cocker interview had this to say about the totality of evidence for exercise and persistent pain states The evidence in this overview suggests that the broad spectrum of physical activity and exercise interventions assessed here A aerobic strength flexibility range of motion core or balance training programs as well as yoga, Pilates and Tai Chi All potentially beneficial though the evidence for benefit is low quality and inconsistent The most commonly reported adverse events for increased soreness or muscle pain which subsided after several weeks of the intervention Physical activity and exercise main proof pain severity as well as physical functioning quality of life So based on what Genon had to say from the 2017 Cocker review it appears There was not exactly an overwhelming amount of evidence will support for the recommendation of exercise or particular dosage for individuals for system pain And this new article by Plaski out of all the authors sought to understand how altering the dose of exercise might affect pain They say the primary objective is to test the hypothesis that the dose of exercise would impact the efficacy of exercise and physical movement based therapy To reduce persistent or chronic pain For this new review, Plaski out of the site to utilize randomized control trials from the 2017 Cocker review That included adult patients, 18 years of older chronic non-cancel pain defined as greater than three months in duration And it is a meta analysis reporting post intervention effect sizes for pain It was put in the final caveat was the included articles had to be published in a peer review journal Now the Cocker review originally included I want to say 21 papers 381 individual studies now Plaski ended up including 75 individual studies that met their inclusion criteria The pain states that they looked at were inclusive of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, low back pain, intermittent clodication, neck pain, spinal cord injury, and fatella for more pain syndrome Those were included pain states When they wanted to look at exercises effects on those pain states, they then had to classify the exercises that were utilized in these interventions And they did this kind of broadly, they classify the exercise modalities as either strength or resistance training, aerobic exercise, either land or water And then meditative movement therapy Now they further subdivided from these broad categories and to things like walking, jogging, pilates, tai chi Motor control exercises range of motion, flexibility exercises, aquatic aerobics, resistance training and land aerobic exercise They talk about that a lot more in the article which I definitely recommend reading So once the authors categorize the exercise interventions, they needed to then classify the exercise dosage For each exercise intervention to look at its effect on the pain states particularly So they classify the exercise dosage, based off of frequency intensity, time, and duration Frequency is defined as the number of bouts of exercise performed within a week So for example, if they performed the exercise intervention three times that week, then the frequency would be three Intensity was defined as absolute intensity in which they took metabolic equivalent units, nets And they multiplied that by the number of minutes performed in one week For time that was a cumulative amount of time and minutes the exercise was completed per week So if they completed it 60 minutes and those three times per week, that would be 180 minutes of time per week And finally duration was the weeks the exercises were implemented in the study So if the study went on for 12 weeks, then the duration was at 12 week intervention So again they just classify those in the frequency intensity, time, and duration For each exercise intervention and it looked at how the dosage effects particular pain-based states So overall the author states that they found that most of the studies included in this review Demonstrated some positive benefits of exercise up pain outcomes that was 69 of the 75 included studies Of which 30 were statistically significant So less than half Of the statistically non-significant studies 39 or 45 described positive training benefits of exercise Why only six studies reported worse pain with exercise? Now that last part of that statement is kind of intriguing When we see things like trending towards statistically significant That's more of a view to or a trickery where it's not really telling us anything meaningful But rather perhaps it's trying to force someone's bias of wanting to support exercise interventions for Efficacious ways to help people with persistent pain Trending towards statistically significant isn't very meaningful in this regard So the reason article about Pulaski at L just further demonstrates our lack of knowledge regarding a proper exercise dosage For those dealing with persistent pain We seem to know that it's beneficial but at what frequency intensity time and duration We're really not sure it's not like the national physical activity guidelines that we have in the US But we have some understanding of an appropriate baseline level of dosage to incur health benefits on the participant We're not quite there yet with persistent pain You know it has a lot of positive benefits We're just not sure what their proper dosage is Now this shouldn't be looked at as a net negative The way that we can see this as clinicians Is this means we can work collaboratively with patients Define with their appropriate dosage for them Based off of their goals Their ability to hear long-term and most likely that's going to be related to something that they enjoy And then finally looking at their prior training history all of those could culminate into getting together Some type of what I would prefer to call movement activity or cold erected movement activity That they can utilize to work through the issue to currently dealing with And then maybe if we can get by and long-term for all the other positive physiological adaptations from exercise Then we get something that they want to do long-term throughout life Even with the understanding that maybe their interest change It would be very easy as a member of the Barbel medicine team I personally very much enjoyed resistance training Specifically with the barbell But as someone came to me working through one of these pain-based states that they discussed in this paper And they weren't very into barbel training They knew that it wasn't something they're going to do in the future And they just didn't have any interest Then I'm probably going to find other exercises to incur the effect that I'm looking for That they think they could adapt to their lifelong term We know exercise adaptations on a spectrum Some of the ceases doing the exercise the minute they leave our clinic Then is probably going to not have a long-term benefit for them One final point that I do think is important to state here We do know that it's okay to allow patients dealing with persistent pain-based symptoms to exercise with pain And there may be some short-term benefits and allowing such an approach By decreasing connesia phobia Instilling self-efficacy and teaching the patient that pain doesn't equal tissue damage necessitating avoidance and protection Hert doesn't equal harm in the scenario Either way, hopefully the findings from this review Help stifle claims that one must do a particular exercise dosage Type frequency intensity time and duration to get themselves out of pain And rather reframe focus on defining the patient's preferred exercise dosage Based on activity history and individual goals
