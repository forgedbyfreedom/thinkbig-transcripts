I am actually one of Barbell medicines first online clients. Through that coaching process went from just having had rotator cuff surgery to then becoming a competitive power lifter in the process. People come to us from all walks of life with all sorts of background experiences, with all sorts of problems. It ends up being a collaboration between client and coach to optimize their long-term kind of health and performance outcomes. On our team we have a great group of folks. We have myself, Austin Baraki, Lea Lutz, Joe Pemortins, Alno Strelia, Alan Thraw, Tom Campatelli, Hassan, Alex, Michael Ray, Derek Miles, Jess Griffith, Vanessa Berman. It's just a great group of people with a wide variety of different backgrounds and we're all working together to help you achieve your goals.
