Music Welcome back to the Barbell Medicine YouTube channel. I'm Dr. Jordan Fagginbaum. We have Dr. Awesome Rocky in the studio live in the flesh. That's real. He's in town this week and we decided to answer some questions from the internet. This question is about how to approach training with hard bio-mechanical restrictions. So this individual recently found out through an x-ray that he's got a possible bone spur on the front of his ankle that severely limits his ankle mobility on that ankle. Basically he can't move his shan any further forward than vertical on that leg which makes squats a little weird sometimes and he has a tendency to twist at the bottom of the squat if he's not paying enough attention. So this is interesting because you're going to have people with certain anatomical variations, some people post operatively that won't be able to do certain exercises. So just having hard bio-mechanical restrictions, although I think when we say they can't do a particular exercise, we need to have some sort of standard that we're saying okay because you can't achieve this particular standard. Yeah I don't necessarily view it as you can't do this exercise so much as it is a position that you may be unable to achieve at that particular moment in time and then the nature of your restriction may be one that with time, with training, with you know, adaptation, you may be able to progress to achieve that position, other things, maybe a little more set in stone and you may not be necessarily able to just gradually progress towards a certain position which brings up some other questions which is I imagine what this is kind of getting at. Yeah so I think you know if this individual is having trouble squatting right and I would say all right well is the trouble the twist at the bottom of the squat because I don't necessarily view that as like a hard stop you can't squat. You might squat with a twist or with a lean or with you know some other sort of thing that may not be aesthetically pleasing based on what we've been cultured to believe. Condition rather to a perfect squat but that doesn't mean you can't squat and what do I mean by squat I mean you know simultaneous hip and knee flexion to this arbitrary death standard with a straight seven foot barbell. You know you remember watching I think it was cloak off who always pulls with a staggered stance he is like one foot that's like a couple inches in front of another and you know certain people on the internet would get pretty triggered by that but it's he's been doing it for decades and you're not super strong doing it without any apparent you know not to hit with no detriment sure being apparent from it. Yeah so I feel like if you can't do a particular exercise to your desired standard I would first then just evaluate that standard like why does that standard exist because if it's just kind of like an arbitrary constraint you're placing upon yourself due to a value system imparted on you from somebody else I don't know that that holds much water. Now if this if you can't in this case for example a squat if you you can't squat to anywhere near parallel without substantial variation in like your movement patterns so it's not repeatable without substantial difficulties having some sort of efficient movement pattern meaning like the bar path is all over the place for example you're losing balance or whatever and you can't develop any proficiency to mitigate those first two things the repeatability of the efficiency of the thing then I don't know that that movement is you know suitable for you I just call us the rep model of like exercise selection so is it repeatables it efficient right and then are you meeting the points of performance of that particular exercise whatever you decide them you know determine them to be so in this case I think this guy can probably squat if the twist was so bad again that it was not repeatable really sacrificing a ton of efficiency and he couldn't like you know if the twist was like throwing him forward onto his toes under heavier loads and that might be present a little more of an issue sure sure yeah and in that case I would move to a different training exercise to train the lower extremities if you can trap our deadlift sure if you can pull normally those are to you know ton of different movement patterns that would be fine leg press if you could split squat if you can do a higher box squat I mean you know there's so many different options a belt squat for example might be easier because you get to sit back a little further depending on the apparatus but effectively like at the end of the day you're trying to train the major muscle groups multiple times per week through ranges of motion that are useful and I know that what does that mean what does useful well it depends on what's your training for if you're trying to for a very specific sport athletic you know competition then the useful ranges of motion are kind of defined for you same thing with like movement velocities are like you know narrow down for you if you're just training for life or to be healthy well the world is your oyster you can pick a bunch of different exercise a bunch of different ranges of motion and so you want to train the major muscle groups multiple times per week through you know different ranges of motion likely and and different movement patterns and you know it's intentionally vague that way because it just depends what you want to do yeah I'm going to come at this maybe a little bit differently I think it's it's wise to look at this and say um what is the what is the standard that you're aiming to to meet with this movement I agree determining is the issue here that you're struggling to achieve depth because you want to go compete and meet sure well in that case how that you want to compete and meet if you want to compete and meet real bad then you need to make some other accommodations in your movement because you don't have the option to not squat to certain depth in your right and so if it's that important to you then we need to think about what are the potential interventions that we that we can use here right so one would be if we are very very confident that this restriction is due to this ankle spur which may not be sure you know it may it maybe one of those things where you experience some discomfort and we went looking we took a picture we found this thing we blamed it we do that all the time with back pain and other things but if we're fairly convinced that it's related to this um obviously that's more of an anatomic kind of structural limitation right so we say I don't care I want to find a way to squat to depth and meet well the first thing is it seems like he can squat with a vertical shin so that means you can probably take his stance pretty wide it goes out he can do like west side style you know pretty pretty vertical shin squat and that may just need to be his style given that limitation another option might be go and find the weightlifting shoes with the highest effective heel height so I think they're like the edetus lifestyles or something like that have a full like one inch heel height and then that you see how much you can get out of that in terms of that elevation in the heel may give you you know an extra inch of forward knee travel um uh in a squat or some combination maybe use both those heels and a wide stance squat and you may be able to do just fine with that if none of those things are getting you to where you want to be and you still say I insist I need to be able to squat well then you need to address the thing directly and if we're very convinced that it's there then shit go get surgery you cut the thing out you know um those are kind of the ways that I'd be looking at this is how can I modify the exercise of this and equipment that that I can use like the like the heel height with the shoes to to help me get there or do I need to go in an intervene on this thing and all of that is couched in I must be able to squat to a particular depth that I cannot otherwise do right now if comp competitive goals you know certain uh uh uh depth standards are not really in the picture then yeah I wouldn't get too concerned about this just based on the slight twist alone that doesn't spook me I used to twist actually a fair amount of my squat I'm working on that and in your garage years ago um but uh that wouldn't that wouldn't worry me um compared to compared to the other stuff yeah if the ex like I said if the technique is repeatable someone efficient and it's meaning all the points of performance that you have for that particular movement pattern the rep models if you I'm cool with it and if you happen to twist that's fine yeah and for talking about the from like a health promoting standpoint like all the stuff just went out the window I have zero of the service about that my I'm more concerned about your progression loading programming etc this exercise being inherently dangerous so what I'm doing yeah cool
