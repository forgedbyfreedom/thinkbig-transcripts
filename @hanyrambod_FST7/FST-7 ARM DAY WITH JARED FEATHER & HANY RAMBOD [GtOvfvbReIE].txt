If you die, Zee dies. We didn't do legs, this is arms. Oh my God. Oh my God. I have none other than the one and only Mr. Mohawk himself. The IFBB Pro men's classic physique. Competitor also known as Jared Feather, Jared. Hello. Welcome back to the Eveogen Gen. We've been trying to get you back in here for a while. You've been traveling all around the world. Literally one year. Yeah, like to date almost. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll be down there. I'm going to be, I'm just going to be in this part of Texas and I come and see you. And then all of a sudden, it's like, I'm back in Vegas. Or I was filming somewhere. We got a call. We got a film somewhere. Yeah, you have somewhere else. Yeah, somewhere else. So just briefly, want to just make sure that everybody kind of knows. It's been a crazy year for you. Right? You've been traveling all around the world. You got a lot of stuff going on. Obviously, right now, you just came off of your last show. And what is the planet at this point? At this time, to really take an off season. And then, honey, it's going to be all my ass about that for the last year and a half anyway. And just really take time to come down, go into a maintenance diet for good eight weeks. And then start to kind of ramp things up and go to a real true off season, doing everything properly, like, tracked off season, dedicate the body building for a little bit. Because I, you know, I never really have, like, you know, traveling all like this all the time. And it's, it's impossible. But I'm going to, you know, stay in one place for as long as I can. Do a real off season, probably not prep for a whole year. Put on the size that I need you on my back and bring up the other weak body parts, like, what we're doing today. Yeah, we're going to use some arms. Jared doesn't usually do arms. But the other thing we're going to also do is we're going to jump on a podcast. We're going to talk a little bit about the trials and tribulations when you know just a little too much. Because, you know, him, we got Dr. Mike, we got to talk about that. When you end up having a bit too much information, just like moms and dads that are out there that might be watching this, you end up just completely getting in the weeds on every little thing when your kid gets sick and you're like, he could have 10 different elements from a common cold all the way to cancer, God forbid. But at the end of the day, such same situation that happened with Jared Feather, I feel this last year, where you end up bouncing because you know so much and you feel like you can manipulate so much. But there's some things that you can't manipulate and you can't manipulate time. So what we're going to talk about, even a little bit during the workout too, we'll talk about it, but especially on the podcast is we're going to talk about the lack of knowing too much and how that can be a detriment to you as a bodybuilder, but it can help your clients tremendously. But when it comes to you, you don't end up being able to fulfill the plan that you should be doing because you're too busy trying to execute everybody else's plan while you're trying to just kind of push yourself a little too much when you're in the middle of competing. So oftentimes you just gotta be, and that's why I say coaches, higher coaches, like you just gotta be lazy to fare sometimes, like you just gotta take the freaking hands off the wheel. And I'm excited to do that a little bit actually. Yeah. So we're going to talk a lot about that too, but we're going to go ahead and get this thing started. We're going to go ahead, little EDP RTD, and then hit a little bit of the Penauda standing total arm. And we're going to have a really good time hitting biceps and triceps talking about philosophies while we train. You ready? No, no, no, it's just right. So today we're going to go ahead and put Jared through one of my FSC7 arm workouts. Again, he's not used to doing bice and tries together. We're just kind of warming it up on the standing bicep curl machine, the Penauda. How's that feel? I love this thing. Yeah. Yeah, we have it a couple of gyms and maybe it's gotten popular now. Where you can find any Penauda now, officer, and it's popping up everywhere. It's great. Might add something to do with them. Yeah, a little bit. Let's go ahead. Let's say me and you have, I know you back in the day had really good pressing strength and good triceps. Yeah. So you're probably similar to me. We're starting with biceps. Yeah. But as somebody has weak triceps, you'd probably tell them to start with 100%. Yeah. And I like to lift a little bit. Do a little bit of a different variant. Many people out there will always stick to one type of curl throughout the single range emotion for that particular exercise. And what I like to do is kind of feel it through where if I want to get create a little bit more tension at the very top or lift the elbows, even at the last part of the actual exercise, being able to just lift because I kind of go by feel. Be able to say, okay, let's just lift the elbows on this last three reps of that given set. I don't feel like anybody needs to. If you want to, it's okay. But if you need to kind of fit within certain boundaries, right? So as you're doing a curl, if you feel like you're bringing your elbows up and getting a little bit more of that upper bicep tendon, you're kind of going in there, by all means. Yeah. I mean, that's part of the action of the bicep is to lift that front though, like that. Yeah, but you know what I mean to that. Yeah, but a lot of people also think that it's really just, there's only one way of doing something. There's so many different ways of skin and that. And that's the thing, like you said, with one variation. So like this is a pretty decent variation. Yeah. And I assume we'll do another one bicep exercise after this. That's probably more of a stretch-based variation. Yeah. Like whether that's a cable curl behind the back. Yeah, like I like doing that too. Yeah. I love those. There's a couple of different, you know, options on some panodic equipment too, that we can do. But I do. That's one of my favorite ones. I was having C-bumb doing those a lot behind the back cable. Yeah. Yeah. Really. So then again, same thing, lifting at the very top just to get a little bit more, even to get a little with that front belt as your, there you go. Good. Good. Good. Control that eccentric now. There you go. Good. So, that's it. Four reps there. That way we'll probably put me in the 15 to 20 range. What do you want? 10 to 15? Yeah. So a little heavier. Yeah. So I was what three or four. Yeah. So on the next one, I'll go to my working load, it'll probably tend to 15 pounds heavier. Right. And I'll do like one or two reps. Okay. And then that kind of like primes the nervous system with all the, sure. So then when I go into my working sets, I'm not, because you'll probably hear, we might have talked about this last time. People often say, oh man, set two, feel so much better. Mm-hmm. Especially with like squatting pattern. Yeah. Yeah. Because they didn't go in prime the nervous system for the working load. They'll go like 315, 415 and go right into a set. Right. If they were just done 415 or a couple, backed off, take your breath, get two minutes later, hit the set. Right. Then that makes the first set feel the best. Right. Right. So when we used to do that 25, 30 years ago, we would call that basically a set to settle your system. Right. So you're trying to sell your body. You're trying to make sure that your body's understanding of very heavy working load, especially like you said, squats going in there and doing three to five reps. And then turning around and priming the pump, saying, okay, my knees, my hips, everything you're settled, it knows what's about to come up. Now let's go ahead and let's start doing that in the higher rep range. Yep. Yeah. And people do that a lot to the, I say anywhere from like, in sports science with like actual potential, you have some stuff for sport athletes. It's like 5 to 10% over the working load. Uh-huh. Because most of that's like power based stuff. Right. So even sometimes with like a leg press, let's say, or bench press, I might, let's say working load is 315. I'll go to like 335. I'll hit a double. Okay. I'll come back down with your 15 and 2 to 3 minutes later, hit my working sets. Gotcha. Yeah. So it just feels way lighter. Yeah. And you can actually do more stuff with it. Right. We'll trick. All the shit we teach is like, yeah, the guys did this. They didn't name to it. Exactly. And then, exactly. So all this, all this dumb shit, all these names, mess of cycles, I'm like, do, everybody trains like this. Yeah. Everybody's putting their pants in names to a lot of things that we've been doing for a long time. And a lot of those theories just end up being, some of the ages even, bro science, and then they become proven a little bit later. 100%. Yeah. All the time. Especially in the end of all of the room. Yeah. I'm like, yeah. Can't do studies about that. So. Sorry. It's working set one for you. Let's go. All right. Come on, honey. Yeah. Yep. Oh, that felt good. It's like I'm trying to micle over those, like, and then the tank. Yeah. That's good. That's good. That's actually feels good. It feels good. It feels good. It feels a little stim in you. It feels like, okay, let's do this. You know? Yeah. What about you in terms of sleep and rats right now? Like, what are you doing? I don't see how I can nullify it until 1 a.m. I took a 3 a.m flight here, so. So it's very little. Let's go. Three. Good. Good. There you go. Good control. You notice he's controlling that eccentric? There. Good job, Jared. Is driving up? It's time to get huge, brother. Let's go. Good. Good control. Really good control. Drive it up. Control. There you go. Keep going. Keep going. Good. You got two more in you. Let's go. Easy. Up. Good work. Come on. Good. Keep going now. That's super easy. Drive. Drive. Good. Another one. Good. Not even helping you, yeah, brother. Let's go. Go. Again. Go. Go. Up. Up. Slow. Slow. Good job. That's it. Ooh. Here's my glasses. You're not lying either. Ooh. Good job. It's good job. All right. I got one more on this. As I see after this. Yeah. We're going to do is we're going to another. I would really like to see what you think of that. Yeah, pernata. Upright curl. Yeah. Yeah. See how you know, would do a couple sets on there and then finish on the stretch. We'll do an FSC 7 set on there in between with some flex. Two sets of each. Yes. Yeah. Perfect. That's it. Six total working sets of biases. That's about what I would cap. Yeah. Oh, bicep session. Which is. You know, you think about doing that four times a week. There you go. Yeah. I think you can get away with twice. That's one of those things. For sure. Where's we going to write this on the podcast. Yeah. It's about the volume and sensitivity relationship. Yeah. People can put it. If you can just understand that and love your training, you will make progress. It doesn't matter if it's while I enjoy the heavy fucking loads. And I'm taking every set of failure. And I'm all going to do six sets of body part per week. If you're having fun and you enjoy that shit and you have a good technique. You're going to make progress. I'm not going to tell you or not. Do I think a little more volume is probably better? Absolutely. Or if you hate it, absolutely fucking not. No. Absolutely. You know, even like right now, I want to do something where I'm going to be in that eight to ten rep range. Yeah. That's it. And I want to go as heavy as I can. And I want to really feel that eccentric like that weight. Yeah. So that it can really work on getting my strength up. So that when I can do volume, I'm doing it with heavier weight. Let's just go a little heavier. Let's see how that. Yeah. So much arguing online about all this shit. And it's just like that is the 90% volume intensity relationship. Two, three, good money. Oh, five. Come on. Okay. Three. One. There you go. You throw shoulders back. Stretch them by yourself. Yeah. There you go. All the way. All the way. My man. Come on. More. Come on. Make sure that's big stretch. Make sure that's big stretch. There you go. Yeah. Good stuff. Good stuff. Woo. All right. All right. Is this your second working? Yep. Perfect. So whatever weight you want, then we'll move that up just a tiny bit. Just because you're just about a half inch taller than me. After. Me and Mike are about same height, right? Five, six. Yeah. Here you're like basically the same height. How to. Just much better. I'll give you. Yeah. You're better looking. That's it. You heard that here. Mike. Much better looking you. That's it. Got the model, looks. Yeah. Jared trains the better looking Mike. That's it. Yeah. The Persian Professor. I love you. I love it. We got this. Is Rayleigh Professor? I love it. And we got the Persian Professor. Oh, let's go. Let's go. All right. Very good. Good. Notice how Jared likes to really lean back. What he's trying to do is he's really trying to maximize the stretch on his biceps. Keep the shoulders back out of play. Good. Good. Excellent. Keep it going. Come on. It's the last set on this. Keep moving. Keep it moving. Come on, Jared. Good. These are the winning reps right here. These are the ones that count the most. Right here. Another. Another. Up. Up. Up. Up. Now nice and slow. That's it. Nice and slow. Excellent job. Beautiful. Good. Good. That's it. Good. Good. That's it. Let's do it. No, let's do it. Another set. That's another exercise. And then we'll come in and we'll do some FSC7 flex sets. Oh, even the C2 one? Yeah. Yeah, you just said, I use it a cult fitness all the time. Which one do you have? They have the incline. No, they have the C-dits. I believe. They're upright. Yeah. Okay. Which one do you want to try? No, they have this one because we don't have armpits. Let's try this one. Yeah, let's try this one then. So you like to do it singular both. I like to do both. I like to do both. I like to do both. I like to do both. The only thing I usually do like an eye isolated, colon is the preacher. So I can shift my body in this direction. Yeah. If you have a big asymmetry, then I feel like being able to do one, especially doing some extra reps. And then maybe going back and doing next or set. Yeah. We're just the weaker arm. I feel like it's really, I think the issue with the preacher girl though is just a put your elbows here. Uh-huh. So your forearms out of line. So if you can just do a single on the preacher, you can turn it. Yeah, you can turn it. Four-sure elbow with this direction. And you can supernatment the hell out of it. My favorite one to do an isolation on them. These, this is a phenomenal exercise. I love these. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So now again, you saw me do about six reps. These are again, what I call a fewer sets. You're just feeling out the warm up because you're already warm but you're just trying to get a new range of motion. There's a new new machine. Usually anywhere from four to six reps, you feel it out. Yep. Oh. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Come on. Oh yeah. All right. You're not going to be a little trained for that couple of days but it's alright. So what happens when you start to work out with somebody who knows what they're doing? Because then you're like, okay, I got to step it up a little bit. Yeah. You're going to be a little sore. Yeah. It's okay. Yeah. Put some weight on there, big boy. Come on. Let's go. Boom. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's it. Good breath. That's it. Good. Again. Good. Come on. Come on, Chair. All the way. Good. Again. One more. Come on. Oh. Oh, it's slow. Slow. Good. Again. Drive it. Easy. Easy. Keep it moving. Easy. That was a lightweight. Again. You got this. Get him to grow. Get him to grow. Slow. Good stretch. Good job. See, I was a much better spotter than he was. He didn't give me all that extra. He just want me to get his biggest him. That's what it is. I'm holding you back. I'm not going to make a comeback. This is why Mike didn't win his last show. No, he didn't come back. Was it because of anything else? This is what happened. He always wants to be the biggest. Was the rip dude in the gym? Yes. I figured out the conspiracy. I thought when I was doing Nick, I just trained him. I don't train with him. Yeah. That's right. I'm going to clean up. I'm not going to win that one. That's it. That's it. Oh my god. That's it. Yeah. Very good. If we figured out the reason why Mike didn't win his show. That's a Jared's favorite. That's right. Let's start the rumors, man. That's right. I'm sorry. Watch and Mike get shit. Yeah. Directed toward my flash and mo walk or whatever. I'll put on for 55. So I think that was good for me. That was good. That was good. That was good for me. All right. So I said on this. Get this work in here. Quick stretches. There you go. Hell yeah. Come on. Come on. Yep. Come on honey. Go chill chill chill chill. Let's go. Yep. Yep. Yep. Nice to meet you. What? Walk if you're a horse. Come on. Yep. Yep. Beautiful man. All the way. Control all the way. Hell yeah. Ooh. You're gonna do your own flex sets. You're not gonna do that. I'm not that good yet. Wait till I get a little bit better. Then I'll start doing doing sort of doing some. Flies. I don't feel like worthy enough to. Flex yet. But I'm definitely not. That's it. That's it. On stage to. I was right at the cap to about 12 to 19 when I got on stage. Where do you feel about that morning at 2.17 so far has been your best look to date? Uh. I'll say. Nationals, Dallas, Europe, 2021 and our GV last year and this year. Mm-hmm. We're all very comparable and different ways. And I do for the love of the shit. So yeah. It is what it is man. I always have a good time. Good. Good. Good. There you go. Good job, Jared. Good. If you notice he's also using his wrist to even stretch a little further, he's going into the forearm on the very bottom portion right there. And as he comes back up, full contraction, very top. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Again. Uh. Good. Good. Good. Good. Just one more. One more. Good. Uh. Good. Good. I'm just helping you. I'm just enough barely touching. Nice and slow. Slow. Slow. Good. Good job. Excellent. Good. All right. Good job on that. There you go. Now let's see what you look like. Get a little body fat on you. No for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Let's hit a front double and let's see what that looks like. Okay. Sit your legs. Okay. Good. There you go. Good. All right. And what we can do is we want to supinate the wrists a little bit more there. You go much better. Good. Bring your fingers in. Talk to fingers in. Good. And then turn that wrist. That's it. That's it. Good. Good. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Good job. There you go. Oh, it's done. There you go. Oh, yes. Your arms go look like they just got pumped up with it. The bicycle pump of the S nice. That's so. That's not of supination as rough man. Yeah. Yeah. That's what's going to get you really, really sore. Yeah. And that's going to help you get the peak. I mean, peaks are 100% genetic. But you can accentuate what you do have by making sure that you really accentuate the supination of the wrist. We do actually. We're seeing a lot of growth. Specifically occurring because of that really deep. Eastern trick. So for people who do struggle. Look what happened to Irres, right? Exactly. You know. And he probably just wanted it to. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure I don't know anybody else that was doing it. That was a top guy versus the guy he competed against the prior week in Italy. A quinted it again. You're ready to be quinting. Yeah. But he looked crazy earlier. I was watching it. Definitely need to up the weight. That was. You're going to probably need a couple couple more plates on there. Oh, here we go. Good. How's that feel? I'm going to overtrain my biceps. Oh, you're going to be fine. You're just going to. Yeah. You mean today we're in general. Today because I haven't trained for a week, right? Yeah. So this is a lot of volume jumping right back here. That's good. That's good. You're just going to have to just rub some anabolic. I'll be all going to be there. I'll be there. It's a little dull cam in me. No cam. But a lecture KSM66. I just got mine in the mail too. Did you? Yeah. Awesome. Have you slept on it yet? I took it a couple nights ago. But I was already up until like 11. Got you. So I took it and I laid there till 1230. Walk up to ours later. Walk up to ours later. Yeah. That was my own fault. I should've taken it like seven. Yeah. Went about it nine. Yeah. That was a good idea. I was going to take it seven to eight. Yeah. And then house kind of chilly out on it. I want to go back. Could also gone to supposed to be before the other sleep shit. Right. Take a meltdown in an hour after that and all other stuff. And meltdown makes me groggy. Yeah. So I don't always take it. But the effort gone to I can wake up at yeah. It just fresh for me. You know. So I get up much more. My HR visa better. Yeah. On Ashwood Gonda. Then I don't meltdown in as well. Yeah. If you can take the effort gone to. It's going to be clearly come off that phone. Like you said earlier. That's that's the hard part getting up your phone. And just chill and watch you know. Dem light room. Maybe it's in TV with the family. Yeah. And chill out. It'll put your ass to sleep. That's for sure. There you go. Yeah. You're going to have your. Yeah. Definitely got to go a little heavier for me. Because I thought it was going to be too heavy for the. The 80 it was too heavy. So I should have done 77. So I'll do 77 next set. I like these a lot for teaching people. Because when you get somebody who is used to. You get your entire guys all the time. You coach so many young guys. I'm going to do 77. I'm going to do 77. I like these a lot for teaching people. Because when you get somebody who is used to. You get your entire guys all the time. You coach so many young guys. And most of them like eagle lift first. Five years in the training. Six years in the training. It's all just moving. Show around. All right. Oh, I got a pump. Let's go. If you TV. It's training. Let's go. That's it. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Focus. Hold there. Excellent. Much bigger, bro. Definitely. You're later. Yeah. It's good. Good. Control. Good. Good. Good. Excellent. Good. Good. Good. Good. Again. Good. You got two. You got two. Come on, Jared. Big arms. Big arms. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Good. Good. That's it. Good job. Someone can go ahead and get into the DMs. Somebody can help him. Shampoo his hair. Yeah. I need a little. I need a little. I need a little. I need a little. I need a little. I need a little. I need a little. And then that's it. I'm going to hotel hotel where it doesn't need DM me. That's it. I'll be gone by the time. We're going to put it up on IG. Put it on story. What a come watch. Good. Yes. Come over. I want you my ass wipe too. Good point. Holy sh. It's like when I trained Jay for the first time when we were getting ready for the 2009 Mr. Olympia. And then the first body part he flipped San Jose was arms. And we were doing an F.S.D.7 arm workout. And I had him flexing and we were doing spyar curls. And then he must throw up doing spyar. He's like never trained arms as hard as I was. Yeah man. It was just like good times man. It was a good time. There you go Jay Kelly. One of the biggest of all time on record saying he's never taken a set the failure. Yeah. That's it. She got to go close to failure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's a volume guy. 100%. Yeah. He did the right. Like I said, the volume to relative effort and intensity of the load relationship is he had an ailed man. Yeah. He knew he wasn't taking all of the sets of failure. So he did more volume because he could. Yeah. And not everybody could do yeah. But he training. Right. They didn't have the joint. They didn't have the overall muscle torque. And sometimes it's not even as fun for most people. Ronnie fucking loved it. Ronnie loved it. And if you try to do that with Phil I'd barium. He would have tore his rotator. And tore his voice. He was a basketball player with a versus Ronnie was a linebacker. Right. And a piloter. And a powerlifter. Right. And your resiliency. It's not something people talk about often. Well, that's part of genetics. Just that funny. There you go. Get that control. Come on. Yeah. Big stretch. Come on. Don't let it control you in the end range. You control it. Yeah. Hell yeah. I feel it's out of stone. Come on. Let's go. Beautiful. Let's go. One more. Good stuff. Good stuff. Yep. Yep. You guys don't realize how much he's grown in the last year. I mean, he's put on a good almost way. That'd be about eight to ten pounds. Yeah. Yeah. He's in between eight to ten pounds. And there's ways of doing eight to ten pounds of just mass and versus quality tissue. And he's put on quality tissue. That's why he's going to look really, really good when he just gets a little bit of muscle ratio. Yeah. Let's go. Good. Very good. Good job. Good. Good job. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Come on, Jerry. Excellent. Drive it. Good. Drive. Good, good, go, go, go. Good. This is it. This is it. Good. Control, control, good. Again, again, again, Jared, again, Jared, all the way. Let's go. I could. Begarm's on stage. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Good job, relax. Slow, slow, tension. Keep that tension up. Good job. Beautiful. Textbook, guys. Textbook. Wow. That's good. Let's go ahead and you want to start on. Yeah. On, you like this part? Yeah, this part is not bad. We can try that. See how you like it? I think it's really easy on the wrist. So I do a lot like Jay did. Uh-huh. I think it's the better stretch for the tries. Do you like them out here? I like you. I like you less stretch out here. I think this is actually my stretch. I like them here. And then what I do is, I create a variability where, if I want to come up, I'll do a couple of jobs. Exactly. Right. So I'll go into almost like a pseudo-scope pressure from there. And then if I wanted to create more stretch because then I can drive up here and go down. And then, but again, there's different versions of this. I think that's what people will call a mechanical drop set where you go from the hardest positions to the easiest. Right. So like if this variation where I'm stretching behind the body because this is way harder. Yeah. If it's whenever I fail here, I could like do what you said. Yeah, bring it up. And there you go, boom. Because that's easy. That's easy. Right. Exactly. Yeah, that's a good intensity technique. I like that. Let's go. Let's go. Let's start off. A little boy. Let's go, buddy. Come on. So I'm going to run through the warmer processes to the try. Let's go. Good. There you go. What I'll use on this. See how that feels? I haven't done these in forever. And again, I did shoulders yesterday. What have you for me on that shoulder press on the panata press? Yeah. Yeah. And I ended up getting a couple of really good working sets of 15 and then eventually down to 12. And just start to feeling really, really good. And then eventually like to get back into Smith machine and you know, to shoulder press on that Smith machine and try to get back to two to two and a half plates eventually. Would you, so this is a good question for you. Because we talk about frequency right? Yep. Would you because of that today? Yep. Reduce your tricep volume 100%. 100%. I feel my triceps. And so I still want to hit them because I didn't isolate them. But you do have to go off a feel, right? So what you want to do, a pump sticking, huh? Arms and plate of... Yes, it. Let's go. Probably the sushi I have before. Yeah. Good. There you go. Good. Good. Got a pump with one set. Drive. Good. Again. Good. Drive. Excellent. Come on, Jared. Good. Good. One more. You got one more. I'll help you. Let's go. Let's go. Big triceps on stage. Push. Easy. Easy. Easy. One more. One more. You got this. Come on. Come on. Come on. You got this. Come on, Jared. Come on, Jared. Show me. Show me. Oh, yes. Push down. Push down. Push down. Push. Push. Good. Right there. Oh, good job. You seem to come in hang out for a week. Yeah. Okay. 20 pounds. That's like Marcus Rul. He's taking that toilet. What's that? He's taking that toilet. Oh, yes. That's for sure. He's going that way. 100% Oh, Marcus. One time I was at a show like 25 years ago. And I saw Marcus Rul pull out. I think it was the Olympia. And he comes over and he has this big massive guy. And he's got this little cigarette. Oh, my God. With a little cigarette. And I was like, is that Marcus Rul? It's a European thing, right? Of course. Your penis, you know, especially back then you'd see him. And he's like, you know, we're going to shoot him and make a team of intellectual relax. I asked him show today. But there's a lot of guys that were doing it in Europe. And I was like, and you close your wake it out here. We've never seen the States, right? I was like, big old guy with this little cigarette. It was like, can we? Yeah. You know, my God. I don't know how you've got that to his mouth. This peaked for ridiculous. His whole body was ridiculous. He's not like the guys that couldn't really do this. No, not just said. It's far more than smash into his. Just go honey. Yeah, next piece. Come on. There you go. Oh, I'm so troll. Nice stretch. Here you go. Yep. Yeah, I thought drops. I didn't love it. It's like a bitch. Let's go. Oh, yeah, come on. Oh, nice. All right, guys. So when in use of standard push down technique, then went over to four facing almost like a, you know, a pseudo skull crusher that you stretch a little bit more that try set. Feel like you go close to failure with one range of motion and then going right to another one and then drop set that set fashion and try that home. I think you'll really enjoy it. So it changes in a load you just go into a more mechanically out of the position. One hundred percent. Yeah. The mountains are covered with a little too much snow in the spring. It'll dry up and snow. Snow. Oh, it's a way so you could see there. That's a phenomenal analogy. I love that analogy. I'm going to use that. The peaks of the Himalayas. Mine's more like some red rockers. Right. Right. Right. Just, yeah, just outside of Las Vegas. Yeah. A little bit of snow and then a little dusting of snow during the winter months. That's it. It's just like mountains. Your body was meant to. And your mirror, mirror the mountains. I'm off there. Yep. How's that way? Oh, I think it'll be good. Oh, good. Good. This is it. Last working set on this. Come on, buddy. Oh, good. Good. Good. That's it. Good. Super solid pump. Good. Okay. Push push push push push push push. You got one more. Come on, Jerry. Come on. Good. Make the reps count. Good. What? Let's go all in front. Let's go on front. Let's go. There you go. Good. That's it. Good. Bend the elbows. Stretch up. That's it. Good. Feel the burn. Feel that stretch and burn. Good. Keep it going. Keep it going. Good. Go again. Again. Good. Good. Go. Good stretch stretch. Up. Good. One more. One more. Stretch up. Drive. Give me two partials. Up. Off the top. Go up. Stretch. Go halfway down. Go. One more. Up. That's it. Fucker. Ha ha. Told you you should have chose legs. Well, having more fun. I'm stuck, man. That's awesome. That's honestly. Oh my god. I really firmly believe that you have to go through these types of workouts. And I call these workouts break through workouts because what they do is they reset your mentality of that body part. When you actually have a really good workout, it really takes you to another place. So you actually start to enjoy training those body parts that you weren't enjoying. Those break through workouts are going to retrain and remap your brain into thinking, I'm going to enjoy this workout. Let me do it. And that's what's going to help you grow because if you are constantly going, God, I really don't like that one that body part. You will not grow with that body part 100% guarantee. But if you can turn around and put a little bit more intent, put the phone away. Turn around. Go with intent. Make sure that you really feel the muscle group that you're trying to focus on. You will 100% be able to break those pothos. And use that just to try to like press out from this angle. And if that does bother shoulders or elbows or whatever, you can always do the neutral. I don't think there's too much of a difference in the activation of the choice up. No. It feels good. Actually, I think the fact that I did shoulders just actually actually helps a little bit, because it's not as tight. Good. Raise the weight for the next set. Yeah, it's just a nice variation for it, especially for like you said, short arm guys might have trouble getting those positions. You can pull this thing as far forward as you need to. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Good. Let's go, Joe. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah, I'm so not used for the range of motion that it's like, you started getting the shakes and it's good because it feels different. Yeah, completely. You know, you get that deep stretch in the triceps now too. Yeah, there's not like the long rope for these, because it's one implement and it feels a lot more stable. Okay. Because you're controlling two months at one time, so it's kind of like a similar like a tricep push donor, right? Like that two of these and you're trying to do them. It's going to be different. But it's not terrible. That's pretty light. Why should you do like six? And then what we'll do is we'll raise the weight. Good. Got you. Let's go. Go. Where did I have it on before? 30. So let's go 40. Let's see how that feels. Jacob, we could do 140 on these. Oh, let's do this. Let's see how it feels. Yeah, it leaves that position. You're not used to. Yeah, very much. Yeah. Feels good though. Yeah, good. I'll all yourself to feel it. Really control that. There you go. One. One. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. One. Ooh. I don't feel. Burning. Good. So what happens when you're not used to doing arms? Train arms. Feels good though. All right. Good. Two. You're right. Five. Five. All the stabilizers are kicking in. Yeah. So it feels good. But you can really feel that you got to be able to really work harder. Then it feels a fixed plane machine. Good. Good. Keep going. Come on. Good. Nice stretch. Nice stretch back. Good. Good. Good. Come on, Jared. Come on. Good. Two. Two. Two. Two. Come on. Up. One more. Right. Good job. Slow. Slow. Feel the burn. Burn. Good job. Good. Woo. Yeah. It's. It's going to be one of those things. You know, I'm going to be locking up tonight. You know, I'm going to wash my hair later. I'm going to be. Do you ever get that still? Yeah. Yeah. When you have a really good session, then your arms start to, like, start to, Yeah. You get all of the muscle fibers are just all the way to the end of the night. And then all of a sudden you're just like, oh man, I got to bring my head to the toothbrush and do this. So I can't like do this. I was having a huge, huge issue doing that when I was competing because. Just going. Oh, feels good. There you go. Don't let the position control you. You got to control it right there. Yeah. We need to get you to the position there. Yeah, honey. Okay. Enough. Go on. Come on. Two. Two. Two. Control. One. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it likes it. Whoo. All right, guys. So we're going to go give you a little F.S.E.7 tip here. So normally what we'd be doing, even if you're in the off seasons, especially when you're getting ready for shows, is being able to do those F.S.E.7 flex sets.
