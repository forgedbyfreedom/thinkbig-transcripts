All right guys, I am here with none other than Anton, Classic, the Z-Pro just coming off your Pro-DaveU and Pittsburgh. That was what about a month ago? Or it's been, I think, six, eight weeks. Almost two months. Almost two months. He did his Pro-DaveU placing a very, very respectable six in an amazing lineup. How are you feeling? I feel excited to finally step into the Pro League. I kind of jumped into the Pro show, already kind of dipped my toes and now I'm excited to fully dive in the waters and become the professional bodybuilder, you know, meant to become. So I'm really excited for the career ahead of me and, you know, I'm glad to have this opportunity to train with you and you know, pick up some tips for the future. Sure. Sure. No. For a little while in Dallas area, so you want to come by and say, awesome, you know, always bringing in not just amateur's, but pros from all over the world that come in and have an a great time. So chest is something that we're going to focus on. He's coming away with a little bit of a quad strain, but getting better at that. So maybe next time, so we're going to do legs. Looking good. Information is going away. Yeah, I love to. Yeah. Like these are my favorite. I feel like when they were at first step to foot in the gym and actually my first workout was like day and I had it was back in Ukraine. I had a pretty tough trainer back in the night. So you put me through like my first first workout and it was like, day, I ended up like puking. So I kind of how I was kind of, you speak Russian, right? Yeah, I speak Russian. So you're creating? Didn't tell you dots with on, yeah. That's like, by. That's what I told him when I was puking. But yeah, no, this so that kind of like started the love for bodybuilding and pushing myself in the gym. So I always kind of had that attitude of giving it all, even starting my first workout. So I'm excited if we do hit legs. That would be great opportunity. Yeah, when you get your legs a little better, get them a little bit more recovered from the little strain. And then right now, not doing Texas Pro, if you're going to go in and possibly do San Antonio. San Antonio, so is that public yet or not? It's not public, but I'm that. I got nothing bad. It is now. It's not public as long as everything keeps going. Yeah. How many weeks out of that? So that's 10 weeks. I believe. I'm going to not rush it with qualification for this year. I do think I need a lot more size and potentially just getting the qualification out of the way and smart for 2026 having that whole year to grow. It would make me really competitive in the next year's Olympia. So that's the plan. Yeah, there you go. Again, turn pro here in Dallas, Texas, just literally two years ago. Right? Yeah, at Nationals. Going on to New Year's, then, Nationals. At 19 years old, something that we have other people that are talking about. It's like 18 years old that we want to turn around. Yeah, there's lots of guys who are chasing that. Yeah. Yep. So we had Julian, he's also trying to chase that right now. Talking about it, he's become a little bit of an online hype beast because of the fact that he's been throwing a lot of things out there that he wants to do. He wants to be the youngest Mr. Olympia. Yeah, that hurt that. Yep. You want to be the youngest one. So I guess we're after that same goal together. Right? That's why everybody had up. It's something he still has to even compete. He still has to get a pro card. He's still has to do. From what I've seen, I mean, that's going to be in the bag. That's why I'm a little bit nervous. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You've got to wait till you finally get the process because there's all seems easy until you do it. Yeah. Especially the dining part and going down to like single digit by the fact that's something that unless you've done it once, you know, you don't know how it's going to go. So that's right. That's right. He didn't know that you had to be at single digits to be on stage. We were literally right where you're standing. He's like, I got to get down to single digits. And then you go, yeah, that's how you get your glutes in. Oh, that's why my glutes have never been on. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's what the potential is there. So it's great. It's excited where he's going to go. Where he was, how far he's going to take that. So absolutely. Really, really inspiring to see guys like that as well. Yeah. Well, and you, as well, 21 years old, term pro at 19, top six in his first pro show in the stack show. Most people also, and I'm going to go ahead and warn them, would not do as stacked of a show as he did, right? So that way he could have possibly been in the top three or even maybe one depending on the quality of show that he was doing. But he just went up against, again, probably the third largest stacked show outside the Olympia, the Arnold was Pittsburgh and New York pro. Those are the, those are the top shows. Right. And I don't believe he didn't New York though. You just did. No, yeah. I decided to just rebound after that. Got you. But again, Pittsburgh was stacked. You had, you know, rough diesel, who did a great job at that show. And I just think that right now, the great thing is with Chris not being the front runner right now, it, you know, it really opens up the field. So all of you hungry young ones are all chasing after that crown, which is great. And I feel like you are, again, setting a trend for the next generation of bodybuilders. I appreciate that. Yeah, I'm trying, that's, that's one of my biggest goals to inspire the young guys and to go, to get, to get after, you know, chase wherever close they have. And then, you know, potentially achieve the things that nobody has achieved before. And, you know, for me doing Pittsburgh and seeing myself next to guys like Terrence, and Terrence, and Josema, it was really, really eye-opening to see where, you know, where I need to go and how much work I still need to put in. So that was like the best experience I could have had, doing the more stack show rather than just like qualifying, placing like third-callowed deal in Pia. It's not something I'm looking forward to doing. I want to see myself with the best and, you know, perform, and my best. So that's what pushes me forward as well. Work for fillet, you know, going in. It's, uh, first couple of years off after qualifying even. And then decided to go in and, was top three in his first open Olympia. So again, guys, we're going to go ahead and hit some chest. Let's crush this. What's up guys? Very excited to announce that I finally getting ready to launch my own FST7 transformation challenge. It's going to be a six week transformation challenge. And the winner will receive $5,000. That's right. $5,000 to the winner with the biggest transformation. It's open to men and women of all ages. It's going to be a six week challenge. You're going to be able to get all the information on the FST7 app to be the best version of yourself. Very excited. This is my first transformation challenge. It's going to be August 11th that we're going to be kicking it off. So make sure you go to honeyrambaud.com for all the information. Can not wait to see your photos. And seeing if you're going to be the best version of yourself. So what we're going to do is we're going to kind of warm up with it a little bit. Okay. And then we're just really going to get a nice stretch. Put some blood in there before we go into your compound. Good stretch. All the way up. All the way up. All the way up. There you go. Now down. Good. Good. Nice tempo. About two seconds. It's a little faster breathe in. Breathe out. Good. Exaggerate stretch at the very top. Good. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Just two more. Up. Up. Good. Even higher. Get a really nice stretch. There you go. Right there. One more just like that. Good job. Good. Good. All right. So what we're going to do is I'm going to bring this down just one. So it gives you ability to just stretch a little further. And we can bend at the waist. So what I want you to do is I don't want you to be so far upright and pull down. What I want you to do is almost like if you're leaning forward and doing a cable fly. Got it. And nice thing about the ponata standing flight is the fact that you can manipulate your body up down left and right. So well. I recommend being a little farther back on the platform and then bending over slightly and stretching. And like I said, just try to simulate think of Arnold back in the day when he was doing cable flies. Yes, yeah. Out here. We want to really get that nice stretch out in here. Don't stop. Go further back. Got it. Okay. Go further back. So we're going to add just a little bit more weight. Maybe go to like 100. There you go. Again. Chest down. Chest down. Good. Good. Good. Bring your pull body back a little bit. Think your head off the pad. Put your head down in front of the pad like that lower. Higher up, higher. That's better. Now squeeze. Good. Good. Good. There you go. That's a better stretch. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Good. Now what I want you to do is I want you to open your hands at the very bottom at the midpoint. Go all the way down at the midpoint. Down, down, down, down, down. Bring your hands together. And that's where you squeeze. Go, go, go. There you go. Oh yeah. Good. Because palms open as you come together. So as you converge open your hands. Open. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Now as you go up, bring your chest down. Down. Down. Bring your head down. That's it. As your hands come up. Down, down, down, down. Let me push you down. Right there. I got nice squeeze. There you go. Hands go up. Chest comes down. Stretch. Stretch. Down, down, down, down, down, down. Again. Good. Good. Higher. Higher. There you go. Again. Good. Again. Stretch and drive. Good. Good. Stretch. Stretch. You feeling it? Yes, sir. Good. One more. Squeeze. Squeeze. Good. There you go. That's it. Do you feel a difference? Yes, sir. Yeah. I definitely feel when I push my chest forwards. Right. Yeah, that stretch. So as your arm goes back, chest goes down. And then force the stretch. Yes, sir. Yeah, I got it. Yeah. There you go. Because before you were just stopping here, and you want to be here. Yeah. I got it almost even push myself back. Yeah. Instead of going forward. That's right. But I definitely noticed when that whatever my palms are open, I get way better squeeze. Yeah. That's a big really nice contraction. Yeah. Kind of opens up the sweep. It's a little bit of weight. It's a little bit of weight. It feels really pumped from that. That's great. But it's good range of motion. And it's that force stretch. You're just not limiting your range of motion. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. 5. Now you're going to be just 3 more. 1. 2. 1 more. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good. Now we're going to raise the weight. And we're going to go into our first working set. Cool. Good. Good stretch. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. More. And then don't forget. Bring your chest down. Into it. There you go. Lean into it. That's it. Good. Good. Good. Good. Excellent. Keep rolling. Keep rolling. Keep rolling. Keep rolling. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep rolling. Up. Up. Chest down. Stretch. Good. Three more. Three more. One. Two hold it there. Hold it. Hold it. Good. Another rep. Up. Stretch. Stretch. Push it down. Good. One more. Together. Hold. Hold. Good job. No. Let's raise the weight. Good. Put it to 220. You'll be able to handle it. There you go. Got this pumping me up. Good. Good. We're going to get pumped going on. 100%. Good. Squeeze your chest. Let's see if it looks right here. This is going to light. Okay. You see how you're pushing your shoulder blades together and your delts together. Don't pinch your don't pinch your backs. Stay there you go. That's better. That's how you do it. Good. There you go. Good. Bring your hands just a little higher up and bring your head again. Exactly the way you had your hands perfect. Good. Make a fist here. Like that. Hold that. Good. Chest up. Good. Stay wide. Wide elbows out a little bit. There you go. Get on those lats. Bend those elbows up. And bring your shoulders up a little bit higher. Like that. And then bring down like that. Yeah. That's it. Good. Good. Squeeze your, squeeze your chest. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Squeeze without pushing your shoulders together. Squeeze that's better. That's better. That's going to teach us F-C-7. Yeah. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze your chest. Good job. Okay. So what he was doing wrong was he was just pushing his shoulders together. Right? You're not squeezing your actual chest by doing that. You're just squeezing your shoulders. And you're just trying to be more narrow if I'm 100%. You're right. So that's a good tip. Thank you. Yeah. So you want to stay wide and then get your lats out. Then go ahead and flex your packs. So you can actually see the strations. And that's going to get better in my muscle connection in between those sets. So you're going to feel a lot of difference. And get a lot of chest growth out. I feel like I was just standing there in that, like holding it here. Yeah. 30 seconds. Oh my god. Sorry. Feel as much bump as after I said. So what you're going to do? You're going to do four reps. And then you can tell me if you're going to be able to go to failure in eight, or if it's still light when you need to raise the weight. All right. So let's go. Go. One. I could probably do a little bit more. Okay. Good. This raises weight. Good. Raise the weight. What do you think? What do you think? Two, 40. Yep. This would be a good eight. Yep. Good. Let's go. Let's go. Good. Control. Good. Good. Push forward. Go. Two. Good. Stretch. Stretch. Three. Good. Four. Halfway there. Easy. Five. Six. Stretch. Seven. Eight. Keep going. Nine. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. 10. Hold it. Two more. Just like that. One more. Hold it. Five seconds. Four. Three. Good job. Stretch. Chest down. Good job. Excellent. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. How's it pump? Really good. All the lines are gone. There you go. Yep. Now you've got to blacken blue. You've got to sort of see all that blood right there. Let's stand right there. And then the same shot. Okay. Make sure we did it right. That's better. Good. Good. Bend the knees a little bit. So you can get a little more quad-filid there. You go. If that looks good. There you go. Good. Good. Let's fix that. Oh yeah. That's better. Good. Tighten that up. There you go. There you go. Good. Hold it. I want to see a little more strations in the upper chest. Squeeze that. There you go. Don't bring your shoulders together. Just squeeze. That's better. Bend your elbows out a little bit more. Hands up a little bit right there. A little higher. Hands up. Right there. Box most muscular. Hold that. Hold that. Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One relax. Catch a breath. Good. Catch a breath. Catch a breath. Just like your own stage, right? You're posing. Catch a breath. Yeah. Go ahead and try and get like learn how to breathe through my chest. Yep. Rather than my stomach. Good. Now go straight to your side chest. Set your legs up. Good. Put some weight on it. Okay. You're up on your toe too much. There you go. There you go. Now put some weight more on the ball of your foot. Right there. Right there. Good. Notice how your legs and your glutes are popping more. Don't go up on your toe because you're not going to be able to put tension on the quad and the hamstring. So bend the toe a little bit more and then as you pull. That's right. So then you've got to turn here and then put weight on it. There you go. Good. That's better. Good. Now push. That's it. That's good. Set up the upper body. Lower body. Set. Perfect. Okay. Now you're pulling down from here. Don't do that. Pull all the air from your midsection up into your chest and go into your side chest. Big chest. Pull all the air into your chest. Seabed. That's the way you do it. That's the way you hold it. There you go. Good. Perfect. Take it from those hands. Like that. There you go. Good. Stay big. Good. Right there. Hold that. Good. Upper chest is pumped. Better here. Get in the back. Hold that. Hold it. Hold it. Good. Good job. There you go. Much better. See how much bigger you look? Yeah. Yeah. I tend to crunch down to show my beliefs, usually. But you can do that still. But the initial pose is right. That's right. And then you can turn around and then you can blow out. You can turn around. You do a lot of things. But the initial. It's full and wide. Yeah. Yeah. Because I feel like I'm just, you're going to fall in for it. That's right. Don't do that. Because you're showing small. Don't do that. You have plenty of size maximized it. Yeah. Yeah. You need a little bit more. Yeah. But you've got to show everything you have. That's why posing is so important. Again, every single person out there needs to pose. Why? Because if you are going to eventually compete, you want to be able to show off what you're doing in terms of hard work in the gym. You're not cut yourself short by not being able to present properly because they cannot turn around as judges in a sum that that muscles there if they can't see it, they can't judge it. You need to be able to exactly show the most amount of muscle separation. Everything in its entirety, if you want the judges to score you properly. So again, don't cut yourself off by being weak in the gym and not posing. Because that's something you have to do on stage. You don't lift weights on stage. You pose. You're so good. Go, go, go. Two. Three. Good. Do you feel that stretch? Yes. Good. Good. Again, good. Good. Good. Try straightener your arms a little bit more as you come down. Straighten your arms. That's better. Oh, yes. La harder. Go. Together. One more. Good. Solid foundation in your core. Tight. Drive. One more. This is it. Squeeze. Goal that. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Zero up. Slow. Good stretch. Good stretch. Chest down. Excellent. That's how you do it. Yes, sir. Good job. Good job. Oh, yeah. I'm so good. There you go. Good. Good. Now we're going to do it again. Remember, do not do a low row into it. Do a mid row into it. Go here and then push that air into the chest on both sides. Tows up on the left. On the left toe up. And then set up that lower body. Go up on that toe. Peak the calf. Peak the calf. Right there. Hold that. Good. Just like that. Good. You started low again. Go back. Up, up, up, higher. Get your hands up. Yeah, it's better. That's better. Much better. Hold that. Just like that. Hold that. Squeeze that chest. Squeeze that chest. Two. One. Good job. Who? There you go. There you go. There you go. Yeah, that's, uh, I need to stay balanced. You gotta do that. Yes. You gotta do that. Right. Because we can tell right now. You have a more developed right side. You right side dominant. You're, you're posing on your left as well. Yeah. Make it weak. I feel like I also have like a weird insertion down here. So slightly different than my right. Yeah. Well, you're going to end up seeing it a little bit more because you're going to do a line. Yeah. But you're just going to have to be able to pose through that and make sure that you make those slightly adjustments. Yeah. Got it. All right. So it's going to a pressing motion now. So let's go into that plenata in client press. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Just eight reps. Good. Just eight reps. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Six. Good. Good. Stretch. Seven. Good. Refete flat. And drive. Good job. Good. Put down. Okay. Let's add some weight. You want to go a quarter? You want to play. I can do a play. Okay. And then we're going to rest a little bit longer on these. So again, remember, he could have done another couple of reps, but we don't want to go to fatigue. We want to go to failure. Now we're going to go ahead. That was a feeler rep set for eight reps. Now we're going to go ahead. Take about a two minute break. So that way he's not going to fatigue. And then we're going to do his focus on being sure that that upper chest really fires. Good. Good. Good stretch. Good stretch. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Go, go. Good. You got three. You got three. You got three. You got three. One. Excellent. Two. Could you keep flat? Do you core tight? Now drive. Good. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. You got this right. Good. Keep your butt down. Hold it. Hold it. Good. Slow. Slow. I'm going to help you. Explode. Right there. Hold it. I'm going to let go. Nice and slow. Good job. Good job. Thank you. Cool. There you go. How's your set when the sweat is just going to be terrible? Good job. Good job. Working. Very comfortable. You can use your gloves and make sure you're drinking in between. Whether it's just water, water, hydration, and you know as it's usually like scoop with two pump products. Yep. Yes. Some carbs. Awesome. The big thing is just making sure also, as you're pushing, you're not allowing your butt to lift, you got to keep your hips down because you want to be able to keep that stretch and then as you're driving, you're not moving out of the seat. So just make sure you anchor yourself a little bit more because as you're handling more poundages here makes a huge difference. So don't be afraid to keep your hips down and keep your feet flat and even if you have to drive your glutes into the seat, keep it there for stability. Good. There you go. That's better. Good. Better hand grip. Good. That's better. Good. Better shoulder width. Good. Pull the right side. Good. Pull the right side out a little bit more on the right side. There you go. Better. Nice. Nice. Just. Yep. Let's go. Good. Put some weight on the foot. Always. Here he goes. Always set your body up from the feet up. Okay. Don't set up your upper body until your lower body is planted. Yeah. I'm just going to just thing like why like this. Set your feet. Good. Now go ahead. Yeah. That's better. Good. Bring your lat out a little bit and bring your arm on top of the lat like that. There you go. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. You can tell that a lot of the tissue is still new. That's why it's still not striated yet because it's starting to just definitely just develop. But the great thing about it is that you're starting to see all through the upper collar bone area. You've got really good depth to the muscle and you're just starting to get more separated. So as you start to get harder and later you're going to start seeing all of that hard work from the last two years just kind of come in. Especially you know you don't always see it a lot of people get disgruntled because they don't see it on stage because you're always trying to balance that dryness and your lower body and your glutes and your hamstrings. And then to get yourself to really push and become 3D you got to be able to do you really really, really full. But you also don't want to get so full that you spill and then you lose the lines and your legs or your glutes and hamstrings. So it's always a balancing act as you're doing that. I feel like having this time where I'm just like saladating the tissue and making it more concrete and just like we call it a marinade. Yeah. Yeah. Because I've never been this heavy. Especially this body fed. My last off season was only like 227, 269, 230 pretty much and you're lost in the stage lean. Yeah. And just a good rebound that's what gives me good good good good. Good. Again. 3 good. 4. 5. Good. 6. Excellent. 7. Good. 6. Excellent. 7. Good. 5. With me. With me. You got 8. 2 more. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. Good. He had the NSS squirreling. Yeah. Yeah. It's good though. Yeah. You see how black and blue he's getting. Again, when you're lighter skin tone, you can really start seeing that blood pool. And that's where you see a lot of that black and blue that ends up happening. Yeah. Yeah. There's so much blood in the field. I do try walking outside to get some tan. Yeah. It doesn't stick for me. Yeah. You got your ginger, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's odd. Like some of you see your penis like they get really tan. Yeah. But with me, I'm like, I can't get like kind of golden tan. Maybe I think I'll take it to the mic. And you know, it looks like you got like maybe they came over. You know what, that's what I mean. I did my like genetic testing. And so yeah, I did it whole whole. The whole panel and basically says I'm 99.3% Ukrainian, which I did think it had some kind of kind of a kind of a kind of organic. That 0.7% is showing. Yeah. Hands as you come down together. Good. Go. There you go. There you go. Nice and strong today. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep it going. Keep it going. Keep it going. Excellent. Just two more. Two more. Good. Now it's last one. I want you to hold it. Give it a three second pause at the very bottom. And then go now right all the way top top top top. Hold it. Now there's three seconds there. One, two. Good job back. Back slowly. Now it's at a little bit of weight. You can handle a little bit more. You're going to do either a 10 or a plate. I never had any injuries up until that because you guys are just so lean for so long. And you mostly happens because I don't get bodywork done like the 200% because I never did a job. I don't have any injuries or myself training because my training is pretty good. I do control negatives and you know, I don't go too exposed. I used to train like a little bit more psychotic but I've calmed down because I realized you know, I want the longevity in the sports so training is the one thing you could kind of offer you quickly. Sure. So. So that's why I'm like just like mentally. Like I could do it. I could push the river but I know I'm like I'm already like how I'm already having a lot of pain. And now like it's like the more I can kind of go into showing you know you're not 100% you know what I mean? Yeah. That's why you know it's best for me not to rush and just be there whenever I'm ready. You know what I mean? And then actually after Pittsburgh, Chris Bumsley came off to me and he was like, you got to give me this whole speech about like you just have to do it your pace. You know, there's always no way to pace. But for everyone it's different but like I know what I need to do. And now I just need to take it slowly. Yeah. But I'm ready to compete and get the experience. But to go for like the highest. I still need time. So that's why my best, my best chance to get the qualification right now and then keep growing. Yeah. Yeah. Take your time now. Because even if I qualify between 25 I don't think I should have done that. You shouldn't. I'm going to be honest with you. You know, I held back a lot of my guys. But yeah, you know, after Pittsburgh, I was actually talking to Phil too, but this whole thing. Because we somehow, we couldn't find a place to get to go get food and then like last second we went back to the venue and everyone was there. I think you were there too. It was a, do you remember what the place goes? Yeah. Oh yeah. That was the only place I was open. Yeah. Yeah. I was there with my videoographer. Yeah. And that's when I met Phil. I was there with Chris. Chris. Yeah. Yeah. It was with Sherry by the window and then we went in the corner and we were trying to think I saw you walk by. Yeah. And then yeah. So Phil gave me a whole speech about like having the longevity about it and everything. That's what I just clicked in my head. I was like, okay. But then like my eager mind wanted to do Texas real quick and like see to show that that's the problem to be honest with you with you being 21. Yeah. That's the thing. That's what Dallas is issue was, too. Dallas wanted too far too fast. Yeah. That, you know. That's the thing. I've already, I already did my pro debut. I kind of like, as I said, did my toes in the water and I know what to. Well, no exactly what I need to do. Like I'm still not there. You know what I mean? It really opened my eyes to the point where like, okay. If I keep trying, trying, I'm not going to make improvements. Not only you're not going to be improvements, you're more likely to get hurt and then also burned out your body. So you got to remember there's an area under the curve, right? So the way the area under the curve works is that you have a career and if you try to force too much in two short of a time, what's going to happen is your receptors, your body, everything sends a shut down. So you might peak faster, but you'll also burn out faster too. You know, versus like, with the way we worked with Phil was that like, all the years was always the first year was like we did two shows. We did New York pro and then we did his first show which was the Denver and then we took it and then we took it and you're off. And he qualified, he won two shows and he qualified, but I kept them out. Right? That's the right way. Second year, he placed top five, we went to the Arnold, top five, qualified. Because back then, top five was qualification. He still, I said, no, you know what I know here. Then we turned around, made some adjustments. He won the Iron Man at the second to the Dexter and Arnold. And then I said, now you're ready. And then he does the Olympia and he places top three. Right? So that's crazy. That's yeah. That's a tough, because then obviously you have the longevity you have. You have longevity and you need to take title after title. Tidal, keep coming back better. Tidal after title after title after title after title. Seven times. Seven times. You know, probably could have been eight or nine actually because the first one he went up against Jay in 2010 that one, that could have been either way. Yeah, that was controversial on that side, but you know, again. But then even the last one, he saw, you know, I think he should have beat Sean Nashio too. But it was also there were so fixated on his stomach that it was, it became a thing as well. But that would have been nine. But it is what it is. It was the greatest. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. But yeah, so I got the opportunity to talk to him after Pittsburgh. He gave me like a whole speech about, you know, how to be a pro, like a real pro. How to treat your fans, how to make a, like a long career. Did you send him a check? I wish I had enough money to send the check. Well, he can do eight or not for him. I just did advice. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. Phil, he owes you when he wins. He's going to owe you some money on that one. That's it. Let's go. Yeah, I do owe money for that. Good. Good. Excellent. Good. Good. Good. Good. Light. Light. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Good. Again. Good. Push. Good. Again. Stretching squeeze. Good. Again. Squeeze. Two more. Squeeze. Oh, good. One more. Squeeze. Cold it. Hold it right there. Five. Four. Chest up. Chest up. Good. Good. Slow. Slow. Good job. That's it. Oh, yeah. Good. Good. And go up to a plate now. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, even though I didn't place good, like my opinion, Pittsburgh, which was still a good placing obviously. Oh, it was a great place. But it was it gave me enough experience to like, especially with the people I met all the networking. They just completely turned my head around. And it was kind of a God's plan that I didn't do Texas because it would have been too much. And I knew it was rushing here because all the issues that I had put on would have come off. Right away. Right now it's great for me just like, hold it. But it was like, yeah, I always gave it my all, but first it was just like, just because I loved it. Now I'm like, understanding the longevity effect and like what impact I'm leaving as I'm doing this, you know? It's kind of like, I'm looking into like, not just what I'm getting from it, but what I'm leaving behind, you know, and I'm trying to be as long as possible obviously. So totally changed the mindset. And if I like, because that's how always did like I never, I did a show, then off season the show. I never like did compete like that back and forth, but there was the best thing for me to call after Pittsburgh obviously. Yeah. Everything happens for a reason. Yeah. There's always a learning moment. Okay. There you go. Good arch. Now go push with the pinkies. There you go. Good. And the ring finger. Drive. Again, good. Much better. Good. Keep the tension. Now drive. Good. Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Good. Good. Shoulders back. Shoulders back and drive. That's better. Good. Good. It's almost going to feel a little awkward. There you go. Good. Good.

Right there. Hold it. Slow. Slow. Good job. There you go. Oh yeah. That's it. Good. I'm going to go to the point right there. I feel like I have it in me. Oh yeah. Let's see if most muscular or not light right there. Right where you're at. Now let's see. Let me see what you do. Like give it to a crab. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see what that looks like. There you go. Squeeze. Okay. Now squeeze your. Do it again. But squeeze your chest a little sooner before your hands come together. There you go. Boom. There you go. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Good job. There you go. I do like the crab a lot too. Yeah. Yeah. It looks good. You just got to make sure you activate your chest a little sooner into it. Don't a lot of the things that you activate it right when you're off. I often just tend to like just squeeze my shoulder together. That's my thing. Yeah. That's why you'll continue to grow your chest. Once you start getting your mind muscle connection with chest more. Yeah. Let's grab. I gradually became weaker on chest. I'm just going to connect with it better. Well it's because you're actually using your chest and not your shoulder. When I was like 18, I was like repin' out 365. Yeah. And now I'm like, oh, now you 75. Yeah, now your chest is twice as big. Yeah. It's funny how it works. Yeah. It is five. And drive. Boom. Good. Good. Drive. Excellent. Again. Good. That's a good way.

I'm more belly fat for those of helpful foods for tea. Yeah. That's yesterday we were able to cook something up with for my blood. Like, actual, like, actual was wearing a two-two a day. He went to a ballet thing and they had a two-two on it. Yeah. He was like that. Did you do it? No. No. I don't know. You got a baby for that. Yeah. I'm so awkward with dancing and stuff. Like, that's just it. I feel like I could go dance, like, but I need to be like tipsy for that. Yeah. You're like, I got to go a little drink on. You're going to turn up for that. That's for that. I can't be bothering out there. That's it. That's it. You're working on it. You feel like the tooth fairy kind of, like, how do you rock it at it? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like pumping iron. That's what we're aiming for. She's ballerina. I'm trying to be trying to get that. But they were shirts, picture and articles like, didn't like that. Play that. Yeah. Yeah. We bought the last year's Olympia was one of the booths. I can see what's still where every day. Yeah. This is the day. Guys is feet man. I dated ballerina. Her feet had to get searched. I didn't get surgery several times because it just destroys your toe. My toes have brain cells. I don't like it. I don't like toes. That's crazy. Have you ever seen it? It's like the worst. The feet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My ankles are very flexible. Like squats. I can get like full them. I would just lay. I would. Yeah. Yeah. You can talk. I did. I did a gallery. Yeah. Everyone's the thing. Friends are like holy. That was so sick. But you're going to tell us about it? You know, I haven't tried in a long time because it's been like just I haven't done it since. That was a done. How's it going? Oh wow. You haven't seen my videos. That's really for a 50 year old man. Yeah. I've seen it. It's just really up because I was having so many back problems because I've been so tight. So every time I just... I mean, always the hips that like tighten up your backs. That's my hips. But I had it. I had to see my so as because my so as your legs. So I was always quite dominant. Yeah. If a doctor gets like a doctor and your hip they're interconnected. So usually my doctors are tight and it goes to my hip and my lower back. So that's why I'm always working on like the stretch. Yeah. You're trying to massage it out like here. Yeah. Yeah. I was literally with massage again right before this like just going down to my doctors. Something more out. Maybe maybe if you're nice to her, she'll... Like her is right. And I'm a massage woman done to her. Oh. Yeah. She's a big help. We make a great team. That's awesome. That's why I put a ring on it. Yeah. We're engaged now. Are you? Congratulations. That's awesome. Yeah. When was that? Like a week and a half after Pittsburgh? After Pittsburgh? Yeah. She's like, oh, if she dealt with me during the my prep I better put a ring on it. Yeah. That was that. She stuck through the words. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be the Ross form of yourself as when you get ready for a show. That's it. Really? Yeah. That's good. That's good. That's good. Control. And drive. Good. Good. Little higher up. Good. Good. Little lower. Good. Right there. Excellent. Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Come on. Good. Good. Good. And drive. Good. Good. Good. You got two. You got two. One more. All the way up. Up. Up. Now lock it. There you go. Good job. I'm so dead. You got to play that. You're like, okay, I'm done. How do you feel my tries? Good job. Yeah. Well, also you're going to have to really strengthen your triceps because you keep mentioning that. So if you want to be a chest, you're going to have to have really strong tries. Yeah. So that you can be able to make sure that the tries. For me, it was like, I was always pressing my tries and my shoulders. When I first started out, and I, now it's just like a habit. You know? So they will engage each time my chest gives out. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. And they're going to continue to. But that's why you got to really work on making sure that you're working on your. Yeah. Post-cript bench. Post-cript. Yeah. That's, that's something I haven't done in the wild, too. Yeah. I would definitely incorporate that back in to help with those arms because you're not only going to be able to. I need that outer. Two. Yeah. It was my long head to D-San. But I still need more like out here. Yeah. You're going to have to do the first three D. Yeah. I'm getting on the news split. Finally, my quad is already feeling good. And just, I need to still get it like released. So it fully feels good. Because it's got like, just a little bit more tension than my left. But at least it's all healed up. Which is nice when you're young, everything feels fast. Yeah. Yeah. I healed quick. Like my hamstring looked terrifying. It was all purple. Oh wow. It was right like two weeks. What were you doing? So I wasn't doing anything. It was just tight from training. And then I was rolling out. And I was rolling out and it split. Because I'm pretty flexible. And I had like the roller right here. And I could just feel it pop. Wow. Just because I wasn't getting enough bodywork. Mm-hm. So it just the muscle so tense. Oh. It was. Oh wow. Yeah. It's like healed within two weeks. So fully purple here. This is just like standing. His entire leg. Mm. Oh wow. Yeah. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Look how black and blue. It's not protein. That's just, yeah. And then that's literally. This was April, April 24th. And then this is back in back double by right here. Yeah. Okay. Double by. Yeah. It wasn't the same. So it's your week. Let me see that first. Yeah. Yeah. My body was really flat there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When you say you're only three hours. No. There was a lot of callouts with us. Us three. Yeah. Yeah. Physician. That was for Samuel. His back is just incredible. Yeah. It was a really good show. That's why I was saying like, you know, Most people wouldn't pick that for their first show. Yeah. They would pick something like this or something like that to be able to. Yeah. And so I was so excited to go go do like rebound. Do Texas real quick. Which was too soon, you know. So kind of got showed me that it's better to just hold off a little bit for sure. Well, yeah. Because if the call I think they didn't happen, I would have probably like something else would have gone wrong with Texas. Very possibly. Because I feel like it was just too soon. Yeah. Because if the call I think they didn't happen, I would have probably like something else would have gone wrong with Texas. Very possibly. Because I feel like it was just too soon. Yeah. Take your time. She was able to tell us. She was like, take your time. I was already starting to feel stressed like putting too much pressure on myself just for that show. Which was supposed to be like a stress free show that I don't know now. So you know what I mean? And I ended up like holding off. Best thing that they did, because now I'm like basically doing nothing maintaining this shape. Just letting the muscle count marinators you said. Mm-hmm. It's good. Come on. Oh. I had calves and had the long go to their palms. All right. Let's go. Yep. Unhook. Stretch and squeeze good. Good. Right there. Again. Good. Good. Good. Really push the peak. That's it. All the way. Good. Nice stretch. Good. Drive. Right there. Good. Again. Good. Again. Good. You got it. You got it. Go. Good. One more. With me. Yep. Good job. Good job. Good job. Oh. There you go. Yeah. That was a squeeze for me. Really good. That was in trice of the actually that was a little chest. Good. Squeeze right there. See what that looks like. Squeeze. Good. Sheen up like that. Hold it. Squeeze the legs. Push. There you go. Good. Squeeze that chest. Look forward. Look forward. Squeeze that chest. Squeeze. Squeeze that upper chest. That's it. Stay wide. There you go. Good. Hold that. Hold that. Show the arm width. There you go. Like that. Good. Good pump. For sure. Very black and blue still. Yes. All the way through. Good. Good job. That's the magic of having some pump product clean. So always stay pumped. Let's see what the front will actually turn. Okay. So you have an asymmetry with your left shoulder and your right. So what you need to do is really build up that right side a bit more because you have an over development on the left versus your right. So I think it could be. It could be. It's like right here. Mm-hmm. So go back to your front relax and you'll see it. I think it's also just the winter handling. So you go. Just a little more development through there. So I think that your body's compensating a little bit. So make sure that you get some body work done to open up both sides and then a little extra work on the right would really help you to be able to help that fullness to be able to match up with your left. You know, different to slice it. Good. Good. Sight chest. Okay. Now do it again. And then bring your air into that chest and stay big through the chest and we'll see how that looks. Good. Good. Just stay up like that. Like that. There you go. Squeeze. Good. Good. Now bring your foot a little bit more flat. There you go. Like that. There you go. Stay there. It's a little bit more flat. There you go. Stay there. It's a little bit more flat. There you go. Stay there. There you go. And then pull this tight and bring it up. Like that. Good. Just a little higher up with the hand. Just a little higher up there. Good. There you go. Good. Turn around so you're back the little. Okay. Loving forward just a little bit because of the lighting. I know. Not back. Like that for the lighting. There you go. Good. And bring your arms down. There you go. Good. Because when your arms are too high it makes your lats go away. Okay. So it'll bring some more thickness in. If your shoulders are down a little lower. Don't be here. Come down here. I think it's filled. Right. Like filled. Down and then straight. Okay. There you go. Good. That's better. Down. Good. Bring those elbows down. There you go. There you go. Good. Don't lean back so much. There you go. Good. Good. Yeah. He's what you're doing is you're over rotating your shoulders and then you become all shoulders. I'm more narrow. And he'll look narrow. Yeah. That's why I noticed. I just, I don't know why I think somebody told me to get more. I'll provide a detail. If I go a little bit more. Up. You know what I mean? No. He just said, you lose your lats. Yeah. You lose your lats. I could just feel it because I contract them with him down. Yep. Yep. That's it again. You set up a little bit. Set up a little bit. When you're doing the back pose, sit your home with you. Yeah. Like that. There you go. Just got a little bit more light. Good. Bring your elbows back. Bring your elbows back. Show your tree. No. Bring your elbows back. Let me see your tree. That's better. Good. There you go. Good. Don't lean back so much. Like that. Like that. Right there. Hold that. Right there. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. I see that. I definitely need more like outer lats. Mm-hmm. Even more. But yeah. Yeah. You got to engage your lower lats and you're not doing that when you're up here. Yeah. When you're up here, it's all upper. Mm-hmm. Hold that. I can tell what you set. Kind of into the fire a little bit better. There you go. See. Yeah. With my leg position, I could impossible my knee elbow or lower on the left. Yeah. But you see how much more you're going to get more separation. Yeah. Yeah. You have to get that lower back because if you're way up here, your back's going to just engage. Good. Good. There you go. Good. There you go. Like that. Don't lean back so much. Right there. Right there. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good. You know that. I've got to get body work to. Yeah. Because I just hit back. I think it's just your posing. It's just that you were just used to bring your arms too far and then you're overroating here. So you're seeing all of this. So you need to do this a lot. People too like, you know, more of what it does. Kind of around two's back. Yeah. Thank you for some more of the more thickness. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In the like, like, this is good. Like, you go like around it. Like this. Yeah. I do not like that. Yeah. Because you lose all your separation. You know. Yeah. Well, I would listen to them. There's a judge. Yeah. I would listen to other. Yeah. Let me see a last spread just for fun. Because I know you don't do it on stage. But let's see. Because you get a good mind muscle connection going. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. That's where you can really see you need to fill in those lats and that bat just thicken up that back. Yeah. Yeah. So I would definitely make sure you're posing your lats spread because you'll be able to really once that starts to thicken up, then you'll know how much better your back double body steps going to be. Yeah. I know there's a more I have a, like I said, that gap. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Turn around and let me see your ab thigh. Good. Good. Good. There you go. Good. That's what you're, what's your pose of choice? Usually I do this once. And then I think I want to incorporate the front lattis well and then to go the three fourth Arnold. Okay. So I'm going to use two or three for that. List of name. Okay. Try. And then go sit from that. Good. Separate your legs. Yes. Just really separate them off top. Yeah. That's the one you, and you, and you, and you, and you hurt. Okay. But it is so the work's going on. You can just see. Yeah. More than maybe a little bit more more down here. Got you. But it's back. I'll probably do the transition. How I can go into it. So let's start with this one. Good. Good. There you go. There's little lattis. There you go. There you go. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good job. Yeah. It's still something I'm working on. Good job. Yeah. Yeah. Just keep going and continue. You got great physique. All you got to do is just keep refining it. Try not to rush it. That's it. Just try not to rush it. Yeah. Yeah. You did a good job today. Yeah. I've really tried my best. Yeah. You did. Awesome opportunity. I got it. And then I'll listen to all the advice. Sure. To the highest of my extending. Yeah. And just make sure you focus on your posing so that between your sets also add in the posing. After you're training while you're pumped up because if you can do it then you won't have any problems doing it on stage. So yeah. I just do rounds and rounds. Something I never did because I kind of just like pay attention to the listing aspect of food. But buying it really spying really has to you know, explore the art. That's right. Imposing is like one of the biggest things. You got to do it. Display. Which you have. Good job. Awesome. All right guys. So again, we got Anton's journey. You can go ahead and follow him on social media and make sure if you're anywhere in Texas. You're going to want to see the San Antonio Pro. That's going to be coming up. So again, follow him on his Instagram page as well as on YouTube. He's going to be documenting the whole process and making those little refinements. They're going to show big, big changes by the time he gets on stage. On your round by 25 time Olympia winning coach Anton, IFBB Pro. Peace.
