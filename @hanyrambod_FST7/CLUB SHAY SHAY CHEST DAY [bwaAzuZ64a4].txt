I love training differently than what I would normally train. And so it just lets me know what I need to do and what I need to get better at. I'm always a sponge. I always want to learn. I'm always trying to get better and what better train. We're trained with someone that's guided 24 times. Mr. Olympia coach. Feel he. See bomb. Long for you know, you name it. He's trained them. And so obviously know what he's talking about. And when that picture that you saw my IG. But my 54th birthday he was the guy that sent me the program. Told me how should he. How should train. How often I should train. The amount of cardio I should do. What time I should eat. How often I should eat. And so we back out of the game. So we're about to see what we're going to do in the next. Make six to eight weeks. See what type of program we can put together and see how. You boy get peel like an orange again. Let's try it. 60th anniversary of the Mr. Olympia is in six weeks.
