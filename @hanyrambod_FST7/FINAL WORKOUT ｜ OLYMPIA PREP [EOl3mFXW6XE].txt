Yeah, you took it a post. That's it. Thanks for everything. Good for you. Just a fourth here, man. A lot of... Sir, fourth show together guys, only a fourth show together. 22, 22, 22, 22, 23. The first two years, really actually count. Yeah. I mean, they count for us, but I mean, in terms of... I was two, 12 the first year. Right? Second year, we almost put out, I got sick. And then last year, we were going, which was great. So I feel like last year was like, kind of the first year. And then I was still learning how to be an open bodybuilder. And then still... Well, yeah. So we're always learning, but I feel like last year, so this year was the first time I think, sort of, clicking more and more and more. But thank you for your men. God put us together for a reason. And thank for you, did. I'm just really looking forward to the sweet end, and presenting a package that we've been working on for these past four years, when especially since we stepped off Lashers, Limpus stage. And it's all come to fruition now. I just hope that everybody can see all the hard work presented at a hundred percent, and I believe they will. So I mean, I don't know about you. You're coach, but I think we're right on track. Yeah, so fortunately, I'm good. I mean, I'll be honest, like, what I saw a couple hours ago. I'm looking really good. Now, we're just going to be able to make sure we're about 70 percent there. For the next couple of days, we've got to just turn it up and get to... Fill it up and dry it out and just make sure that it just has a right amount of fullness, and that amount of dryness is going by paying, but you said we're about 75 percent there, and that's... You know, Pony will never be more than 90 percent there. Most of... Oh, right. He'll never be like, we're a hundred percent. He'd be like, yeah, we're good. We were really good. But, you know, there's some things we could do. Spend them when it's all crisp. It's not horrible. You know what I'm so thankful for. Yeah, I appreciate it. I appreciate you too. Next time, make sure you stock up on those arts and be useful in the ring. Yeah, well, they had him back in the room. All right, guys. We're doing a final workout with Hottie. Once again, he's also doing shoulders, a little bit of arms. Just getting some blood flow in there, nothing too dramatic, nothing too drastic. Just a little bit of a barcloth, just to continue to keep the blood moving, and keep a circulation high. Yeah. All right, guys. So what we're doing is all we're doing is we're just going through the range of motion. Making sure that we're going to a little bit of blood in the shoulders. I think crazy. We're doing not want to produce a tear down workout where your body has to actually root for that big big workout that we're doing is just getting blood flow and getting good pumps so you can facilitate a good fight up. All right, guys. Do not forget to take advantage of the EVGDestrition.com, Olympia Cell. We got amazing deals. Also, the ZVC, the Keeb asking about the GDP extreme, a QRTV. Those oil customers that are spending $100 or more are going to get a free, free launch unit of the traffic splash. The traffic, the travel splash is a great flavor. Then we put together for the RTD launch and I just am very excited to be able to share it all the way to you because we're going to work on all your long and now we're able to. All right, guys. All right, guys. So we just did a little bit of straight arm pull downs and that's just how you can stretch out a little bit of his torso was feeling a little tight and just to open him up a little bit. So again, just a really good body pump. We're done. That's it. Done for the workouts. The 2024 now is time to get ready and go over to the open after the second. So that's for audio and Derek and then C-bombs got weigh in tomorrow morning at AM. It's going to make great. So I'm going to go back and check on him. Make sure that right there he was about five pounds over the early of today. So we just got to just make sure that we're starting to adjust everything on diet and water to be able to
