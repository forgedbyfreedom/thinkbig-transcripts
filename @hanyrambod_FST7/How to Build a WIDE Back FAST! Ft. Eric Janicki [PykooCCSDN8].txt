All right guys, honey Rambot here, 25-time Olympia winning coach, and I'm here with none other than Mr. YouTube himself, Eric Janikis. I call him Mr. YouTube because this guy is one of the hardest working guys up on social and putting it a ton of time in when it comes to content. And he's putting equal amount of time into his physique and going out and trying to get that pro-card. Just missed it. This is again, the third time in a row, but hey, we're going to get it at some point. I'm not a Mr. Zero Olympia over here, but social media body, but they're so... Hopefully I'll change that, that stigma soon enough. Yeah, but honestly, tons of really good quality. A lot of really good stuff. His channel's popping off. Not just because of the fact that he's entertaining, but he's also giving out a lot of really good information. And today what we're doing is we're focusing on back, and we're going to throw in some buys. But what we're going to do is just kind of move around a little bit of the movement, maximize some of the PenoDoc equipment that we have here, and be able to kind of walk off of this walk away from this with a lot of really good information. That he can take back and be able to get that coveted pro-card that he's been looking for. So, let's do it. So, I'm ready to soak it up, I guess. Let's do this. So, what you're going to realize is the bio mechanics of the PenoDoc pieces of equipment. I feel like a second to none. You're able to get through full range of motion with time-under tension. And you don't get those dead spots where you get with a lot of the other machines. As I was talking about, love the rec center. We go to as a family, but you don't get that time-under tension with some of the other machines that you have in regular gyms. So, when you do have the ability to find a really good piece, you can really get that mind muscle connection that will help you grow in great platoes. So, as you can see here, you're going to start feeling much more than you normally would. With just the handle position. There you go. Good. Good. Normally when you're warming up, when you're reps, you normally do when you're warm-ups. Well, let's see, like, probably, eight to 12. It's really a new gel that's like sitting that stretch position, too. Mm-hmm. Let's get everything open. Get your hips down. You're going to be able to stretch. Yeah. There you go. I like that. I like that. So, guys, make sure exactly what Eric said. I love the fact that he likes to get into that stretch position. He doesn't have to just rip on reps. He can keep that stretch position. And also, the big thing is do not lift your ass up. You want to keep your hips down so you can get that maximum stretch so that you can be able to really warm up the entire muscle. You're... Is... I like to personally square up a little bit more here. A stretch. And then pull and then dry. That's it. And give it a good stretch. And pull. Almost like you're doing a rough... When I'm done by rope, you get that lawnmower effect. Where you're pulling that lawnmower string. And then you pull. And dry. Good. Good. Real delivery. Real delivery. Scrooed. It's good. Good. Notice how much heavier that weight fell. Pull. Yes. There you go. Good. Yes. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. What do your thoughts on grips? Um, I don't like using them until you start getting to heavier weights. Because I feel like especially most people who have need a forearm development, they use it on the lighter weights. And then on heavier weights where your grip wouldn't normally give out. That's when they're needed the most. But if you've got big arms, arms like you do, not as much of an issue. If you have smaller arms, stay away from straps or grips until you really need them. So you get more forearm recruitment. I think it was interesting to hear the methodology you want to come up to using grips. One of the things I really started to emphasize to is not completely straighting my armoured stretch, because I can keep tension in the lower lap. Yep. Yep. Good. Good. So what I like to do is exactly that, but every third breath, we're just, yep, and stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, and then up one. There! Just so you can get a little bit better stretch the very beginning of that point right there, right there. Good. Good. Good. Good, good, good, good, good. There you go. Handful. Excellent. Keep it moving. Yeah. There you go. How many reps we should have for a work in good? Good. Good. Good. Between 8 and 12. Good. Good. How's that wreath you? Nice. Good. Again. Good. Good. I would just do one more. Just do one more. Good job. That's it. Now let's add a quarter to it. And then let's do a working set. Quit. Let's do the other side first and then we'll come back and then we'll go into that work and set. We've got this pump cover off after that. It's still, do this machine. That's so thick. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Come on. Come on. Show. Show. Good. Just think you're on stage. You bring those elbows back. Showing those really thick lats. Boom. That's it. Good. That's it. Good job buddy. Good drive it down. Good. That makes a stretch. Keep those hips planted. Good. You get that hip plant. Perfect. Good. Again. That's it. Excellent. Good job. Check it out. Good. Good job. Good. Good. That really nice. Yeah. That's nice. She is just like, yeah. So good. Yeah, now what I'm very big into is real my most connection. So in between sets, like going into that next set right now, just literally bringing your elbows back right now and just feeling those lats contract. Just so that you get that good mind muscle connection and set your body up to be able to get those neurons, everything to fire for the next set. Do you see all of this this coloration and then you're bringing it back there you go together right there. Good. Again, another one more time. Now we can stay waiting for it and then bring those elbows back. Good. Backscat. There you go. Good. How could you have fingers back? And let's go ahead and go a last spread all the way out. Just, uh, boom. There you go. Lift it. Lift it. Like that. Right that. Hold it there. Good. Now lose slightly forward right there. Just like that. See how. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Good job. So not bad. There you go. Especially when you nailed it. And again, you're getting so much blood in there, which you want to do is you want to be able to control and move me and then be able to get that my most connection of what you're doing on stage and you're trying to be able to converge on both of the pieces of what you're doing here that you're not going to do on stage to what it's going to look like on stage. Yeah. So that's why it's so important that you be able to master both. Absolutely. So many people don't do posing and they want to know why they don't look right on stage because they're lazy. Good. Good. Oh, it's you. Good. Good. There you go. Good. Good stretch and pull. Excellent. Good. Staying right on that lap. Pull. Good. Good. Hanker those hips. Good. And pull. Good. Keep them moving. Keep them moving. Go on air. These are the reps are going to make you grow now. Keep it rolling. Again. Good. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Again. Good. Good. Pull. Oh. Easy. Good. Pull.

And you got one more easily. And much stronger than you think, dude. Travel. Try. Travel to. Travel to. Higher. Right there. Now slow. Not slow. Not slow. Good job. Good. That's it. Oh, of course. And again. Partial. Partial. Good. Partial. Good. All right. So those partials work amazingly well. We want to increase intensity at the end when your body cannot do the full range of motion. That's why we've got invented partials. Oh, good. Good. Good. Come on in. That's it. Good. Good. Operation don't have tiny arms here. Let's go. Good. Good. Good. This one actually is better stretch than that one. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Every person who's bobbing can't sort of different depending on your height and the arm length. So that's why as you go through the range of motion, you're going to notice a certain of machines or you give you a little bit better stretch. And this one seems to be really good. It's dream. Good. Drive it out. Yes. Good. Which is going to do one good set here. That's all you need. You're ready warmed up with the biceps. Everything's been primed. Now we're going to do that ultimate contraction. All the way up. Good. Good. Good. Again. Again. I can see the tricesterone coming through the veins. So it's what I'm doing. Good. Good. The tricesterone coming out of the veins right now. I can smell it as real turn. Yeah. It was perfect. Again. Again. Drive. Drive. One more. One more. Yes. Good. Good. Drive. I'll wait. I'll wait. Right there. Hold it there. Hold it there. Five. Four. Three. Two. Two. We have an exchange rate with tariffs. One. One. Okay. What was that, Dr. Canadian tariff exchange rate? That's why we do extra because it's not exactly $1 for dollar. That was very mean. That was very mean. That was very mean. Good stretch. Good. And I think on this, you're going to get a little bit better stretch because we're able to drop you a little bit further. Where's the first exercise? There you go. Try to feel the tug. Twin peaks. Brawl. Twin peaks. Let's go. Good. Squeeze. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Push in the hands, also out towards the bed. See that? Yeah. Go. Hmm. Do you feel that peak contraction? Hmm. That's a funny question. Yeah. Let's go. All the way. Try it. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. And drive. Good. Good. Good. This is only going to be a one set wonder for you. We're doing one set. We're going to turn around and absolutely chill in. Hmm. And that's it. One set on this exercise. It's because we're going overboard because you get a chance to be here in the Pinata Pumpland. Let's go. All the way. Go. Go. More more more. Good. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Good. Hold that. Hold that. Keep contraction. Not work. No. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Seals fibers. They're dancing. Good. That's it. Good. Good. No. No. Not a good one. That's, best for my entire life. Like, besides, you're like, a close first or second. It's like, everything's so acts really design. I think I need to just a little more stress. More stress. But the force curve. Yeah. On these the way they're set up. You're just taking a talent. Somebody that actually understands bodybuilding. Whereas. a lot of machines are like, for example, a pulling machine. That one, all the curve is here. A lot of these camera shapes, they go the opposite way, they curve like this. You're like, like that, it's like, no, it's not how, like, you should be driving low in here. And then half the machines, they do this up, like up to down there, they're like this. It's like the opposite of what you want to do. It's just like madmaning, so when you see somebody actually like, get set, gets very fun to use. Right, I want to surprise you, but don't get too excited, because I want your class out. But I'm going to show you this extra room in here. Let's go. This is not the lighting here, it's so noisy. Good. I thought it was a little like that. There you go, stay away, stay away, stay away. That's it. That's it, good, right there, right there, like that. See how hard that is for you? That's it though, good. Just got done doing some posing at the very end of the back workout. Your first FSC 7 workout, how was it? I met it last, it was like definitely taxing, definitely tough, well, like everything felt super safe, very acute, I learned so much, but I think that's like the big thing, like open-mindedness to learning something new and trying a new stimulus, because I think if you go to the gym to do the same for exercises, like it's lobbed in my experience, you're going to like make games for the first like six, eight, 12 weeks, but you continue to try to progress me over the same moments, you're going to just try to do a wall eventually. Yeah, absolutely. And remember, this is just an example workout. I tend to do is take half of the workout, keep it the same, and if we're going to do a variant, then switch up the second half of the workout. So you have some consistency in the workouts week to week, so you can see where your strength points are and how it's tracking. So again, utilize this information, check out Eric's channel, he's given out a ton of really good information as well, and like always, let us know in the comments below what you would like to see on the next workout. Honey Rambud, Eric Jannigate, we're out, peace.
