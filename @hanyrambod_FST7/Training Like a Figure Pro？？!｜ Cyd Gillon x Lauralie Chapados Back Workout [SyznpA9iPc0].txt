Oh, that's a competition now. Yeah! Hey, don't you think I'm a competition guy? That's a competition. Tension class for now. She's gonna eat and figure it out guy. What's up guys? I am here with another, and it's two beautiful points. I got the go, Sid, eight-time misfigure Olympia, as well as the current in reigning Miss bikini Olympia, Laura Lee. That's right. We're gonna get ready to do what body one? Ready to back to bed. That's right. We're here at the E-Vision Headquarters. Big both have just got a loader up. One of the free workouts in now. Oh, by the way. Okay, flavor, what you're saying? Hey, three pop, EVP, 3D. Really non-sim? Yes. Then, did you go with the strong unbuttrolled? I did not, that's wrong with it. But you said, dude, that's wrong. Yes. And then, with the budget. And it clicks around the victory punch. And I did that EVP was a good one. Okay, so that's EVP HQ, victory punch, with the sound with, sour candy. It's our candy. It's true. Wow. We own non-sim step, retired, retired. Right? She just poured out and chimped in the before. And then, now we have the rainy champ. Again, we're 13 weeks, just under 13 weeks out. Okay. Yesterday, we did a little ham together. So if you haven't seen that video, make sure you check that out. Now we're gonna get ready to do some back. And again, right now, how are you training? Miss Olympia, retired, eight-time goats? I'm doing all the things. I have two full body day now. I do a crop of dog class, a yoga class, and I do running twice a week now. So it's very much functional, very much trying to be an overall athlete type of vibe. So from Athens out there, we'd probably be going to show you what retirement life was like. That's all I said. And then you are in full glow and Olympic mood. So we're gonna get ready to podcast also after we've done. And we're gonna talk a little bit about tired it. And a little bit of current trying to get back. And still Olympia champ trying to get to that point to get ready for a back-to-back finish. I know you can kind of really get scarf because you got this, you're not gonna be Arnold, which you're body-rest, you feel like you're gonna be impressed. First time you've done that, and almost seven years. Yes, that is. Let's try to say that you remember. Yeah. So, are you excited? Are you excited? You a little bit of back. Hi, I'm excited. Especially being in back. I mean, you're perfect. You can take a bit of the running look just so that it has the back, you know. And you know how to train this. So I'm excited. Yeah, so we're gonna start off with some dumbbell when our dumbbell rows. They're gonna do some dead lifts. They're gonna do it. You don't start. Wait a minute. I'm not hot. You're coming. No, hot. You're coming. Yeah. You're coming. So we're gonna do a bikini figure champion workout. Let's kill it. All right guys, before we get started, one thing I do want to mention is the shirt that I'm wearing is available. It's like the Legion Trish Nutcom. All the proceeds, all the proceeds, I'm not just the profit, all the proceeds. Of this particular shirt, are gonna be given to the flood victims from the Fourth of July flood. So again, a lot of families were affected. Children will pass away because of this. Tragedic accident with all the different flooding in that full area. We wanted to be able to get back. So everything that comes from proceeds from this shirt on the Legion Trish and website will go towards the victims. So any help would be highly appreciated. So again, thank you guys so much in our prayer to the families and loved ones for those that survived and for those that ask. Again, maybe the rest in peace. We love you all. Thank you for the support. All right guys, so we are starting now with a pot of pull down, circular, it's converging, it comes down. It simulates a back to the bicep. That's why I like it so much. This is something where we can also talk a little bit to sit about what you might have done a little bit differently versus a bikini competitor, versus a figure champion. So again, we've got the two champs in the house. We can talk about comparing contrast. It gives some of you out there. May still need to bump up volume or weight or exercise depending on what your needs are. You could be a bikini competitor, but you might have to train like a figure competitor only because you have to put on that exercise. So let's go ahead and get to us. So nice thing about this pinot of ease. Again, it's simulates almost going into a back to the bicep. You want to get full range of motion. A really good stretch to be able to stretch out. There you go. You can go up even a little further. Further further. There you go. Pull all the way. There you go. Again, a lot of people think that bikini does not need back. It absolutely does. Even though you're hair covers your back, you want to be able to still have that B taper. And especially from the front pose, you see that back go right into that oblique. Cool, good job. Good set. It's good. Good one set. Starting with overhand. Did it pick up? It was better. Your eye cover is coming. I'm going to have the ends. I couldn't see it. It was making my head up. Now man, what's the deal? Put your legs long to my head. I don't know. When you're people, you got some thickness in there. No? Let's go. That's the losing. You got those wellness legs now. No, no. Good. Good. There you go. Great. So as you can see, even though she's nine months, ten months retired, she is still an amazing shade. Some people do think you're asking you if you're going to come back? They do. I didn't do well with them. They just lift your leg. Good. That's the thing for life. That's a nice thing. There you go. Yep. Really? Good. Excellent range of motion. Is there something you would normally do also when you're pregnant? Absolutely. I was a pull down point. We do part three to four different exercise pull-downs with a different different variations. But it's like pull down everything. And then it was out with a couple of working sets. Or it was it. Just how many working sets on me want to move? I don't know. Because at that point when T takes over, I just just go. But when I was training myself, like before, we would go out with him. I would only do like four total sets. I would warm up on the first exercise. And then going to work and sets everything from that point was working. Because they have things to warm at that point. I think he was like men in black when you bring it right. He was like forget all the exercises and the reps that the set. There's lift away. Move it down and it's down. That's it. That's it. That's right. All right. How was that way? It's good. Oh yeah. She wants some weight. Yeah. I love it. I love it. I just want to see it's my class big brother. I think it's typical because when you were going, your elbow was like, I also back here. So when you release, you kind of kind of stop here versus dropping it. You probably learn as blood. What you kind of drop under? Yeah. This is who tried that. Okay. I see what that sounds like. Okay. That's right. Do you got down further? There's no way. That's too low. Is that too low? I like it. Okay. Good. All right. Good stretch. Good. Squeeze. Excellent. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. She's that right side. Don't. Go in. Go in. Yeah. Bring it to you. Go in. Drop your trash down first. Go from there. Oh. There. Go. Oh. That's good. Good. Again. Much better. Stretch. Good. Good. That's a field. Good. Good. Right. Ready and then then off. Again. So I want to say right traps still. Good. Good. It's good. Have you been moving now? Keep going. I'll tell you. Yeah. You have a little bit of engagement. But not much. Yeah. No. You're good. Good. squeeze better one more like that. Good. You should have strong. Good job. So when I do, when I think of it, what I think of kind of like, how, what I get the stretch. So I'm getting to get the stretch, but I want you to try to think of long neck. So if you get up here, your neck's no longer long. If you always keep it down, even when I'm stretching at the top, I like to think of it like a dead hang. I'm not. You don't always have to do this, but I'm a dead hang girl. Even under my pull-ups, I'm dead hangy coming back into. I don't keep attention on it because I want to really this engage, and then make sure I'm using my last to come back through. So that way, like, you just think long neck to keep those traps down. Even when you go up, and you're pulling my gown, none of this moves. I hear you. Okay. I try that one. So again, a lot of people will end up having issues because they're trying to engage their traps unknowingly. So exactly what Sid was saying, tends to happen, whether you're a guy or your girl and you're trying to train, and you don't want those traps constantly firing, because that's what's going to get really, really developed, and you won't be able to get that V-taper you're looking for because you're constantly on those traps. So you want to be able to relax your traps, which means that the lecturing neck, which she was mentioning, was trying to go into that. So who would look like this by the way? Yes. It's not damn. It's my first new lens. Keep in this down the hallway, and pull it through. There you go. A lot of engagement. Good. But it's under his capital, I knew. It's your step in the hallway. That was really, like a little wind show, I heard. Good. And you suck the sock. You bet. You bet. You bet. Good. Good. Cool. Good. That extra extension. That's it. Cool. Good. Excellent. Also for you to try, not easy to come, because that's an unfortunate and turn you rotate too. Like what you put your left hand on the outside. I know you don't watch your biceps coming or something like that. Keep your hand out so that your fingers are disbottled through. So you're not in grip because that's part of your vet. And goes into your biceps too. Okay. Good. Do you want to add another 10? Throw a 45 on? What do you want? Uh. Come on. So a 45 on. Take that down. I don't even do it. Easy for you. That's where you put your feet to the floor right now. You should do it. Okay. Let's try it. I think you do both of those way. Yeah. You should do it. Come on. Yeah. You're on that cell count. You're on that cell count. Loady the up. Pretty a team. Kick it in. Okay. So wrong now. Yeah. Go on. Good. You come down. Who was elbows down to push your dips? Good. You got it. Good. Hold it there for a second. Take it from now. Let's see what that does. Anything time to go. You're going to have to be more. Yeah. Good. Not a bad fail. Yeah. Good. Can you stretch it? Good. You're going better. Good. There's just a little heavy now. You stretch it stretch it stretch it stretch it stretch it. Oh. Good. Good. Good. Good. Cool. Good. That was good. That trapped down the right. That was a bit. Yeah. There you go. Cool. Good. That was built with a trapped out. Oh. That was very easy when those last words. Yeah. Let's see if back over right there in front of the flag. Right there. Yes. Oh. Good. There you go. Boom. There you go. Who says bikini competitors can't pose? If my little thumb went back right back. But yeah. I was like wait. Wait. I do that. Also watch too. But now you like to have to this was lower your fits up like this. It's better. Get your foot. Hold your foot on the ground. Yeah. Good. You do that. You do that. You do that. You do that. You do that. And you keep that foot on the ground. Blast it around. And you're noticed too. Pretty good. But even if I'm in my shoes, I'll drive my heels. And I can decide how much my lead I engage with my pinky toe. My fourth toe. My third toe. My big toe. Kind of playing around with that. Sometimes you may have to turn a foot a little bit slightly different on one side. So you engage at full side. I'm talking about. No, it's not. So like sometimes I've been on left one. Shut up. I'll turn a toe a little bit. Drive it. And a shut up. So you got to get it real than two with that. Just so you can see which it seems to tell you because a lot comes with and feet. Yeah. A lot of injuries. And you can see. It could be your chop as a game. But it could be your right foot. My reason is not going to be foot. Yes. So you when you come down. So it's a second. All right. Here we come down. Drive the track first. And we pull down. The armchair. It's a position. Yeah. And it's a two-way down. So every United already engaged. This is that they are first. Then one for an air. Oh, okay. Yeah. Don't fidget. Play those feet. Stick them. Yeah. Don't fidget. Play those feet. Stick them. Yeah. They're good. Big stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch. I mean, you want to really exaggerate the right side of the track right now. Yep. Keep stretching the disc rear. Lift. Lift this rear book. That's right. Yep. You crunch on the side when you pull down. Got your arms with my head. You know, your ribs is like your on a week's insurator kind of pulling you to that side. You just made this with a bit tight. Better. Because on this side, you have to work more and you're going to get that chap down. You got that, you know. And you're engaging here and it's stretch and it's not dropped out. Pulling, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it. Exactly. Better. Jeff's down. Long neck. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Pull it, pull it, pull it. Good. Good. Pull, pull. Pull. That's how you're going to do that. Good. Awesome. I'm going to watch out for it too. It's the pinnacle we pull down. How much arch and a little bit or how much public touch you want to have. And if it's sometimes the pinnacle we you tilt, it will give you more spawn of the Rectors. Engagement. All right. So, I know in McKinney, you want to watch for that. You're not going fully all the way down. Just watch for that. So, it is not carving more muscle gain going out over this way. Good. Keep a pause on the rebound. Let's go. Hold it. Good. Let's master that way. Good. Hold it. Good job. Again, two seconds. One thousand one. One thousand two. Down. One thousand one. One thousand two. Last one. Hold it. Hold it. Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One. Easy. Easy. Oh man. This one first room back where God will allow. Is it? Because that I just full body. I only need full lips. Oh. That's it. That's it. That's it. Just play away. By the way, when we're up. The pins, I try to get like 30 totals. So, I have a little like in the 15 and on time. 10 at one time. That's the really strict one. So, I said, like, a thing out one. That's why you're mastering this little light stuff. I didn't even know what. I think you go up. That's it. But just thinking that just doing a pull-up is an Ancientist. How much your strength is actually maintaining. Because pull-up's a way harder. Anything. 100%. Like, 100%. That's right. When we're young, we can all do them. Exactly. Like, oh, we do that pull-up now. Yeah. Yeah. Because pull-ups are just too hard. Exactly. Five of those. That's it. That's all that work I do. Just like, just like, just like, just like, just like, just like, just like, just like, just like pound cow thinnings. That's it. Yeah, really cool. Full of long time. I mean, I was thinking to do it now, but I think I need to bend girl. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Your abs and stuff. He's like, steps in here. So, we can do this. We're going to go ahead and we're going to mix it up. Have a little closer grip. Oh, I have no idea. Yeah. So, let's do that. Like, we did in white creeps. How is it like? Yeah. We didn't get one. Oh, I'm about to hear. Awesome. Alright. Now, we're going to go ahead and change up the exercise. We're going to go close grip. So, almost like a few that was simulating a V-bar. We're going to do that on the foot because we got the master blast right here, herself. And then we're going to go ahead and see if Laura Lee can do a pull up. Pause the video right now and go into the comments and tell me how many reps you think Laura Lee's going to get. And how many reps you think that's it is going to get. Okay. Go ahead and I want you to see it in the comments. Alright. So, I'm very excited to announce that I finally getting ready to launch my own FST7 transformation challenge.

I don't think she doesn't. She's not. She's not. I don't think she doesn't. More. You might be my last video here. You'd be like, you're actually fired. You're fired. You're fired. Yeah. You got this. And then the reason. It makes you overarch because you won't fill in your biceps. If you go this way, but you have to go scoop it. Right. When you're hanging, you're going to have the insulin muscles to get more. Yeah. So what you're saying is just a few barge. What you're going to do is you're going to feel it. Lots of it more. Yeah. And then arms just are more ancillary. I mean, it'll under emphasize. You're still going to get some more. Yeah. I'm going to show you. Yeah. Okay. So we're going to see how my core is disconnected. It's my point of time. Okay. All right. All right. So make sure. Well, for said. You're going there. Lurely. How many are you going to do? Don't cheat. Go into the comments. Go ahead. Give it a guess. Let's go. It's true. He got a shred of things. Okay. Don't stress. Come on. I want to make that. There you go. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep that tough. Go. Go. Good. Or keep going. Keep going. Come on. You got it. You got it. You got it. Now we'll see now. Come on. Good. So now we're going to make this now go with nice and slow. So you notice I'm helping with the positive. And then she's going to go slow on the negative. So it's like e-centric. I'm going to do one more just like that. Up. Right there. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good job. So you got five. Let's get. Yeah. She's too much. That's good. That's good. Thank you. Good. I think okay. Let me ask you this. Did you think that you're going to do less or more going to do it? I thought I was going to do less. Thanks. Yes. Is that you're going to do like two or three? What? I love how she believes in herself. One. That's right. That's it. That's it. That's it. All right. How did that feel? Empowering. Really is. It really is. It's probably needs to do more of those functional workmen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that's it. Yeah. No more. More set. We're going to do one more set. Okay. So that's it. Let's go. We're going to do one more. You got this. There you go. Very big arch. Two. Three. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Five. Good. Yes. Six. Good. So I'm going to. Eight. One more. Nice. Up. Up. Up. I'm barely helping her. Just the great time. Now she's going to nice and slow. She's going to nice and slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Now we have her one big closet. Go up. Right there. Hold it. I've done. You got it. Slow. Good job. Good job. Good job. See that back door. Why set. Get that opposite set up a little bit right there. There you go. Well. Hold that. Hold that. Hold that. She didn't even get to do this pose with a stand-alone. That's it. I don't know. I think I'll come to your show if you guess post. Yeah. I don't know. There you go. I think about it. If you guys want to see her guest post getting the comments below. Because honestly, I would love for her to go out on her own show. So when's the show next? Me, there you go. So make three at the land in Georgia. Right? Right. So you fly into Atlanta. That's right. How far is the road? 30 minutes. 30 minutes. And then we're going to talk more about her show. But let me know if you think that she should guess post. Because I think she guess post. The research analytics are that sick. That everybody thinks that Julian's got better genetics. Like the best out there. This is the one that we're going to talk about on the podcast. And why I believe she has the best genetics in history of body. So he is like a lot of body. So really, really good. Very kind of. Yes. Is genetics all the rest? Like it's like, yeah. When I first saw you train, but for some, I was like, what the hell? It just would be everything I did together. All right. Okay. I just thought I could do one. All right. This is it. So the last thing on this, make it count. We're going to try to go for five. You guys, do the best you can. Okay? You got it. We got this. Remember, bend your knees, crush your ankles. And then go on. That's it. Yeah. Go. Good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You got that. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. It's a little bit of help. There you go. Good. Good. Again. Good. Up. Up. Good. Very good. Up. Up. Up. Right there. Hold. Now you need to do a five second descent. Yeah. Good. Yeah. Four. Three. Come out. Two. One. Just stretch. Good job. That's how you work. Good. Now back to the vice. There you go. Because you know, we got to throw it in the pose. Did you? Did you? Did you? Did you? Did you? Did you? You did. You did. You did. You did. You did. Boom. There you go. That's it. There you go. There you go. There you go. Look. It's a little nervous. There you go. Ooh. Look at that. Look at that. Be tapered guys. He's going to be at her show because she's gone down and so. Let me see if I'm done with my stuff. He's going to eat from the front. Yeah. Both of you. Wait. There you go. And put it in the trunk of this on just a tree. Do a little bit of a leg out there. Okay. Boom. There you go. We're going to picture in the middle. Okay. Just because. Just because. All right. We're saying this. I'll take a photo. Yeah. All right. That's it. It's not girls out because it takes away persona. It's just you, you are of machine. You do the work of solid. So how's your comment? It's popped. I can tell you how to go to why. I'm not going. You gotta go. Come a turf check now. Come a captive. Yeah. You have cops. Hold on. Hold on. Just get a serious number. There you go. There you go. There you go. Here. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. There you go. This is it. She's pushing class. She's on the E in bigger now, guys. She's on her place, me. She's so great. That's it. She's going to go back and forth. Yeah, I think this girl, which is the vision you're going to do. I'm going to be kidding one year. You ready to be kidding? I have to start for that to hear. I see you doing well on this before the evening. I definitely do. Yeah. The amount of time I want to take me to the meeting, I probably have to be like 115 now. Announcements being made right now. They're going to switch classes. She's going to do figure and she's going to do the meeting. Coming out of retirement, eight-time, misalempy along with going back to back. She's going to level up and bring it back down. There's going to be no level it out. Sorry, Kim. Don't have a heart attack. All right. We're done with that. So now let's talk a little bit about it's your back workout. Yeah, okay. So we threw in a little bit of, you know, Sid's style pull-ups. What do you normally do for back as well as doing a pull-down motion? I would say one of my favorite machine for phenomena is just one all the way over there. That has a big fence and grip. So we can venture into that. Otherwise we can just pull over. I always have a pull over in my name workout. Okay. Sure. Okay. Let's try your wanting first. How does it pull over? Since we're like in that and then we can just finish up with that. So what we're going to do is we did a pull-down slash pull-up. Now we're going to pull over stretch out those lats. The punata machine is fantastic. It's being able to really stretch out your lats. Some of the other manufacturers have good pull over machines. But this one tends to do really well at being able to get you a full stretch and a full contraction through a midway. So let's go. So we're just going to use the straps. Pour it in and use your hands on the bar. Just get it depending on how long your arms are. We have shorter, two-rex arms like mine. The straps come in handy. But you have longer arms. Good. Just make sure you lead with the elbows. Okay. You're going to go that. Okay. You can't be high around the feet. Your shoulders actually in line with the pivot point. Oh, the arrow back there. You can't come on just a tiny bit higher if you like. My boat is a little bit just one. There you go. That's fine, right? Yeah. That's fine. And then you remember to lead with the elbow. Good. Got this. Got this. There you go. Good. Stretch. And then you just do about three reps. And then we're going to do it without the stretch right now. Just do your thing. Okay. And then you do three reps with the straps. And then you see if we feel a difference. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'd rather the handles. And then pull with theirs. Yeah. Hold them just like that. Just like that. Just like that. Okay. There you go. They can really work because you're such a compact torso. You can put a pad in a little portion of that. I'm going to give you a little bit more stretch. Okay. Yes. All right, champ. That's easy. Go. You got champ. And we have champ champ champ champ champ champ. Yeah. Champ champ. Just a lot. Just very easy. Just a little champ. It's like. And now I'm prepping. Like it. Like it. Like it. Like it. Like it. Like it. Like it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit low. She's a little bit taller than you. Just a little just an inch or two. Good. She's a little even more than good. Like everything is connected. Like some grids don't have a slightly. Don't lie. How impressed were you with that for relaxed? Very best. The waist snap. That's right. I'm wearing a little waff waist. That's right. I saw the look in your eye. Yeah, you know, you can just use this plumbing. Yeah, like. There you go. Good job. Good job. Did you have a good experience feeling like you wanted to bounce? I've actually never used a belt on this. Ever. That's right. It just really keeps your hips back. Especially when you're heavy or it just what normally happens is the reason why you have a seat belt is that when you're heavy, you're, but it's going to want to come off. And then you lose the range of motion. And how? Because you're on stretching. So you strap down so that you keep your hips down. OK. So you have a better stretch. Usually you don't usually need to during the warm-up way. OK. When you go heavier, but we can play around with it a little bit. And also we can create a little bit more extreme stretch because if we add a little bit of that pad, it will get you forward so we can do that as well. OK. So we'll go ahead and try that. Let me get you a seat. So a little bit. I'll be right there. I'll be right there. I'll be right there. Yeah. That's about where it was. Yeah. That's where you liked it. You could be one lower depending on how it differs. Let's see what they're thinking about. Are you feeling good though? Great. OK. Perfect. Good. Cleaning, clean reps. Good. Feel a little more of that stretch. Yeah. That's what we do. And it falls up exactly right as I'm supposed to. Like there. Yeah. And then as you come down, get your hands a little further apart so you can go a little farther down, hast your quads. Oh, yes. Yes. They don't like that. OK. So you can just bring it down. You don't want to stop prematurely. OK. Just like that. Good. I thought that. Yeah. So when you do that, it's almost like showing off that Christmas tree pose that we got. You want to take a look at what you're bringing your elbows back. That's it. You're going to be like this on the same. That's it. That's right. That's right. That's right. What? What's going on over there? It's beginning to turn into. Yeah. Ooh. Squeeze. Yes. Good. That really helps with that contraction. Bring that elbows. Squeeze good. Good. And then those out through the mouth don't forget to breathe. Good contraction. Pause the bottom. Good. It's like that. Control the weight. Do not let it control you. Focus on the outcome. Think about how your back is going to be. Really nice and detailed on stage. Good. Control. Yes. Squeeze. Continue. Two, two, two. You got this. Drive. Yes. Yeah. Good. Nice stretch. Stretch.

Keep on moving. Nice. It's a... Easy. Easy. So strong. Good. Good. Squeeze. Good. Two more. Good. One more. You got one more. Come on. Easy. Go down and I want you to pause over. Let's go. When the water collapsed. One more. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Like that. Hold it. Right there. Hold it. Ooh, yeah. That's it. Put inside. We're doing it nice. Now we have. We're doing a nice negative at the very end. All you internet warriors out there that want to turn around and pick apart our techniques and say that there's a clinical studies on whatever or is that you think, me not work. Please continue to believe that. Oh, this one's great. So we have multiple styles of grip. So the more you seconate, the more you're going to feel like the lower lap. So you can go neutral. You go really neutral. Really seconation with being almost like a reverse feeling. So we should all be like, I don't see. I like to use all of them. But you know, see, I like to go neutral. And then I like to go out with a supinated grip. Yeah, so let's go here. So let's go here for you to set up there. See how it feels. But so, how you try it? 40-knowage, which we use pretty much. I want to take 25. I'm going to start with 35. But let's go to 35. I'm going to work there. Because I need my. I still do my hard to do that. You're five. I'm saying it's a different making. Because I really don't. I can't move. I'm in it. Let's go. Let's go. OK. OK. I'm trying to get your hips down. Left and the stretch. Yep. And then you're going to go in. You see how it turns. Yeah. Right away. That's, you know, I'm going to pull things up. OK. Yeah. And just pull things up. OK. OK. OK. Come on. That's it. Your focus. Good. There you go. So as you're coming down, but pull good. Excellent. Stretch, stretch, and pull. You long get that muscle. You long get it down. No way. You're pretty good. And then go all the way up. You want to stretch. Stretch, stretch, and then pull. Good job. Good. There you go. Yeah. Mine are discomfort. You come. Pull the measure. Try to keep stomach. Perfective. Double egg. She's training. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. That's better. Good. There you go. Pull. Good. That's it. Now show how easy it is. Good. She's a lost stronger. Yes. She looks. I tell you. She goes in there and tries to play all day deep. Take a little leg. Goal fish and little pepito like easy. And then all the sudden she comes out. She like a cactus. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Hard to go. Let's go. Let's go. One more. One more. That's it. That's it. There you go. There you go. It's so easy. She's just in motion. She's just big. Her. No, so you can do that way. No. She's like a point. She's like a point. She's like a point. She's like a point. That was easy. I thought it was a point. This is not it. This is not easy. This is more of a point. You guys haven't used the machine before. Yeah. You're really trying to get rid of it. If you try to get rid of the competition. Good. Oh. It's like a little roller coaster. Yeah. I like it. I don't like it. Good stretch. Good stretch. I'll be able to go right here. Good. Good. You're the burn. Good. Good. I'm going to do the final two reps. But I want you to do the one you keep. I'll break the hair. Okay. And then bring your arms to you. And pull like that. There you go. And then stretch. And then pull. Pull. It was back one more. Just like that. And then bring your elbows back. Go. Good job. There you go. Good. It's going to make that back to my simple give matter. That other day it gives something else. It looks like right away. It gives more middle. Yeah. Yeah. Like all through. Especially because my curve and my spine is a little bit higher. So it gives all my stabilizers and muscles in there. It makes you my spine taste straight. So that that helps. It helps. It helps. It helps. It helps. It just makes sure everything just kind of walks in. All those muscles in between. I'll work into. Yeah. What's up with this? I don't know. I don't know. You don't put it on there. I believe it. Put it down. You're good. I don't believe you. You got it. Get small. There you go. Get small. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You got like both of y'all. What are you doing? Why are you doing? Back home by self-stage. There you go. You got it. All right. Let's go. It's between the ears. Yep. And then pull. That's it. There you go. Good. It's nice to have a chat. We need to do the full release. We have to understand to move about. Good. Come on. Here. You look good. Yep. All the way. That's it. There you go. There you go. It's just to the neck. Hold on. You got this. Good. Good. Good stretch. Good squeeze. Oh yeah. Hold on. You're trying to go back. I'm going to swing five. Good. Work out. Mark is over. You got it. Work out. Mark is over. Come on. Let's go. Work out. Come on. Good. A little stretch. Stretch. Control. And pull. Pull. Pull. Good. Two just like that. Come on. One more. You got this. You got it. Come on. You got this. Pull. Pull. All the way down. Good job. There you go. Hold it. It's stuck. Right. A barrier. So that's why I have to drop more. This one. I have to drop it. Go on. Yes. I'll just go to my own car. I'll just do the opposite. And kind of just know what those with another thing. Switch it. So that's how I do it. Because you got to do this. I can't say. So what we're talking about is when Laura Lee's going into her pose. Because I'm such an excellent pose. Like it's a bikini. I'll go out. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Go ahead. Go to your pose. Right there. So right there. Watch this. Boom. So because you're used to doing one side of all time. What you're seeing is it becomes dominant on that side. Now again, they don't usually go back and forth. So when proper coaches when it comes to posing are coaching you. They're going to tell you to do what? That's right. So you're going to go to that side. It's going to feel completely like completely out of character. But when you do that, all it happens is your body completely transforms and you're able to get both sides to be able to actually balance out. But it feels super strange. Very strange. Very strange. Very strange. Right. Because you get a dominant side when it comes to your del. You're trapped in your lap because you're constantly just hitting that side. So even the lower body. So what you want to do is balance it out by being able to do poses on both sides. And so therefore you don't have an in balances. Yes. And training on it. Training on it. Training on it. Definitely training too. That's really the problem. Yeah. I think a lot of people too. I noticed when a lot of the goal asks me questions. I'm like, why do you do so much? What are I'm working on? And I'm like, and you're not doing that? You can't go through all of your workouts. Only doing bilateral work. You never know where your weakness is. Actually, you do one arm at a time. One leg at a time. One boot at a time. Just so you can see what's actually happening to your body. Especially if you're like me, I have a short leg. School girls. There's a lot of things. I got a counterbalance. Why have to do primary and unit a lot of work. Especially because of exactly what you just said. A lot of people don't even understand or even know if they have a lower dose. So when you have a school, you know, so you're going to do that. You're going to have a actual curvature in your back. So that's curvature. Many of us have slight school doses, but some others have a very major school doses. And then a lot of us is basically means the spine is actually going towards your belly button. And then that's going to give you possible distension or looks like it's essentially. But it's just what's happening as we turn sideways is that your back is actually curved towards your belly button, vertebrae. So that's what the difference between school doses and lower doses. So you have to work around those things, especially if you have them, so that you can be able to create a properly balanced physique. That's why back days are a mess for me. And when I retire as I say like I'm training for life, if I were to ever stop doing back workouts, my quality of life is going. Like when my was first diagnosed with school doses, I had a 41-degree curve that was 40 degrees at the time away from getting surgery for my spine. So I wore a brace 18 hours a day, all the way up to my chest had to sleep in it, eat in it. Only time took it off with for basketball, cheerleading and track practice. So when you're doing that, that's what the weight lifting becomes important because those muscles are what pushed my spine straighter. Those muscles are what they're my posing better in that all started in the gym and training that makes sure I was focused on those details. So that way I look symmetrical. Nobody knew I had a short leg, but I could tell it to my friends. I know what leg is supposed to be where I know where I have to put my other foot on my other heel to make it look like it's. The same and it really wasn't. So people like I'll sit your profile and I'm like, okay, I'm not. Nobody is. But you can make it look as close apart as you can. So that's why it's just all in the position. That's right. Good. That's a good. I'll put it out. I should do one more breath. Now put the weight back. That one will change up. There you go. Now this is the way of showing you how much you're different. You've got to lower latin gauge. Do you feel that? Yeah. Good. Good. Nice control. Nice squeeze. Excellent. Watch the third. Do you want to bring your hands into your upper body? Good. Stretch. And squeeze. Excellent. Three more. One. Good. Two. One more. Good. Come on, sit. You got one more. Nice. Squeeze. Called it. Good job. Good job. Excellent. Woo. Now let's see. The 80s. So let's go over here. You got the good light right there. There you go. There you go. It's actually hurts. It does. Yeah. If you get your back and so pumped up. Now turn around. Let's see that back last breath. There you go. Good. Pull it out. Pull it out. You shoulders there. More. Just up. There you go. That's it. Shoulders up. Like that. Boom. Hold that. Hold that. Yeah. You're going to get used to that. You're going to get you supposed to get her show. Remember? Right outside of Georgia. And it may. Twenty twenty six. Woo. Good job. Oh. Fall all the way down. That's it. That's it. That's what I long as I couldn't do. Watch out, vibree. Right. I couldn't feel anything like like low back. Why? Because I think it's my neurons were so shut off. My low doses. Because I literally just learned to stop feeling down there. So that way everything just stays in place. You don't have to really worry about it. Because you don't fill it in the exist. So you just keep going through life. Figure it out. But then like the last couple of years. I started doing different styles of training. And I got back in touch with like the spiral records all the way down. Because it actually benefited my posing in my glutes and my hamstrings. Just a bullet of connection again. Like you feel like you lift it everything up. Like you bring it up. Yeah. Everything. Get my blood. Bring some extra together. Yeah. Because I was already really strong. I'm so much more in my strong food. My entire life. But it pulled everything together. Just made it just like flow really well. Which is crazy because you take somebody who's got lordosis, scoliosis. And then now it's your strongest body part. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. Yep. I'm telling you. All right. Let's go. Last one. Come on, big slow. All right. So we're going to do this grip. So we're going to have more of that supinated trip. Okay. See how that feels. Higher there, the grip. You have it. You had it higher. Yeah. Let's go. Good. Let's go. Good. You want to be down. I know. I know. Good. You got it. Come on. Nice. Two. Oh yeah. You can definitely see a difference. That little feel that little lot. Nice. Two. Yeah. You can definitely see a difference. That little feel that little lot. Yeah. Good. Yeah. Good. And. Keep it more tight. More tight. More tight. I can throw that ready. Good. Troll. There. You can see that you have that lower light in gear. You're going through the range of motion. Good. There you go. Good. Excellent. Good. You going? Good. Good. You going? Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep it. Stretch it. You're going to stretch it a little more. Stretch it a little more. There you go. You're going to a little more than that. Come on, really. That's better. That's better. Keep it butt down. Now pull. Now pull. Now go slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Excellent job. Beautiful. Beautiful. All right guys. So we're talking a little bit about why you wouldn't want to do too much of this. As a bikini competitor. Just we've been joking about this because again we have a champion, a time champion, fair competitor training with the current bikini champion but she wouldn't do this all the time. Because if you end up over developing your lower lats then you can actually build a little more blockiness. So again this is just going through one workout with a couple of sets to be able to still stimulate that area but if you would do that over and over again doing the Ben over rows like I have my professional bodybuilders do reverse grip that's going to really thicken that up. If you're doing one on dumbbell rows that's going to thicken that up doing those T bar rows but I was joking about early on. Those are great for anyone that really needs to fill in. So if you are a bikini competitor that has a completely flat back you're going to want to do it more often. But when you're at the top of the game and you're just slightly dialing in your body parts you want to be able to have that long statuous look. So it's that feet taper starting at the very very top and just tapering right towards your midsection and then flaring out on the legs once again. So you wouldn't be doing this over and over again if you already have muscular development through your torso. So that's where the refinement comes in. So once you go over there pose again and then we'll do a front end of back. There you go. There you go. Go back up, pack up. All right. I'm going to do my same voice. Okay ladies. I did a same with my client. Stop up and watch the front end of the stage. Yeah back up back up and then we'll stop. So back back back back back back back back back. And then we're going to watch the front end of the stage. Good. There you go. Yeah. Boom. Good. So we got shoulder width. So waist. shoulders. Pretty nice and round 13 weeks out. That's what you want. You don't want to be flat at 13 weeks out. You still want to be full. You got the waist coming in because you want to start making sure that you're leaning out. So you're being out properly. You want some nice fullness in the quad as well as a hand straight in. So everything looks very proportionate. And you have that V taper from here down to the midsection. So that's what's really really important. So timing is everything. If you get too lean too fast, you're going to lose the muscle. And not getting lean enough. You're not going to be lean enough on stage. So the key is to have proper timing. So again, now it's going to back. Now let's go ahead and move the hair just for the sake prosperity here. Boom. You can see. There you go. So shoulders. Look in nice nice V taper. You can see that she's got just some good tone through the triceps. She has slight bit of muscularity to the point where she's just very feminine muscle. And it became a competitor. It's super important not to be over muscled because you can end up losing that feminine look. So be very, very careful. And then you're going to break lower back. Again, round full glutes, hamstrings. And then she's going to focus on leaning out in the next 12 to 13 weeks. To get that great hamstring tie-in where it's tight but not shred it because again, work for your particular category. So that's it. Anything else you want to add? Chair? No. Blucer great bapes. Off it is. Off it is. I have no. There you go. Hey, job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it.
