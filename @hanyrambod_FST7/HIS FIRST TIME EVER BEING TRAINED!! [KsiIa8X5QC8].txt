Okay, go. Come on here. Oh, yeah. All the way through. All the way through. All you. All you. All you go. Go. Finish it. Finish it. Right? Right? Yeah. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. All right, guys. I am here with a special guest. We just happened to running into each other last night. We'll use, I'll tell you, where on a different occasion. Maybe because it does not go along with a gym. But it is something that everybody's been doing. It's a good club. Exactly. I'm gonna say this stuff's so bad on the show. It's gonna be so good. But Jared Feather for those of you that know it's either Jared Feather when he has this haircut or checkleadel. And checkleadel is definitely not as big as Jared is. What do you check on him? Yeah. But Jared. Yeah, definitely. But you definitely look better than he does. In terms of bodybuilding, Jared is very known for RP. I guess, you know, degree in physiology. Master's, he's done a lot of work. Just really, really, very, very smart, individual. Very studious who loves to break down and build up different training systems. And don't each other for several years. But never really got a chance to stay on talk. We did last night. And he said, hey, I've got a, you know, he was gonna work out this morning. I said, let's go. Let's do this. And came by the Jimmy was staying like what? Four minutes away. Literally. Yeah. I was right behind the place where I saw you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm telling you this story about the, where you saw me. But yeah, just quick little background on your bodybuilding career. Where did you learn pro? So I was a natural pro from like 2014 to 2018. OK. And then I went, I computed in the NPC and I turned pro in 2020. OK. In classic physique. So I've been in I've been a pro for four years now. OK. In my last place is like fifth place and my credit bureau. So I'm okay. So yeah. And that was when was that 2022? That was really, OK. And basically right now, how far are you from the cap? Like two or three pounds. And like three or four weeks out. OK. And right now three or four weeks out from the either, I'll do your row bar. I'll do the RTV, which is an account. OK. So that's the 31st or the 14th of September. OK. So it's three or four weeks out. And nobody's ever put you through a workout. No, man. Never. And you're 30, 31. 31 years old now. No one's ever put him through a workout. And I think that a lot of you might have recognized him or RP and Renaissance modernization with Dr. Mike Isratell. And you guys put on a ton of really cool content. They really, really cool stuff. And definitely got to get together with Mike. Because this is going to be a good one. I'm sure he's been on a little bit of peanut butter and jelly right now. Yeah. Well, we both have a lot of respect to him. And we bring up a lot. And especially when we're talking about great coaches and industry, so this will be a great time outside of the world. Yeah. It's going to be a good one. And obviously we'll put the link down for all his social and down below. So that way, you can go ahead and follow Jared on his journey because I can't wait to see how you do because I know that he's always in shape and he's always training hard and always working on trying to get the maximum out of his physique without the use, heavy use, obviously, of the farm side. And which I'm a huge believer on as you guys all know. And I preach all the time. You want to get the maximum out of the natural part of bodybuilding, which is the healthier part. And now there is a dark side to it, but you try to minimize that by being able to really rely on the gym and the kitchen and being able to dial that in properly so that that way you can people to have a long, really healthy career. So let's do this. Oh yeah, let me hear. I'll be here and I just push my chest out. I'm coming back. Okay. And then same thing as you, excuse me. There. So with us. Good. Like what you do? Yeah. Like you said super smart for people who are especially on stage, they're hard to do poses, which I honestly am probably one of those guys. Yep. We emphasize a lot on the deep stretch portion, right? And we hang out on the bottom for a while. So you'll see a lot of my stuff. I'm like hanging out back here, hanging out down here, same with curls. I'm really trying to get the deep stretch. So you're basically doing it way under load. Right? Where? Yeah. Got it. So always, the first couple of sets here, what I believe is just kidding, what going, just warming everything up, again, we need to do a lot to warm shoulders or anything like that, which is kind of going through it. And using the first couple of sets, just to really increase blood flow to the area, nice stretch. And work on your breathing, not holding your breath. Especially a lot of beginners. They really tend to hold their breath in multiple reps. You don't want to do that. You understand, I just just Pacific warm-up. Okay, so I'm going to do a lot of general warm-up, I thought it looks like some risks curls, I'm just really, yeah. And because they're doing those nice and stretches, the nice thing about it is you probably don't have a lot of children. So the key is, especially if you're a beginner intermediate, start getting that full range of motion now because as you get bigger, you're going to get tighter. And as you get tighter, you're going to be more injury prone and you're not going to be able to get really maximum muscle growth because you're not getting full range of motion. So two things happen. Number one, you're more likely to get hurt because, again, you have to just short range of motion. And number two, you're not going to get all of the development. So when you're doing those partial squats, you're not going to get full development of your legs. And then when you're doing all of those short ranges of motion, you're going to be definitely not increasing the muscle size and fullness that you could with a deeper stretch. Full range of motion. Right now, carbohydrate-wise, we are, let's say, the light build is just like a regular gypsy. So this is a carbeline base. So 25 grams of carbohydrate per scoop comes in several things. And you said, we have unflavored, strawberry lemonade, it is probably the latest risk. It's great what-this is-the-great year. She's all right and that's fine wine. So that's a great year. You can have me picked one out. So you're fine wine. How does that taste? Six million kilometers, okay? That's really good. ...the heroine. All right, honey? What would you try on you...? I'm kind of close to the for you. It's a hydration product about a two and a half to one ratio of sodium Good potassium, but it's got a nitropic in it. So it's got citricoline and it's also You've got about 1.25 grams of tarry and then it's my hydration product even all prep friendly because everything that design is all for So even the two to one ratio is more yeah Well, you don't want the potassium to high is you don't want it too high because also You might hope when you're loading with it You don't want to end up having to throw off a potassium ratio when you turn around and you pull your water Your potassium will be high especially when you're carving up with high potassium foods like potatoes So what's up guys honey rampod here 24-time Olympia winning coach and I want to introduce you to the newest product in the Evigen family of Products we have the new hydration if you're into hydration like I am you really know the importance of making sure to add Electrolytes back in before and after workouts Which really important is not just the electrolytes, but also the fact that it's sugar free caffeine free contains no artificial dies and I added in a new trope I put in CDP otherwise known as C2Coline to be able to help you with focus without the use of caffeine So it comes in two amazing flavors lemon lime as well as strawberry lemonade Check it out eVageenutrition.com as well as all eVgenolete retailers worldwide So we're gonna go ahead and do this set Think pick a wait that you feel that you can be able to do about 10 to 15 reps with and what we're gonna do is We're gonna go a little bit beyond that just so I might give you some four strokes And then we're gonna just change up. We're gonna do a couple of reps that are just standard reps With the regular range of motion Then what we're gonna do is you're gonna just follow my hand and I'm just gonna put you through a little bit different variation of being able to try to go through a little bit lower mid and up Oh boy And don't forget to open that set There you go. Good squeeze Good Light wing. Let's go. Come on, babe push good stretch good squeeze great range of motion Good Good One One more that's it now we need a little I need a down Put Good然後 Back Squeeze together. Go, go, go, go, go. Good. Again, a little higher stretch. And squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Again, again, now we're gonna bring down just a little bit. Go down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, together, come on, come on, come on, come on, go and go lower. You got it down here, you can do it down here. You can do it down here. Go, again, again, come on. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, together, hold it, hold it. Now slow, slow, slow, slow, good, good, hold that. Hold that stretch, hold that stretch. A little bit forward, a little bit more forward. Squeeze, squeeze, push. Right there, hold that, hold that, hold that, hold that, and back. Okay, good, that's what I would consider the first working set. Okay, and we do one more that. What was that face coming up, face? There you go. Oh, good, good, how'd that feel? How'd that feel compared to what you're doing? So they can get it. Well, reference one. So we're big fans of like, reps and reserve, depending on where we are in the training sector. We say I have three more hard weeks, and I want to be able to progressively overload. As far as volume goes in the gym, I'm not usually pushing that close to failure this early, but because of the working sets are so low, genuinely that's fine. So my R-I-R is generally like three, two, one, depending on, why should we explain my R-R? Just reps and reserve. Okay, so like week one or two of my mess of cycle, or what people consider like a training block, I'm doing something like three in the tank for most of my work he says. It might get done like two. Okay, so just so you guys know, let's go into our failure. Okay, so again, you're speaking your language. So reps in the tank basically means that you can do three more and you're stopping. So just so you know, that's basically, again, love language. Yeah, it's a lesson to take people who in power looking call it, or they call it RPE. Yeah, right, yeah. Yeah, so every training perceived exertion, exactly. So again, there's a lot of acronyms for it. Basically, I like to simplify things. But you would, where you would be able to do reps and reserve would be, I could do it done three more. If I pushed all the way to absolute failure. Yeah. Good. Make sense. There you go. Good to go. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So now the one thing that I do tend to do is I, what I preach, is making sure that you get your heart rate down. Yeah. So, okay, get up. Yeah. He's not used to being coached. He's used to being coached. Now we're way longer, so I'm just like, yeah, you want to go now? No, no, no, no. We would late, wait, because again, on the FSC7 portions of it, what we're doing is we're trying to do is we're trying to actually work within a set amount of seconds. It's 30 to 45 seconds. These are not FSC7s. These are straight sets. Now, for me, straight sets for me means basically that you can take up to two, maybe even three minutes, because what you're doing is you're trying not to go into fatigue, you're going to failure. So you do not want your cardiovascular system to be so taxed that it's going to lower the amount of weight that you normally could have used on your next set. So rest up enough so that you can be able to maximize the poundages. That's it, open your mouth. Good. Ah, it's good. You're not just going to do that. One more there. A good job, good job. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. S confidential. Okay. S its temporary. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, you got one more. Come on, you got just in you. Come on, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, all one more. Okay. Stretch and squeeze. I'll keep it down. Good, good, good drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, hold it. Squeeze that chest, you know? Right there, right there, squeeze, slow, slow, slow, slow. Good, now partial, go. Good, good, good, good. Again, again, go, come on, you're, again, two more. Two more, like that, squeeze, come on, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. One more, one more, drive it together, together, go. All the way down, all the way down. All the way down, all the way down, all the way right there. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, good job. Good job. Good, catch your breath. All right, catch your breath. Now think yourself on stage, do your call out. Right, let's see what, the most most clear we're going to go ahead and really put some time to attention in there. Okay, so see how you're coming in, don't do that. Get your last out one, that's good. That's how you go. There you go. There you go. Relax, relax, go. Relax, go. One last pose is going to be your most muscular. We're going to come in and I want you to do a crab loss, my skill. Let me see what that looks like. There you go. Good chest up a little bit. Right there, squeeze that, squeeze your chest, squeeze your chest, squeeze your chest, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Squeeze, come on, don't let go, don't let go. You got five more seconds for three, squeeze, two, one. Good job. There you go. There you go. So that's your second working set. And that's also basically just really focusing on making sure that you're building your conditioning for stage. Because many people don't do that, that's why they start sweating. That's why they're not making, they're shaking. Because these are the things that you actually do on stage that you don't do in the gym, especially when you consider it homework. Because most people don't like to do their homework. I think three or four years ago commenting on a lot of our videos like, somebody needs to develop a Smith machine that's like a chamber bar. And then I think that years we've been not a criminal at this piece. I was probably basically having that. Yeah. So that's cool that he did this. Yeah, the dual Smith machine's awesome. Yeah, again, we love Smith machines. You know, there's a lot of really good things, but what if we want to go pass that with the point of view shots? Was there a line that had something like this when you were going up and body building? Yes, there was. There was. Well, the signer saw it. Not on the Smith side. There was no independent Smith. That was very novel. Not that I had seen. Everything that we really like was like old non-lissers cool, you know, whether it was pullover, whether it was like, you know, some of the flex equipment. That flex press is amazing. Yeah. Chris has got one of those at his home gym. And those are really, but none of them were Smith machine base. I know. Not the ones that I ever saw. Yes. Yeah. That's really fast. Smith machine base. There we go. Good. Drive. Good job. Good. Good. Just blow. Good. Good. Driving. Good. Drive. Good. Good. Driving. Good. Driving. Good. Driving. Good. Driving. Good. Driving. Good. Good. Let's go. Let's go. One. One. Good. Good. All the way through. All the way through. This is all you. All you. All you go. Finish it. Finish it. Right there. That's it. Oh. Look. Huh. Huh. I was tough. Yeah. It's like he's got like five more and then just like no one. Yeah. All right. I'm going to drink. You got to get right the ice cream sandwich. Yeah. Frozen. Let's go. Next. Good. Have you had an edge of creamy? Yeah. You do? You have an edge of creamy? Oh, but let's get it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to do it. Yeah. Yeah. So she'll use that one and then she'll use the term. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Yeah. It's all about the shit. Yeah. It's term to sue isolate. That's off of it. Like I said, it's over. With this, it feels like it's part of your cream. Right. And that's why I incorporated into the FST7 Flexets. Right. Because when you incorporate it into part of training, you don't feel like you have to go with a secret, traditional, losing 30 minutes. You can turn around and get much more out of it. Of course, you're doing it when it's the hardest. Yes, right. Which is awesome because you're already taxed. Yeah. And if you're messing the poses up when you're just posing, but you can get them perfect when you're doing a flexet. Like you're probably going to do the perfect on stage. It's going to be an effortless. That's right. So it is, it's really cool. It's, it's sports signs. We call it specificity. So it's the most specific thing you can do. Being tired and posing with perfection is the most specific thing that you're going to do on a body of the stage. Well, people don't understand it smart. It's such an important part of bodybuilding. But nobody wants to turn around and build a do it. And it's just like ridiculous because you either they won't do it or they'll do it separately away from the workout. And then they don't understand that what you're doing is you're trying to actually do it in the way. And then the thing that you're doing is you're going to be the most taxing, which is when you're training. So you don't do any of this on stage. But you do the stuff that you're supposed to, which is posing on stage. And but nobody likes to do that. But that's the actually what the rent, the end result is supposed to be. I think so this is actually a really cool snippet because I can say one of the things that I got wrong in my essay is that I said one of the bad things is that flexing is really hard. Between your sets will lead to set performance decreasing in the session, which is bad because you want to put all the effort and the glycogen for the session into the sets. And that's how you maintain your muscle tissue. But I also was going to be assumption that the rest periods were all shorter. So we're resting long enough between the sets that when I do that. And it's at the end, it's a last set. It's not actually interfering in that much of the session right now. So that's really fucking cool because that is definitely one of the things that I got wrong. While going through it is what I mean to the big difference. I understand that's why I was like, hey, let's do this. Yeah, it's cool man, I really pisses fun. That's awesome. All right. Let's do this. Okay, let's do your last work in set. So what we're going to do is we're going to go through to failure. And then we're going to go ahead and be able to really, I'm going to help you with sitting some positive positive. And then we're going to get you going really slow on last civil negatives. Okay, let's go. Good job, Territ. Up. Good. Here you go. Try. Good. I'm going to move it. Control and try. Good. Good. Go. Go. Go. Go. Try. Drive. Drive. Can you help you a little bit? I'm going to be going to have nice slow slower, even slower. Even slower. Even slower. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Now just slowly come down and there we're going to lock it on the down position right there. Right there. Okay. All right. That's the reference again. All right. Let's do a box-post muscular right there. You guys are good lighting here. Good. I bumped it back. Hold that. You got five seconds right there. You're going to hold it and push it right to that chest. Push it right to that chest. Five, four, three, two, three, four. Relax. More. Like that. There you go. I'm taking this up. Pull it in. Good. There. Squeeze that chest. You need to squeeze your arm. Go. Now you're going to pose. Now you've got five seconds from this point. Right in there. Five, four, three, two. Good job. Relax for a second. Catch your breath. And it's your catch-up. If you're going to have a lot more food on your own state. So you're going to have to keep that core tight. Good. Good. How are you going to that side chest? There you go. Archer back to it. There you go. Good. You take your tight. Squeeze that upper chest in here. Good. Squeeze. Squeeze. That's it. Squeeze it. That's it. Squeeze it. Look at that pump. Look at that pump. Hold that. Hold it. Three, two. Good job. Good job. There. Right there, squeeze. Squeeze. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Eight to ten. Yeah. Eight to ten. Ooh. So Mike's never put you through over now. So if he does, it's something I pick. Okay. So like the first time that I met him in the gym and college, I was doing work I already. He's like, he's like, he's like the first time I kind of showed me crazy orange emotion stuff. And I was already doing like barco curls and he changed a couple of like techniques that I was doing. So like that type of thing. Yeah, I've done. But like letting somebody take over my sessions completely and like, I'm going to do something. The first time I'm up to cherry. Absolutely. It's good though man. It's like how was this telling him in the camera? Mike Ramall could put anybody. They she wanted through the heart assistant of their life. Sure. Because all she got through is pointed to machine and then ask you how you feel afterwards. Go do that for like five sets of 10. How do you feel? I'm fine. Put that one. Right. And he's walk out of the gym. Messed up. Right. But that's not what we do at our pee. So you do you're trying to teach people stuff. Correct. You're trying to actually take something away from the session. Whether that's see how hard posing is during your sets. Right. See what it feels like when you have a pump and you continue pushing the tab lights into that tissue. Yes. So it's not just like a chain of trainers pride themselves and that type of shit. Yes. Would you train me man? You're going to mess up your week. Okay man. Yeah. It was funny because I understand being yesterday. You guys trash myself more. But I just feel better today. I'm just, you know, just, you know, the only any attitude you know, stimuli doing it. 100% doing it. And 100% really about because it's about what how much you can recover from. Yep. Right. And that's the key. You want to try to create a little bit different stimulus so that you can be able to grow because you should something slightly different and that's why I get the posing for me as part of it. And being able to do those types of things. But at the end, it's really about making sure that you can recover from it. Because if you're so trash, the turn that can be back in the gym for so long. The chances are you're not going to come back for a long period of time. I'm trying to stretch. I think I'm ready. Yeah. You're not ready for the posing. Yeah. This is going to, yeah. You're really thinking about it. Which is daunting. You're going to start loving you. Let's go. Love, hate relationship. Let's go. Come on here. Stretch the squeeze. Right. We're going to go all the way. Perfect. Good. And drive. Good. Good. Such a deep stretch. Good. There you go. That's it. Good. Squeeze that. Good. I've got to drive it all the way. With that mind, my connection and drive. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Good. Drive it. Drive it. Drive it. Drive it. Drive it. Okay. Come with me now. Good. Good. Slow. Slow. Hold this way. Hold that way. Good. Good. Hold it. Hold it. Slow. Slow. Slow. Hold that. Hold that. Hold it. You better hold it. You better hold it. Good job. Oh. Oh my god. Oh my god. Yeah. Right there. You know that? So, okay. So, what you're going to need to do is when you get home, your right lap is bound. Okay. It's bound up into your territory. Your left isn't. So, you can see that. So, you're going to need to get some muscle work done on there. So, an RT on that. I'll show you some stuff that you can do on that. That's not what you're going to do on that. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I like to tear the muscles. But I do not want to be able to create some act of therapy that's going to help stimulate both because it becomes like velcro, right? Those muscles are so bound up. You really need to get some muscle work done. So, we'll talk about that. But that's something that needs to be done, especially on that right lathe. I could tell. Yeah. And it's probably hindering your growth. I feel when I'm doing like any sort of right. And you've been, basically, your back is probably the place you need to grow the most. And that's something that can really help the growth because you feel and to get that muscle work done. We'll create that client ability to build a help grow into that. And that's why you need to get some deep tissue done and an RT done. Because from bodybuilders being wide and sleeping on their sides, they tighten up a ton through your upper lathe to your terries. And that's why you end up getting a lot of bound up tissue. Good. Still kept the fullness of your chest in natural. I know, right? Yeah. That's awesome. Good. Good. So now we're getting into that. So we should get into that. So we should get everything into the right medium. Little bit on there. You go. Yeah. Just there. Just keep it right on that. And just do me there. Just a little bit. A little bit. That would be nice. Very good. Good. Not showing you something little more. Because now that you're bringing the help of also doing it. And we're going to go into that right. And we're just going to get that. It's making some noise. So what do you think we do that such as? I hate the way it makes me look. Like, nice. I don't know. I've always been kind of more crunch so that I'm showing off a week. Yeah. But look, you need to. Yeah. So when you're going into that, you're getting really deep. So what I suggest to you is going to be. And then. And then that way is dynamic. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Okay. So. So when you go into it, set your feet. Always go casa. Good. Push it. You're not picking your death. But some way. There. Now you're pushing the way. You can get so that when you're sandwiching the two. Perfect. So you say, if you're first. Yep. Go. And then. Yeah. And blow that out. If you've been a portrait back a little bit. There. What you got to keep that in your mouth. Good. Like that. New routine. Like that. Oh. That's better. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. Okay. Hold that. There you go. Time right there. Good. Don't let me. Good. Hold that. Good. Oh. Look at that. Watch. Yeah. Go. Go. Go ahead. It's struggling front. Go ahead. And you're in a low row. Good. Condition looks good there. And then. Hold. Hold. Hold. Chest. Yeah. Chest. Oh. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Again. I just had a lot of work on my own. And I was just like taking like information from kind of from body orders and the gym and just trying to put it together. In my own. And you know. And I just. And I just. And I just. I did. So when you were younger. I got a coach. No. I didn't. You're like that was it. That was a close. I ever had. And he just kind of taught me some basics of just like posing and stuff like that. And I was just like. I don't know how to be like. So what I did was I just try to like. I started from the basics again. I'm a teenager. It was barthor Jones. It was like, you know, it was all of those. You know, men's are hard for Jones principles. Learning about dad. And all the aspects of nutrition, stuff. And how arching and the more. And you know, the. And you know, the. And that's the. Because everything we get is natural. And that's what I'm. So I'm. I think. So when I was 14. So I was always afraid of drugs. Yeah. I was like. I'm probably. So I was. That. That. And. And we should do that. Yeah. You know. So I was just like. Now. You know. And that's. Why? Why? Because I fucking obsessed. We're lying. It's all just sugar. Yeah. I'll just product to the sugar. Yeah. That's good. That's really. I'm. I feel bad. There. There. Look at me walking away with all the. Put the lottery here. Two. Hell. Isn't nice. Yeah. Good. All right. Guys. So we just got finished up. What do you think? So. Seriously. First time again. Anyone point through a session. A lot of things I said as far as like. Somebody who is here to teach you stuff and not just like. Mess you up. Rack you. Yeah. Which is super easy. And that's what have to people do. Like any guru that ever seen. Putting people through sessions on YouTube or whatever. It's like. Okay. So if they're just doing 80 sets of. Whatever. Right. So this is nice. Because it's very similar. What we do on the RPG channel. Teaching the techniques. Telling you why. And not just throwing the ball you. Kitchen sink it to you. Like it's truly for purpose. So I appreciate the hell out of the thoughtfulness. Yeah. So we have a lot to go into. You know, a little bit of the stuff. Even your supplements. Like it's really cool. Now. And it's great to have you because again, having that dialogue was huge. Because most of the time. My guys are either deep in prep or we're sitting there just being. I'm sure we'll shit back and forth. But we don't get to talk a little bit about the science. Imperical evidence. All of those things kind of mixed together and being able to really geek out on it while we're training and being able to see someone that's also doing it. So, you know, I respect this shit out of you because you're doing both. And again, three and a half weeks of show. And maybe one more. Question. Yeah. Maybe do like some more. Awesome. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
