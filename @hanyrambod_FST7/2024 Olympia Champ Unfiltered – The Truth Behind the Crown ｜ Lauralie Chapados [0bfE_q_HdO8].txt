Welcome to the truth podcast. I'm your host, honey, Rambad, and I have none other. This is your return. This is your second time here. Lowerly the queen of bikini. Welcome back. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm so nervous. I'm why are you nervous? So I realized that there are first podcasts together that people are actually watching. Okay. Yeah, thanks. I don't know if the take that as a compliment or not. People are actually watching. You had more than a hundred people, more than a thousand people. Yes, a lot. And just kind of, I mean, saying like great comments don't get me wrong, but I was like, I don't look back at my things. Do you ever think about getting your things? No. Right? You don't. So it's like, okay. But then you have people that actually come into gym and just regular. They're just like, I watched your podcast this morning. I'm like, oh, no, you didn't spend your morning with my voice in your here. But it's like, they loved it. They enjoyed it, but now I'm nervous. I'm like, yeah, I'm nervous. There's nothing to be nervous about. We just got done training. We got lowerly here for the open gym weekend. So what we're doing is actually at Evision. We had a select number of people that we are brought into the gym for Saturday. And so though by the time you listen to this, you're probably already see the pictures on the Evision channel where we had an open gym. And we're bringing axle is here right now. He got to the training with me a little bit earlier than we did. We got Sid coming into Maro, we're supposed to have Jared feather coming into Maro. This is going to be cool. So we have a really good crew. And what's exciting is the fact that you, the last time you were here, you were getting ready for the Olympia. And now you are Miss Olympia. So congratulations, first of all. Thank you. Thank you so much. I want to say thank you for having me because it's always such a great opportunity to be in your presence. Like, I really, really am so grateful for that. So grateful for being part of, you know, Evision, but it's also so meaningful that I won. You know, the title that I've been working so hard for being an Evision athlete. So thank you for having me. I'm so excited for this weekend. And I would love to take all the credit for the fact that you won, but literally you hit we're just knocking at the door. You hit one, three, Arnold classics. And you're right on the cusp, you know, working with Kim, working with your boyfriend and working together as a team. And you guys just really dialed it in. And I loved that we were able to really witness and be a part of your journey. And it means a lot for me because I obviously with me coaching so many people myself and then being able to not only have Sid, but now also having you as part of the team. It makes a huge, huge difference. And your feedback is always amazing. Like you about flavor systems, up out to products, about how you use them, you just give really good perspective. And so again, having you here as a champion and being able to highlight that is great because I know originally you were thinking about going straight into the Arnold. And I do want to touch on that a little bit. And it was kind of a little crazy to me because I was like, wow, you just won. Why don't you just take a deep breath and just enjoy it? But is that just because that's just so used to going into, perhaps, back to back all the time? He came out about, is him, you know, I feel that I've been doing this for 10 years now. And I cannot remember celebrating my birthday, my birthday is next week. And that's because I've been doing the Arnold for as long as I, I've known. So it just, I think, became automatic. And for me, there was no changes of that even though I've won the Olympia, I was just okay, well, we're just going to keep on going, doing the champion with champions are doing, just on carry on and doing another prop. And like you said, not really taking a deep breath. And, Kim told me, he's like, go back, take a deep breath and think about it. And it was just so, again, automatically send my, why? Was he for it or against it? What was Kim's, you know, thought process on this? So Kim is always going to support me and my thoughts, right? And if you were going for it, we're going for it. And there's, there's no way back. But he, I think he really tried to make me think about it and not do my usual comfort thing where I just go and carry on with my decisions without giving some thought. So he was shocked when I actually told him because I actually ended up telling him I was, I actually sent the, they they request because you need to request for invitation, right? So I actually sent him a screenshot and was like, okay, and he was ready. You know, he's always ready to like, but he, he wasn't, he just knew what we've been through for this last 22 weeks of prefer the Olympia. He was huge. And he, under some way I was coming from me, I understood who I wasn't as an athlete, but he also knew from his experience what it meant to in the Olympia. And now what we have to hold as responsibility and the shoes I need to step in. And I think he's much rather look at me now fulfilling those responsibility and like walking to those shoes than just being on stage again. And these are obviously my personal goals and he's always going to support me as as much as he can, but he's also very happy that we're stepping forward into that world right now and to, you know, making a decision on choosing longevity and what is right for me and being a ambassador for this sport. So I'm excited for this phase of my life taking a step. You know, it's a step forward. It's not, it's nothing of a step back. You know, people can make it what it is or whatever they want, but in our heads right now, it's a step forward. 100% I think that when you called me and we were talking about it and we were, you know, making that decision about not to the show, what was the thing I told you. I said, I don't know why you're even doing the show because you get a chance to have that victory lap and you get to be able to really absorb what you're doing and I know the certain people will come, you know, come to mind like Samson Dada. But again, Samson Dada is going for a half a million dollar prize. So he's going for that big check. So for him to win the Olympia win 600,000, trying to go in for 500,000 of the Arnold. That's one thing. But with you, and not that you can, couldn't do it. It's more of like, enjoy the moment. You won three horinals and then this is your first Olympia win and I know you're going to try to repeat and you're going to go in there and try to build a legacy. And now is the time to like what you said, create longevity and also be the brand ambassador that you are. Do you afraid of that a bit? Is that one of the reasons why you might have kind of just went right back into like I want to go into battle mode? Maybe subconsciously, there's probably some of that. I think whatever you want to call it, you know, I'm going to go for because that's what champion are doing and like it, it just, I was so hyped up. I was like, I gave Arnold four time. It sounds good. Let's go for it and when it actually, we started prep, everything was good and when we had the blood work, it just the decision was made for me. I really had to think and sometimes we go into that mode of like not really thinking. And as I was at the, we take a lot of noise and we never self-reflect on what we actually want to do. So I think subconsciously, there's a little bit of that. You know, I've been in the second spot, fist spots, they're like always kind of there but never the one. And I think it really hit me on that Sunday after the Olympia when I was sitting down with at the champion seminar and you know, you have Seabumb there. You have Sid, you have, you know, Missy and then Ryan Terry and I'm like, wait, that's my chair. And I'm actually here as the title holder of the Keeniness Olympia. So like when that hit me, it's like, I wanted to go into hiding. So I'm like, okay, I did my Sunday here as a champion but now I want to go into hiding and just like go back into prep and just go into that grind where like, you know, you have you hoodie up and it's just like the grind and the this and the that and just go into your comfort zone. It's insane to say that body building has become my comfort zone because for a lot of people it's a comfortable, you know, it's a lot of sacrifices and all this stuff but it became that for a little bit. So when I had to like really think hard on what is actually the best decision, what is the best thing for a lowerly right now and trying to be all that, be all of myself because when you're around like when you you earned that title of misalempy, it's kind of like you kind of feel like you need to reinvent everything and be someone that is bigger than yourself when in reality is like being all of who you are and you start feeling some kind of like different pressure and now you need to show up with like a six back everyday like and not talking the same way and be more articulate and don't get me wrong. I want to work on all that and be a better ambassador for the sport but I also want to be more of myself because that's all I've been doing for the longest time and I've earned my title being, you know, a little bit messy sometime having, you know, my up my ups and downs and but also owning all of that I am and being like authentic and organic and genuine. So I don't want to lose that just because I'm misalempy. I know I have to just go full front and be a champion again and never stop and the grind is forever and it's hard core and I love all these things about bodybuilding but I also want to tap into my more more of Lourley what she has to offer being that now, you know. Well you went over a lot into unpacked it's really I guess um admirable because a lot of people sweep it under the rug we talked about that before we started right and I think you know you said you're the queen of that. I said sweeping under the rug is my cardio. They're the cardio favorite activity but yes when you say that you mean with kind of all the aspects of competing or just in life in general. I think competing for me has been my pillar my solid core and my that's where I go to where I'm happy when I'm sad. This is the thing that I can obviously control. It's every three hours you need to have a meal. You need to think about your pure got you need to go to sleep. So it's you're constantly wired. So on wiring and just be into that lifestyle and being into yourself it's kind of something that I haven't done a very long time. So sweeping under the rug for me it's just to help me carry on with my bodybuilding carry. It's like okay but we don't need that we just need to be focused on this right now we need to be focused on our meal we need to be focused on our cardio and just being optimal constantly into being a machine basically. So did some parts of my life went under the rug yeah totally and now that I'm 28 almost turning 29 it's not an age thing it's just like a a duration thing things start compiling and you start whatever you put under the rug starts coming out a little bit and now it's just time to take care of it. It's just time to take care of whatever is showing up because there's a lot. So at the end of the kicker of those things I'm very happy in the place that I am right now but I'm again taking ownership of a lot of things that I've suffered the rug that just needs to be taken care of so that way this is part of my prep for the Olympia you know it's it is because that's gonna allow me to be so at peace you know keeping that peace of mind that's freedom you know that knowing that I've took care of everything I think the care of and I can go into this prep having this formula that we have now which is a 22 week prep that's where I thrive being ready about you know nine weeks seven you know nine weeks ahead of time maybe like four pounds of stage weight and just kind of cruising and getting my body you know I accommodated into that new shape because I get you know a lot smaller than I'm actually am right now so that's our formula and we wouldn't have had that the Arnold that that's the whole truth like we would we would be you know ten weeks and it wouldn't have been the same formula so I wouldn't want to go into all of my prep now knowing that we have a winning formula and really owning that so no that that says a lot because you you that's the self-awareness part saying okay if I don't go through those steps of going 22 weeks then go it down to like that optimal look at seven and nine weeks like and kind of bring my body down because we all know when you bring down your body too quickly what it does is it just kind of deflates right and I think that's what's happened to you in the past and I think a lot of that has to do is you would go through the Arnold you peek and then when you try to double peek again for the Olympia your body just wouldn't get right and that's what it's seem like from the outside did you see that that's kind of what was going on in the past yeah which is interesting because the Olympia we normally have I mean I would I would come off from the Arnold and kind of going to the Olympia if I wasn't doing like Pittsburgh or New York or whatever um so Olympia wasn't was never the right one because it was I mean the biggest show and then obviously stress would come along and things would happen you know I got two lean one year and then two big the other year you know and both year we were talking you and I so it's interesting how far we've come but like I said I think coming down and I I know I can grow into a show I know I know the intensity I know I'm like my I know my boyfriend you know he's gonna push me where I know he's gonna be able to like grow me into a show if we we need to Kim's same thing those in nutrition and I have the here no cap no I I do I really do and I you know I was talking to other pockets I don't know if I said it on here the last year but I was like I'm going to the Olympia I have although Kim and honey like I encourage you like right I know it wasn't like that because you were busy with your athletes but in my mind that's really genuinely what I thought and I just felt so safe and protected and I felt so loved all that we all weekend that's my little bubble I was and I was just just loved yeah you know well we we always we're always checking in on you and saying hey look if there's anything you need our conversations right just those little 20 minute conversations of where are you how's your head what's going on is there anything ahead right but again it's you overthink right a lot of people do it's it's totally natural it's normal and I think also being a woman doing a division where you also are being judged from the neck up not just your physique but your neck up and it's like hey is the angle right I got to look you know in shape but I can't look to and shape because I'll you know scare the judges because they follow me or you know all of these things go on in your head and much more so than a man because a guy can look really crazy shredded and then just soften up you know by the time they sit you know on stage if they're like let's say men's physique or the opposite somebody looks a little soft but by the time they dry out and they look crazy by the time they get on stage it's totally fine but with women I feel like it's always like hey this is my angle this is my side this is like make sure there's a filter make sure I'm not looking a little too beat up from the lack of sleep the night before and then you're doing your cardio but you still want to connect with your fans so all of these extras have to go in with the thought process of trying to chase perfection that you never get to right yeah I think I've accepted that a long time ago and I think that's what you know made me have like such an incredible audience is because one time like years ago I was on Instagram stories the first time coming out Instagram stories I have no English my English is so bad and I'm filming this story post like 30 times and I'm like wait I gotta go to work I gotta go to work I need to post this story and I'm just like effort I'm actually gonna post it my French accent is wild like English accent I don't even know with like with language I spoke on that story but I was like hey this is me guys thank you for following me I think that's what's the story right but from that point on I was like I'm always gonna say true to myself I've stopped using filter my god like about a year and a half ago I was like what am I doing here like trying to cast fish people like cast fish myself on those filter they they made me look amazing but I'm like let me not do that let me not do that let me be about what I preach and and you know I think the overthinking come just from caring a lot I care a lot not only for myself but how impactful and I feel that sometimes I've taking on things in my life whether is with relationship wise it's not like a friendship right like relationship with coaches or your sponsor that was not aligned with my image I was like you know it's okay I just need to do my bodybuilding thing I just see like you they can do whatever they want I'm just gonna do bodybuilding things you know but the impact that I had with that and how people use my image in order to make themselves more credible that was the most painful part of my career so now like I'm always like so double aware who I'm associating with like who I'm walking to the grocery store with like what am I wearing like all of these things like I do take a lot of it's it's not pride it's just care just care I think protection to you know because you've been through a couple of different talk you know tough times where you had some situations that like that occurred but I think it happens a lot more than people think and for people listening to this you guys know what I'm talking about you may go into the gym talk to somebody about something it could be about creating it could be about this and that and then next you know the person you talk to goes often says I'm prepping that person because you guys had a conversation about a pre-workout or about creating because people are so thirsty to try to take credit for things that they do not should not be taking credit for number one but number two they just want that association and they want your name in their mouth and you could be a local just let's say you're just a great physique in that gym someone will do that because people don't think they just do and they don't understand hey look there's that person number one you're taking away from what that person's done and number two if they're working with somebody else you're taking away from what that coaches doing and then you turn around and try to do that and again I dealt with this a lot when I was coming up where people would just try to you know reach on to an athlete and they would just try to focus on saying oh I have this to do with it or I have that to do with it so that they can try to be able to create validation and credibility for themselves but really it was just a conversation and passing something super superficial surface and like you said when you say oh I'm walking with somebody to the grocery store now all the person that person got oh she's my best friend and we were hanging out and you're like dude I just saw it this door I said hi I was being friendly and all of a sudden it's just weird thing and then you have to go into this protection mode because you have to say well wait a minute how is this person trying to use my image or my relationship because it can get really really dicey and I feel that everybody in this industry really can relate to that to some degree if you've been in it for a couple of years and you've just turned into something just let it could be a local show winner it could be somebody like I said who has a great physique super pretty in the gym and you know all of the sudden you know someone's like oh I'm her makeup artist or I'm this or I'm that because I gave her something about eyeshadow I don't I don't know but I just seen so many weird things and there it is out there that people come up with sometimes it's yeah and and it's I think that's the unfortunate part and because you have to change your vision of every interactions you have sometimes and it's it's never as pure so I'm that when I say I have surrounded that makes me safe that's what I'm talking about is because I can be who I am which is like I love people like I love like being social I never can't see bad intentions and that's also like very Canadian very native very Canadian I mean but I had to grow up really fast in the industry because you never know and you know I'm sure you know like as soon as you get a title you have people that you you know that gave you a shaker cup and you're like yeah I sponsor like you know it's just what I like whatever they come up with right so it's it's very unfortunate because as much as I've been on there like sharing my journey and you're like people come up with those narrative and it's like you just have to watch one video of me and you know that this is not true but like do you go and fight with them like what do you do you do you call them you you call them and you you're actually talking to them because I didn't in the path how do you think I did it I would see something that crazy I'm like here's my phone the bird call me will talk talking the person I said half an hour that like you know what I'm still believing that I'm like okay this is this is for me to understand that I know my truth yeah people are gonna be around me are either gonna you know support the truth and and I have to leave it at that whatever people want to do with it it's not it's not in my control I don't even want to control it you're gonna lose your mind absolutely right yeah and also I think it's also just in general difficult because you want to try to please everybody but at the same time people take advantage of your niceties right and I think that's the other tough thing with a lot of people when you start becoming nice you open up the door a little bit and then the people take advantage but you know I was going to talk about Aldo a little bit like how hard is it getting coached by your significant other so so he's he's a trainer but he would come on any interview and say like he's my boyfriend first like he really wants to stay that out loud because that's the most important part of his role and it's something that we it's still hard to navigate like I'm gonna be super honest with you like we've been out it's like we've been together for four years now it's been for great amazing year you know being obviously with him with Kim like working collaboratively and he's such a fan of body with building so it's it's great overall but still hard to navigate so sometimes we have to come up with strategies where you know we have I'm still on his schedule you know I risked back his schedule I respect you the office he has job and if I'm having a day like you know I'm just having this communication and that's verbal exchange with with Kim being involved with me being involved but on the athlete where we have to change hearts basically but um it's not always easy yet get sometimes emotional you know I won't I won't hide it I'm just like where is my boyfriend like I want you to support me and he's just like it's hard being double duty it's hard being double duty I know I did it with my wife when I started coaching her and I know that you won't ever do it again no right no no I'm not that's the thing I don't think you'll listen to me ever again but she want her show we did you know we did one show when I met her she was prepping and then obviously we've told the story several times but um and she was really good at taking direction but if we would have kept going and she would let's say you know try to go for a pro card or got her pro card then I think it would have gotten even more difficult but it was so early in our relationship that it made it easier because she was just very tough and good at taking direction and I um and I honestly didn't want to do it but then when I saw so many mistakes being made by by the guy that was coaching her I was like okay this is this is wrong this is wrong and then I just again I didn't want to get involved and then when I saw it like really starting to fall apart I just said okay we're 12 weeks she's gonna end up you know getting sick and I said okay I think we needed to change some things and but that was like about one or two months into us dating and I kept away from it like I just said you're doing your thing good luck and that's it and then when I started seeing a lot of mistakes being made that's when I turn around and I'm like okay I have to step in a little bit and then again I took over and then we were able to fix things and then she won the overall and it was good but I just it was because of the danger aspect of it that was happening yeah I ended up having to get involved but it wasn't something that I wanted to do and that's why I stayed away from it but if we had to continue and do more and more shows it would definitely be very difficult because again when you get upset are you telling them to do more cardio because you're upset at them or it's because you really truly believe it and then it goes back and forth it's almost kind of like working with your significant other and business and one's trying to be your boss and the other one has to be the quote unquote employee those don't tend to work very well either right I mean you hear stories all the time but funny story like that's how we met I actually hired him to train me so like I knew he was really good I watched his content for a long time so I hired him so then of course I want him to train me you know what I mean and then I think it's like I grew a lot with him I grew a lot then my glues were too big okay we're changing things up and you know it it was a good time of fun time but then it was you know he's so into his work he's so passionate I wasn't prep all the time so we never kind of had that break to like connect you know how people have they're a to five they come home and they have dinner together and they go to bed we didn't have that so I think that started missing and then I was trying to have that during our session and he kind of didn't know how to show up anymore so it was just hard and navigate you know but he obviously supports you know me so much and he's a great trainer and always have good intention you know if you have good intentions and we both want to win and we both want to best for each other it never comes out of maliciousness but it's also understandable okay what do you need right now and sometimes it's just I just need to train myself for a while and then he'd like okay let's go ahead and he said you know one year that ended up growing he was like I was looking at you doing five plays on the side backs hacks hackscoot and I was like I want to intervene and tell you you're doing something wrong but then he let me learn and I you know I learned I learned the hard way but then after that I was like okay let me take my pride I want to hear what you have to say like you do prep or does he just do training he just a training got you yep he just personal training so that's his own right because I know he does personal training but I didn't know if he did prep for others no no no no no no he won't get a check in from you he's just very pretty and he likes a one and one he won't even do online really okay yeah he wants to be there he likes to really hands on okay yeah hands on which you're getting back into that yes yes well for me I've always been hands on because I always had I did both right but now I could just leave it at the door where in the past that's why everyone's like oh you know you're retired and I go no from coaching high level Olympia but for the people that are prepping there's a lot of people we had just had rough diesel in your last week and you know urges is going to come out I think before the Arnold which is going to be really cool I got to train with him in India but it's because now I'm just focused on just the workout and being able to give back to the audience to the people to the to the other athletes and not having to be able to have a horse in the race for say and being able to do that is what's really fun where I don't have to get up in the early in the morning and you know it's good about the late and worry about pictures and updates and all of these other things and peaking free with the shows now I can do really just focus on let's get into the gym let's do some really good training and let's have some fun and then let's grab a you know with protein shake and high five you know looking at the club out yeah it's it just leave it at the door and that's again for me that's plenty but when I see you and you know the dynamic of him and Aldo and being able to do that this way I was always curious I'm like does he prep other people just doesn't prep you or is that just his is laying and it looks like that's just his laying he likes to do the training yep that's awesome yeah and then now as the division is now you know with gotten almost in some ways now it's it's and now we have a new division right and I really would love to hear your take on the new division yeah I mean the fit model division oh my god and we actually had the first show at the LA fit expo when we were at the NPC woman's workshop uh Cindy Williams in the workshop the fit model division what a great addition to our sport for and I love the podcast you do with Tyler by the way I watch it and I told Tyler this is a great podcast and if whomever is asking you question just redirected into that you know he was just so open about it I think that's great information but personally I just think it's it's great to see the this sport grow and you've been there for a long time so you saw the women's physique good you know figure thickness yep but I've never been in the sport having a division after bikini it's a lot of like wait this is so cool like you know it's good so some people would think that maybe you'd be like threatened by it because now that you're the champ you're like wait a minute now you know do I feel diluted but it seems like you're actually pretty happy about it oh I'm so hyped about it I think it's just gonna be great for the sport it's so great to have um and it's also so different I feel like people don't take it as two different I didn't like categories I feel that they think that bikini is going to change because there is that happening but I think the judges are doing such a great job and you know shout out to Tyler shout out to Cindy Williams and to make it so different with the criteria of what it is so I don't think it's a you know people will compare it to bikini back in the days but I really do think it's going to be completely different that's why the suits are going to be different there's no crossover possible so they're doing the right way and I'm so proud to be a bikini I'm here on the every work 10 years of my life to like nail this look so I'm a proud bikini girl you know nobody asked so you're not switching division you're the only one who asked me that like I always got insulted I was like wait nobody's asking me what if I'm going to switch division I don't know why but I'm like no I'm actually proud of myself because I'm just such a bikini girl I heart I love this category and um I'm yeah well you're built for the category to be honest with you it's one of those things where when you look at your shoulders waist like everything that the way that you're built and I feel that what's really nice about the fact that now they have this other category it just really helps with a feeder system something that is more attainable but a lot of people are threatened by it I don't understand why it again I still think that they should do it for the men's I think that the men's have gotten super muscular and back when Jeremy was winning and that 165 170 pound physique his way different than what you're seeing now it's much more muscular now than it was when it first started but that's when I feel like it was as big as so I do feel like this creates especially now you can't cross over I would do the same thing with the men's and be able to create a feeder system so that if somebody has that look and they can get on stage within a shorter time frame then we still have the ability to bring them up and then if they want to build and move up they still can if they so desire or they're genetically able to grow they can go to another category but I feel that when you are kind of where it's at now the bar is almost too high in the men's side so that's why I feel that way but with the women now I feel that again having that fit model look with not being able to cross over really helps identify with a different audience and if they want to get a little bit more muscular and just a little bit more just rounder then they can move up to bikini yeah you know um what do you think about that because here's some of our discussion that Kim and I had about the category fit model is going to be really hard to coach the coach are going to be so exposed because if you don't know well nutrition and you don't know well training you're not going to be able to bring a body because you can't rely on anything else you can't cheat your way into fit model it's going to be curvy it's going to be athleticism it's going to be health wellness it's going to be all that so now I feel like there's a less like people rely a lot on you know supplementation you know like to make it PG on here but they don't really know their basics so I think there's going to be a lot of coaches are going to get humbled very much so really fast which is going to be a great thing for for the sport again because it's going to showcase that and enforce women to stay within and hopefully men eventually like to stay within the potential of their own body and you know we're talking about Sid a lot and I am such a a fan of her but she started it she was seven years old you know what I mean it's it's one of those things it's a marathon it's it's not a sprint that's what we're talking about it's like now girls of course like they're trying to go into bikini in two years and when they're programmed in two years like great things takes a lot of time and that's why Sid when you look at her it's it's maturity in her muscle it's it's density it's athletic it's in genetics it's just she has insane genetics and that's just part of it it really is it is I know it is but it's just to say that these things were not given like we're talking about filth you know like it's it's it's athletes pretty muscle those pretty muscle you don't have that a lot in this sport anymore it's I think a lot of people rush it and if they do have a glimpse of it they just destroy it because taking hormones can actually ruin your look I know natural guys who looked better when they were natural than then when they went on and that's because what happens is their body ends up going into some type of chaotic change in due to the hormones and it doesn't make it better it lots of times makes it worse because they're relying now on something that they shouldn't be relying on and then on top of that your body just starts to grow disperpourish and it just throws everything off and so there's a lot of reasons and then you see women that do the same thing and then all of a sudden you're like wow when she was natural she looked at so much better and then they got enhanced and I'm saying you're like oh skin is bad you know shoulders are blown out too big you know quadr too big you know glutes are kind of disproportionate all of this other stuff and I just feel that that's what ends up happening if you don't have a good coach that can keep you wild you know inside the boundaries of what your division really is yeah and I feel like that's why people just end up like getting blown out yeah totally totally I agree with I think you're always one cycle away of messing up your physique totally and you see it in the rules of if if models to just go back a little bit on that new division when Tyler says no cap shoulder it's because he knows like the judges are smart now they they they they've talked to a lot of athletes a lot of things that they've seen so when you start seeing things that are not supposed to be that on women they're gonna call it out for what it is and I'm gonna be like we won't we don't want that we don't want shredded like visible like tie in or shredded hamstring even not in bikini anymore like anyone on the top five like they didn't have deep lines in their hamstring and because they know what it takes I mean it's to get that lean it's a lot of extreme you know what I mean yeah especially for women so I'm I think it's a very positive turn into the sport great at this shit and we'll see where it goes we'll see where it goes there's no negative until we don't see what it's done for you know what I mean we don't have anyone competed yet so all of these negative thoughts I just think it's like bogus at this point so I'm excited I think it's positive yeah the other thing that I think that that could possibly happen to some point and I don't know if Tyler or Jim or anyone's talked about it yet is possibly just having set judges for those divisions because I always think early on when we just had bodybuilding right we had men's bodybuilding and women's bodybuilding and there was no other divisions um now with all the divisions and you have a bodybuilding judge what are they going to go after they're going to keep going after the more conditioned look because that's what they're really you know judging with a prior division so now you constantly do that but if you have someone who's really focused on what the division they're supposed to be helping create the standard for then you have more of a purest outlook and I feel like certain judges are not good at carrying over and saying hey I'm not going to go back because it's easiest to go to the most muscular or the most shredded person because it just creates a little bit easier way of being able to decide on who's best but when you are trying to look at the overall structure and you're trying to create that complete look for bikini or fit model or whether it's um figure if you're using a lot of male bodybuilding judges then what's going to happen is they are going to I feel inherently just it's just an apparently going to want to go towards a more conditioned look more muscular look a little bit more extreme look and I think it just evolves that way but I think some judges are really really good and they can do that they can they can compartmentalize on what they're watching but I think some of the others not so much and I think that's when you have to kind of just maybe possibly have a standard and having you know if it's something that maybe they should also think about is saying hey these are set judges for these divisions so that they can also just not have to really work on looking at men's open one minute and then turn around and do fit model the next yeah yeah I mean we'll see we'll see I'm sure the sport again constantly evolving I think having the pit power like it just shows how much they're really in trying to be in tune and to growing the sport the right way I think it does come down to the judges awarding either the best physique on stage which is very subjective and sometimes isn't really for the criteria again so thanks you see that a lot overseas because then the overseas sees what they're rewarding in the USA and in the US most of the time the big panel the big show have a set criteria in their mind and then they're kind of almost see it as like a stencil right so they have the design stencil of the body that they want and they're just passing the bodies into that stencil and whomever is like really fit into that stencil that day that's the one that's rewarded so sometimes it's not the best body on stage but it's the body that fits a criteria the best and these are two different things and again I think you're really gonna see that in fit model because if you award a best body while sometimes the best body is have capsules and that's exactly it and that's where the they miss the mark and that that's how it gets to evolve and evolve and just to get so much and it doesn't stay within the confines of what it's supposed to be I mean the good thing is Tyler's actually verbalizing so much he's going out and he's doing the breakdowns and I think that really helps tremendously because we didn't have that in the past right we didn't have a lot of that transparency that we have now and it was because we didn't have the internet we didn't have social media we didn't have all these things it was a magazine and then we would see it three months after the show was over and we would open up a magazine and then you just be like okay it is what it is but now with that I mean again I think he goes in was it like the less no weak later and he starts to break down the judging already so that that's what makes it cool but now he has to try to keep everybody at bay because there's so many shows now and like you said internationally letting them also so that's why I think a lot of times those send some of the judges from here out there overseas to be able to really kind of oversee the standard right and I think that's happening even more and more now which is very good because that's what helps the standard because if you have some rogue judges that are going back into like some of the old European days you would see some of their figure girls and they were shredded and they would be like abs and veins in their quads and I was like what is that and this is like back in the day and rewarding size over like shape and just 100% yeah and then they come to the Olympia they're just last call out you know 16th you they just do well right and then increase frustration and you know you know how it goes yeah absolutely and they don't know what to do because they were like hey I won this show back in like Slovenia or something right and so I think that that's you know the cool thing about what we're at now as a organization but going into this next year I know you got a lot of events coming up right and so where are you gonna be at next I know we have Arnold in couple weeks right yeah so you're gonna be there with us you're gonna be there for Celsius as well and then after that what's the next show do you get because I know you're you're everywhere like I saw you in Kim where were you guys that a couple days ago we were in Virginia so DC Virginia area so we've been doing that seminar for like four years not but again my first time that being on prep for a seminar so it's great everything is kind of brand new for me so I'm enjoying those moments a lot I'm so happy to be here this weekend we're gonna have so much fun and then after that I'm actually gonna celebrate my birthday which happened then in a long time so that's my little late 29 in a week don't say it maybe more don't say it that's it then you just say 22 that's it then you go backwards then you go 29 the 208 okay deal yeah that's okay I can agree to that that's it that's okay 29 28 27 just go backwards from there okay good deal that deal so now that you're getting to enjoy your off season tell me about the food because another thing that I noticed from many many years of being in this industry is the disproportionate just relationship of women in this industry in food right are you able to kind of like allow yourself to enjoy yourself and get a little heavy or are you constantly trying to be like hey I got to watch an eat like super super clean because I'm scared I'm gonna blow up do you get cheap meals do you get to have some things that we're you know we talked about in the past but right now with where you're at are you allowing yourself that or is it constantly a struggle it was a little bit like in complete transparency again since we're gonna to true the truth podcast the truth podcast it was a little bit more of a struggle like I I had to kind of relearn my thought process on like me going reverse dieting every single time in the past it switched on switch off I go back to intuitive as as soon as I can as early as I can to just get my hormones back as soon as I can for me to do a very very dire and add a hundred grams of carbs every week it just elongates the process and I have to go back and prep very soon so I want to have my hormones back I want to you know have you know lepsing growing back on truck I want to have my period if I missed that I want them back you know sorry these are the details but as as early as I can so for me to just keeping my physique after show that I've just got my physique judge on like no I'm I'm going on to health phase so my focus is now changing from a physique standpoint to a health and internal standpoint which whatever my body wants to do at this point I have to let it be and be what it is because we're going all in to that phase as soon as I can to repair what I need to repair so how many times a day are you eating now? Like four times a day I'm still listening I'm hungry I'm active I need good fuel so I tend to go through kind of the same meal that I used to have in the past maybe adding more fruits I love like fruits here and there I would add that if you know I crave for a bigger meal because I train really hard that week I'm going to allow myself to eat those meals like I don't have any issue with that at all you have a set cheap meal day or a couple of days a week we get allow yourself to have a date I don't really but I do like a little like Friday Saturday night maybe or like a little Sunday brunch that's my thing a little Sunday brunch I love I love are you doing the champagne brunch like me most I know I would do like a big old kimchi like kimchi's big wow you didn't carry it away with big I thought you're going to be like yeah like a little bit of maple syrup like you know my my I do like Hulk thinking with like oatmeal stuff so I would just like to syrup on it and maybe some little East chocolate chip like I would go with that and just Brad Brennan butter is my thing yeah yeah yeah and we're not cardio you're doing cardio off these I do have a little cardio it's not very cardio cardioing as I call it's a little step between step and cardio so I do do 30 minutes of cardio a day and that's in the morning or after training or one depends yeah you mix it up yeah I do and how many do seven days seven days yeah and so you just kind of balancing everything out and then are you doing blood work right now or you kind of like going through again and then because you I said you said that you mentioned blood work or is not where you where you wanted it and that's why you're like no I'm going to tell you know back off of the show yeah now with the situation you're in now are you going in and how often are you checking you know your blood work right now so from the last but work that we've been doing I started to work with the only paddock doctor and I also have the doctor that are working together so I'm on this phase right now with you know the supplements you know like needs them and all that these good stuff yeah and we're going to get blood work done and about like it's going to be right after the RN on the second time I work done and see where we're at because right now my training volume is reduced by a lot you know I told you I'm three four times a week a week 30 minutes 45 minutes exactly what we did today was like spot on like I feel good I'm not drained with it and go to failure really like the form was it broken down but we just keep you know just how long will you be sore now I'm probably getting it sore how many days two three okay yeah right that two or three mark yeah three days is like on average and then I'll right now with grams of protein do you know do you count your grams of protein or macros I would go like you know per meal for ounces of chicken if I so it's like 26 rounds of protein meal and in the morning I have to answer 200 grams of egg whites so it's about like 26 grams of protein to 30 grams of protein per meal I have like four meals a day in the shake okay yeah and then shake I do a scoop in a half now which is look at you it gets it gets so velvet like um i mean a crispy cookie a scoop in a half is like you've been tagging me on those videos you did with Kim that cookie uh the cookie crisps so the cookie crisps guys for that you don't know I made a nice eject that reminded me of cookie crisps cereal and it has broken little pieces we call them inclusions and they're in there and that's my go to because I love the texture and that's what you miss when you're dieting right like that's why a lot of people like chips that's why you like pretzels you like little snack items and when you put those little pieces in there you really feel a difference besides it just being a pure liquid it kind of feels like you broke up a little bit of a meal or like I said cookies pieces in the bottom of it the fact that you just said that the texture part yeah I am such a texture for the I love me some different texture give me a cake but that has like a little praline going on and it'll crut done done is it's perfect that's why it's so fantastic I mean I mix it with even like pumping pumpkin puree oh wait a minute how come you don't give me any of these recipes what do you mean well you mix it you mix the protein with pumpkin puree and what do you do do you just like do you chill it or just mix it so it's already chilled so like the pumpkin puree is what it's cold so it keeps the I mean the crisp little cookies compact because otherwise if it's hot no fall part they do but but when they fall apart it kind of makes it little like situation like melted chocolate chips situation it's fantastic it's great but having to crunch with your pumpkin and it's like I have my Baltimore drink right now what's going on what is going on okay it's good I have to let me try it yeah what you let's do this tell me down below in the comments if you think she should do maybe like a recipe a week yeah I'm down okay so guys girls whoever is listening to this go into the comment section let us know because if we get enough of those yessas we'll definitely get her to be able to do this unfortunately to do it actually should look to do it anyways I would I would I would I do it like you should be doing it it's come on this I mean this is like gold these are the little nuggets yeah people people tag me on it some people I've picked up on it you know it's just sometimes it takes a while that you know all pumpkin with you just don't taste it and it's great it's entire inflammatory food volume food like the macros are great yeah because you got a little bit of that density to it exactly because you see it often with like your good people would like me say we agree good but what if you're it that close in tolerant and you want the macros no it fits perfect and then yeah I just have the proof to use it when you're tidy yeah I had that oh my god when you're prepping yeah wait I had the I so check up until a week out no I'm saying with the pumpkin and then with the pumpkin yeah measured a hundred grams of pumpkin so you just add those to your macros yeah how many calories is that in a lot it's great why don't know it sounds like me like you're having ton of it is it canned is it canned it's or yeah the one from whole food yeah okay specifically organic of course yeah it's got organic yeah yeah but that yeah you got to definitely share some secrets you know I'll share some secrets too I just yeah I'm serious could people are asking me because I you have the my my secret Persian pizza wait what I would do these gluten free pizza is you didn't hear about this no spill it right here so I would make these gluten free pizzas and it was just a tortilla that we would I would use a little bit of like olive oil cooking spray put it on a hot plate right hot pan flip it get it crispy add a little bit of like pizza sauce and then I'd get turkey pepperoni and I would put like low fat cheese just right on top of there and then get a pizza cutter and it would just make it crispy as hell and oh because texture because I'm a texture guy and the texture like little crispy tortilla and then that's it I can't I can't only drop the rolling over there right now he's yeah I'm really I mean yeah we're hungry but I just can't only imagine the feeling you high when you took out your roller pizza roller and prep like you just feel like you made it you're like I'm using your pizza roller you know a lot of people are getting super creative you know and again just being able to kind of work around some different things I know some people that were doing certain types of muffins and cookies my wife will use the ninja creamy and mix that up and then make you know the ice cream sandwich Evevision you know ice eject ice cream sandwich yeah you would do that or she would use choro and then she would turn around and make you know the ice cream with that and the beef collagen in there yep yeah the new chocolate one is my favorite that chocolate collagen is off the hook because I'm just a chocolate fiend but it's um but anyhow it when you start mixing you know collagen and different types of ingredients and you can literally get some nice texture out of it and people have gotten super creative with some of these things and again I love watching some of those Instagram things and even though I'm not guiding for a show just because I like ideas and then I go oh and then I forward him to my wife and then she's like do it yourself you're just like you should make this for Cameron and then like wink wink like go there and steal it yeah I love that I love that that's so cool yeah but it's it's it's good so definitely you know I a lot of people who are listening to this you guys have your secret recipes share them put it on the Instagram on the YouTube comments and let us know if you want to see L'Orley on there oh my god we could we could pick up on some of those and actually try them and see how yeah 100% right okay yeah let us know you guys recipe will pick some of them and just do them it better yeah if you guys do it and you want to you need protein let me know what flavor I'll send it to you wait that's cool yeah I'll do it sick okay so if somebody out there is
