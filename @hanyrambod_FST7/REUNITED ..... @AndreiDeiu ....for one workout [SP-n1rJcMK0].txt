Alright guys, we are back here at Evo Land here in Cologne, Germany. Final day of Evo was today and I have get a little bit of a shoulder pump and then you know I always train alone but once in a blue moon they'll be somebody that wants to train with me. So I just try to grab somebody just randomly might want to train shoulders with me. So this is what we got to tell all guys we got a back! Black in the game! I only used been this excited since he had that one time in Dubai when you were fishing and you didn't come back for four days. You're like an exciting seeer bro. He has this exciting man. You're like you're like you're like I'm ready to do the yacht life show. No no more I'm going to put that line. Yes, that's right that's right so again getting to see each other in a long time. It's been a while and look who's back. I still had bigger calves than he does. Oh bro, don't start. Only when I bought them doing a little bit of progress. Look at this. What do you think? Nice talk sir. Do you injection bro? He's doing injections. At this point I need everything. Troll that negative. All right guys I had a lot of people come up to me at the booth asking about how to get those gold or shoulders. One of the things that they're doing is number one they're using too much trap. That's why they're not getting the lateral head of the del. When you're doing lateral raises and what you're doing is you're not focusing on centric the weight down. Only on the way up. See how Andre's coming down slowly that's what you want. You want to control the weight, don't let it control you. Make sure video yourself and wash yourself. You'll know how fast or supposed to be going. One to two seconds on the way down. 1,000, 1,000, 1,000 to it perfect. Just like that control. Good and not too high don't bring your hands up higher than shoulder level. When you go up, we have been here. We're going to start hitting a lot more trap. So you got to be really, really careful with that. Alright so tempo is important. You don't want to go too fast. Don't want to go too slow either because if you go way too slow, you're not going to be using the heavier weights. You want to be able to balance the tube. Make sure you're using heavy enough weight but don't go so slow that you have to lighten it up so much that you're actually being a detriment to yourself. Good. Keep going to go on. That turned up a little bit on the way up. That's it perfect. Go so 3, 2, 1 more. Good not partial. Go go. Good go all the way up. There you go. Up there. 3, 2, 1 more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. Good job. Not scared. Oh you missed me. This is one thing I didn't miss. One more end of doing like six more ends. That's right because we're doing the exchange rate. Romani and dollars. Exchange rate. It's dollars to pay so it's raw. That's what you want set. We can get your meal. You go 3D, bro. So hand it to your health. Yeah. Single ones. Yeah. It is a killer. I still do it. I still do it in my trading. Yeah. Yeah. Can't forget the training. You want to stay at your children? Yeah. Yeah. Back to the end of the beginning. Yeah. Especially when you're on the back with your ass. Yeah. That's a good one. Yeah. Yeah. Again, do not use too heavy away where your traps are going to kick in. If you want to be able to use away, you're going to be able to control. And then also when you get to those parcels, make sure that it's only the last third of the set. Don't do start doing parcels halfway through the set. The last third. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. I'm going to switch. Hold it, hold it. Oh, I know it hurts. Hold it. Good. Control. Good. Great. Four. Five. Five. Six quick control. Six quick control. Seven. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Now together. Good. Can we get more control? One. Control. Control. Even more. We're all that's better. That's perfect. That's perfect. Two more. Two more. Just like that. Good. Two partial. Eight. Eight. Two. Eight. God, you're a statue brush, a statue brush, a statue brush, a statue brush. A statue brush. Let's go much more scalar. Two trees. Squeeze. Shot. Lots out. Right there. Hold that. Five seconds. Five seconds squeeze. Four. Three. Three. Three. Two. One. Good job. That's it. I'm not gonna get my time. Welcome back. Oh my god. I'm gonna finish it like this. She's been still training bro. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Lift your shoulders. Look at that. Look at that. There. It's just looking forward. It's the deep. So it's all the details. So you must have the shirt. He's now starting to come. After all these years, the nice break off. So the elbow to really get it. It's body to be sweaty. Now it's getting all of that detail from all the rest. You have the rest. Yeah. It's all the way. It's all the way. It's all the years that we did together. It's been years and years. And that's all coming back. Yeah. How many people still talk about that? Ah bro. Even at the age, it was like, get people, remember that one leg to end the risk. Yeah. She's back in the year. Yeah. There still people talking about that video bro. Yeah. I swear. I love those F-27 workouts. Yeah. You push them back. You was the baby then. I know we got so much motivation. So many people. So many people all around the world. I go. People always say. And it's the most video. It's like five six years. Yeah. And they're still posting now. I see it in my mention. They're still posting now. All of the gems. So everywhere. That's awesome. All right guys. We just did a lot. We just did a lot of stuff. We just did a lot of stuff. We just did a lot of stuff. And then we went to full sets. Then we went front rays. But again, single arm. And then going over to completing the following arm. Then we brought it back. And did together. And then now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and do shoulder press on a machine. So we want to do is just be able to focus on the overall del. So it's really important to be able to get those cannon ball del. You cannot lack in one exercise over the other. It's a balance during the workout of presses as well as ladder raises. Eight reps. Go down lower bro. If you can. You're so good. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Just go to that. You can without it burning. Because that way you pull the range of motion on the light light. You try to rehab. Okay. Because you don't want to limit it if you don't have to. The lower you go the better. The bends if they do like. Up to 5.11. I go like in KG 90 or KG. If they do over which I'm over it's 90. You're fine. So I'm gonna be fine either way. I'm nearly in time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we'll be fine later. Wait. Good thing you didn't have to be legs. Come on, bro. I'm working, bro. I'm working, bro. Okay. Sit or can.

Three reps. Three reps. One. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. So what we're doing is we're doing rear delts. The key to rear delts is to make sure that your elbow is in the same height as your shoulder. As you're bringing back, you're controlling the eccentric. You do not want to just go with crazy, crazy, fast positive. And then drop the negative. You want that tension all the way through. And tempo is okay. If you go a little bit quickly, it's okay on the exercise. But you don't have to be super, super slow. But you can be very deliberate and make sure that you're getting parallel with the other arm. And then you're going back again. Do not just do partial. Go all the way to your completely 90 degrees with your hip. So you just make sure that you're going right in that level. And you should have your wrist in the same plane as the belt. You can squat for 10,7項.onsense. It should be serious on the rightная and out of general speed for practical exercise at this time just fine. I need to 동 up instead. Please. Keep your watch to watch.
