So you guys all know how much I love my Pannata equipment in my gym and we're going to go ahead and beat up with the team over there. After that, we're going to go over to the KSM66, Ashwaganda booth. We're going to go over there, talk about all the new technologies, all the new clinical research, the studies that are keeping dropping, just over and over again, talking about how great Ashwaganda is for you and stress reduction helps with everything from testosterone to thyroid. There's a plethora of positives with Ashwaganda, especially KSM66, that uses only the root and none of the leaf or stem. Very, very important fact. That's why we're trying to educate everyone out there, the differences between Ashwaganda that is amazing versus everything else that's out there. So KSM66 is considered the best Ashwaganda because it uses the root only of the Ashwaganda plant. But we're going to talk a little bit about that and how we're dropping the new cell camp, the latest version contains a full clinical dose of KSM66 at 600 milligrams. And we're going to just be a really good week talking about training, talking about nutrition, talking about all the amazing shows coming up, the ones that have happened. So again, a lot of great champions are going to be here at Fibo and can't wait to be able to meet everybody at the booth. So this is going to be pure fire today. Pannata KSM66, let's go. So we're going to go back. It was really good place. Alright guys, so we are here at the Pannata booth. If Fibo one of the new drops is the re-watch of the fantastic series. So for those of you that you see this, I want to change back in the 67's, 80's, then going over to cables and belts. And now this is a re-introduction to that series called the Fantastic Line. And that's what we're re-introducing here at Pannata. So, let's pull down, let press a couple of other presses and current machine that are all using the chain driven systems. Again, this is all a reboot with new engineering with old hardcore technology that's been reintroduced and re-introduced here to be able to perform it even a higher level than it did in the past. So you take all the old school, mix it with the new school, and this is what you're in half. Purely fantastic. Fibo, birdish shoulder, you're asking how you are to shoulder. Yes, too much. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Really great good. You have any other photos from the back? Yeah, yeah, there you go. Good conditioning. Yeah, yeah, just keep working on your lower-loss. Your lower-loss a little bit. Just continue to keep working on your legs, but that looks good. Conditioning the foot is keep working on your lower back. That's the lower-loss. Thank you so much. Great. Well, probably that's enough for me. One last time I made you reverse grip. Re-script, pull down, reverse grip, then over roll, reverse grip, one arm done both of it. Re-script. Okay, okay. So thank you so much. Well, this is golden. All right, guys, we are heading our way to the KSM66 booth. It was packed over, but not a check out the new fantastic series. Now it's time to get through this mob here in Feebo. It's absolutely next level. Having been here for at least since before the pandemic. And everyone was wondering if it's going off again, well, it is going off. So now it's time to get together with our friends over at KSM66. Ashwood Honda. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. That's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right, guys. The new version of Salkham with the full dose of PSM66. That's right. KSM66 to Roots Best Ashwood Honda is now loaded in the new Salkham. So you'll be able to not only get lower portion levels, but also help boost your account with being able to give you that relaxed feeling, lower thing side to you, helps to even with your thyroid, so many different benefits of the world's best Ashwood Honda KSM66. That's why a bulldoze is in every school. So check it out and you sell them. KSM66. I don't know. Maybe the length of the muscles you get. Well, personal always with anybody. It's a matter of control or call poor emotion. Super important. Because so many people like to especially do longer your ranges. Yeah. The more you want to do partials, the partial reps, the very end, or your helping thing. To want to be able to have a full range of emotion, make sure you get your four session. Number two, don't forget to give a very random and open working sense to do partials. Works really well. It's actually done by getting people range anymore. Then you can free extra reps. Where you go to partial reps. That will also help you get your intensity. With free small muscle load, time under tension. To help small flow. So it doesn't matter if I load out with the weight more, just an intensity. Either way it works, because you want to try to keep failure in about these steps. And then maybe get a couple of those partials of your area. And if you're going to that big step, grab range. That's pretty much really good for the growth. We have about two different parts of the world. Okay. I'll have a little more time. Thank you very much. Two working sense. I don't want to get up and bring the four extra signs. I'll go on. Yeah. Thank you. Alright guys, we just left the KSM 66 group. It was awesome. We saw everybody in the honor earlier. KSM 66 we finished up. A lot of really good stories with people that are not only taking the products, but we also met with some people who own companies that were asking about KSM 66 in the application. And the spectrum keeps getting bigger and bigger. So the exciting part about KSM is the fact that there's so much more clinical studies that are coming out about the benefits of KSM 66. So with cortisol, with thyroid, with just being able to get your natural hormones to maximize. So you get all of those benefits and getting to talk about that with other supplement companies. It's been awesome. So again guys, appreciate everybody. Day one is now done. Alright guys, we are day two. And we got some in special actually walking with us to the booth. We got to Mr. Eight time himself, the legend Lee Haney, right out of Georgia. We got him on a plane. Yeah. This is not having very out of him. And we're going to head to the banana booth. So you can get a speedway. Again, we're with a great pound around the ball. The yellow champion right here. This is the man. Thank you. You will be at the nearby fantastic. So we can feel, okay? Hi. You're welcome. Say good. If you have a lot of people here with Mr. Rudy Pinnata. We're in the legend tent. We have eight time Mr. Olympia. We're waiting for these. We should go ahead.

Come here. We're going to get out. Yeah. I'll go right into the archaic. Yeah. I will go right to the archaic. Okay. They're at four. All right. That's awesome. I think people in Germany have a problem so I dealt with it. We got a big problem because there's too much track in the belt. So the best thing you do is see the lateral rays to try to take the momentum out. So see the dumbbell lateral rays or you can do cable behind the back of the wheel or even cable front. The lower cable but no sure you go slow. Don't pull with your trap and go to shoulder height and then back down. So go in the higher and just go to shoulder height and back down. You can make sure you work on your negative two seconds on the way down. Okay, I'll be a sense. Normally it's about four sets to arm up and two working sets. Okay, obviously the front, the back, the side, all of the key is not go fast. Don't worry too heavy, otherwise you'll be trapped in the gym. You'll have big traps and small children. Yeah, okay, thank you. Can we take a big turn with three out? That's it. All right guys, we are here at the biggest day, Saturday day three. After the expo with eight times. Yeah, man, we gonna have a great time with my brother, Hati and the, we give it a rock and roll. It's got a super bottle. Somebody's texting. What are we doing for the next day?

And I'm not sitting in size. I'm not even having a life in this exact moment. Yeah, the difference is the management of feeling the muscle and the body. So you're using your heel to soak on through the, where the heel is like you're not getting into your self. Because it's really biopic and it's a success.
