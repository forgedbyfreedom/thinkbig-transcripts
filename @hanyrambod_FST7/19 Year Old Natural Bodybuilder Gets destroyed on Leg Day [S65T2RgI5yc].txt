All right guys, I am here with none other than Mr. Natarral. What's all you? Julian Fitzgerald. Are you the second? The third? Are you just doing that? Not necessarily the second. There might be a second. There might be a second. Oh yeah. Yeah. Definitely tell you right now. It would be a second. If he's already talking about that at 19 years old, he's been thinking about it for a minute. Yeah. Yeah, that might be one. That's right. So today we are going to do Lays once again, because we need to build those Lays up. So one thing that we really want to focus on this time though, is a little more hamstring dominant. And we're not just doing pure hamstring, but we're going to do quad hamstring with a little more hamstring dominant. And as we talked about in this whole video series of making him his best version of himself, we want to be able to focus on you guys being able to be a part of this journey. So again, did you end up laying yourself? Not then. Okay, because you know, he's been busy working. Yeah. Working at Amazon during primed day crazy crazy times. And the thing about it is that he was worried about losing weight, because he said he's going to lose five or ten pounds. But I know that you didn't lose weight. You gained a little bit because I gave you some super huge. So super huge was our gainer. I ended up giving him that. Told him to mix a little bit with the ice aject. Now what is that good for? That is really good for those that are going to lose weight. Because of the fact that he's working in a crazy hot warehouse. He's not going to be able to get meals in. If he does doing a shake is going to be much easier. But instead of doing the whole 1200 calories, which is too much at once, how much does he run half? Yeah, I did two and half. Yeah, so five scoops is a full dose. Always recommended to cut it into either quarter or half dose. And that's 25 grams of protein. So we threw a scoop of protein on there to get him to 50. But only 600 calories from the super huge. So again, we're just used that. How did that work out for you? Yeah, I think last time I was wearing like, so a panaceous of I was like, 210. So I know that I didn't lose too much. That definitely helped out. That's like, we take IVs in the panaceous of that's my emergency IV. Because it gives me everything I need for the rest of the world. Yeah. So that definitely came in close. Especially when the calories are so good. Yeah, because you told me you were going to drop like five or ten pounds. Yeah. And we ended up not only holding weight, but it went up a little bit, which was really good, especially because now you're going to be done with work. And then you can focus on being able to build a bit. But the goal is to build without losing his abs. So we want to keep it outline of his abs and just work on the body parts. Because if you get heavy too heavy too quickly, you put on that body fat. You're more likely to put on body fat. So what we're doing right now in his program is just putting in a clean bulk. And that means that we're not going to lose the abs. We're going to still continue to keep the outline of the abs. But we're going to try to build up as much strength as can because we want to be able to thicken up the legs and be able to utilize just more volume but with heavier weight. So as you've seen in the previous videos, I felt like you can definitely be stronger on some of the lifts. But today we're going to focus on quads and hamstrings, hamstring, dominant, and we're going to use a little bit of caffeinated pre-workout today. So a great drink. Mm-hmm. You're a great drink. Yep. Are you trying to play with it? No, I was. Okay, cool. So you haven't tried to play with it yet. I think the last one that blew up in your face was Patriot Pop. Yes. That was good. That was funny. I remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Everywhere. I just held it. It just exploded. That's why we called Patriot Pop. So all right. Let's go ahead. We're going to do this workout and do not forget to make sure you like. You subscribe and get into the comments and let us know what you think in regards to the series. Because I want to hear what you guys want to add to this. Because I feel like there's a lot more that we can but we want to hear from you directly in the comments section. Let's do this. All right guys. So we're doing Apple HQ boom and then with the extreme. Great. So again scoop 200 milligrams of caffeine. If you guys have high tolerance scooping half the two scoops two scoops max and then. I think you just do this to mess around. I think Skirto did this to mess around. Oh, make him a thing. Yeah, making it drip. He does this stuff all the time. Yeah. The full guy? Yeah. I think he literally poured some just now. That's crazy. The sticky. I'm not talking about weed. I'm talking about HQ. So again, what makes a Q different S7 vitamin C that's sodium based. It's going to help with nitric oxide S7. Help read nitric nitric oxide. The B-tain in there. So it's not just a plain glycerol. When I designed the six years ago and came out with it, it wasn't designed to just be glycerol. It was designed to be a complete glycerol hydration solution. So that means that you have glycerol, but you also have the components on the S7 as well as you also have the sodium based vitamin C. And then on top of that you have the B-tain also. So it's going to help with not only the vitanotherwise known as tri-metallic glycine. We'll also help with inflammation, but it also helps with power. power. So again, mixing all those together creates a synergistic effect, nitric oxide, nitric oxide plus hyperhydration of the lissoral creates pumps that last way longer than just powder alone. They work well together. It's super good. It's solid, right? Yeah, they call them mini-channel. I go like, yeah, was that great, pineapple? Yep. It's dope. Alright, so let's get with it. Now we're going to have to check the legs. The before, the pump. Let's get in there. And this is how the before the pump is going to look. Right there. Right there. Stand right there. Right there in that light. Pull them up, homie. Alright, so we got before. Okay, squeeze those legs. Yep. Yep. We got, I don't know, I think I got you. I don't know, man. I don't even have any trained legs, but forever. But I don't know. Turn it inside. You don't want this old man to beat you. Yeah. Come on, put it up your foot and go to the side like you're doing a side chest. There you go. There you go. Okay, so what are we trying to do? We're trying to fill in the quad. We want that to really, really just go much, much fuller on the outer sweep. We want that hamstring to drop. We want to fill in the calves. That's the thing. Again, everyone's like, oh, he's very similar to fill. We'll fill had really good calves. So one of the things that you're going to have to do is really break through. Genetically, blessed up here, not so much down here. So again, now it's time to try to balance that out. Not easy. So we're going to have to really hammer that lower body. So quad hamstrings as well as calves. That's what we're going to train today. And, I don't know, man. I don't know. You don't want any of this. This is like, I definitely beat you with this. This department. I'll beat you in that. Yeah. Boom. Okay. I got you. You got some old men. I'm bad muscle in there. All right. So we're going to go ahead and we're going to start off with some hamstring curls. We want to really become more hamstring focused today. So let's get that going. I'm about lying hamstring curmishing. So, banana hamstring curlmishing. My favorite hamstring curlmishing because the biomechanics are so good. The knees are lined up right with that center joint. This is good. I'm good. So you want to go right before it touches. Back up. Don't touch. Just go back all the way right there and back up. Excellent. Good. Good. Remember right before it touches and back up. Good. Go all the way. There you go. Just two more. Good. One more. Good job. We'll rest up. We'll do about a minute rest. Then we'll go ahead and add some more weight and start getting into working. You know it's crazy. I don't remember exactly the way I did last time. But I'm pretty sure what you're doing more than I did last time. I think it's pretty close. I think that's where you maxed out that last time. Yeah. That's good. That's what I told you. You're excited. He's excited. He's going to do more than 77 pounds on the hamstring. Yes. We're moving up. It will be hard to do as kind of as you can see without you being there. So I'm like being there to push me. So I guess like building that mental fortitude now is going to help a little bit. But at the same time, you need some more of a rough. And you make me do 10 more. So it's like, yeah. So I don't know. It's all right. There's going to be built in. So what I've been doing is doing all these body parts with them. So I can build them because custom program. Now what is that going to consist of? Well, FST 7 sets. What are FST 7 sets? Their ways of increasing intensity without a workout partner or a trainer there to push you. So if you have to do 30 seconds of rest, it's going to increase intensity in between sets. So you're going to be able to really hammer in those extra sets and the extra reps. And then we're going to throw in partials and four strips whenever he has a spot with them. So again, those are ways of being able to increase intensity. That's why I created it because all my clients were remote. So when I was there, I could push them hard. But then when I created FST 7 was so that I can be able to create structure for them to create intensity without me being there. So that's exactly why I created it. And you're going to be able to use it after we put the whole program together at the end of next week. So that when you go away to school, you know exactly which are supposed to do with reps sets and everything else. All right. Let's throw. All right. Cool. You go up a little bit for the work. Yep. Yep. I'm at 77 right now, what you should think like 88 or 90. Got some food in me. Got a little turkey burger. It's going a little heavier. Just go one or two more. I got a little turkey burger. We got the energy going. Jesus, black pepper. Yeah. That is turkey burger from Ellie Burger. Yeah. It's a bag. Turkey. Because it's lean and mean, bro. Now that it's from back. I got it. I got it. I got it. Get ready for my transformation challenge. Yeah. I'd certainly burger soon. Yeah. I've never had Ellie Burger. I got to go back to real burger. Yeah. I got to get that real stuff, man. That real burger hit different. All right. Did you guys see that thing where the guy took three different burgers and then he stored him for a month to see Hump which one rotted? That's the same after seven months. It was one month. Look exactly the same as seven months. The second was Burger King. At least it molded a bit. He got moldy. Then the third one was five guys. And it was the worst because it just absolutely eroded. Which means that it was something that had the realest food and the realest ingredients because it was completely rotten. And that's what you want out of your real food. So again, if food looks the same after a month, six months, years, no bueno. That's like a McDonald's. Yes. Go. Go. Yes. Yes. Literally does. Go. Go. Come on. Now with me. Two. Two. Go. One more. Come on. Come on, Julian. Let's go. Let's go. All the way up. All the way up. All right. Good job. Awesome. Awesome. So he peaked out at 77 pounds. The last leg workout. Today, nine pounds. Solid solid. And again, every machine is different. So if you use 150 pounds, don't think it's the same unless you have the exact same piece of final equipment, then you can be able to compare and contrast what you're doing versus Maddie Guy. Yeah. Give me ten. One. Two. Good. Three. Excellent. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. You got it. Go. Come on. Come on. Come on. This is that mental toughening. Come on. One more. Go. Go. Go. Right there. That's it. All right. Well, that's going to be a pain in the leg stretch out. That's how we harder stretch than the quads. Because you don't have to do for the like stretching. For it. You go like this. Is that when we bend it? No. That's squat. So what you're going to have to do is you're going to have to pull forward. So you could literally like here. I'll give you a quick quick peek. Sit down here. Put your leg up. Up on there. Where your head was. Left leg up there. No, that's so that is quiet. Okay. Okay. Now. Off. Put your foot. Lay this way and put your hip this way. Like that. There you go. I mean, lean forward. Yep. Describe your ankle. Angle. Not toe. Not the inside. Outside. There you go. Okay. There you go. All right. That makes sense. Yeah. So again, what you normally do in a lot of people ask. Back in the day, stretching, stretching, stretching. When is the most important time of stretch? Actually after you train. So a lot of different clinical studies have been shown to this train. If you do too much stretching, I can actually your hinder performance before you train. So after training, optimal time to stretch. Foam rolling. It's going to help with recovery. Stretching. Estested stretching. All of those things. So we'll get more into that as well. Okay. Let's go. One more set. Two. Good. Oh. Okay. Two heavy. Okay. Light it up by two. Go. Come on. Stop it and let's go. Go. Go. Good. Go. Good. Go. Come on. Stay lighting it up again. Light it up by another two. Okay. Go. Good. Go. We're up those hamstrings. Go. Up. Good. Good. Last set. All right, guys. So when you can't hit that 10 to 12 rep range, or even if it's just as low as 8, then you want to be able to cut the weight down, do a drop. Do a couple reps. Drop again. Then get yourself into that range. So don't just stop. Give up and end the set. Make sure you create more intensity by lowering it and making it into a drop set. These are ways that you do not have to have someone like myself or a workout partner be able to have to help you all the time. You can create that intensity on your own, but whatever you do, you do not want to sacrifice too much form because you don't want to end up pulling your lower back on that movement. So make sure that you are not going too fast or not use momentum. But he's learning as he goes. How many workouts have you done for that hamstring? Since the last time I trained you. I want to other ones. One, three. Yes. So three total. Okay. So one with me, one without me, and this is our third. Okay. How did the second one go? Without me. It went pretty good for what I could. So I know I was listening a little bit to intensity, but I was able to work it. So I, you know, I feel like I've got you as ready to all of the time. Good. Good. So again, these are going to be ways that when he's back in school if he even doesn't have a workout partner with them, that he's going to learn these concepts so that he can increase intensity even by training along. Now, on hook. Now you hold that. No, no, that both. Keep it there. Okay. That's, that's going to stay unhooked. Okay. Okay. Now you're going to go ahead and you're going to come down. And then back up. Booyah. Okay. Good. All right. So now we're doing the Pinata Bell Squad. Many gyms around the world have a Bell Squad machine now it is. So keep, you want to keep that there. Good. There you go. Good. Excellent. You're going to keep his chest up. You're going to go down all the way back up. Really good range of motion. Now what we're doing is we're trying to give him full range of motion. So he really be able to accentuate. Glutham not hitting just parallel, but actually going full range of motion. But the knees are not traveling too far in front of the toes. They're just right above the toes. Getting deep. And back up. Excellent. Good. Warm him up. Feeling pop pop in that leg. Good. Good. Good. Good. One more. Excellent. Now we're going to lock it in. Just forward. Come down. And relax. There you go. We're addressing positions. I feel like you've been resting. It's like a little bit of tension in there. Okay. There you go. Let's go. Time to get those legs to grow. Good. Good. Good. And these are tracking perfect. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Good. 10. Good. Two more. 11. One more. Good. Lock it in. All right. That was the second warm up. One plate. First warm up. Two plates. Second warm up. Now it's time to throw another plate. So we're going to actually start doing some working sets. Like when everything starts to grow. I think that if I had to decide right now, I think you have a more open style physique because you don't have that crazy wasp waste. But you just never know it because you've got a lot of development to do. So there's a lot of development going on here. But if I had to guess right now, I would say you definitely have more of an open style physique. But that can absolutely change. Yeah. I'm not against open. I'm not against other ones. So that's the open. This guy's crazy. Yeah. But this again. You've got to still got to do your first show. Yeah. So let's do it. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. So easy. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Chest up. Good form. Good. Right to the bottom. Without touching. Right there. Back up. There you go. Keep constant tension. Good. Let's go. Good. Good. Sounded to do a lot of that lower body. Good. Keep going. Good. There you go. Come on. You got three. Go. Show me. Go. You got this. You got this. No help. Everybody's watching. Everybody's watching. All the way. Up. You got one more. You got one more. You can do this. Good. Big legs. Big legs on stage. One last one. Show everyone. Everyone's watching. Drive it. Good job. Good job. And up. Easy. Last one. You got it. Good. Good. Good. Now how you feel like you're getting to that thing? Yeah. One more. That's it. Because I didn't have the lower. I didn't have the goal of. Mr. Lempia. Like, not too long ago. And when doing my research, I told me. Seeing Ronnie feel. Flex. I was like, that's inspiring. And then I'm doing the cut. So like, when I run like, well, I'll see push passes like to see them. And it's hard to be like them because it's like, It doesn't matter how much money you're going through. Like, they don't do. They gave it their all. You know what I mean? So it's inspiring to see them. Like, that definitely helped me a lot. Just be able to see it. And it like, probably would go to a competition. And I would be great. So I was like, it's a scene in person. You see them up there. Like, glowing in some of those spotlights. So it would be awesome. Yeah. He's got to go to this first show. So there's the Texas pro coming up. We're going to make sure you try to make it out there. So he can see his first show and walk him through with a whole bodybuilding show is. He's talking about trying to be Mr. Olympia. But he never even do a show before. So again, guys, this is from the beginning. Round before the big show. So it's like just showcasing it. No, it's at the end. After all the preliminary. So in the morning, the pre-judge is where all the comparisons are. And then the finals for the amateur is more of just displaying your physique. But it's not usually judged for the finals for the amateur for the men's professional. You have 50% judge in the morning and 50% judge at night. So they judge before they just said you pre-judging before and in same day than that's when the actual show is. Yes, unless you can let the Olympia it's two different days Friday and Saturday. So you have to come back and peek again. So when you go out and do that forward, the men's are open for a classic it's morning than evening. So what's the pre-judge before? Just that you know what's the pre-judge? To compare. And that's where a lot of they can guess who's going to win. They're not going to guess. They're judging you on what your strengths and weaknesses are compared to the person next to you. That's what pre-judging is. Wow. This is something that's like back to the basics. Two good. Three. Five. Good. Keep going. Next. Good. All the way. Up. Seven. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Up. Good. Up. Good. Keep going. Good. All come on. That. That's what you're done. You're done. So guys, this is a bit of that newbie stuff going on. Where normally you'd be able to get one more and he just drops. This is something that's going to be something very mental. I definitely feel that he could have done one more but he's scared. And that is for a part of being able to break those plateaues. You know, it's saying I could do one more. And the reason why I'm saying that is because he did the last one much easier than someone that would normally end up going to failure on that last one that he just ended up not doing. So again, I think that part of that is a little bit of a mental block but he's going to get through that. Let's do it every workout of all the time. Okay, but workout in terms of what? Just in general, like if you're a second to do a go with home piece of equipment, what was you want to have? I love that fly machine. I'm not saying one favorite. The one, do you have a standing one? Yeah. I'm hooked on that recently in the last couple because I can do ladder raises with it. I can do, you know, reduce with it. I can do cable fly almost style with it. I love that flight machine. Yeah, it is nice. It's really nice actually. I've never seen a gym how that before. Yeah, there's there's large jumps that have it but not every single gym has it. Yeah. But if I had to pick one total piece of equipment, he would probably be a cable cross over machine because you can do so much with them. Yeah, you know, because there's like six different, you know, exercises you can do with that. I'll get a Vince Fess because I can do anything with that because I can the bar, I do some curls. You hear it? Oh, of course. Curls. Yeah, it's not favorite. It's like I can tell. Let's go. Come on. And don't forget to re-rack your weight. Yep. Let's go. Control it. Good. You got to chest up. Drive with the glutes hamstring. That's it. Good. Again. Excellent. Chest up. Good job. Good. Come on, Julian. Come on, Julian. Up, up, up. Good. Come on. You got two with me. Up. One more. Drive. Drive. One more. Come on. Come on. Come on. One more. One more. Up. Good job. Good job. I'm a ghost. Come on. I can already feel it here, man. What do you call it? Like the gasses? Like the acid build up. Turn it up. See what the pump looks like. Back it up. Back it up. Over there. Right in front of that evening logo. So that's where the light is right there. Right there. Turn around. You got that light. There you go. Boom. Both legs. Both legs. Both legs. Both sides. Come on. Bend those knees. No more popsicle sticks. Yes. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Push the legs. How you doing? Turn your knees out. Just a little bit. Like that. And then push. Do you feel the hardness in the out? Yeah. We out. Hold that. Hold that. Hold it. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Harder. Five seconds. Four. Squeeze. Three. Two. Five. All right. All right. Exercise two down. We need a couple of warm up sets. A couple of working sets. Again. He's feeling through that pain. Do you feel like you're doing better the tolerance? Yeah. Because I'm starting to... I can't even start to see things. Like I'm starting to see... Like... Like the dream. You know what I mean? Just like building up to it. And like seeing like flexing everything. Like I keep wishing them. I like... I'm more of a visual person. Like every single of the kid I like to draw. And stuff like that. So I always see things. And so that's where we were helping me. Like whenever I feel like I can't do anymore. I just see those clips of like Ronnie and Flex and Thames. Like yeah, we gotta get up there man. That's right. That's right. So again, when those people ask out there, oh, is he taking drugs? Is he doing this? It's got to be. Look. He's never in a bloody building show. He is just starting to understand bodybuilding. He just started looking up videos of... I'm sure you've seen pictures of Ronnie in the past. Yeah. But you didn't see Flex or Phil. Right? That was very little. Ronnie did this thing where he... That was the most... Like the coolest thing he did. He had his legs like this. And then he started off like this. This is something like that. He saw those arms. I was like, yeah. But... It looked at a real. So again, Ronnie... And then now just starting to get a bit of taste. You know, people say, oh, very similar to Phil or a Flex physique. And I say Flex because I also know Flex was very bubbly as well. And both of them weren't known for being super wide, but just super bubbly. And especially Phil with a 3D look, right? And he just started to... After meeting me knowing who Phil is and being able to go do it, wasn't the other way around, which is super weird. But it's okay because again, I think... Who did you look up to when you were starting to train? What were the things? The first person that got me answered was Arnold. Arnold was a class kid. I kind of was like, cool. I saw a clubbing iron. And I was like, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Got you. Got you. Well, Arnold Arnold. You know? And he can't meet that. But it's one of those things when people always ask, oh, you sure he's natural? And I'm like, look, I'm not with you 24, 7. There's always people willing to lie. She still do all kinds of things. But I'm just going to tell you, I do know really good genetics. I've trained some genetically elite athletes in my time. And go look at Ronnie's arms and go look at Phil's arms before they even became body rotors. And you'll see what I'm talking about. We're going to do some straight lady delifts. You can do these with dumbbells. You can do them with barbell. I want to make sure we use this exercise time to be able to understand how to get the bright biomechanics down. So that he can take this back school. And when he goes back to school, he can be able to do these as he's there for most of the time throughout the year. It's fine. When I put my thumbs down, I can find the best ability. So is this a good width? Yeah. I mean, you, it's probably a little wide. I would go a little narrower, actually. I would go right there. There you go. Okay. And then bring your, yep, lift up. Good, back up. Good. Bring your feet closer together. That's it, right there. Keep your legs straight without locking your knees, but keep my straight as possible. Keep that bar right there. Good. Now your knees are a little too bent. Come down. Good. Keep it there. Back up. There we go. Good. Good. And drier. Good. That's good. Good. Good. Well, muscle so I'm using that. I think this is my back. Good. Well, muscle so I'm using that. I think this is my back. Keep going. Keep going. I'll tell you after. Go back straight. Good. Good. Good. You're going to feel it in your lower back. Yeah. You want to be able to. Yep. It's fine. You're going to feel in your lower back. But you're going to also feel it in your hamstrings. Good. You're going to feel stretching your hamstrings right there. Keep that legs straight. And drive up. You feel that stretching the hamstring? Yeah. Good. You got legs straight. Stretching the hamstring. And drive. Good. Good. Come on. Come on. Good. Come on. Come on. You got this. Keep a lot of extra. And drive. Good. Go ahead and rack it. Good. Have you ever done anything before? No. No. Okay. So again, guys. Never done straightly deadless before. There's a bunch of exercises in this last couple of weeks that he's never done before. I think he didn't very few if any lay curls. Again, you can see it. What does he normally do? He's like, oh, curls. So he's arms is so good. Right? And he's already been genetically blessed with arms. But now, again, we got to build that lower body. What's up? The forearm. It's like, sleek and nice. It's sleek. It's sleek. Yeah. Like, this is like, I'm not doing this. Oh, your fingers? Yeah. Does that? Oh. It's not like I'm vinded. He's not used to holding the barbell. So what's happening is your forearm is cramping up. Okay. Yeah. It's not like pain. Does it not get signs? I promise you. Does it not get signs? Yeah. Yeah. That's like, how do I know? It's not a grip sign. But how do I have my fixes? Easily. Yeah. We're going to get you some hydration. You haven't drinkin' off water. This is still weird. I don't have this before. Why do I do this? It kind of hurts, but I don't like this. That's weird. Screw it off. Think you're in five, right? I like flexors. That's your. Are you serious? Yeah. Right here. Oh, fuck. Yeah. There you go. Hi this. Open up your forearm right there. Is that feeling, you feel it in here? Ah. Yeah. Oh, I mean, I got it a little bit. All right. We'll get some good. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate it. I think that's the first muscle cramp. Now again, guys, we're not going to go heavy because he's just learning his form. There's no point. He's going to have his lower back in hot and fried. He's trying to get, you know, all of those other muscles are going to kick in. So I mean, look, he could barely even hold the bar. So. Okay. There you go. There you go. Just that mid-shin. Give your backs arched. There you go. Keep the bar close to your chin. Good. Bar closer. Chin, drive. Good. Good. Good. With those hamstrings. Good. Good. Just give me four more. Good. Good. Good. Just give me four more. Go. One. Good. You're the legs straight. You're back arched. Two. Three. You got one more. Good job. Good job. Good job. All right. Yeah, definitely helps. It's good. It's time to grow those legs. You can't have arms like that. And I have big legs. Just add that to the protein shake. Good to go. I'm going to punch those little cases and stuff in my mini-fresh. You just get regular milk. Like not the low fat ones. Yeah, just regular milk. You can use low fat for a little bit less calories. Again, you don't want to go crazy. But you also got to make sure that you can digest it. You're okay. You don't have any of that black to some tolerance, right? I like that. You are? Yeah, I just fist best of it. No, but I would do it. Your life is a tolerance. You don't want to do it. Because you get bloated. You don't feel it digest. Don't force it. You don't have any problems with the isolate, all right? Yeah, it's because it's got it's so clean. And it has a kniter in there. And the kniter really helps with making sure you maximize the absorption. So that's what that enzyme does. So a lot of people can't absorb way normally can with the isolate object because of the kniter that's in it. That on this one, let's go. Good. Go. Good. Leg straight. Leg straight. You can be shoulders back. Stretch the hamstring and back up. Good. Good. Again. Good. Again. Good. Again. Three, three, three. One. Two. Keep going. You got this as your last set. Work hard. Good. One more. Good job. That's it. That's it. Awesome. Awesome. All right, guys. So the reason why we're not going heavier like I mentioned earlier is his lower back is going to get fried. He's not used to the movement. This is the first time ever doing this. Again. First time ever doing a straight leg deadlift. Right. Yeah. So what you don't want to do is go too heavy and then you're going to end up frying your lower back. Then you'll never get to that hamstring pump that you're looking for. So these are all exercises that you have to get through the first couple of times for your body. Get that mind muscle connection. Now we're going to go on to a seated lake roll. Good. Control control the way up. Good. Control control the negative. You're starting to control your negatives and that's why you're growing. When we're doing those shoulder press, we start controlling that negative. Now three or four workouts later. Shoulders are trying to grow, right? Okay. Good. Now we got to get those legs to grow. Good. Good. How many more you got? You call the number. How many you got? Three. Okay. Four. How many now? Two. Two more. Three. How many more? Five. Come on. Keep going. How many got left? Come on. Keep going. Go, go, go, go, go. That's it. All right. Yeah. Press that out. Pull that out. Push down and pull it out. That's going to show you how to do now. Oh, there you go. There you go. The torture chamber. Yeah. Three. Okay. How many more do you have left? Come on. Eight. Come on. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One more. One more. Come on. Pull. You got this. Come on. Come on. There you go. Oh, stop. That's what you're doing. Come on. Boom. Two. Good. Good. Good. There you go. Keep going. Good. Come on. You have left. Five. That's it. Six. That's it. That's it. Seven. Good. There you go. Keep going. Good. Come on. You have left. Five. That's it. That's it. There you go. Come on. Come on. Keep going. Good. Keep going. Good. Keep going. Good. Keep going. Good. Good. Keep going. Go. Good. Good. Go. Come on. You got two. Come on. Oh. Oh. I can't get out. There you go. Okay. You're done. Good. Good. Good. Make sure that has good. Yeah. That's good. We're going to do a little bit of calves to finish this up. Again, he got to do his first time doing a straight leg deadlift today. We focused on hamstring curls first. Then we went into a belt squat. Then we straight leg deadlift. Then we went here. And now we're going to go ahead and do some calves. Let's go. Okay. There you go. So the key to calves is full range of motion. As you notice, not genetically gifted. Gifted? Not so gifted. So what we're going to do is he's going to have to work even harder on his lower body, especially his calves. Go. Good. All the way up on your toes. Full range of motion. Good. The most important part of this exercise is the stretch portion at the very bottom. Good. You want to go up as high as you can on your toes. Good. Down. And you don't want to let go. You want to go slow on the way down. There you go. You want some tension on there. So go all the way up. Up. Good. All the way up. Good. So you can notice that he's not very strong. So once again, probably because he's not used to doing these. Are you used to doing these? No. Julie and are you used to doing these? No. Good. But I guarantee you you know he's worth a curl bar. Yeah. So for the last four or five years he's been training. He's been stuck on the curl machine and the curl bar and dumbbell curls and easy bar curls. And curls for the girls. Yeah. Good. That's the football model man. Yeah. And like her. Cross the girls man. Yeah. Like her up it was biased for the beach. Oh yeah. And you guys full range of motion. You've got to slow on the way down. That's one thing that he used to do a lot of is go up and then explode and then drop the weight. So there was no tension on the negative now. We're going to work on that negative tension even more. Slow on the way down. Good. Two seconds on the way down. Go up. Good. One thousand one. One thousand two. Good. Up. Up. Good. Yes. And then you always refocus your feet. As you slide down which is natural tendency in the exercise you just get to reshuffle your feet to get it right back to that starting position again. Good. Again. You don't want to lock your knees. You want to keep your legs straight but without locking them completely. And go up. Up. Up. Good. Good. So if you notice this reminds me just like when we did the first time we did shoulder press. Why you not train calves? Well I think I do like barbell calf raises. I just don't think that I was either a and I doing a properly or I just think I don't think it was like I was doing it with proper form. So it was kind of just putting a whole bunch of stuff in there. Got you. And again utilizing a barbell and setting up on a box. Nothing wrong with it but it's obviously much easier when you have a really good machine with a right bio and mechanics. So this is the Pinata Viking Press slash cab. You can actually do a shoulder press with it. You can do a single arm shoulder press with it because you can go ISO and lock. Or you can do what he was doing which is actually a cab raise. So standing cab raise. So again make sure you work both angles. You have one that's going to be a standing and then we can also do seated. We're going to do both. We're done with this one. There's nothing left to do because you can barely do it. Now we're going to go ahead and do seated for the solius. You're holding on like you're right a little more cycle. Like a little roller coaster. More cycle. Okay now don't lean back. Keep your back straight. Now let your knees go up and down. Okay. Let your ankles go up and down. There you go like that but don't lean back. Lean into it. Like that. Right there. Boom. Now stretch. Get your ankles down. Good. Oh you got to unlock it. Push. Okay. Like that. Now go. See how that works. Yeah. Have you ever never done seated? Never. There's another new level that's been unlocked. He's never done seated cabbages. This is fine. Actually, you can kind of tell you you have never done seated cabbages. Go. Go. Got to eat like a little. If you have eaten it. Good. Go. There's a very potter item or a lander. That's it. Go Mr. Harry Potter ride. Good job. Good. We've got the next level unlocked. Let's go. Good. Come on. Three more. One. Two. One more. All the way up. One more. Okay. Good. Now lock it. There you go. Okay. So guess how much that weighed? Zero. That's pretty much. There's no weight on the side. That's all just the machine weight, which is probably about 30 to 50 pounds. So now we're going to add some weight to it. We're going to start off with just some quarters. I think too crazy. And then we're going to see how he does. But that was literally with no weight. I think this is my favorite machine. Go on. This is so fun. Good. Up. That's it. Good. Up. Two. Good. Keep your toes straight. Keep your feet straight. Don't let your ankles roll out or in. Just keep them straight and good. And then nice stretch. Good. Stretch. Good. Now drop it up. Good. Okay. Now when you go home and come up next couple of days, you're going to do a video about how you're feeling and tag me on it. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Go. Squeeze. Good. Go. Okay. That ain't how you're making this money. I thought you were in this money. You go. That's what I was about to happen about. Up. Come on. Come on. You go. Yeah. There it is. Okay. Stand up. Go stand over there right there. Now turn around. Go up on your toes. Right there. Go up on your toes. Good. Good. Hold it. Squeeze. Up. Straight up. Hold that. Hold it for five seconds. Good. Go down. Good job. Okay. Keep those toes straight. Reconfigure your feet. Move them in a little bit. There you go. There you go. Keep your ankles from rolling inward. Keep them straight. And then go all the way down and all the way up. Good. Good. Good. Squeeze. Good. Again. Good. Remember what I said about your back. Keep your back straight. And let your lower body come down. And go back up. Good. Again. Up. Again. Good. Okay. Now go down and go halfway up. Come on. Come on. Three different of those. Go. That's one. Come on. Higher. Higher. Higher. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Okay. Better get it high enough so you can pull that in. Go. There you go. All right. So didn't go crazy. Didn't try to kill him. We didn't do a lot of exercises that we'd normally do if it was a top to your pro or top Amateur. Why? Because there's no point when we're trying to stimulate the muscle. We're trying to go over the proper form. There's a bunch of exercises that was his first time. And there's no point in me beating him. So hard that he's going to end up at risking either getting hurt or that he's going to end up being out for so long that he's not going to be able to get back in the gym. I think last time it was just enough, right? Yeah. Yeah. And you're sore for about four days? Yeah. Four maybe five days. And again, as a recovery gets better, he ends up stretching a little bit more. He's able to do the exercises more than once. Then he's going to be able to create a lot more recovery because his body's going to get a little bit more used to it. Then we can add exercises, variants, and literally all of the above. How was the workout? I was great. I was able to feel the hamstring isolation. So it was really good. That machine over there was the best for hamstrings. I don't think I've been able to focus on like that. So it was really nice. Caves to keep in my calf strapping. That's why even though I was doing them right barbell, I was probably letting my calves go outside so it could bring in other muscles and stuff. But this was a great hamstring workout. So I appreciate it. Yeah, but I absolutely again, always willing to teach the upper body. I teach the upper and coming young bucks. And I really feel that he's got so much room to grow. So again, let me know in the comments below whether or not you want to see what workout you want to see next. And what other parts of this journey you guys would like to see while we're being able to do these filming. So again, love you all. Honey, Julian, peace.
