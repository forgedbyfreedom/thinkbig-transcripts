All right, guys. We're here with Axel. He is in his clean bulk phase. So what does that mean? That means that we're doing this calorie surplus, but we're trying to make sure to keep that midsection tight. So again, outline of abs, while we're growing and getting stronger. Yesterday, we were able to hit chest. He put up almost 110. Almost 110. Yeah, almost 110 pound dumbbells. When I first met him, I think you were doing 50. 50, 55. Yeah. So you was doing half of that. When I met him, literally a year ago. So he's double-destranked so far, which is amazing. What we're doing now is we're doing back, because we want to be able to, as he's getting more 3D through his chest, is now going to add in those layers because we're always trying to get that turtle shell look that thickness in the back so that you don't end up being too dimensional. You're three-dimensional, even from the side. So today, we're going to start off with some pull-downs and get into our rows. And we're going to work on some freeweight things. So that way, when he goes back to Mexico, he knows exactly the form to use with the heavier weight. So you're ready? Really. I want to see something first. No, you can't. Anyways, no. Yeah. Bye. Yesterday, I checked my weight one year before. When I come on first time. And the first time you're here, yeah. I was almost 40 pounds less than no. 40 pounds almost. I win 17 kilos. 17 kilos in one year. Maybe like 12 on the muscle? I don't know. Yeah. Because I wasn't lean lean. Yeah, you're really a bit like that. But again, almost 35, 40 pounds of muscle are pretty close. But the point, or I should say, wait, the point is that he's putting in so much dedication. This is now become his life. What he's doing is focusing every day on the training. He tends to be pictures. He talks about training. So again, guys, I have not stopped coaching. I am just now starting to work on the next generation of athlete. So whether you're 18 years old or you're 48 years old, you can always improve. So this is why we do this content. This is why we do these videos. So share with you our journey. So you can never be young enough. My son started working out when he was 11 years old, 10 years old. And now we have El Nino, who just turned 21. That's right. Ben Thay O'Neal. Ben Thay O'Neal. Ben Thay Sinkle. So Mr. 25. And I'm having a great time because I love seeing his energy. And his energy is absolutely next level. So I love being a part of that. So we're going to have some fun. And then who knows, maybe we get some Texas barbecue tacos or Texas barbecue barbecue. Barbecue. Ah, okay. We're going to go to town. We go to town. Okay. So when I come to Mexico, then we're going to do that. Let's do it. Let's do it. Go to town. All right guys. Here's an FSC7 tip for you. Make sure that you're focusing on just the warm-up to not make life-wates into working sets. All you're going to do is to team the muscle. All right. Good job. Let's go.

Good. That's better now. Cool. Oh yes. Good. Stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch. Oh yeah. Come down. Oh. You're fired. I'm not fired. You're going to control it. It's too heavy for you. You're trying to keep up with me. No. You make me laugh. No. You're spawning it on one side. It's like this. You don't know. That's what you know. You have your hand on one side. You got down. You got down. And it's going to be in balance. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. This is it. I was trying to make me come back. I have to stop now. Because of actually. Good. One. Good. Two. Good. Three. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Six. Slow down. Slow down. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Five. Five. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. This is your spot. Let's go. You get it. Lower. Lower. Lower. Lower. Lower. Right there. Hold it there. Hold it there. Five. Good. Stretch. Good. Good job. Lower. Good. Good. You got one more set with that. Three. Come on. Let's go. Eight to ten. Let's go. One. Go. Control. Stretch up. Stretch up. Two. Three. Good. Four. Good. Four. Good. Four. Good. Four. Control. Control. Five. Good. Go. Six. Loats. Loats. Loats. Stretch. Go. Good. Stretch. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Right there. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Now stretch slowly. Good. Now. One. One. Stretch more.

Two more. Two more. Good. One more. Good job. That's it. Good. All right. So now. Second exercise. We're going to do his rows. So again, one of my favorite exercises, especially the reverse grip version that hits those lower lats. We're going to do those. Make sure he knows how to do them. So when he goes back to Mexico, he knows this is going to be his homework. Archer back. Keep your core tight. There. Good. And a little more. And a little more. There you go right there. Good. Control slow. Good. Bring your elbows back. Stretch your troughs. And bring your elbow back there. You go. Boom. Stretch your lats. And drive. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Control. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Control. Good. Good. When he gets tired, he's going too fast. Control quality or reps over quantity or reps. The second thing is he was bending over not enough. So he was too upright. Then you're going to hit a lot of trap and you're not going to get as much back. So you don't want to be parallel with a ground but you want to be a little bit higher than parallel and you want to pull right into that waist. So you really contract, stretch the arms, and then again. Now you're gonna pick up, you're gonna get the right position, you're gonna arch your back, and bring it to the belly button and control it. Okay? Okay. Eight reps, eight quality reps. Okay. Let's go. One, control, two, control, three, four, five, control, six, better, better, better, seven, control, up, slow, let's say. Good job, much better, much better. The biggest thing that you gotta worry about when it comes to this is when you go too heavy, you're just gonna have a ton of trap recruitment. When you wanna really blast your back, especially when you're trying to focus on that reverse grip, you wanna be able to come to the belly button, stretch, and then return. You do not want to be fidgety, you do not wanna use momentum. You wanna actually bring those elbows back and feel all those fibers really, really firing. Control, okay? One, those, the rest, one, single, says, sit there. Oh, no, oh, oh, Joe. I can get it. No, good. Show me like you're teaching somebody. Let's go. Perfect. Excellent. Okay. Okay. Three, four, stretch, five, six, good? Good, good job. That's it, good. Good. Good. Before he was only using a 25 on your side, now he's got a plate and a quarter, which is fantastic. Form is really good. Now when he goes home, I'm gonna want him to go to two plates, eventually two and a half plates, but it's all coming together. He's put on almost 30, 40 pounds since a year ago, when we started together, so I'm very, very excited to see him continue to get growing. Don't. All the way down, come on. Good. Good. Good, you're not stretching. Stretch all the way up. All the way up, good. There you go. All the way. More, all the way, all the way. All the way, higher, higher, there you go. That's cool. Oh yeah, good. Come on, bro. Good. Good. And go all the way down. Stretch, and then go down. Oh, good. Good. Both of the elbows, but they're all on the pad and the floor. Good. Good. Two more. Controls, stretch, stretch, and pull. One more. Good job. Good job, Russell. Don't. Don't. Give me a one. Oh yeah. Do you feel better? Yeah. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Stretch. Two. Two. Nine more, one more. Control it. Good job, perfect. One more. Last set, guys. Let's go. One. Good. All the way down. Go. Go. Give me eight. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One more. Control it. Keep your hips back. You can take a tight. Go. Good. You got one more. Come on. All the way. All the way. Okay. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. Fight, slow. Good job. Hold your. Go. Just bring back. We're relaxed. Out back for a while, sir. Start again. Go up with your hands over your head and then come again. There you go. Make a fist. Make a fist. Make a fist. Make a fist. Make a fist. Turn your wrist. That's better. That's better. That's better. That's better. Hold that. Hold it. Don't shake. Hold it. Do it. Do it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Hold it. Don't shake. Do it. Four seconds. Three. Two. And one. Good job. All right, guys. So basically, just got done. Blast them back. Three. Awesome exercises. Two variations of a pull down. Overhand as well as neutral grip on the Pinata pull down machine. Then we came over, made sure that he's recognizing the proper form, reverse grip, as well as overhand grip on the bent over barbell rows. And then the final exercise was the Pinata pull over machine. Again, have to really line up the shoulder joint along with the cam. Once we were able to do that, he had a really good range of motion. And then the fourth exercise, drink your protein. Honey Rambad. And get axle. Peace.
