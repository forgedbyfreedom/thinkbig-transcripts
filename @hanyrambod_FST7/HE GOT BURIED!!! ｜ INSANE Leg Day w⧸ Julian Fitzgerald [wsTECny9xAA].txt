I'm going to throw a Wizzichash guy. Uh, hi, why'd you do this, me, man? Alright guys, I'm here with Julian Fitzgerald, our new, you've been an athlete. We're getting ready for our second workout, ever. We are ready to bid shoulders. Yeah. And again, when we were in the gym together, uh, that video's gone off, because everyone's talking about all the different things you mentioned. But before we get into that, and before we get into this workout, I do want to mention the floods of 4th July, weekend here in Texas. In South Texas, uh, entire kids' camps got wiped out. The floods and the rain came in the middle of the night. And what we've decided to do is, Evegen is, be able to take all the proceeds for the shirt that we launched that weekend. We're going to continue to keep pushing this. Everything that we are going to sell regarding this shirt is going to, all the proceeds are going to go to the victims. So we're going to be working with the county and be able to put together a, uh, there's a victim fund, and we're going to be able to give all the proceeds. So if you go on the Evegen website, and you purchase one of the new, uh, Evegen USA shirts, all the proceeds are going to go to them. So again, really appreciate any support on that end. It was devastating disaster. And, um, I cannot even imagine losing my child, losing parents, losing, you know, just these kids, there were so many kids. So if there's anything you can do or you'd like to do, then this is what we're going to do. Even though we're about five hours away from where the tragedy happened, we want to be able to do whatever we can with the team Evegen to be able to help out. So again, guys, all proceeds, while the shirt lasts on the site, all the proceeds are going to go towards the victims. So, um, appreciate you guys all for all the support and all the outpouring, the text messages because they didn't know how close we were to those floods, for all the friends and family that hit me up and hit up all of our loved ones. So again, we're praying for everyone out there. Um, that's all we can really do at this point. Um, besides this, we are trying to do whatever we can to be able to help out. So again, any health on your end would be tremendously appreciated. So going into that, we do want to get our lake workout in and, um, how is after the shoulder workout? It felt a little fuller. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, yeah. So again, working out here, um, 19 year old phenom got kid that's got amazing genetics. Um, he's going to school full time, uh, in the University of what? Uh, I go to the University of Hampton. Okay. So, yeah, it's HBC and Virginia. Okay, in Virginia, getting his degree in business? Yes. That's also something. He's going to about to be a come a sophomore. So that's also very, uh, admirable. So he's sticking to body building, but keeping in the education front. And, um, the big muscle group that he really wants to work is his legs because that was another body part that we really wanted to bring up. So he's build up a shoulder. So we got that shoulder workout in. So if you haven't seen it, go check it out. Um, and the second one that we talked about is really bringing up his legs because he's about five foot almost five 11. Yeah. Yeah. So about five 11, about 200 pounds. And again, has never competed before. I want to compete has crazy, crazy goals. And some people are taking back by these goals. And again, I don't mind it. I remember when Phil Heath used to talk about, like, him wanting to win 10 Olympic titles. Right? Now, when you say that sometimes, like in the beginning of your journey versus after you turn pro, again, some people are going to just be offended by it. But at the end of the day, you do want to put these things in the universe. But he also does know that it's going to be hard, right? Yeah, of course. Yeah, it's going to be hard. Yeah. It's going to be difficult. I got lots of work on this a lot of mountains of climb. Do you have any problems? First show at some point. Yeah. Then you got to turn around and be able to then that first show has to qualify you to become somebody who can compete nationally. Then you go over there and try to be able to do that. If that's the next step. Sometimes you do junior nationals. A lot of Phil Heath and there's some other, so that did junior nationals before they went to a pro qualifier. Then you go to either the USA, the team universe, or the nationals, that are several different pro qualifiers, then after you qualify as a pro, then you have to turn around and be able to qualify and win a pro show to be able to qualify for the Mr. Olympia competition. So there's a lost step to this journey. But we want to do whatever we can to be able to get you involved and show you the journey and be able to the trials, the tribulations, the ups and downs. We want to be able to share that with you. So I'm very, very excited to be able to do that. Again, last the times. You guys see the end stages of trying to keep a Mr. Olympia title, or you're right on the cusp to become Mr. Olympia with a lot of the athletes that I've worked with in the last several years. But it's been a while since we showed it from the very, very beginning. So we're going to be able to do that and reset it. So again, hope you guys enjoy this. Let us know in the comments below what else you'd like to see as part of the series. Because we're listening to you. I'm going on to the comments. We got Julian going into the comments too. And he's reading them. So it's a little bit of a movie. Motivation too, right? Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, that's awesome. So again, now we're going to go ahead and blast legs. So again, thank you for all your support. God bless. Let's get this work out going. All right, guys. So one of the things that I don't show much of, because it's always considered known, we're going to do today, is actually talk about the warm up. So getting Julian on the bike and white bike versus treadmill versus basically a sit down recumbend bike. Well, because I like using a setup bike because you put a bit more tension on the quads and hamstrings. And so therefore warming up. But if you want to be able to do one of the other ones, by all means, you can do either of the cardio pieces as your warm up normally. It's about five. Sometimes some guys like to do like eight to 10 minutes. I like to do a minimum of five minute warm up just to get some blood rolling in there. And again, this is something to get your body kind of, just be able to get the blood circulating. But it also helps kind of prime the pump on your quads and hamstrings or calves, just to be able to make sure to get a little bit of that tension while you're doing the warm up. So again, do not forget your warm up, a little bit of light cardio before you start hitting quads, hamstrings is a really good idea. So do not forget that. Some of you get those legs to grow. I'm excited for it, man. It's always been some of that kind of, well, not really loud. That was the number one requested video. Yeah, because he knows, he knows my weak voice. He's trying to call me, yeah, it's okay, though. Yung, call me out, because it's like, right? Is it that you just train upper body more than life? No, I have a background in football. So, all right, like, with that being said, the train is for strength. So it's like, we're not doing aesthetic workouts, we're doing for strength. So like, low reps, high weight. Yeah, so the way I train my upper body was, because remember the main reason I started was because I pulled my hip flexor. So I couldn't walk, I couldn't run. So I was doing pushups. So that's why I'm not being in a train aesthetically. But how my legs are still, huh? How long goes that? That was a while ago. First started, like around 14-ish. Okay. So that's when I started training for upper body and getting aesthetic and stuff like that. But then, because I didn't have a trainer, I still train my legs the same way. So as you can probably see, like my legs are pretty strong, this is just don't look as strong as they actually are. You know, it's big, because you're not hitting the fibers. So again, just in summary, bodybuilding versus football, in football, they're not doing 10, 12, 15 reps plus. They're doing three reps, five reps, trying to get strong with squat. So they can turn around and be able to either, you know, what position you play? The other. Okay. It's going to be some big dudes. So I've had it. I have the base, you know? Yeah. So defense event. So that's a position where you're dealing with some big, big guys. And you've got to be able to have a lot of power in your hips. So that's why they got you under that squat bar. But again, to be able to get bigger, you don't necessarily need to be that strong and say, I'm going to do a single or a double for X number of pounds, which you need to be able to do is do time under tension and get that volume. And then the key is to be able to do that with heavier weights to get the ultimate goal, which is big, powerful legs. So now, not forget to hit your pre-workout. Today, we decided to do non-stim. You want to do on something? Tell me why you didn't want to do caffeine today. Which is totally perfectly fine, because I prefer non-caffinated or low-caffinated pre-workout. So again, if you do too much caffeine or any stimulant, you can end up having a muscle constriction. So I'm a huge believer in lower or running non-stim. But tell me why you decided to do that today. So I have ADHD. So caffeine kind of hits me kind of weird sometimes. I don't have to explain it sometimes. Did you keep your heart going now? Yeah, he's been a little bit, but it also makes me tired. And I crash like 10 times harder than most of the people. And in addition to that, I like to fill the pain. So when I'm working out, I want to be able to know that I'm giving him something not so on the comments. The last video was like, oh, he gave up. He had two or two more reps. And for me, that's one of the biggest criticism that I can get because I'm like, oh, yeah, y'all, right? I'm not giving him my, oh, I need a strength in my mental fortitude. You know what I mean? So I'm working on doing that. So I always love when I have an opportunity to strengthen my mind, because that's what we're working out really does. I feel like a strength is a mind more than the body, really. So I don't do caffeine because I just like to be in the moment that I like to really know that I'm doing what I can do. Yeah, exactly. I mean, the key is to be able to utilize some of those comments. Again, some of them are going to be super negative because some people are just like to be negative. Other people are going to be constructive criticism. And you take that and you be able to run with it. And one of those things was those comments talking about that. So again, thank you guys because giving that motivation, seeing that saying, hey, look, you could push that extra couple of reps. You guys have all seen me coach many, many people throughout my career. And it's all about me trying to push them to the next level. So he's going to have to learn that mental fortitude and be able to instill it within him so he can be able to go above and beyond. So let's get this pre-work out in. So we can get 3D and be able to get those quads really full. So we're doing just over a half a lid of the EVPAQ. And we're going to go two scoops of the 3D for the maximum dose of the 6 grams. So sit really in the 3.2 grams of beta alanine. Then you still have them tropics in there, like the lines made, the DMAE. They're going to help with focus with out the stem. So you're going to feel much more focused, but you're not going to have your heart beating. And again, I've talked about this before. When it comes to doing lays, your heart rate tends to go at the highest amount of beats per minute during squats, leg press, any of those because it's your biggest body part. What you want to do is not be overstimmed also so that it allows your heart rate to get back faster. So you want to be able to bring that back down. And if you're super stimmed up, it's going to make it even more difficult to bring you to be able to catch your breath because your heart rate's going to be still elevated. So that's another reason why you've got to really limit your caffeine and take on some of these body parts. So all right, I'll let you do the honors. Shaky Shake. Thank you. Thank you. There you go, sir. Thank you. That's why you've got to be a sponsor. That's because you've got to buy this. That's because you're a bottle, man. That's it. That's why it's called Patriot Pot. I'm like, that just feels spray. All right, guys, here's your FST7 tip. Whether you're a beginner or a advanced. You want to make sure that you're taking your pre-workout. And it's okay, whether you want to drink half of it or the whole thing before you start. Everybody keeps asking me, do I have to finish the whole thing? No, you don't. You can take half and then sip on the other half during the first 10 minutes of your workout. I prefer to drink all of it to try to get the full effects of the nitric oxide and the focus before. Therefore, I get maximum amount of blood flow during, but there's nothing wrong with drinking half of it and then sipping the rest. But I would urge you to finish it in the first 10 minutes so that you can be able to utilize it during your entire workout. So do not forget your pre-workouts and there's no wrong way of doing it. Just make sure you do it. Oh, wait you fast. Okay, slow down. Take your time. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. So we're going to do some warm upsets here. First thing he did, which very, very, I'm sure it instinctual for him, is explode. Right? And what we want to do is we want time and attention whether it's on the concentric, which is on the way up or the eccentric. So what we want to do is we want to control that. So you do not want to be able to just throw the weight up and then just let it drop. You need to create that time on your tension by being able to really control the tempo. Okay. So you're looking at about one to two seconds on the way up and about two seconds on the way down. Right now during the warm ups, you can go a little faster, but ultimately that's what we're going to do during the working sets. We're going to be doing between 12 and 15 reps. And that's the first set. We're going to do another set. What we're going to do is we're only going to be resting about 45 seconds. So 30 to 45 seconds on our traditional FST 7 sets. So we're going to do 7 sets with 30 to 45 seconds of rest in between. And this is what's called an FST 7 preload. Many times you've seen the FST 7 set at the very end of a workout, where you turn around in whether you do curls or whether you're doing a press or a fly, being able to do it at the very end. So this is also priming the pump on a preload by being able to do it in the very first exercise. Because what we want to do is the weakest body part on him is his legs. Again, his taller takes a lot longer to fill those in. He's been doing workouts with a lot more weight, a lot less reps. Where we want to do is create continuous tension, time under tension, and we're going to do that by doing these FST 7. Good. Good. Don't forget to breathe. Don't hold your breath. Good. Good. Go. Go. Go. Go. Good. Go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Breathe. And then those out through the mouth. Three more. One. Two. One more. Good job. Good. Good. So we're on the clock now. That was set two. We got five more to go. Two. Good. Good. Good. Good. Just go all there. There we go right there and then back in. Good. Little slow on the way down. Little slow on the way down. One thousand one. One thousand two. Good. Little slower. Good. Good. Again. Good. Good. Again. It's a little bit more. One. Control. Two. Good. Now slow. Slow. One more. One more. Good. One more. Good. Good. Up. Up. You got this. Come on. Go. Good job. There you go. Learn how to get past that pain threshold. Right. So that's it. Now use to it. Yeah. You can get in as soon. Now this time we're going to do is we're going to point your toes like a ballerina. You can straight. You feel a little bit more in your upper claw. Okay. Let's go. Good. Two. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Now toes can go upward and ceiling. toes up to the straight one. Good. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go. Go. Past the burn. The strength is there. You just got to get past the burn. Two. Good. Again. Two more. Good. One more. Go. Go. Go. Go. That's called lactic acid buildup. Very natural, but I don't feel you're used to being able to go that far past the initial burn. Usually stop. Yeah. Low ribs. I love any ribs. Yeah. So because he's been trained to be able to do just low ribs, getting phenomenal genetics, phenomenal physique, but you're trying to get to that next level. You're going to have to learn how to master the burn. So again, I can tell by the fact that his body is not actually going to failure. His mind's going to failure before his body is. So that's why I knew he could do one more, one more, one more, one more. So when you're watching me, whether you're on the app or you're watching one of my YouTube videos, it's really dialed in to be able to get someone to push past that point of pain because your body is not giving up. Remind this. Two. Three. Four. Five. Super strong. Good. Good. We're going. Keep going. Okay, now. Okay. You're going to relax for a second. I'll tell you when you do it. Put your toes towards the ceiling. Okay? You're going to keep your foot like that. Okay. Go. Go. Again. Good. Again. Good. Again. Good. Rest for a second. Catch your breath. Good. You got two more. Go. Go. Good. Good. Good. Rest for a second. Catch your breath. Catch your breath. All right. Again. Go. Three more. Go. Go. Good. Good. Good. We got to go. Okay. This is a scene. So when you go into that ballad arena, style to his pointed, you tend to feel a little bit more of that upper quad versus when you point towards the ceiling. You tend to get the overall quad. So again, just to be able to mix things up a little bit more and get that body to be able to really upper legs to fire just a tiny bit more. You'll notice a difference. So try to at home. I guarantee you'll feel the difference. All right. So if you're looking to increase your intensity, like I did with Julian, what you want to do is be able to do their partials. If you have someone that can be able to help you, you can do those or you can do by yourself. What I just did, you can either do that with your workout partner or you can turn around and be able to do it yourself. You stop rest for it, rest pause for a second. Two maximum. Do another rep. Do one or two. Then rest again. So again, it's all about getting to that point of failure. Now on this one, I want you to see if I can give you a little more range of motion. Let's see if that gives you a little more range of motion on your heart on your head. Same way, right? You have the same way? Yeah. All right. Okay, last set. Let's go. Good. One. Good. Two. Good. Three. Good. Four. Good. Five. Good. Six. Good. Seven. Good. Nine. Go. Come on. Come on. Ten. Good. Can I rest for a second? Okay. You're going to give me two reps already? Yeah. Let's go. Show me. Show me. You're going to go one way down. Good. That's better. You're going to rest for a second. You're going to be two more. I need you to control it better on the way down. Go. Two. Go. One. Good. Again. Two. Good. Good. Good. You got another one just like that. You're going to give me another two count. Okay. Really control the negative. Go. Up. One. Two. Good. Now you're going to give me partial. You're going to only go halfway up. And I want you to give me three like that. Okay. That's it. Whoop. All right. Remember what I just did was those parcels at the very end. You don't need a coach or a workout partner to be able to add those in. So make sure you go to that point of failure to get maximum muscle growth, throw in those techniques and I guarantee you you're going to break your loose plateau. So second exercise. We're going to go into a hamstring curl. So on the hamstring curl we're going to use the Pinata lying hamstring curl. It's a great great exercise. We're going to go ahead. We're going to do four sets on that two warmups and two working sets. And then we're going to go into a compound movement. So let's go ahead and get rolling. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You want to go all the way down right to there. Good. You don't want it to touch. You want to be right before it touches. And then back up. Good. You go down a little lower. You can even look to your side. You can see how far it right there. Perfect. That's perfect. Good. Keeps constant tension on the muscle. Good. Again. Come on. Come on. You got to be a lot stronger than that. Do you do these? What? I'm using a stick to slide. You just sit at the car. I can tell. Alright guys. So make sure that you are not a mirror warrior. What's a mirror warrior? Somebody who trains all the body parts in the mirror. Hamstrings are important. You need them on the side poses and on the back poses. So his response when I said have you ever done these and he was normally do squats. Well squats. Great. They do a little bit of hamstring too. But they do not specifically isolate the hamstring muscles. So if you want to specifically isolate the hamstring muscles, lying lay curls or even seated lay curls are going to be fantastic. Then you have also straight lay deadlifts. So it's going to help tremendously as well. But you need to focus on those hamstrings because that's going to really help thicken up your side poses. And that's another reason why your legs look a bit thin because you don't have enough size in the back. This exercise is going to help that. Okay. So that's why you need to incorporate them immediately to good. Great. Very important portion of this exercise is lining up correctly. The joint point for we call the cam is going to be lining up with your knee. If you're too higher too low, you're not going to need to be far enough motion. Oh yeah. You're going to be living on the position. She's getting one of these dorms. Come on. Come on. Hold it. Hold it. I'm going to let go. You're going to go slow. Slow. Slow. Come on. Slow. Good. Good. Good. Good job. All right. Have you ever used it up machine before? Not off to. Not off and sometimes it might be interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Anybody ever seen National Geographic on the Baby Giraffe's born? The legs are like whoa. That's a love thing. Baby giraffe. There you go. The key is to always try to feel a bit of new sornus because especially because what you're trying to do is break plateau's and the way to do that is to create an enduceding list by giving a new exercise slightly new angle or whether you're using a different cadence or you're using a different technique to increase intensity to be able to constantly be able to shock the body and the growing. All right. Second exercise is complete. We had basic hamstring curls. Again, I consider it basic. He's barely doing them because he didn't have it in his college. But you need to figure out a place we're going to be able to talk. I think there's a couple of other gyms nearby. We can be able to get you some of these exercises done in those gyms. But when you don't have that, we're going to also create some different exercises so that he can take with him. So when he doesn't have the ability to be off campus and he still has to train where you're going to build some work around. Have you done straight leg to the list? No. Okay. Is that already us? Are they different? Very similar. Yeah. So what? I hate those actually. Yeah. And I don't like those at all. I feel weird. Like on my back and stuff. So we're going to do this. We're going to go into the next movement. But a lot to learn guys as you can notice, I mean, great, great genetics. I've been able to take this as far as he's taking it. Now to be able to take it to that next level, we're going to have to build a really good training base. So we got a lot of stuff to teach him. All right, guys. So we're here doing a Pinnado super squat machine. So again, he's used to doing some free weight squat. But right now, while we're using the Evigen Gym, we want to be able to utilize some of this great equipment. So this is one of my favorite pieces of lay equipment. I've posted myself doing this and a lot of other athletes doing this machine. And it really helps simulate a squat. And let's get you under the bar facing towards the gym. We're going to get 10 reps. Good. Two. Two. Good. Keep going. Four. Good. Keep going. Five control. Control. Good. Good. Good. Good. Great. Good. Good. Good. Good. Okay, you got two more. Go down a little slower though. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Good. You got to go in a little slower than that on the way down. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. Good. Good one more like that. Good. Drive up. Good job. Lock it out. Good. Easy. Easy. All right. Four slower. Good. Good. Good. Good. One. Two. Three. Up. Good. Again. One. Two. Three. Good. Slow. Three seconds. One. Two. Three. Drive. Good. You got two more like that. Go. One. Two. Three. Good. One more. Good. One. Two. Three. Now halfway up. And you can go down. And go halfway up. And give me three like that. Go. One. One more. Come on. You got berries. Let's go. Strong. Good job. Good. There you go. So you have to remember, dude, you're much stronger than you think. Okay. So again, this is that mind versus body. He's definitely less stronger than he knows he is. He's giving up a little bit because he's definitely getting more fatigue. And he feels that burn. It's okay. He's going to have to learn how to get past that. Happening extensions. Hamstring curls are a whole different world because he's never done number four. He's done very few. Hamstring curls. You got Bell that really focus on that. Also doing the super squat machine. We're just using a basic shoulder width and being able to really get good range of motion. He's getting a good range of motion, especially being almost around 5-11. Which is great. But making sure that you're keeping constant tension in the legs, especially on the East Centric, he's so used to being explosive with football. Everything is about being explosive. And it was pushing when you were doing dumbbells with shoulders. Then he was also pushing when he was doing leg extension. But it's got to slow it down on the way up as well as on the way up. I did get very, yeah. I was able to push back though. Yeah. Okay. Good feeling when you're in the corner a little bit more. It's right there. Good. Go. Excellent. Up. Go. Good. Good. Again. Good. Good. Good. Again. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Watch your feet. Good. Go. Drive. Good. Come on. Come on. Can you get buried? Three, three, three. Okay. That one. Start up. Go. Come on. Up. Good. Again. Drive. Drive. Come on. Good. Good. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. You want to do? You want to play bodybuilding? Let's go. Let's go. Go. Go. Let's go. Three more. Go. Up. Drive. Come on. One more. Pull out. Get two more. Let's go. Light now. Good. Up. Good. Again. Up. Good. One more. Okay. All the way through. You do not stop. Drive it up. You should go. Good job. Lock it out. You don't play bodybuilding. Let's hit. I don't just serve. Oh. I'll try to serve up and maybe you. Got a time. Pro card. I'll throw some extra onions on that. I don't want to go ahead and supersize those Mr. Olympias. Yeah. Yeah. Make it like four or five. No no. Let's go for six. Let's. See what I'm at. Six. Yeah. Well, Tom was like a failure. Ordering it up like he's going through a drive through. Shout out to Tom. It's nice. Easy. I mean, I expected to be with. Damn. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited for it though. I know. It's good man. Let's go. It's like a breather. We got like cows next. We're working. Cows next man. We still got another. We got a nose. Yeah. Oh, how about that? That's a face. You say this. Oh, okay. I might use the word. My ears feel weird. Yeah. I feel like faint. Like faint music in the background. It's a great music. Yeah. I can tell how loud it is. Those are the trumpets from the angels. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Those are the trumpets from the angels, bro. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You're going. Good. Go. Go. You ever do this before? Nope. No leg press ever? Go. Good. Good. Okay. One more. You've got this. Come on. Good. Good. Again. Come on. Okay. Right. That's the squeeze. Go ahead and unlock it. You want the good news or you want the bad news? Bad news. That was like the bad news is your week at this. Yes. The good news is it's because you never done it before. Okay. So what I just realized today was that you've never really done a lot of hamstring work. You've never done leg press work. Sounds like you've done maybe extensions before. And mostly you're doing maybe some kind of squat. Well, so you used to doing it. I do a tip of doctors. Okay. Well, I just started that when I got back from school because they didn't have that machine. Okay. So I've been doing a hip of a doctor. Is there a reason why you don't do a leg leg press? Is there a reason why you don't do leg press? Or is it squat, that was the same. Okay. No. How does it work for different angles? Yeah. It's going to work the muscle differently. So again, all of these pieces of equipment, whether it doesn't matter the brain, they're going to work slightly different portions of your leg. So you've got to look at your anatomy as forward, sideways, and back. So as you're doing things and your legs start to grow, like whether you're squatting, whether you're leg pressing, whether you're doing hacksquats, they're all going to hit some different angles of those legs to help grow. So now you know, like you've got a lot more size you've got to put on those legs, right? To be able to get them really full and really to be able to max that upper body of yours. So now that's one of the reasons why as people are going to go through and say, hey dude, this is not an easy task because you have to go through these really painful workouts to be able to go to that point, but it's just not a matter. It's just a matter of doing it every week, every week. There you go. You get used to it, but you're going to have to just be used to being able to deal with the pain. Yeah. Good. Control and up.

Didn't go crazy. Just going through. Learning process. We learned a lot of things today. We learned that you've got to be able to work as hamstrings. We've got to do different exercise besides just a base of squat. So leg press. Definitely hit him pretty hard. How did you feel? So great. I'm going to sleep when I got home. You get a lot of food. And I'm ready. Get out again. I have that opportunity to. So yeah, I'm thankful. It's good. And I know I need to work. So. So matter of getting back in here every day. We're going to work on any of what we're working on. But I need to work on. So yeah. You did a good job. Again. Also, we learned that your body's a lot of work. Your body's a lot stronger than what you thought. Right? You pushed yourself. Right? Because you would have stopped probably with half the reps. Right? Yeah. So right now, he was just talking about how you want to eat and pass out. And it's a, I don't know, like four o'clock in the afternoon. It's like 350 p.m. Here in Texas.

He doesn't know what he doesn't know yet because that's just what how it is. But he's willing to learn. He's very eager. Obviously, he's very genetically blessed.
