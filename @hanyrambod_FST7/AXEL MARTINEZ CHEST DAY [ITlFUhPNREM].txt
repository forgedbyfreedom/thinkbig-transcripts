What's up guys? We are here with none other than Mr. Elmino himself. Axel, how you doing brother? Fine, good man. Always a good time in Axel's and town. And how much weight have you had given that? I don't know, but the stretch, say that we're good. Yeah, the stretch marks are getting crazy. Yeah. So, please send extra lotion for him. Not the P to the current. But we need definitely to be able to really hit it hard because he is the middle of just hitting all his calories. We have him on a crazy program of just making sure that he's like usually about three to four days on one day off. We're doing high carb meals, high carb days before the biggest body parts, like his back and his chest. And then we alternate that sometimes with cheat meals. And your cheat meal of choice is now Taco Tuesday, backless Tuesday. That's right. Taco Tuesday every day. But all honesty, we throw in those taco days. And he loves that. Sometimes pasta, sometimes pizza, whatever. But just those high calories, a bit more high sodium. So that he gets that crazy 3D look on the next day. So right now we're doing chest. He had tacos. Yes, sir. That's it. And yes, she was also, you had a way of work out. Yeah. The legs are growing. Everything is really coming up and kind of your 21 mom. It's sad. Yeah. Yes, 21. That's right. So we might have to go out and have a margarita this weekend. Just sort of the fact that he just turned 21. And but again, guys, watch and we'll talk a little bit about nutrition in between sets. We're going to also add in a little bit of the supplement stacks, because we do have them on a creatine cycle of 10 to 15 grams. And then we'll talk about also food. And we'll also talk about how we're food cycling also. So I know you guys want all the secrets to the other cycles. But that's all the same. But anyhow, we'll go ahead and we'll go walk you through it through the entire workout. Good. Good. But back in this case, I'm late. All right, guys. So as he's warming up, just want to explain what we've been doing before the workouts right now. He's running the extreme RTD. Sometimes he'll use powder with the HQ. Sometimes he'll do the RTD, depending on just what he's feeling like. 25 grams of glycject with creatine. So we're running creatine pre-imposed. Right now, 10 grams of creatine a day, because we really want to make sure that he has that extra torque. Help for the pump helps with making sure that muscle fullness is there. So we're running that as well. Intro workout also. Amino can't venture workout. Ice is jet post workout. So you can take it the same time with the creatine, or you can mix it together. It does not matter. It works fabulous. Now we're going to go ahead and get ready for these heavier sets. What? Five. Six. Six. Seven. Seven. Eight. Eight. Eight. Nine. Eight. One more point.eedong. Eight. Eight out the way. Six. Seven. Seven. Eight w at sudden? Seven. All right, that's so eight reps. Why did we stop at eight when you get it done more? Because that is not a way that I want him to use for a working set. What I'm trying to do is be able to just make sure that he warms up properly. And as we get into the heavier sets, then we're going to be able to push closer to failure. That was just a warm upset. That's why we stopped at eight. Racked it and we're going to go ahead here. You OK. Go. во Five, seven, one. Good job. All right, guys. So as we're going up and wait, it's traditionally okay to spend an extra minute to two minutes of rest, especially when you're about to hit that top set because you don't want to be fatigued when you're trying to go to failure. So two to three minutes rest is totally okay. If you only do a one minute rest, you are going to absolutely get tired and not be able to go to a complete failure. So give yourself enough rest so you can add that extra weight so you can really get behind that set and you can be able to maximize the set, eight to ten with a heavier weight. The core tight as you go back and let's see how you do. Even if you have to come down to sixty eight reps we're fine. Let's go. I'm with you. You're good. Roll. Good, go. You get up. Let's go. Two. Three. Keep your feet flat. Core tight. Good. Good. Go. Go. You got one more. Go. Good. Now you're working. This is working set slow now. Good, slow. Slow. Good job. Bring down. Good job. Woo! Was that like four or five reps? Nine. I almost died. You give me. Think about it. Two. Eight. Five. Five. Two. Eight. Eight. Okay. Bring it back. You got to kick it up. You got to kick it up strong. Go. Good. Go. There you go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Five. Go. Six. Go. Good. One more. I hope you a little bit. Try it. Try it. Try it. Try it. Let yourself. Go. Go. Slow. I was in. Good job. There you go. There. All right, guys. So, say the last set on Henklaing was 101 pounds. Last set, 106. We got about a good six reps, seven reps. Definitely strength starting to move in the right direction. Goal for him is going to be 120 pounds on the Enklaing. And I feel like he's going to be able to get there in the next four months. And then as we go there, then there's going to be then 130 to 140. But it's going to take a little time. Again, as he's getting this new muscle on and he's getting stronger, a bigger muscle is a stronger muscle. So, you need to get strong to be able to get big and be able to get really grainy. So, it's really important to get the strength on. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Good. Keep going. Drag it up. Good. One more. I got it. Good. Good job, sir. Good job, sir. You're going to rest like that. Yeah, yeah. All right. Now we're going to go ahead. Let's get each ten really good reps to go. Go. One. Two. Good. Three. Go. Go. Good. Good. Keep moving. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Give me eight. Two. Three. Well. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Good. Good. Good. Good. Two more. Good. Now you have two more on top of that. Good. One more. Good. One more. Good. One more. Good. Up. Up. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good job. Good. We can raise the weight. We can do one more set. Come on. One. Two. Come on. Yeah. Let's go. Come on. One. Two. Two. Three. Good. Go. Go. Eight. Four. Five. Keep going. Keep going. Good. Good. Keep going. Good. Good. Keep going. Go on. Excellent. Grab it up. Good. Good. Slow. Slow down. Slow down. One more like that. Up. Up. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Rais. Okay. Go. Good. Good. Get a bit of it done. All right. What we're doing is we're doing an incline fly but I have several different fly machines. This one actually is fixed on rollers. We have four arms. We're going to be going towards each other on the fly. It definitely hits different. So let's go ahead and we're going to bring this down a little bit. There you go. I'm shooting. You know? You're just... Good. Good. Good. Keep going keep going. Good. Keep going. Good. Good. Drive. Get your hands, pass each other. There you go. There you go. And under. Next rep. There we go. Good. Two more, two more. Good. One more. Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive together. Just together, right? Slowly, slowly. Good. It's good way. Good. Okay, guys. So on this particular exercise, when you are doing your crossover like that, what I like to do is go over. And under with each rep. So again, alternating over and under. Let's go. Good. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. That's it. Go ahead. Good. Let's go. Keep going. Come on. Come on. You have four. One. Two. Three. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. together together together together together together together together together right there slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow good job good good all right so on that one two sets had really good muscle contraction good form didn't go too fast when full range of motion now we got one final set we're going to do an FST 7 set we're going to use a machine on that one the Pinado standing flight machine and we're going to just completely annihilate that last set and we're finished with Chastole go good You going? 10.

As you can see, he's definitely growing. Again, guys. You've seen a lot of different aspects of this. And a lot of them are top of LMPA champions. But now you get to see somebody that we've been working with now for since he was like 19, 20 years old. Yeah, he did just turn 20, I think. 21. Now he's 21. Yeah. When we started working together, he just turned again. So it's just about a year ago, right? And about a year, a little bit less than a year. Now he's been able to put on another about 15 pounds. About seven kilos? Yeah. About seven kilos? Yeah. Seven kilos. And then, but again, this is our clean book. So again, making sure to try to get stronger, using good form, making sure you go full range of motion, making sure that he's eating and he's not overtraining. But being able to train three to four days on one day off, that's the split. And the lifts have gone up dramatically. And just making sure that he's spot on with his nutrition as well. So how do you feel? All right. If you'd great, thank you again. Yeah. For treating me. Yeah. Absolutely. I love to come here. Yeah. So again, guys, if you don't follow the axle, make sure you follow him, showing the journey. So that you can see somebody from the beginning stages of right after being a teenager, getting into bodybuilding, working on his legs, working on his upper body, and with show the legs to, we have to. Because I mentioned legs to some real quick. Okay. Good. So we have to go up. You guys have to get the good light in here. Okay. Good. Nice. Come on. To the calves and grow. Caps. Yeah. You know like to show the calves. So there you go. Good. The legs are growing. There you go. Good. Awesome. Hands on the hip. Good. So definitely growing through the claws. Outtersweet, fastest media, fastest bassist, light or other. Everything is growing. And the great thing about it is that he's getting very balanced, especially for being so tall because he's six foot. And I feel like what he's seeing is over all body development. Just because you get heavier doesn't mean it makes you better. He's putting the weight all in the right areas, right? The quads, the back, the chest. Samstrings are going a little bit too. Caps are growing. So nice symmetry. And I'm really proud of that. So good job, man. Good job. He's putting in the work. Follow the journey. He was in nutrition. Honey Rambad. Axle. Peace. Peace.
