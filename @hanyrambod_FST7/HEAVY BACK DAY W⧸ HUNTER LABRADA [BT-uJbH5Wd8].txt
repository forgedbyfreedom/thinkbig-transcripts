All right guys, we are just two days away from the 2024 Texas Pro. But this man happened to decide to go out and have some pasta and Italy instead this year. So year about what three weeks have? Four in Sunday. Okay, four in a salary of a Sunday. And he's coming up to be able to be a part of the show, help support the show. And hit me up and said, hey, let's get together. I said, great. It'd be good. The last time we did that was it. I believe we did. Really after AFE, me and there. Yeah. Yeah, it was at year to last that I imagine. The LeBraude headquarters, which was awesome right in Houston. And this time now, the show is only what ten minutes away. Yeah, it's so much nicer. Ten minutes away. So take advantage of being able to get a workout together, also show them some cool pieces of equipment, and also talk maybe a little bit in between sets about what he's doing a little bit different getting ready for this show so he can be able to basically be qualified, right? Exactly. So headed out there to my goal application. But yeah, man, he's shut out to Heidi or honey. I won't talk to Heidi, honey. I won't talk too much, but last year I came out, they had just moved into this building. So did come back this year, just a year later, and see what honey is turned it into. It's pretty damn cool. I'm stoked for today. I haven't used a lot of putna to stuff before, and I know he loves it. So excited to get put in the dirt on it by him. It's going to be a good day. Let's get honey. Let's get honey. You got better pressure for the Houston here. It takes a little bit of an hour. We have a very good, good, pressure population in the young. Good stretch, good pool. Good stretch. Good stretch. Do you have a difference with my wrist? No, I do. Yeah, sure. But the nice thing about the nervous, so this is smooth. It's a very smooth thing. You don't have any of those dead spots. We're somewhere here. And I'm going to say the profiles really nice, and it's heavy, or it should be heavy, and it's like that too light. Or it should be light. Right. We're sometimes you'll be like, okay, I'm pulling in like it's real light. And then you're like, oh, I want you to go to the back. So it's a light. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good stretch. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You're going to do some poses in the very bottom. Good. There you go, okay? Just like that. Perfect. Just a 1,000, 1. Good. Good. Good. Good.

With me. With me. Now I'm going to help you. Right down. They're not holding that. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good job. Did it. Yeah. It's making sure. Yeah. So what you're doing is you're actually shorting your range of motion because you're going to get your shoulders so much. So what you want to do is you want to square up your shoulders so you can be able to get a really good stretch. Okay. So when you start doing this, you start to kind of create a little bit different by the final. Yeah. Flexion. You're going to hear. It's almost like doing it with your spine instead of your lap. And you're able to, everything's kind of kicking in this way. And then what you want to do is you don't go to the core and your motion with your foot through. It's allowed. It makes pretty good. That's all. Yeah. Just. Where's the shoulders? Good. Good job. You're on the positive and every effort is once you say so. Right. And now we'll just next. We'll just have to talk about the third quarter out there. You go. Good. Again. Come on. Good. Good. Good. You go to the shoulders nice and square. Oh. That's it. Pull. Pull. There. Good. Again.

We're back home training the three of us on our unilateral stuff. We'll do like one side each. Good. Then go back and do the other one. Work like two in a between touch. Exactly. Super fresh. You're not trying to sit here and you're not trying to do a marathon. You don't want to go to the team. You want to go failure. And so you're not building an or a capacity. That's right. You want to build a muscles. Good. Come on. Come on. Time to work. I've worked with the McGee. Good. Square of the shoulders. Good stretch. Pull that out. Pull. Good. Good. Good. Good.

Thank you, sir, man. I have another. Good. Thank you. That's the first texture, sir. It concludes the first warm-up set. Okay. If you're here in the candy store, go ahead and use a neutral grip. So, just like if you're doing a warm-up, don't they'll roll? Go into that. Stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch. And then you're going to pull. Go. Go. Beautiful. Beautiful. Go. Good. Excellent. Keep going, hunter. Good. There you go. Good. Stretch. Are we running this one? No. Not bad. Just sit and just sit and just want you to feel hard. I think you're not going to be able to get into a worky session. So, I have a little piece of tape, bring that maybe a little heavier. Has it given a great good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Stop so working. Come on, hunter. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Time to get it. Time to get it. Stop. Good. That's it. Really good contraction. Really good contraction. Great. Good. Pull was up and something down. Good. There you go. Good. Squeeze it. Excellent. Good. Stretch, stretch, round down. Pull. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on, hunter. That's a good. Come on. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You got two in you. Come on. Pull. Good. Slow, slow, control, control, stretch, stretch, and pull. Good. Good. Right there now. Stretch, go down. Stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, round down. Go, go. Go. Go again. Three. Two. Keep going. Go on. One more, one more. Now, just stretch. Good job. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. We're getting better range of motion in the last year. Yeah. That's it. That's also what's helping you back the moment. You're not going to say? Yeah. I spent since the Olympics year really tearing things down and going, taking everything through full full extreme ranges of motion, especially on my push day. Yeah. Like really spending some time in the stretch. Just made my shoulders. She'll so much healthier. Everything feels so much better this year. That's great. Yeah. It's just you don't realize. And my body's responding to it too. Why? You can see the difference. You can see the difference. Stretch it out. Stretch it out. Pull. Yes. Good. Again. Again. Jordan, you're lost stronger in this man. I can tell you all in this way. Good. You're literally limiting yourself. Bro, go. Go. I can tell. You got two more. Show me. Show me. Go. Everything you got. Oh, that's it. Good. Now you're working it every day. Pull. You got to the home. You pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. Good. That's slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good stretch. Good stretch. Good stretch. And partial. Come on. Three partials. One. Two. Good. Bring those elbows back. Pull. Three stretch it. Stretch. Stay in stretch position. Good job. Good job. Cool. Good job. Good job. Good job. I said. Good. Good. Good. All right. So we're taking a little bit of weight off. This is one of those really good teaching points. For those of you that are working out with guys that are stronger than you, do not try to keep up with their weights if you're losing form because you're just going to be able to just move with momentum instead of actually putting that muscle through really good time under tension. So what he did stripped off a weight, put the ego at the door so that way he can grow. Proofs in the pudding. Rolls started training with me like six months ago when he first got in the gym with me. Try to use my weights for everything. He did it for like you know five or six with not the best form in the world. We finally made him check it and he went down to weight so he could do nine, ten, eleven, twelve reps with perfect perfect form. That was six months ago. Now he's stronger than he's ever been with that good form and growing quicker and he's ever been. So one of those take a step back to take through three steps forward kind of things. Try it. Good. Stretch, stretch more more more more more more more more more more more more more more. Cool. Good. Come on. Do you have a one? You have a one? You have one? You have one? You have another one. You got another one. Come on. Cool. Cool. That was back. Good. Now I'll give you a more. Are you pushing? Are you back if you can get a weight? Yes. Good. Really good. Good. One more. One more. One more. Cool. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good. Stretch. Stretch it. Good job. Good job. Yeah. That's good. That's good. You're right. You're right. You're right. And it means you're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. That's why you're one plate set of difficulty. You're right. There's so much fiber recruitment on all the other exercises. You need such a good job with it. You've got to go. Here you go. And to be honest, the other tip is that if you're working out with somebody who's much more advanced than you are, you don't have to go set by set. You can skip a set if they're doing two working sets and you do one because you're starting back up. Don't feel like you have to do exactly what they're doing. If there's a set, you know, if they're sitting there doing dead and you haven't done dead in a while, then you can go ahead and not consider yourself pushing out. What you're doing is just making sure that you're going to be able to get back in the gym and two or three days and do that body part again. But you know, or in four days and do that body part again. Otherwise, if you're so completely erect, you'll either get yourself hurt or you'll be out for so long, then you're not going to come back because you're now all of a sudden. So sore that's going to take you all week to recover. Not about what you do, it's about what you can recover from. Don't worry, I'm just going to help. Two, three, go. Go up. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down from the top. Go up. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Good. Good. Pull. Push. Good. Really good. Good contraction. Let's go, Hunter. Pull. That's it. Good. Stretch. And pull. Excellent. Excellent. Again. Again. Let's go. Come on. You got three. Three. Come on. Up. One. Come on, Hunter. Come on, Hunter. Come on. Go into. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Up. Up. Hold it. There's more. Come on. Go. Come on. Hold it. Slow down. Slow. Good. Good. Down. Wow. That explosion up. And then truly catching it at peak control. That happens. Well, that's the other thing. So what Hunter did was he was slowing things down. On the latter part of the rep and through the range of motion. So from here down on the stretch. So what we did had him do is we actually had him slow it down from the peak contraction. And then he felt it. Yeah. Instead of, you know, because you're going to be explosive out of the hole, not like dynamically explosive, but you want to recruit the whole muscle. So everything you got out of the hole. And then like Hunter said, first couple of reps. It was everything out of the hole. Then I kind of like catch it a third of the way through and then control it known. You saw the difference when exploded out of the hole. And you know, caught it within the first 10% of the negative and then wrote it all the way. It made a big difference for sure. So again, he wrote it. The eccentric portion much further through the entire range of motion. And that's what's going to make you be able to really grow and be able to break those potatoes. And pull good good contraction. Stretch and contract. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Good. Keep it moving. Keep it moving, brother. Good. Go. No. Good. Again. Good. Again. Again. Oh. Good. Stretch. Stretch. Cool. Come on Hunter. Good. Good. Good. Cool. And then slow on the way down. Cool. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Stretch. Stretch. Good stretch. Good stretch. Good stretch. Good job. Good job. Good job. Excellent. There you go. I'm stuck. There you go. There you go. There you go. That hot quality A2O. Good. Good. High quality A2O. You could put this in a warm and lime gatorate and I wouldn't know the difference. This is really good. Good job, honey. Yeah. That's super refreshing. It really does taste like the gatorade. Really that is good. That is flavorful files. I'm not even an illusion. Yeah, totally unbiased review for me. Don't listen to Jordan or honey. Totally unbiased for me. Guys, we got this coming out August 16th. We have a new Eve generation. I've been working on this formula for the last eight months. Very happy with the way it turned out. We got some different aspects of the electrolyte and the actual sodium to potassium ratios as well as some other Metropic, but I added to the formula to be able to give you focus, give you hydration, but also give you clean crisp tastes. So again, look at four to hear and all the feedback as always. Make sure you go ahead and put it into the comments. You know, I've done so many versions of this I've done. Like you can ask, you can ask for like version after version because I wanted to taste a little of the sodium, where you can understand where it's at, and also there's you know hydration formulas that I got a grant. I like to go up, but I don't want to go backwards. So if I go a grant, and I tell you, you say, half of it because I don't want you to have to. So do you, we'll guess what, everything else just got half. Right? So that's why I didn't do that. So that way I go one and then if I want to be able to double up, I can take two and you have also extra material. But you're not getting half past that everything is right. That's right. And it's got citricoline in there. So the C to Coline is actually going to help you with nitropic with healthy cacophine. So that way you need my muscle connection or if you're just working throughout the day, you want to clear up your head. Now you have something that's going to be a neutral, a nitropic that doesn't have any stimulants. I think I'll say a couple of scoops for this and a gallon of protein go down. So yeah. I honestly was playing around with it so much that I put it up and mixing the flavors. And I put strawberry lemonade with the lemon lime. I'm like, oh, this is pretty good. I'm like, oh, this is pretty good. I'm going to put it on the lighter, put the protein mixture. It makes it pretty well. Yeah. Because I don't make mine syrup because most of our customers and athletes, they take multiple products. So I always try to make it less syrupy so that they don't end up having the acid in suggestion. You don't have acid reflux because I know that they're taking three or four different of our positive signal and all this citric acid in. So I cut that way back to try to make sure we're like, digger guys like me who need three or four scoops of the intre, a lot of companies in trizzly take that much. It's like the stomachache and a shake or a cup. Very good. But great attraction. See how deep is getting into that contraction? How is going to really really deep bring those elbows back to the hands of them? That's what you get to work on. Good. Good stretch. Good stretch. Good stretch. Good job. Again. Good. Do you do a little go? I don't go. Go. No. The more more more more. Right. Hold that. Hold that. Hold it. Now stretch. Go. It can be one more just like that. All the way down. You got the power.
