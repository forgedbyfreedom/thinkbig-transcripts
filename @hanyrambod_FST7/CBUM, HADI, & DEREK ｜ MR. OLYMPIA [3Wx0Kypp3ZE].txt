All right guys, we're getting ready to train. Still over 100 degrees here in Vegas, so still hot as a F. And now what we're gonna do is really focus on just making sure that we get some of these upper body workouts done now that everyone's done with legs. Yeah, first up, we got Mr. Seabumb himself. You do a little shoulders and arms, so it's a little bit more crowded than we used to, but it is where it is. I made way. I made way. You guys are putting your knee up and pushing the toe right here. I'm gonna do it this way. Look now it has a strike in my mouth. Could I hang that out? Yeah. A spoon of ginger or brokelah bereits. Great length. Thank you. I'm not done. It's crazy. It's good. I'm going to cut this time. It feels good. It feels good. It feels good. It feels good. Stretch a little lower. There you go, okay. And then pop your lat out and keep that. It's very good. I feel like that. You know you? Squeeze. That's it. Really both of them. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. Come on. It's good. I'm going to cut this. It's good. You'releey Alright. Good. It's good. It's good. être good. Good. It's good. It's good. Perfect. Ok. 100. Come on.�에. Come here. Have to eat you, okay? Men, kk your and tai. Good. yeah yeah All right, so we're doing some shorter press. On this older side of X-axis equipment, converging, kind of really focused on my muscle connection and it's not playing yet any records, just going nice and slow, especially eccentric. I'll have you do one for me. So if you're wondering why Matt's pushing on his back so that he doesn't do that and slide down, because this is a little bit awkward in terms of benches, it's very, very low. And these are more taller than 5-3, so definitely times a slide down. But that's what he was doing all of that. So we're going to go, go, go, go, go. Trying to go too heavy, he's had an injury in the past, so we want to make sure several injuries of the body. And now what we're trying to do is he's drying out, focusing on the contraction, the Oh my god. Why are you still in the front of the bed? I can't hold it. I can't hold it. I can't hold it. I can't hold it. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. It's for the first three or four days of the week and then I'm good. Yeah, if you can see the jack back with you. So remember to take people along there and grab them. Come, go, go. Swaskers look around. They got two fingers in one. You're done, that is workout number one. THE MOST F Egg Damn where to go, I want to do the powder and do the whole stack. I want the RTD. What do you think I chose? I'll do it all day, every day. It's an even cold. It's delicious. It's a great, great last chess workout. Four days out. Let's go baby. Here, Gerblinsford, 2020, Mr. Olympia, just several days out. First upper body workout here in Las Vegas. So what we're going to do is right now, just focus on just... We're good work, but nothing crazy. Again, I've been talking about this all day long. No crazy, heavyweight street. You don't want to risk injury. You want to be able to stimulate the muscle. You have to create really good time and retention. And get a good pump. You'll also really get all the different areas of the muscle. One more. One more. Good job. Good job. You're so slow. Excellent. All right, good. We are in Las Vegas. It's the Olympia weekend.

Good job. Good job. Good job. Come here, come here. One. Yeah. Who? Take a beer, I'm sure. Take a beer. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Good day. Good day. Excellent. Excuse me, that chest. Good. Good. Good. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. We're doing some incline chemistry and stresses. Nothing too crazy, just two and a half plates, and then what we're doing is focusing on. Just that upper chest. Get that good upper chest pump. And we just came off of a flat. So again, just working all the angles. And then we're going to go on and do some slides. So, let's try and hit all the angles. One, two, three, four, five, six, one deeper. Good. Eight, don't stop. One, one. One. Mmm. Two. Good. Good. Good. Get tens of your left arm. One, two, and two. Good stretch. Good stretch. Good stretch. Good stretch. Good stretch. You've got it? Mm. You've got it? Oh. Mm. Good. Good. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Oh. Oh. Good. All right, you just got done doing pre-motion and what that's doing is that pre-motion cable doesn't give you up. I entire full range of motion. So what we're doing is we're adding in the foam roller to be able to get a better stretch. Go, go, go, go. Go, go, go. Go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go. There you go, like that. Go, go, go, go again. Again, boom. Again. Last one. Go, go, go, go, go. Go, come on, Derek. Look, good. Last one, try it. Good job, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go. All right, so we're always squeezing because we want more time under tension. It also gives you a lot of those metabolites that are going to help you grow. So this is one of those things that you really are going to tell you different. You start with squeezing, that muscle that you're working in between sense and the future. Good stretch, good stretch, good stretch. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Good, get an harden with every wrap. There we go. Good. It's not just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little closer. Good. Good. Good stretch, good stretch, good stretch. Good stretch, good stretch. Good stretch, good stretch, good stretch. Good. You can just hand the hands farther back, stretch and dry. Good. Come on, two more. One more. Good job. What we're doing is we're doing from the low cable. We're doing a cable fly from the low cable pull-in and using a finish machine. So basically it's very similar to a regular cable, except that if you would have had the adjustment all the way down to the bottom, that's what you can see. So stretch, good. Good. Good stability. Good. Good. Good stretch, good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Perfect. A little higher to one. I hope you'll help you. Good stretch, stretch, stretch, step, step. Good. Just step, just up to the stretch more. Good. Oh yeah. Come on, here. Come on, control button. We've got this. Come on. Come on. Come on. Easy. Get all every single flyer. Get this flyer. Let's get this flyer. Good. Get this flyer. Get this flyer. Come on, there. Squeeze, squeeze. Good. One more, one more. And go. Up. Up. Right there. Up. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Good job. All right. Let's, that's a wrap. Four days out. That's it. So we just got to end doing chess with Mr. 2000, 2013 Mr. Olympia, Derek Lunsford, got a good chess workout and hit all the angles. Got some really good, two different sets of flies, two different sets of process, just very deliberate. Nothing crazy heavy. Stayed away from the dumbbells today and focused more on machines. But plate-loaded machines as well as cable machines. And I think we got the right one. There's a little posing in. Feel like everything is getting dialed in, right? Definitely can get a little bit tighter in terms of just a little bit. But I needed. Then we're going to have to be able to kind of manipulate the day by day. So tomorrow morning, do another check in. He's going to go and give another meal in. We're going to relax your cardio and make sure that it's, uh, keep pushing. Keep pushing hard. All right, guys. We got Haudie Chopin in the house, 2024 Arnold Classic Champion. And he's here also doing chess. So yeah, Derek did chess, Haudie's doing chess. And we had C-bomb doing shoulders and arms. Now what we're doing is focusing on just being able to, again, get a really good pump going. Seeing where he needs to be in terms of life. Seeing where he's at in terms of overall fullness so that we can, to say what he's going to be eating coming up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to do a little bit dumbbell flies right now back to back. So again, started with the incline press. Didn't feel that incline really targeted the muscles that we were looking for. So if you wanted to come in do some dumbbells, you went up to 110s. Again, a couple days out from the show. I'm not going to go on super crazy. Now we're going to do incline dumbbell fly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We just did dips with it for chest. Now, how are you going to do some abs, a little bit of cardio. So, skid everything cleaned up so we can reset for tomorrow. So, good chess workout with Hottie. Now, I've gotta get back to the hotel. Make sure see them's good, Derek, good, get everybody all done for the next day. So, day two coming up, guys.
