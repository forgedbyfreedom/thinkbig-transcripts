We just got Hottie's Visa booked the first flight out. Got him in the air. Now, he should be arriving this morning. So everything is happening super super quickly. And we're headed to the airport. So hopefully, he makes it through with no issues. There's always chances for things to go sideways because of just the Visa that issues can always pop up at any time. So there'll be here once he's here. So those people that travel a lot, they'll know what I'm talking about. So we're just hoping he has a smooth flight and no other issues. He's already been into by-for a month longer than he was expecting to be there, waiting on this visa. Visa. For those of you that don't know, the process is extremely complicated and difficult to get a visa every year for Hottie because it all starts back from scratch. The other thing that you gotta remember is this year, there's been a lot of things going on in the Middle East that are basically creating a lot more adversity when it comes to being able to get the visa. Being there for over a month into by waiting to get his visa has been something that has been quite challenging and being able to train and being able to do all the things that he needs to do. While not knowing whether or not he's going to be able to come to America when he's already been here at like six, seven times. So it's been very, very difficult this year and obviously the political requirements have been really, really just tumultuous to say at least. But just we went through a tonne, so shout out to Nick Erby, the guy that is behind it all. He's been my right hand man for a very, very long time who's helped a tonne with everything that's related to Hottie. So again, thank you Nick, I'm going to do it without you bro, love you, and all of the support that we have. Because again, everybody wants to see all the athletes be able to compete, not just select ones, but just want to let you know that we're really pretty good today. Today we are three weeks out from the Olympia. We have not cut it this close. Ever except for right before COVID where he came the day before the show. But again, that was COVID here. So normally he's here a month ago. So we're going to go there. So we're going to go there. So we're going to go there. Two, one. We're going to go there. We just made it. They were circling around, they guess, for an hour and a half. They didn't land some kind of issue, but finally they got it. They landed. He got off the plane. That's why I have the delays. Now we're getting ready to be able to get him settled in. And schedule food, work outs, all of those things. Now that we're three weeks out today. Like I said, we've been bringing him in six or seven weeks out. So he should have got here a month ago. Now I'm relieved. And I'm excited to just relieve from now. We're going to go there. We're going to go there. We got it, this is how you for this. We come for this. We come to collect. We're going to run some aminoz as well just to help minimize muscle breakdown during the workout, especially after a long flight. But he did eat throughout the flight. Again, almost 18 hours, about 22, 23 hours in the airport from Dubai to Dallas. And straight to the gym. Good. Good. Good. Off. Okay. Great. Okay. Wow. I'm just doing it. Five. Keep going. Six.
