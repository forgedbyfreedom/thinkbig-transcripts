Alright guys, we just got here to Evo Land. Do you think that he married a little bit of the name for Evo Jen? Maybe. But at the end of the day, Shahab, the man here, is really taking great care of us. And we got Wesley in the house. We're going to do a little bit of a surgical precision with legs. We've been talking about getting together ever since we had the podcast. And I know you're going to keep it in the time of off now, right? Do you want to take the next year? Yes, at least the least of the year. Okay. So again, take it back to your off. So you can blow up the legs to match up to the max of upper body. And we're going to do a really focused on both hand. I'm treating quad, quad, dominant. But we're going to also make sure we're not going to neglect the ham stress. So again, it's going to be a good workout. But all day, today, he's been standing, shaking hands, kissing babies. At the Evo Expo. I'm going to do a little bit caffeinated. He's already ready to go. You ready to do it? I'm going to do it. All right. Let me how you normally do a set about 15, 12 to 15 reps. Yeah. How many sets do you normally do on leg extension? Yeah. And you also usually, if you three may be four max. But that's what I'm fully recovered from the show. Okay. So now I would do two working sets. One and a half weeks ago was Detroit's there. But normally you're like the wrong three of these. Okay. Let's see how you're doing them. And then just see how the bowel mechanics is going. Yeah. You go from there. Yeah. You see here I get to the very good stress. If it's still in blood of space, you're like, yeah. I think when it goes heavier, it's going to be perfect. If you feel, if I really show you, it's going to feel like you're going to lock your arm. Because you've locked your knees. You've been locked. Yeah. Honestly. It's a big Indian revolution. Yes. So from here. Yes. Get up, get up. Yeah. It's actually something else. So you can go up to hanging. Yeah. Fine. Okay. So it's something else. Because it's a luggage tension here. Okay. A few of the motions. Yes. The new local muscle walking. That fatella tendon. That pressure prepared. It's kept pushing on there because the examination is higher. So yeah. So you did really go right before that. And you thought it was the first to get the most important part of this very big emotion. Yeah. The farther back, the shorter, the better your clutch will grow. And then it feels like the machine has not hurt your motion. You're going to get the pads to be able to get more range of motion. That putting a pad. Yeah. Yeah. And I knew it was just that. I think I would be able to do this to help. Like the pin-offers I have a true nice physical. It's a lever to serve it to a shoulder back. The handle, the strength of your shoulder. The breathing stretch. We have our old gym. We have our old gym gym. And that's like an infinite range of motion. So it has, like you can put it instantly towards down. So no matter how tall or short you are, you can always get the fourth of the action. That's perfect. All right. Guys, we are doing the leg extension warming up. Make sure your full range of motion. Just going to warm everything up. We're talking to Wesley about making sure you don't feel like you have to lock out your knees. Just right before you go lock out period. The most important part is going to be in the very beginning stage of the rep. And the other thing is that you get heavier. Because the knees are going to want to lift up. You want to do as we want to keep those boots back. And keep that hip down. And some machines will even have a seat belt to keep the hips down. Highly advise to keep the heavy weights to be able to do that. But the key is to treat the right of your knees. And the ground. Or always you take the seat. That's three. That's what we're going to do. I'm going to work on what's coming. FST7 3-load. So what we're going to do is we're going to be now. After the second set is we're going to be timing 30 seconds to 45 seconds. Because we want to do is we want to force the blood in the blood. Now that you're getting a little bit warmed up. So now what we're going to do is just keep forcing the blood in before the puff goes away. We're going to add even more blood to be able to break that barrier to be able to keep growing even the puff. Nice. I like it to help the structural work. So that's one of the main core principles of FST7, the bachelor stretch training that I started along time ago, was to be able to create more intensity even if you're training by yourself. A shorter rest period. So it's a very of German volume training mixed with high intensity. So that's a very nice training. So I'm going to do a little bit of training. So I'm going to do a little bit of training. So I'm going to do a little bit of training. So again, now what we're doing is we're on the clock. We're going to do a traditional FST7 set. So what we're going to do is we're winning 30 seconds between sets now. And then we're going to raise the weight to get into that 8-12-1 range. But the end of dropping from that, then we'll lighten it up. Or if the end of going too many, we'll make it heavier. So you should always stay in the machine when you're waving. Yeah, you can come in out, sketch it right for a second. Sometimes we get light people. And you see the edge, it takes you to the plane. Thank you. That's on fire. It's okay. But you've got to get back on there, on the clock. Yeah, let's go. I'm doing it as I'm feeling to see the contraction. Good. The contraction solid. Good. You're going. A little storm around there, you know. Good. A little storm around there. Good. Nice feeling. A little bit more to go. Good. Good. Keep going. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Again. Good. Again. Good. 3, 3. Good. 1. 2. 2. 1. 2. 1. 2. Good. Now you go off the bottom and you can go 3 part of the stuff. 1. 2. 2. 1 more. 2. Good job. Good. Good. I'm going to block again. So we're going to now. We're going to just keep pumping blood until legs so that his blades get unconstorably full. So we can raise the weight a little bit. Yeah. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Like he said, he's taking some time off. It's a really grow. At least this year may be a little bit longer. But the rest of the season is going to focus on growth. Obviously coming off the show, you want to be able to recover, get healthy. But you also want to be able to utilize the antibodies window to be able to create rebound for the extra calories. So making sure that you're not enough food is going to be important. I don't mind that you're seeing you. You like to eat the machine. You need to have a machine. The Dutch eating machine. I'm going to touch your open screw. I know. We need to be the open. Okay. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Being pulling his butt down into the seat. So we can get maximum range of motion. It's not lifting as he's coming down or hot. Just keeping it really, really planted. You've gone. Good. That's it. That's it. That's it. You're going. Good. Good. Good. How you going? Good. Good. You got four more. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go again. Go. Go. You're going to have partial. I'm going. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Good. That's it. Go. Go. Go. Go. You're going to chew too much. That's it. That's the C7. Yes. Yes. I was saying why so far. Thank you. You. You hate it while it's happening. Yes. You're going to do the exchange rate. The Dutch to American Texan exchange rate. Yes. So one more means four more. One. Okay. Mayors are going to have to match with your shoulders. You have a long way to go. People go. Well. You know. You know. You know. You know. You know. You know. You know. You know. You know. You know. You know. You know. You know. You don't go. Good job. Go. Good. Good. Good. One more. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. Good. Good. Go. Good. One. One more. One more. Go. Higher. Higher. Higher. Slow. Slow. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Now those are going to warm up set. So now we're going to start getting into the working. So I'm going to couple of sets here. And the FSV 7 range is going to be the work. So we're going to do some things up a little bit of the position. And we're going to do is then maybe even add in a little bit of more force for that. Right now is a perfect time to get in hydration any intercarb also essential amino acids are fantastic. Now as a time you want to be able to do that to be able to help keep feeling the more out. So you do not lose performance while you're doing the middle of your sets. You can be treating your sets. So it's great like a boundary. It's great. We have a boundary like a boundary like a boundary. Okay. There you go. Exactly. I can feel a little bit more of that up a five note. You're going. You're going. You're going. You're going. Good. You're going. And good. Again. Good. Again. Good. Good. Now, to the side. To the side. Good. Okay. Watch this. Good job. Now. Two. Oh. Now. Oh. You're going. Oh. I'm going. I'm going. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. That's your breath. Now it's all mental. Now what you have to focus on is how do you feel placing seconds? How do you feel not being first? Now that's all this is all about. It's all mental. Everybody at this point has genetics and everybody works hard. And now how much order are you going to put it in? Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Wanna play? Come on. Come on. Come on. One more. One more. One more. Hold it hold it hold it hold it Good god. One more just like that. Good now you growing goes or the ground Kennedy's bend or little still more Yeah but I like that wish out to the outer platformуш on your outer. There you go, there you go. That's it, yeah. Take your hands there, take your feet. There you go. Yeah, push, push, push, push, squeeze out, squeeze out, squeeze out, squeeze five second. Four more seconds, three, two, good job. Go, good, go, toes straight, good. Go straight, go straight, go straight. That's it, that's it. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Marker. Five. Five. Five. Three. Two. Two. I'm holding it. Hold it there. Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Five. Good. Slowly down. Hold it. Yeah. Yeah. Good. I'm really good. Yeah. Good. All right. That was your first exercise. Ladies' session, FST7 preload. And what you're doing is pushing so much blood into that muscle that the muscle can't just have to be broken to grow. You can feel at least what you're saying. The fascia. Yeah, huh. It's like it's making room for something new. That's right now. Yes. So should be having like a next level pump. Just the metabolites that you're creating feel so tight right now. We'll see you again. One more. There you go. Push. There you go. Ah, good. Push it. Push it. Push it. Feel that. Feel that pump. Five seconds. Five. Four. Three. Two. One more second. Good job. Good job. Good. We're about to use this a little bit of a little more. Yeah, we're down a little bit more. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. You're a good job. Okay. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. is how is everybody else? You know, obviously Matt is supposed to be a little bit of the rest, but I also think that somebody like Logan Franklin can also, if he goes to the legs up, he'll be very, very formidable because he looks so good at the Arnold and better, you know, there's several other people that we have yet to see at this year that I can't wait to see how they're going to stack up on their Olympia qualifying shows, to see how they're going to do with the last stretch towards Olympia. Do you agree with me? I'd like to make a vote because I think we're talking about the classic physique and I know it's a bit of a question about it and actually try to work it just to work the better for the person of bodyball. But if you think if Logan manages to pull the size of a little bit more, the person who would like to show him like Mike, I think he would be the perfect combination of that press to look and also the math. He has a Mike himself, of course, he won the R-class of the S like, he can pack them off the seat as well. But it's kind of like, yeah, I'm going forward, I can forward a bodyball and look for him or not to, I'm technically a classic look as well, right? And I think that's yet to be defined because again, we haven't had an opinion without a press in the last years. So I think that's going to be something that's going to be interesting because again, Logan continues to fill in his brain, which we can. I think that it's going to be in the seat, plus like I said, there's going to be some others that are sort of changing and I will see how they do qualifying for the show and then see what happens during the interview. I'm sure I'll find this in the audience and get to watch it happen without being one of the guys. That's the fact that you and your friends do this. A little higher up on the contraction. Here you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Again. Good. Watch your hips. Good. Good. Good. Good. Okay. Good. Good. Good. One more. Yes. Hold it. Right there. Slowly down. One more. Reference. Right there. Slow. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. So why can't it be these believed in the back circle is just crazy back and now it's just cracking up and exploding down. Straight floating down the metal bars are pow acuerdo. So you should actually take a picture while feeling like that is powerful. That's gone for a very high level of pressure. This is going to be high level. Tahly Cure Watch that gets blown away.MUSIC I don't believe in that. I believe they contraction in very, very early. Almost unbelievable. But still, I would lay towards the stretch a little bit earlier. But a lot of people are here. The M-size of the contraction. I feel like that's in terms of, I think, especially when your body will on stage. What all you do is contract from the course is if you never know the gym, it's going to... The quality and the muscle I teach really well, I have always believed for example the most clear example that's why you can do it twice the tension. We have to lay all the way right. If you never do this contraction, I don't think you can create the same situation of the wall of it. Because it really is a carving index that's sure she goes for the following phase. And that's why the F-S-E-7 method is doing flex sets in between for more time under tension and even increases everything from the tabloids all the way to contraction because you're stimulating, the assimilating, exactly what you're doing on stage. You know whether really exercises that in this way from the mobile bicep being able to do a last spread on a back day or doing a back double bicep on a back day is so important. If you just leave it with the clots, it's like a second bend. If you've never done it for your barely practicing, posing, you're shaking and it doesn't look the same. If anything's sometimes watery and it's because people have an practice without the contraction. Time to grow! That's it Wesley! Again! Go! Go! Go! Go! Again! You go! You go! Try that everything! Oh! Come on! You go! I got you! Let's go! You got three! Three good ones! Everybody's watching, bro! Everybody's watching! I'll break this low! Good slow! Good slow! Good! I'll break! All the way! All the way! All the way! All the way! Break it a little bit! Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow! Slow! Good! Good! Go! Go! Go! Again! Again! One more! Go! Go! You're easy to do! Two! Two! Don't stand back! Don't stand back! Good! Hold it! Hold it! Five seconds! Four! Three! Two! And one! Good job! Enjoy your day! You have to do even during the competition stage. You still have to push yourself. And make sure that I'd rather, you know, in my opinion, it's for you to back off 10% of your upper body training on those intense days. And then put your recovery towards your leg. It's five, ten. Because again, you're trying to see what is going to create the most balance in your physique. Even if you had to turn around and say, okay, I'm not going to beat up my body. Let me turn around and focus on making sure that first day of the week I'm going to train legs. Because I'm coming off and I think that's how I would consider maybe re-proposing playing around a little bit with some of the workouts. I usually have a three-day arm on my arm. Okay, with a three-day arm, I'll start with leg. Yeah. That's what I usually do, but I think it still is a racial, leg upper body is still kind of want to want because I'm training the legs. It's often actually upper body parts, so maybe I'll have to change something. We did another row. I think it has two, three, three, next day, three, leg days, two, part of the legs. But it's my opinion. You can get away with two, I have to wait two, two, two, three days. I'm going to quite know I'm going to hamstring on the left. But you may want to think about going into a three-day arm when they are two days on the knee. Right? So that way you can still be able to rest and build it around one breast day. On each. Yeah. So the first day and the second breast day, bond in the hands. Yeah. Well, my knee exercise, like, I'm going to do a three-day arm. On legs, it's going to be probably about five, five together. Yeah. About five altogether. Not including any clean-up work, like calves and all that air. I'm just talking about, like, I've got some great three-day arm exactly. But about that. Yeah. So that's something that needs, like, this. It's no use to do more anyway. So if you can, you didn't go hard enough to get it. Like, also an argue to use it like one day. You're used to, yes, one day stuff. Right. So you're going to do one day and then, and then, if you're going to go back to the recovery day. You might be able to do it now. No, no, no. It's so much. I would only focus on this type of technique for you, for your legs. I wouldn't just get to the body. You're going to grow like crazy. And then you go to the balance. It's going to grow altogether. But it's still the sink. You can balance. That's right. You're going to get some free ship with those like seeds. Yeah. Yeah. When you're going right out of weight. Exactly. Yeah. That's doing me brawl now. Wait, let's get some one last set on this. Yeah. So we're going to be a second working set. All right. So now we're going to compound motion. That's all right. Now, normally, you, what else do you normally do for legs? Just so I have a good idea. I like Welsh word and I catch what. I love what black brush. But it's really about the machine that allows my hips to work quickly. It's very blues are quite tight. So, and I'm not in my lower back posture. It's a bit too late because it's quite tall. I'm an anchor that's flexible. So when I do it more and the squat and bend, I bend forward. And it's really targeting more. It's not the class at all. But the lower back and the glutes. It doesn't have tight at all. Also, yeah. Gotcha. What about if you did a speed push-up? It's fine. It's fine. Okay. Let's try it. Maybe we can get you some depth. Yeah. And then we can get you some scratch. Yeah. We can get some fibers or body fat. Just do it because that's a minute bit. So it's simply like this. See how that kind of suit. Yeah. I was wondering, like, do you shine here to all of the pressure, right? Yes. So, and you also we, you're in together between basically after our pressure. And then you have to do the impact. I think we did the path catch together. Yeah. You didn't do before the Arnold 5. Yeah. So at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at my last compare to the Arnold. Yeah. But this Arnold also, I think you, maybe heard what happens with me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what did you see at the Arnold and my, to chic? Like, you just looked like you were depleted. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So when you, someone said you got sick, I go, okay. Now I understand why they have, right? Yeah. So yeah. So yeah. Some issues. Yeah. It was like the normal virus. I believe and food poisoning maybe together. Because it was like a forced, I bought it. I wanted to force something out of it. I didn't throw up for like 20 years. And then I was a sudden, it happened like, get bigger as me, let's just say. But that's why the side of you be destroyed because I was like, I'm not going to end the season with this, but I shouldn't really do anything about it. So if you, I know how much you saw it, but did you see any, I didn't, I only got to see this couple of photos. And again, the lighting was completely different. Yeah. It was really hard to compare. Yeah. I mean, how did you feel comparing your food? Yeah. I think I looked at the choice pretty much, but I looked like, at the previous Arnold, okay. Because as you probably know, Matt Greggle beat me as the Troy. But I, I, I, I find it really interesting that, contrast because it was only one point different. We crushed it a lot. And then kind of happens on Matt's red. It also be maybe one of their new guys. I think that. So it's a best closer and now. I kind of wonder if I implement your kind of big, something higher there. What would be kind of my, what would be your prediction, what I could do, maybe next year? What's your, what are you already one Arnold left? Yeah. I think it's just that the problem is your ratio is needs to get fixed. Yeah. Because you get in so far easy to provide you. A lot of your, a lot of it's what you've been saying. We just worked with, but again, because the ratio is still off. Yeah. That's the problem. Is it this, we should not improve. And that's been through. Yeah. And that's a hard thing to do. Yeah. But I think that you're honest, I can do really really well because you've done well. Yeah. Yeah. You've gotten so good rubber bodies that is in your, I know the core body, a little bit deeper. Yeah. And certain is here. Yeah. Because I think your rubber bodies grow more. Now because you're living in your weaker, because your rubber bodies, yeah. I always think it's funny because when I compare me, I like someone who beats me, if you only look at the cause, it's like, it's not that much of a difference. But it's because when you're investing the, the upper body, the discrepancy, the difference, then like, okay, now I see it in wedge, the difference between the upper and lower, even though the legs themselves would be other guys, because that's that much difference. It's the upper body, but that's the, yeah. All of the, the bottom, yeah. The real show is that, you have to always, you have to, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think Chris had that nail. Yes. People's maximizing this. The shoulders to the quad, ratio, it's always something you look at. Try it out. When it's quad, it's flat. I always tell them, you know, the quad will be top, yeah. You know, you know, change it, let's get you back onto the Smith machine's quad. Yeah. Yeah. You think that, that would work because again, it's not, it's never showing a verb, from the Smith machine, you know, from the barbell. Yeah. So then we put, so he took it out for a while, and he was like, nope, we've got to put it back in. I don't care, do you know what the technique, we've got to be, I think that's going to be the challenge. We're also the fun about this off-season. As I started bodybuilding, having a lot of fun and training, and upper body from almost always, so much fun to see because you can see the meat at the end of mirror. It's cool that a pump in the mirror, like this, but the light is also something you kind of never really show off something. But it's something I have to change my mindset around. That you constantly have to look at. Yeah. You have to obsess about it. Yeah. Because bodybuilding, especially if this level is about, we're going to have to be a perfection. Yeah. I'll see you. I'll see you. I'll see you. But most of the course for me is like the shoulder-crack. Because you kind of want to bend forward because you like that super tight. That's it. Yeah. I'm going to do it. Yeah. I'm going to do it. Yeah. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to bring your feet in a little bit. Yeah. A little narrower stance. And let's see how you do it with that. Yeah. But I'm going to add a little bit of weight. You're not much. I'm going to do it like maybe a quarter. Yeah. And just to see. Part of the meat. Exactly. We're going to work on your depth. Because if it's too light, your technique will be bad. Yeah. You want to force you in your depth. Yeah. So we're going to put it right. We're going to put it right. All right. Yeah. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm gonna get you as your senway and I'm gonna bring your knees in just a little bit more so that you're not going to go and so on. We're just trying to work a little bit of that sort of mouth over the toes. See how stack it. So we're going to go and use over the toes. So just to sit and wait and out, try to come in and see what that looks like. We're really focused on the, yes, sweet. Yes, yes. Let's see what that looks like. We're really focused on the, yes, sweet. Yes, yes. Yeah. Let's see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to go to the pool. Right there. Go on. You're good. Yeah. Yeah. I get one. One. Five. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's like I said, no, four plates. He's easy. Okay? Like, five if you have a really push yourself. Yeah. Because your muscle is a strong muscle. Yeah. So if you're going to be doing that kind of way, you're going to end up looking. Then when I do the way, then I'm ready. Yeah. You're going to do the amazing changes. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's what you should be doing. I noticed that it's not really about the fatigue and the local muscle. It's more about the overall fatigue right now because I'm about to use it. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It's like I've been coming up on this movement for a long time. Yeah. But it's I know that I should be going a lot heavier here. Yes. Get the tension on the muscles. Right. Yeah. Yeah. You know, because again, you can grow doing it. You're doing it. But just in a skill amounts versus whichever body. So. Yeah. Just trying to just change that ratio. Yeah. You want your body. I provided a load of three to five percent. Like 20 to 25 percent. Yeah. I'm lower about it. You recommend also for me using weightlifting shoes with an elevated heel. I like to use just flat. Yeah. Or if you feel like press without shoes to try to get maximum range of motion. Yeah. I think it's a really good idea to be able to really make sure that you get that flexion because I think we can start with the minute it. Then it's a far more to get more range of motion later. Okay. Alright. Alright. Alright. Good. Good. Oh, we have my waist. That's one. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Good. Oh. Okay, good. You have your brains getting rewired because it knows you can do more. So now it's saying, okay, you got to just quit. Just exactly. Yeah, just kind of breaking up out of the knot doing it. Was that last set? Yeah. For one before the swim that we stood. And then that was when you had to tickle on strong enough. Yeah. So now you're like, okay, no, I have strength to do it. Now I just got to get the mental fortitude to be able to go through the range of motion. I'm not used to doing it. So it's all mental for you. Okay. I think you're holding back a bit. Yeah, for me, it's always possible to show the balance between. I'm not going to let more weight but just like form and compromise too much. Yes, remember, 90% can still be better than 100%. If you're going to be able to do 20 to 35%. Yeah. You're saying, yeah. You guys all have time under tension. Is it going to the truth, weight, to more young? Yeah. Like the balance between risk and rewards. Yeah. Yeah. You don't have to be so strict that you're getting up. You can't 20 more percent weight. Yeah. And then 30 to 90% of strength with form and be able to handle a little bit more low. Now again, don't go to 70% of form. That's going to end up becoming now too much the ratio's in the ball. Yeah. So it's because in the past, it got to lower back injuries and stuff. Like going to have to swing leaves. But it's like you're saying then the form would have already been 70% less of what it should be. Yeah. And proper warm-up and doing these partner consistent bases are going to now be able to stretch you out. Also afterwards, you're going to have to stretch right? Like later tonight, tomorrow, like stretching you out, which is really really important. Everything's going to feel contractive because the muscles are going to get really really tight and that's where your lower back is going to get really tight. Yeah. Up the stretch of the block and foam roll. Very important. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Nice. Yeah. And then you should stretch me out. Yeah. Yeah. Stretch and foam roll. I'm not going to do that. I already do that, sir. Yes. But sometimes, these like so. Oh. I do it. I'm doing a stretch of energy to do the leg day. Yeah. You're going to have to do it several times a week. Yeah. You're going to have to be doing it not just because you're going to remember. You're doing legs twice a week. So you're going to need to be doing stretching three times a week. And then you're going to have to foam roll at least three or four weeks on just your legs. That foam roll is always superior to like a massage. You're on or something like that. Yeah. Back and forth a little bit. The foam rolling is going to be much much harder. That's why it's more painful. The massage is going to be kind of relaxing. You know, way? Yeah. Yeah. Super easy. That's why foam rolling. When with Jay Color we used a completely hard surface. And I thought it was good for no rolling. No, it was made out of pexi glass. Oh, and it was so hard that when you put your leg on it, it would actually feel like you're about to break your leg. But if you would have to do that to try to open up the floor. It's not taking with your foam roll. Because you're so heavy. If you don't use a really tough thick density types of plastic, what's going to happen is you're going to give. And then it's going to be for the feet of purpose. And then it's going to be for the feet of purpose. There you go. Now you're catching it. Come on. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah? It's really heavy. It's heavy. Yeah. That's the coming as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good. Now, because of the fact that your body is not used to it, I'm not going to push you to go through. You know, I know you can do it because you're going to end up risking more of that lower back tightness. So I'd rather just try to put you one more set of this. Yeah. And then now move on to the next exercise. Then we'll just do something to take your back completely out of it and go into a late press. So that way it takes your back completely. Yeah. It's a good idea. Okay. I really don't help. We did those first two sets. We got to feel immediately where the tension goes. Right. To the, to the Quad's where it's supposed to go now. And that's why you we pre-exhaust them with it. Yeah. Right. That's a very nice thing in the muscle. And not just because of tired or something, it's really here. That's why you want to feel it. Because you got that mindless connection in the first exercise. Okay. Well, your hamstrings are also warmed up from doing lack of lake girls. So that way when you come into the compound, now you got the blood and the quad and the ham. Yeah. True. So you're not coming in with cold hamstrings. Yeah. I also feel the hamstrings in years. Well, I, if they're also working harder than normal. Alright. You can feel that free is movement. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. You can eat it. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Good. Good. Oh, God. You don't get on. Get on. Okay. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Why should we do that? That's it. That's good. Alright. Reaching how squat. It has it squatting a very long time. So I felt like this neck machine would be really going to fish your forearm keeping this deep a little bit narrower. It's so sports. Try to hit that outer sweep to get it more with because the shoulders are so crazy-wise. So again, what do I do with it? Because it's not a V. It's an X. So, I gotta remember, build the width and your legs to match your squat. You're a shoulders. You're a shoulder. You're a shoulder. So keep your toes straight. Okay. You want to try it today? It's possible to get that outer. There you go. Push that in. Let's do it slowly. Come down. Next. And. Good. How's that way feeling? Good. Good. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. Good light. Okay. Yeah. The sled is pretty heavy. Yeah. You see how your angle is going in? Whatever your foot's straight. Try to make the decision to be good. And then concentrate on it. I'm going to be your angle's inner round. Okay. Line them up. Come back. Line them up. Good. Good. There you go. That's what I'm having taking. You go up. Go up. Good. And then the other thing is when you come down, go out. Go down. Just reverse breathe. Go down. Go roll it again. Pretty much. Yes. Exactly. Yes. Go down. Down. Go out. Good. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's it. Now. Next. Good. So, cue points. Watch your feet. Go to the air level for one another. Okay. Number two. Low out so you get more tap. So you get more range of motion. If your gut is big from air, it's going to stop your range of motion. So make sure you get facilitated that. My breath will reach out. So you come down. So you get it around your inner reverse breathe. So it's going to do a lot of the distance. Yeah. Right. So make sure you do that. And then, make sure you don't hold your breath. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Again. Go. Good. Good. Go ahead. Good. Good. You want to say go. Next. Right there. Good range of motion. Man. Right. Good. And right. You go. You're gonna keep on just going. Go ahead. Go ahead. You go ahead. Go. Go. Good. Little faster. Right. Let's go. It's right. Push. Push, push, push, one more. Come on. Come on. Let push. All right. Right. Pull it and chop. Come on. Come on. One more set. You good. All right. Good tempo. Perfect tempo. Perfect tempo. Perfect tempo. Good. Give us a bit. All right. Good. Good. Give us a bit. All right. All right. There you go. Getting stronger with every rep. All right. All right. All right. All right. You're going. Push, push, push, push. Okay. Now it's time to work. Two of the growing rep. All right. Another growing rep. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Get out of here. All right. Oh. Let's go. Ready toague it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh. Finish it. Oof. Is it the heaviest you've placed in history? Oh man. Even your wife is like, yeah, she goes this morning, you know, right now. Man, indeed, the heaviest two plates ever. Look, super-life, but trust me, the muscles are experiencing something very intense. But this is the foundation. I was gonna have it later, but there's more place of the added. Same double-stain technique, same my most connection as the goal. It's a really build-up foundation of technique, and then the foundation of strength later on. Ooh, feels very accomplished. You know what I'm doing, such sets. Oh. How you doing great job? It's still just 10% of giving birth. Yeah. Maybe 5%. Yeah, 5%. Yeah. We're done. I don't want you to overdo it. I think it's getting. I don't want you to overdo you. But really focus now on making sure that like protein, I would do 100 weeks. Like 4, yeah, postwork out, 75, 100 grams of protein, minimum like 75 right now for you, for your size. But making sure that you're really taking it to the next level. And then on top of that, I would make sure that you're getting that range of motion. Really starting to work great, what we did. But that range of motion is what I was done. Yeah. Trying to get back to depth, and if you did that squad-up, you're going to have to make sure like 4 to be alive. And then you're going to, like, see different things in that sort of company. So, I think we're going to flip this middle Tom. Yeah. Then, you think that few months maybe a lot. We're going to lay it over me. Hexby Squadting that way. Yeah. That's the goal. Yeah. Yeah. We're thinking very much to the inside. Because it needs a lot to be, you know, I've been training for a lot a long time. I said, bodybuilder. From someone like you, with the coaching best, bodybuilder's in the world. That really means a lot because it's a gives me like a tips to really change. I just don't think we don't have to my whole life this. I mean, there's this going to be the foundation of something amazing in future. So, I'm going to really think it's tips to heart and do my best to make it a happy decision. Yeah. I think we definitely do this. So, make sure you don't give up. Continue to focus on, you know, the task at hand, which is really able to possibly improve. Yeah. But, remember, strength is also part of it. Yeah. I'm just intensively working. And also, you can do what you feel. And that time of the adventure. Yeah. Also, are that equation that is also, wait. Yeah. I really need to hear this because you're so over-sadgeted with a technique that needs to be taken in, with comes down, comes down, but it doesn't, doesn't much. The muscle won't respond to all the things like, you're making yourself tired, like being too professional. Right. Now, I really self-confination. So, that's the belief. Right. That's the, that's the squat. I, you know, you see, I believe that I can do more at the reward. And that's the kind of talk. If I might, I need to brush your, uh, faint for that. Go on. Yeah. Yeah. We can pour it. See you in the result. He too. Can you do it? I'll go to it. I'll just take your lunch. Whoo. All right, guys. We just finished up with Wesley. Great, great. Let me work out. Again, not overly complicated. Back to the basics. I just feel that he has to go back to things that were as comfortable, like being able to have a very, very big frame and going deep into a squat. Most of the guys all guys, it's harder versus someone that's my height to be able to squat. So, a lot more range of motion, lot more geography to be able to go up and down. A lot more just difficult. But again, what happens is you end up breaking through those barriers by doing things that are not easy, so your body can actually grow.
