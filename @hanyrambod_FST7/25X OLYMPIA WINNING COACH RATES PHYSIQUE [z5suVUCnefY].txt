Welcome to the not so truth podcast for those of you that are used to my truth podcast I am not doing a podcast today. What I'm doing that's gonna be completely different is actually breaking down a physique and also rating a physique but at the same time I want to walk you through what I see when I'm looking at a physique and The first person that I actually want to be able to do this with is actually Wesley Vissers and that's because I just got done doing a podcast with him this last week and Super super nice guy and he's getting ready for the honor classic But we pulled up the images of the Mr. Olympia and we took a couple of photos and now we're gonna go ahead and Show you guys what I see in my minds. I when I break down someone's physique So let's go ahead and start off with a front double bicep One of the things that comes to mind is how great Wesley's arms are He's got bicep to try set fullness Again very Arnold-esque Arnold had some a little bit better peaks, but just the amount of fullness he has is is great I mean when I look at his arms I think they're absolutely phenomenal One thing that I do when I break down someone's physique I look at their arms and the first thing believe it or not I look at his arms second thing is actually calves So what I'm doing here is looking at the symmetry between the upper body and the lower body That's one place because his arms are so good that He would want to increase his thickness in the calves So solius and gastro he could definitely work on that little bit of that V taper in his calves We want to be able to really build that up right in here to build some more depth Right in here so again the exercises for those would be standing leg just basic standing Cavraises as well as cedar raises for the solius gastro would be standing or even doing toe raises on a leg press would work out really well But that stretch and a lot of the information that's coming out now is also doing partials off the stretch is gonna help with growth A lot of volume definitely definitely he wants to be able to hit a ton of volume on that and build that up But you want to make sure that you're really focusing on that area because as you can see here just if he could fill that area in Then we can have that symmetry between here and down there in the Cavaria so Again guys that's the way you want to look at that X frame now now you know as we talk about the X frame This is what you're looking at The other area that we can definitely discuss is his chest shoulders lots he's got great great lap with so Did last here are really really flared chest nice and full shoulders are popping looks great Good abs, but one of the things that is taking away from his physique again a little bit on the lower body that he can work on is the thigh sweep that thigh sweep doesn't quite match up to his shoulder width because as shoulder width out here doesn't Line up with the quad sweep down low so that would be amazing So again just cleaning it up a little bit from the sketches got as a good X frame but overall Really good practice from the front but he needs to continue to keep building up the thigh sweep So that he can be able to really make sure that he fills in the width of his lower body to match the width of his upper body Once that happens He's gonna have a very very Impressive and imposing look Just needs to continue to keep doing that. I know he's improving his legs When he talked about the podcast he's been really focusing on that But that's what's missing on that front double bicep pose a little bit wider through the thighs and then keep building up the calves to be able to balance out those biceps All right, so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna break down the second pose which is a side chest pose in the side chest pose The most impressive thing about Wesley is his shoulder width So he's doing a great job posing he's got a great chest Fibres are popping so you see all these fibers in here So that looks great you're also seeing this amazing shoulder width right that shoulder width is awesome Now again same things happening here this is happening in the front double bicep just not quite as wide as He can be here to be able to match up with that shoulder width So what we need is we need to have him get a little bit fuller in that quad that outer quad here And again what I would have been doing is probably more of the front squats. I would have narrow Hacksquats narrow Lake press to be able to really focus on being able to build out those legs especially on that outer sweep Could use a little bit more hamstring drop as well And once you fill in the spots between here and here what's gonna end up happening the front Quad and hamstring you're gonna get more width to be able to match that amazing width of his upper body So again when you have such a dominant body part like having really wide shoulders It's a blessing and a curse the blessing is the fact that he's so wide But the second thing that he has to also do is match up his upper to his lower So the way I look at it is that he's continuing to improve he knows his weak points He's gonna continue to focus on him and overall great side chest But try to fill in those quads as well as that hamstring drop all right guys We're gonna take a quick break from rate your physique just for a friendly reminder that if you haven't used the FSC 7 app yet shame on you for only a dollar you get full access to my FSC 7 app my full workouts as well as my exclusive in app content So go to honeyrambod.com Use the code bday that's right it's my birthday month for only a buck you get full access So make sure you check it out if you want access to my workouts so honeyrambod.com code bday now back to rate your physique All right the third and final breakdown Picture that I have here is the back double bicep pose so let's start off with all the good things Great great width he's got awesome Latt with okay this is just awesome We're talking about that back with I'm gonna go ahead and also guys the one thing I do want to get from you guys is Let me know if you like me to use a different color if you want me to break down in a different way Put it in the comments below and also you give me your assessment of what you think of the person I'm breaking down and Whether you agree with me or not but again I'd love to hear your feedback because we want to make this for you so again great lats Also once again amazing arms even his delts okay What I'm gonna do is give this five stars right this is five stars amazing amazing back I mean that's that's honestly I think this is an amazing pose for him what can we improve on though again as we go down to the lower body Caves need a little bit of help need to fill them up to be able to match the symmetry of the upper body Especially the arms and then the legs so let me clean this up a little bit so you guys can have a better Cleaner look But we want to be able to keep building up those clouds building up the hamstrings We want to fill this area in so that we can match up To the upper body that lower body upper body needs some extra symmetry So you need to build up the width of the lower body so it's it's this here the width of his legs So he needs to continue to keep building up the legs just like we were talking about in the front pose But also he could be a bit more conditioned. I know this wasn't his best At the Arnold last year I believe he was at his best, but we're just using the photos from this previous show Which is the Olympia so he's gonna be a lot better than that this year at the Arnold I really truly believe that we had a good conversation with him during the podcast But getting bit tighter so working on the conditioning that glute ham tie in as well You know as well as being able to thicken this area up and then just building in overall more detail There and then a little bit more detail in that lower back as well, but again This looks amazing, but he just has to continue to work on that lower body So again guys Wesley I'm I'm really being picky here. He is amazing. He's a world class athlete these are areas that I am just doing in regards of of critiquing and breaking him down But overall Has an amazing physique I'm gonna go ahead and switch it to the absolute last Picture and let's go there all right going into the last pose He's throwing in a most muscular and This is something where he really excels in why because the arms again look awesome You get in chest strations through there shoulders look really really good You're seeing the detail in his legs especially all the way through into the out Dr. area you can see how lean he is you got fastest media Alice everything is just popping you're getting some detail I mean honestly Great great shot on him. I think he looks amazing. I think this is one of his knockout shots and Obviously cannot forget how big those traps So again Wesley's crushes on this pose But one of the things I do want to let you know is that again this was not his best I believe he's gonna come in more detail. I'm looking forward to seeing him at the Arnold classic here in the next five weeks And I think we're gonna see the best Wesley coming up. He's very very excited to show everyone his up and coming new look for 2025 all right guys so after all these critiques We are gonna do an overall rating The way I'm gonna come up with my rating has to do a little bit to do with what I'm seeing in front of me But also I'm gonna add a little bit for his potential as well so One of 10 stars now can't be that's too easy. I'm gonna give it to one to 10 sandouts right 10 sandouts being exceptional Mr. Olympia I give Wesley Visser in the 2024 Olympia 7.8 sandouts and again 7.8 he was eighth at this show. I feel like he has a lot of room from improvement That's why it's as high as it is But again, I'm being a little bit harsh, but I know he can fulfill a lot of potential that he has We saw last year at the Arnold and I'm looking forward to doing this again after his next Arnold classic So let me know what you liked about this Let me know what you want to see that might be different and I will definitely utilize all of your suggestions on the next segment of rating your physique peace
