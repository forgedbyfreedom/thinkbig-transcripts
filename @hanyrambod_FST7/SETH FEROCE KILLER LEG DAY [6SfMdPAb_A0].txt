What is odd? It's so cute. Welcome. Thank you. That's nice. Very, very monied. That's it. How you guys doing? Doing it. You guys are good. How's the temperature compared to being passing? It was 21 degrees when we left this morning. It was just going to fall here. It was chilling when we landed, but then it warmed up. Are you doing good? It's good to see you. You continue to see you. You continue to. You're doing the worst. Can I see that? Yeah. That's right. Hello. I have to see you again. This is your first time here, right? Yeah. I'm ready for a tour. I think this is like, I don't know if this is always like, I never see this. This is one of the first t-shirts from like, 08. Whenever I had the white, Eve-janties shirt, then I had a black, Eve-janties shirt. So when I see that, I put it in a pool. I know there's a white one somewhere. I think it was on MD. That was the last time I remember seeing myself. I cut the sleeves off of it, and it was for one of the videos Leave in the National. Okay. Yeah. It's a little bit bigger. A little 20% tour. Yeah. I don't know if you see the professor yet. Somebody handbed this for me. The guy that did hot his nine foot statue. It's awesome. All my hand. Check that. He's pretty cool, right? It's awesome. That is part of the cool things that like, like in the industry, all the fans are, they all do something. They can be able to help. Yeah. I think that's what I was going to do. I was going to do that. 13 years. Yeah. I was going to do that. 13 years. Yeah. I think that. On the one. We used to. Yeah. They just assume, and you get to remember, it's an evolutionary process. There's a lot that's happened in the last 30 years of my experience in the gym. You know? And you start to learn things. And you go, oh, I put a lot of importance in this. And then you start realizing that that's important. It's not as important as this. And what we do is we put time under tension, you know, at the top. And then you turn around and go, yeah, it's for injury motion. Great. Yeah. But if you want to say that everything is down here, the contraction has a lot to do with it, especially when you're a bodybuilder. Because if you're not contracting in the gym, and you try to contract for the first time on stage, doing a look like shit. And you're not going to turn around. You're going to start shaking. You're not going to have a detail. And you get to remember, it's also the aesthetic portion of what happens and you guys haven't measured because you're doing something that science based, that's in a book from a clinical study. But they didn't turn around. I've been my clinical study in the last 30 years and 25 will be a wins later. Right? So, I'm sitting there going. You put it so much more eloquent than I could. You're an idiot. No, you just do it this way. We do this at the accident's led you away. Yes, magic. Exactly. But what I turn around and do is just try to sit there and say, hey, look, there is no perfect way, but there is a little bit better way. And something that's less likely to get you hurt. And that's why when we created FST7, to be able to increase intensity from a very far away distance, you and Pittsburgh, Phil was in Denver. But the car, it was in Las Vegas. The concepts, I mean, even just the simplicity of the concepts, like they are an intricate concept, the simplicity of you being able to take people there is why I think I get worked for me. And you've got to be able to just go to be able to adapt to it as well. You can't just be set in their ways. 100%. Yeah, gotta be willing to just be like, yeah, I'll try. I need it. So we'll get to try other things too. Just add on to the arsenal. It's like a toolbox. You just keep adding me to this to them. I'll be like the way for you. Yeah, yeah, literally. Yeah, so welcome to my, my jig. This is bad ass. And if you want to change, you're kind of where, where's located on your vehicle. We can move that if we want to. Yeah, just get the feel for it. Yeah. Smooth for playbo to machine. I'm saying normal you think playbo to the machine. Yeah, I'll send it get really easy. My attention really, yep. Good. How are you doing? It'd be a full. I just bought it. There's good there for sure classic. There's the next boat. We're going there, launch, you know, but we're coming out with your next year. Doing meetings and then that's it. And then kind of right back home. I have a few steps. You're a group, I know. I have a few here. Not for someone like that. When you get a little older, I'll take an India. Because I want him to see some of the kind of how the rest of the world lives. Yeah, but right now he's still a little too young. I'm a way to about another year or two. Good news is he's still having a clutch week. A lot of guys want to get older and lose your clutch week. Let's start. I want to talk to you about. Sure. And just see you general seeing if that, however everything works. You're a opinion matters. Sure. It's true. But overall everything. Absolutely. I mean, we already take a quick look at your body. You see how your legs look when they get full. And you can already see that you still have that fullness in your outer street, which is really good because a lot of guys, as they get older, they lose their outer street. And then if you really start losing your lower body, start losing your little roots. And then you get old man ass. And that actually slows down your metabolism too. Especially when you end up getting older and don't train legs. You lose a ton of muscle. And you never really stop train. Yeah. Yeah. Just change my train. Right. Just functional functional functional functional functional dude. Yeah. I'd make myself feel good and look good. Yeah. Yeah. I can feel crazy if I don't. That's awesome. Good. Yeah. But now it's been good. Got me in shape, but I backed off the cardio significant. Well, I don't think you really mean it. I don't see you because you're still in rich shape. There's no point in it because all it's going to do is just going to end up being you out to my chest. That's kind of what I was afraid of shaving everything off. It's going to happen. You were in Mexico with us and you're certain. I remember you. I feel like an asshole now. It's so good. You just had to get a little of the nitrophics in there. Yeah. You get the blood flow rolling. Wait a minute. You look familiar. I thought you were a fan of Mexico. That's awesome. That's awesome. That's awesome. A little fucking blast. How fun is your son? I have a, I was working on a post because I was going to post a bunch of videos of this kid. He's a fucking crazy. He's a fucking riot. He is me. He's like, if I'm saying, he's me now, which is kind of a problem. Me when I was a kid, I was shy, full ten minutes. But he's new now. That's the problem with camera with me. Yeah. Actually, I mean like, you don't, you don't become a, you, 11 year old. He's a, you're a little innocent boy. He's running around. He's got a 40 year old man's characteristic. So it doesn't give a fuck. That's what I mean in that one. You know, she's 17. So she'll, she'll like, you know, co-her some to do something. So he learned a new magic trick. She taught him. Rock paper scissors. One, two, three shoots. And I'm like, god of a, who are you doing to me? You're killing me. So if a good in the bad comes with me. If a good in the bad. That's awesome. Ah, okay. So when you're going up, you're doing, if you're going through the motion. This isn't a pump right. Uh, sat. Go up. Come down. Twice the foot. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Ten to twelve. You two. That's fun. See those fibers firing? Yep. Right? Because you're now allowing it to really create more time and retention. And that's what you can. That's going to help you with that density. Good. Good. Even in the early sets. Yep. Yep. Yep. Good. See how you're shaking? Uh-oh. It's because you're used to just dropping and releasing tension and allowing that to happen. That's why even you've been training. But people who get shake normally are the ones that are not in the muscle will crackly or they haven't been training at all. Like if you haven't trained abs forever and you start shaking your incunchars. Yeah. That's why it's because you're not hit the muscle properly. Ah. Yeah. More time of retention than there. You can control that. Good. It's just quality reps. Good. Now on this leg point your right here through toe and a little bit there. Good. Good. Good. There you go. Good. Good. Now for the rest of the set. Point your toe. There's much you can like that. Perfect. Good. You feel a little bit more in your upper back. Good. Go left. Good control. Good. Good. Good. Good control. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Again. Good. Good. So we're doing is we're just getting him slow down a little bit. He's going to fly it. One second on the way up. Maybe two. And then he was going about one second on the way down. Now we're doing as about two maybe up to three seconds on the negative on the eccentric. So that we can be able to really get more time and attention. And that's why his muscles are now starting to shake and they're starting to fire more because he's just getting more time and attention. Which is really good because that's going to equal more muscle growth. So you're going to get bigger. Bigger. And have more dense fibers. Which you want to do is those fibers are going to look dense because you have more time and attention. And then you're going to have just that quality of that muscle because you're starting to get where we call that old man muscle. That muscle matured. And so, and the good thing about your physique is you've always had a really good greenness. But now you can be able to have that combined that way. You're new muscle that you're putting it back on. So you're going to be able to have a better look, especially if you decide to get back on stage. Right. You don't need to breathe, doctor. That's not all your breath. Breathe or breathe. Excellent. How's it going? Good. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. Push good. Squeeze good control. Good. Good. If you let attention all the way back, yeah. That's what you did. Especially on a plate loaded machine. Yeah. Good. Go. Good. Go inside. Good. There you go. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. Good. Good. Push it well. Good. Keep him moving. Keep him move. Good. Good. Let's try it. Go inside. Sure. Go inside. This one. Good. Good. Control. Control. Your little sore bike slow, just slow. I got a bit of a child Abgeordn melhor. That's right there. It's not the area that's very very top of the walk in your knee out. It's that area about 20% further down that you want to kind of release the tension. Slow that area especially on that right right because you almost want to just be able to say, okay, I get the wrap and I'm letting go. Keep that tension and be able to go all the way down the descent right? Especially in that midpoint. Up. Good. That's a little bit. There you go. Good slow. Good. Good. Good. Squeeze, squeeze. Good. Good. Good job. Good job. Uh-huh. Good. How's it feel? Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. There you go. Good. Good. See as you try slow down the tension, just want to be good. Good. Good. Good. Good. To be poor tight. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Let's hit. Go up. Up. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good. Good. Good. Slow. Good job. Good job. Good. Good. And a one more play. I don't think so. Okay. I'm good there for a minute. So it's put out a cellied cellus equipment too. No. Good. Good. Good job. It's actually what was cool. I went out and I bought everything. Okay. And what I did was I said, hey man, I'm buying so much stuff. I need some extra stuff. And then they're like, hey, we'll work out a deal with you to pay on how many pieces you buy. But then what happened was then when I said, hey, look, by the way, I think that we should make some changes on some pieces like the arm to alarm I wanted an attachment make. So it was all fixed. And they're like, okay, that's a great idea. So they started making attachments. And then I was like, okay, so that I could came in like a bit of a bit of a advisory role. And then now I'm going over and helping designing some brand new stuff. I know. I was fucking with you, but it makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Yeah. So it's nice. I've never used a plate-loaded lady's tension. That was this nice. Yeah. You normally think, hey, you know what, I've used hammer strength and hammer strength. And hammer strength is great for certain things, but not usually on legs. No, I'm played loaded. So now you can be able to have the best of both worlds. Oh, yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good job Seth, come on. Keep it rolling. Oh, good. Keep going. Going. Okay. On that right side we're going to go a little less. Go. Go. Keep going. Go. Keep going. Go in. Not partially. Go. Five. Four. Three. Two. One more. One more. Two. One more. Hold it. Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. Good job. Three. Two. Good job. Oh. There we go. Okay. Can't catch your breath. Good. Now get your feet still higher. There you go. Good. Okay. And then on the next step we'll adjust that to get a little thicker. Good. Good. Good. Make sure you feel a little less with joining more on the muscle. Yeah. Good. Excuse me. Good. Good. Pretty good. Yeah. So in order to get a little deeper, you can just take it. Just that and then you can go to the control. So here's a tip for you guys. The reason why I don't like high stiff is because especially on leg day is because it's going to be really hard for your body to recover between the sets. If you're so stemmed up on very high amounts of caffeine that you can't get your heart rate down to be able to handle the next set. So if you're constantly feeling just taxed because you're doing so much caffeine, that is not a good thing. Especially when you're doing exercises like squads, pendulum squads, leg press. Because you're already going to have a high heart rate. So you want to be able to recover between sets so you're not gasped. In terms of your cardiovascular shape versus muscle going to failure. So that's why you want to keep it moderate stem or today. I mean you've been a guy that's been non-stemmed from a long time. Big nose stem guy, but no, it's just because of this from years and years ago. And that's why having like, I know we both own supplement companies. But it's like that's why so many different pre-workouts are made. So it's like, hey, on these days I take these days, I take these days. On these days I stack the two half of dose, half of dose. So that way it's, I don't know, it's more fun that way from a meat head standpoint and having your, your plethora of pre-workouts in your gym bag, but also from, from like an efficient, an efficacy standpoint in the gym. No stems on leg day. No stems on back day. Exactly. A little bit of stem on chest day. Arm day, you don't really need them, but they're fun. You're like, you're sitting before your heart is still. Now right now, cup of coffee in the morning and that's it. That way, you know, years ago we did it that way and you drove it into my head. So that way whenever you go from an offseason into a prep, everything has that much more of an effect on you. So that way whenever you're like, oh, it's time to take stimulants in your body. Mark, yeah. It's right. And start to run in a million miles an hour with it rather than offseason whenever you're house in 4,000, 5,000 calories a day and also having a thousand makes a stem. It stems a day. I'm going to do that. That's right. So that's exactly it. So the short version of that is just fact that when you are going to go into prep mode, then the stems actually work. So instead of just being so dumb down because you've been using so much of it in the offseason. So again, these are things that I use with his program 15 years ago that he's still using to this day. So it's awesome because you're still getting a lot out of that. Yeah, I still work. It's too simple. You know, I mean, especially like you always said, don't know, it's good to be detailed. But don't ever complicate it too far and sometimes we need to, like you said, we need that help to pull us back. But don't ever complicate it. As long as you're working hard and I mean covering your basis. Yeah, and having someone like you push you on a fucking lagging session. There's awesome. That's a little bit of a come down, a little hand and drive. Control. Good. Come on, Sad. Good. Good. Come on. Good job, Sad. Come on, brother. Up. Good. Come on. Come on, Sad. Good job. Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Good. Come on, Sad. Drive. Action. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. And drive. Come on. You got two more. Go, Sad. Go, Sad. Up. Good. Control it. One more. Just like that. Control. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Welcome back. Yeah. Your top set. We're going to do two working now. So this is the second working that's about to happen. And this is kind of where I would expect you to be when you go back home. So there's two things. Number one, that time and attention. I can tell you're going to fast back home. Yeah. Because that's why you're shaking so much. It's just that now you're putting more time into the tension on that muscle. Your shit's like, oh my god, here we go. It was like the space shuttle trying to take off. Sure. So when you slow that down, you can see the quality different. Yeah. So that means having the second thing is making sure that you are going for your motion. If you're doing a great job with that. So that has not something to be any change. Just continue it as you end up being stronger. Yeah. So what you're going to do is you're going to start wanting to load up. Just make sure you don't overload with a weight versus time of the tension. I think that's something that, to be honest, is one of the reasons that I probably haven't been. Keeping as much time under tension from like a slow in myself down. Because the weight might have been too light. Okay. Here he means a little too easy to move. Got it. And therefore just kind of going through the motions. Got it. Because legs have always been like a better body part for me. And just starting to train them like a bodybooter again. I'm getting a little bit of results from it. Whenever I could be benefiting more if I slowed it down a bit. Add a little more weight to it and fold more rather than just be like, Oh, I'm good with two plates. And I can get a good 12 to 15 reps. There. Definitely handle a little bit more. Yeah, a little bit more. Yeah. Okay. Last hit on this one. Second one. Second one. Second one. Good. Good. Good. Good. Set those feet. Set those feet. Don't let those ankles right in. So you're going to want to come in a little bit. Keep everything in line. You hit your knees and your toes. Boom. Drive. Good. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Come on, sack. Let's go, buddy. Up. Good. You got two. You got two. Let's go. Let's go. Up. One more, bud. One more, brother. Drive it out. Drive it out. Good job. Good job. Good. Good. Good. There you go. So he just has like auto release. So right now. There you go. All right. So. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Just two more. And this is what I'm talking about with the warm. Just get the range of motion. And drop. I'm going to grab the handle. There we go. Take it. Go on. Go. See you. All right. So here's another tip for you guys. If the weight really feels light and you're in the middle of a training program where you're really trying to work on your strength, do not overdo the reps on the lighter weight to try to make them into working sets. Stop. Rest. Add more weight and make sure you continue to go to failure on the heavier weight. Don't just for the sake of just burning out. Get fatite. If you do that, you're not going to be able to get the ultimate prize which is trying to put on your muscle. Add more weight after you rest and be able to get that same zone that you're looking to get into that A to 12 reps at range. Perfect. But don't sit there and just think you can just do an extra four or five reps. It's going to make up the difference. Especially when you're really feeling strong and you really want to be able to put on the size. So great point. If someone was to do that, say they're on there. They're doing three working sets and they're on their second working set and you say that, do you count that number two? No. Nope. Don't stop. Rest. Add the weight. That's number two now. That's right. Good. Good. Good. Excellent. You're in a 12. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Going. Right out. Good. Three. Three. One. Control slower slower slower. And try. Good. Slow. Slow. Slow. And drive. One more. Go. Go set. Control control. And drive. Go. Good. Cool. Cool. There you go. All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. There you go. Good. Good. There you go. Push that leg. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. I can told you when last time I saw you in Pittsburgh when I was at your place, you're I'm like you're going to grow so much once you get your food up. And the minute you turn that up, you can see the differences. That's really what it's been. It's also just trying to, you know, you want to push food, but only so much. Right. Can I shove more food in my mouth? Yeah. That's not always like, if that's way to go about it. No. No. Because I've kept things really clean. I've had to add in high calorie meals. Yes. A little bit of shit on Thanksgiving because I'm like, I don't like to because I don't like my stomach to get upset and get bubble guts. I was like, let's see if it works. It did. But then I didn't like the way I felt. Yeah. I didn't like how long it took for my stomach to adjust. Yes. I was like, it's no more than that. Right. So just the high calorie meals. Right. Just red meat. Like homemade burgers. Yeah. Things like that. Rather than just going and getting a burger somewhere, I'd rather have control the meat. And call it better for digestion just because I know getting older. Stomach and legs, do the control your stomach and make sure your legs still got the pop and everything else you come. It's really important that you know the things that you can get full on. Right. So if you end up going really heavy dairy-based foods on a cheat, you're not only going to pay the price in regards to the bloating and how you're going to feel, but you're going to end up causing yourself a lot of harm in your digestive tract for a day or two later. It's almost like going out and drink. When you go out and drink, you end up having a hangover. But then you also are dehydrated and your performance goes down for the next day or two. And food acts the same way, especially the older you get. So the fuel is the key. You can't put bad gas in a race car. I'm going. Yeah. Let's go vertical. I'm going back over. I'm just making our laps. You're looking our laps in. Let's put the vertical rolling here. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good job, Sam. Good. Drive. Excellent. Two more, two more. Good job. That's it. Bring it down. Oh. Oh, it smokes. Come on. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Again. Again. Three. Two more. Drive. Good job. Good. One more. Good job. Good. One more. Good job. Good. One more. Set with that one. Oh. You got to rethink any new things. Yeah. Part of this is going back and being a little bit nostalgic of what you did in the past. Part of this is like, why the fuck am I doing this? It's a little bit of a lovey. It is for sure. It's like, he's going to love it when it's over. But he's going to second guess himself a little bit during the reps and the sets and saying, Should I forgot how fucked up this was back in the day? Oh, there's nothing like it though. Yeah. This is where this will make you feel alive. Yeah. It will. There's nothing like it. Good job. Good job. All right. I keep going. Come on, staff. Last set on. Come on. Keep it going. Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Good. Keep it moving. Just like that. Keep it moving. Go breathing. Go breathing. Go breathing. Nothing. Nothing. It's much way before. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Go. Go. You got five. Go. Go. Go. Come on. Come on. Two. Come on. One more. Again. Go. Go. Go. That's it. Down. Good job. Good. Easy. Good time. Good time. Good time. So how was it? We had fun today. We had fun. It was, uh, we didn't do like a real intro to this. And I was going to be like, oh, so here we come. I haven't seen you or trained with you and how many, how many years. And it's like, what are we going to do today? We're going to do this. But the cool thing was like this, while I would play round up at gym, the lady equipment actually was would tick with my fancy the most. And I got, well, can I have been letting know that I don't train like a pussy, but I train like a pussy. I go back into it. I would say, I would say, go back on more. Make me look off in this back off. You don't train like a pussy. But you do train like what they would say a little bit of a skinny bitch. Okay, okay, that makes me feel better. That makes me feel better. Yeah, that makes me feel better. Yeah, that makes me feel better. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, but I mean, obviously, you put in it all together. I think, uh, we're talking a lot about, we spoke for like two and a half hour. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But now I consider meditating about a thing you know, for your body to grow. A not push it. And then be able to assess, and then grow, assess, without putting a timeline or time frame on anything specific, but still looking to see how far you can take your body, and supposed to be fun. not just completing an exercise, not just completing a repetition, but also feeling it and making sure that you're optimizing that repetition. It's not the same. And getting into this and just starting out with leg extensions, I'm like something as simple as leg extensions. You can do it, you know, you're doing them, but you might only be getting 75% out of it of what you should be getting out of it. So, again, going in there, being able to really toss it up in terms of like, he did a great job with the workout. I just feel like it's going to be really that much better. That makes me more excited because I know there's been a lot of people in the past 30 years that I've worked with. And again, 15 years ago, you know, you're 25 years old when you turn pro at the Nationals and now we're a week away from the Nationals here in Dallas. And the cool thing about it is that your body is changing very, very quickly and I cannot wait to sit down and talk about what the plan is. So, you ready? All right, guys. So, you're not miss the podcast. Again, honey ran by for Rosie Shredded, Seth For Rosie. Let's do this.
