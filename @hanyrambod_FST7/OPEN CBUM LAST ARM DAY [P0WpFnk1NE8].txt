Alright guys, we are on our way to London, London to Prague. We're gonna meet up with Seabumb out there and Calvin and the crew so that we can be able to all try to arrive in Prague. That's the plan, hopefully it works because once we get there, it's gonna be a cluster because we have to make sure that we can try to align because obviously, I've never been to Prague. This is my first time. I'm very excited about it. This is the first time. And I guess last, we're seeing, I'm only saying that because that's what Chris says that he's gonna do open. It's very exciting because this is gonna be all for fun. And I'm just looking forward to being able to get back with the crew, have a really good time, no pressure. Obviously, we wanna see Chris do well, but at the same time, we all know we didn't have a year to build them up and do all that because that was never the intent. He just wants to go out there and check that box of being able to compete in an open show. So that's what we're gonna do and have fun doing it. So, gonna give you a lot of info, gonna give you a lot of content and it's gonna be fun. So, let's get to London. All right guys, we are now at Heathrow Airport in London. On our way to Prague, got here around 6.15 a.m. Wait, Nomsibon, who's been, I don't know if he's delayed or he's just come in right before our next flight, but we actually got a hurry up and get to our flight. And hopefully he'll make this flight because I don't know when the next flight from Heathrow is she'd Prague is, but probably not for a while, so we better get going and go. There's a European reference. Moff? Rankings. He's cold. I just showed him the bodybuilding effect from 2017. I said, thank you. It's a night show, so I'm gonna say pancakes in the morning. Oh, is that what some kind of subliminal message? That's why we do it. Do I? You always have to try to be like, here's my subliminal message. You're just here for fun, I'm peeking myself.

I'm not six time anymore, I'm just a young kid going to his open day view. That's right. First time. First time to get a kid. So what was that? Is asking what we're doing. He says, do any competition? It's like, oh, was this your first one? And we said, yes. So it kind of is the first one. So I'm going. Chris, I'm sorry, Chris, I'm sorry. And then.

We have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit because you came from Miami, but I got to take a little nap before we came. But we're going to just do a little bit of arms and then just try to get me set the block so we can get the bed and start fresh into the arm. We'll have workouts. Follow up until two is pork shell.

There's two little notches that you have to pull on both sides and pull up. It's up. No, like on the handle. No, no, you can barely see them. They just slide up lower. Lower. Yeah, there we go.

All right guys, work out one completed here in Prague. We did arms, bicep tricep, got some cool machines. It looks very, very retro. I think you liked them. All you need to do is everything we've great, so. Yeah. That's what we want to do. So one key point is when you're traveling 10, 12, 14, 16 hours like we did, what you really need to do is try to reset. So whether you do cardio or a full workout in our case, it was really about getting some kind of workout in. So they get to be able to reset your body, get that blood flow, and then be able to really get tired so that you can be able to sleep and reset it to the new time. Because if you don't, you're going to be up all night, and that's going to be a mess. That's still my opinion. You know, yeah, we didn't do any caffeine. That'll coffee. A little bit. I like four or thirty. Four. Yeah, but the point is, try to get that workout in when you get in, especially when you're traveling, or at least in cardio. And now we're going to go to the grocery store, and I'm going to try to find some Persian food. Persian food. There's some pro food. I don't know what's pro food. We're going to have a lot of them, guys. Buffins. All right. You're a peeing baker.
