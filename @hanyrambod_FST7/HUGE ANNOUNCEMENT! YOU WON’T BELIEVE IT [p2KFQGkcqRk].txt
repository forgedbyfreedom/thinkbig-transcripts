So it's time for a workout. We're going to go see Rudy Pinnata, the man. He just got done with work. He got his meal in and now we're going to go and meet him at the gym. And there's a bunch of athletes coming. So it's going to be cool. We'll see who's there. We're going to go see the coach. Three months. Alright. I'm okay. You're going to go for me. No, then we can go. What are you saying? So they're going to go for the shot. How do you remember the shot? It's not the three shots. We were in the week. We're here. We got to go to watch.

All right. So we just did legs with Rudy Pinnona. He ended up doing some leg extensions, leg press, seated hamstring curls. And the guy is strong as a horse. He's 74 years young and he's strong as an ox. Can not believe how much strength and power he has. He really like I've seen him cook a lot of people, including some bro. I am here back at the Pinnona factory in a piro Italy. And it's good to be whole. Let's go. And this here is the Pinnona showroom. I'm sure you've seen it before here and there on some videos that I posted in the past. And now you have all the updated equipment and some stuff in the back that's got some really cool new stuff that is yet to be seen. This is one of the new machines. This is a 3D ad vector machine. So this is one of those I definitely want to try because then it just come out recently. There's a couple of other pieces that I've now in production. I wanted to turn around and try out. But Disneyland. It's called a fantastic one. It's all the change of the things from 19. Is that crazy? This isn't saying. And this one would count reps. That had a robot from way back then. And this is how far back it was. All right guys, we're adding the brand new pieces that came to Pinnona. So we have the super vertical press. So this one is this multi press that you guys have seen us do on our back. Well this one's really nice because it's slightly different angle because you're upright. So definitely wanted to try this and got to try it. Love it. So definitely coming on the list. So I got to make more room Kevin. Something to make more room in the gym. Oh set. The mind muscle condition. My question. My question. Weight is important. But not everything. The important thing is to have enough weight but not too much because you have to use good form. Squeeze. Good form. And form range. Yes, like real. Yeah, full range. Full range. Not short. Not short. No, complete range. Yes. Full range. Yes. And the list. The list. You hear it. Oh, lightweight. Heavy with lots of reps. Yeah, and the different. Yes. One more and the back. How do you say? Remo. Remo. Row. Oh. Pass them one time. How do you say? That list. They list both. Yes. On the gander. Uh huh. All right. Polyway. So three exercises. Two three exercises. Three weight. And then two three exercises. With machine together. And they say. Three say. False. Two working. Okay. Two. Two working. They got it coming. The. The. It was. Effective. Real. Two real. Yeah. One more. And the. Repeat. Repeat. Yeah. Massimo. Fish. Uh huh. Minu. Eight. Eight. To 12. All right. Guys. So one of the machines is coming to the Evision gym is the vertical. Press. Now you guys have seen this one. Before it's on. And now it comes in a vertical form. Again, a little easier to get in and out of. So I'm going to be bringing this in. So I'm putting the shopping list together. All the things I'm putting together for the gym. A bunch of new equipment. So mother pieces. I want to show you guys. All right. Over here. So. You see the power. Smith dual system. I have this as well as the inclined slash vertical version of it. Now there's an updated version. Let's kind of again. And this updated version has two different. Unique pieces to it. One is it's gotten a adjustable. Hand grip. So again, the other one felt a little bit wide, especially for women. Now you have to be able to adjust it narrower. So you have a two position on that. And then the second thing it has is it has a corner balance. So that makes it a bit lighter so that when women are using it, they can feel like they can be able to utilize the machine as well. And it doesn't feel too heavy. So now you have those two different add-ons for the new updated version. So that's also coming to the Evision gym. So I can't wait. Hurry up. Get it in Evision Blue and let's go home. All right. Last but not least, super power squat. So I have a bunch of late press machines. I have a vertical leg press. I have a 45 degree. I've got super leg press. But I do not have a power squat. So be able to work really, really well in terms of being able to hit a different angle on the leg days. So what we're going to do is really focus on bringing in a different piece of machinery to be able to get that. Extra pump that we're looking for. Great machine. That's going to be added to the collection. All right guys. So many of you have seen a lot of my videos. And for several years now, I built out the Evision gym with exclusively Panata machines. I think there's a lot of great equipment out there. There's a lot of great companies out there. But I felt that Panata was the best. And that's why I wrote a check for it. Now, after two years of working with them, I've taken the relationship to a whole other level. We are working together. So I am now officially part of Panata. So there's a lot of things that we're working on. We're going to get ready to announce. And I cannot wait to show with you. Coming soon. I just want to thank Rudy Panata, Edward Panata, Kiyara, the whole Panata team. I really would appreciate all the faith and trust you have in me. And I cannot wait to show all of you around the world. What's coming next? Thank you all.
