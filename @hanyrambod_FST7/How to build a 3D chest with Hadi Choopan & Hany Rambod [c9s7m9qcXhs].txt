Getting ready to hit chest with Mr. Hottie Chopin. Work out number two, day two in the USA. Two scoops of EVP 3D, because it's about 430 in the afternoon. I don't need to stay up. Him on the other hand, he's doing extreme, because he's an extreme kind of guy. We're both using about a half a lid of EVQ. Work out two. Let's go. It's actually really good. I like it because it's got a little sodium bicarbonate. It gives you a little bit of that effort bestance. So, you just gotta keep your finger on the top. It's why it's called PageRip Pop. You're gonna have to do that. You're gonna have to do that. You're gonna have to do that. You're gonna have to do that. You're gonna have to do that. You're gonna have to get afty, huh? Yeah.

When he's in Dubai, he's doing 14 plates on shrugs. And he comes here and asks, he's gonna be in the form. It's gotten way better. Something happens on the flight.

When you go heavier, you want to go to failure, not to fatigue. So, if you're out of shape like me, take your time. If you're in good shape and you want to be almost like a pseudo cardio while you're training, then take the shorter respires. But if you really want to try to work on getting the maximum poundage on those last working sets, take a couple of minutes and between those last working sets. What the money? What the money?
