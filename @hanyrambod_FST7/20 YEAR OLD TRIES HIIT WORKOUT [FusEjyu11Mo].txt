I have actually in the house and he's back in Dallas because he wants to grow he needs to be a bigger so that he can get on stage and now he's going to do two big things work out and eat. So those are really good things. And this leap. Trenty, yes. Of course, sleep is always important. But in Dallas, the special thing is the workouts are a little more special here and the eating is a little bit different. But yeah, so it's going to be a really good workout. We're going to go ahead and blast chest chest. So we got chest today. So again, we're going to give you the play by play. But for those of you that want the exact details of the workout, go check it out on my FST 7-Happ I'm going to give you guys all of the actual breakdowns in the behind the scenes that you will not see on YouTube. So for those of you that keep asking, hey, when can you do some more technical types of breakdowns? Well, that's where it's going to be found on my FST 7-Happ. So check it out on the link below. All right, guys, we're going to do something very special for this chest workout. We're going to actually do only one full-out working set per exercise. So we're going to do three or four warmups, especially your first exercise. You're going to have to really work warm-up properly. Then what you're going to do is we're going to go one all out set. Then after that, you change exercises. So are you ready? Sure? No. Let's do this. Good. Good. There you go. Good. Keep going. Breathe, breathe, breathe. One more. Good. Breathe away. One, 76. Go. Four. Go. Five? Good. Open those hands. We come up. There you go. Set. Stop. Stop. That's it. That was a warm-up. So he thought it was going to be working. I would have probably needed seven or eight more reps to get him to failure. I had to make him stop, because I know we can have more weight. Good at one, 98. All right. Let's go. Go. Go. One, two, good. Three, four, five. Stop. Still two like. Go 231. Good. So again, this is how you can tell whether or not you're actually going to be able to go to failure in that eight to 12-per-up range. When you're hitting four or five, and you know that if you had another four or five left in the tank, and then maybe even a couple of four straps, it's still too light. Stop. Reset. Add two more plates. Add one more plate, and then be able to go through. So you can hit that working set, eight to 12 reps. One, two, open the hands. Stop. Again, there you go. Two seconds. One thousand one, one thousand two, good. Good. Good. One thousand one, one thousand two. Good. All the way. We want to peak contraction, hold it. Two seconds, one, two, good. Now one second hold. One, good. Open your hands. Go. Good. Again, come on. That's it. Let's go. You got four more. Go. Finish it. One. Come on. Two, go three. Come on. All the way down. All the way down. Excellent. Hold it. Good. Hold it. Five seconds. Four, three, two, stretch. That partial is go. Five partial is go. Go. Come on. Lower. Good. Stop. Go. Come on. One, two, hands. Hands. Hands. Three, four, two more. One more. Together, hold it. All day. Together. Together. Squeeze. Hold it. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, good job. That's it. Good. You're angry today. I'm very happy today. Oh, that's good. All right guys. So when you're coach like me, you really get dehydrated from yelling at people all day long. So boom. Again, everybody knows I'm super big on hydration. Many times during the Olympia preps or during the Arnold preps, I'm going out and getting IV bags, whether it's here in Texas or whether it's in Las Vegas, while I'm traveling to try to keep my immune system up. Well, one of the things I did was wanted to create a formula that is precisely able to give me the electrolytes that I need. So not only can I retain the minerals that are necessary for me to be able to function properly throughout my day, but also have my athletes minimize the likelihood of them cramping. So doing a nitropic, throwing, tarring to be able to help as well. And now we have a such a well-rounded formula. I usually have at least two doses a day. So again, two servings a day, one scoop twice a day. And some of you out there who have already tried it, have told me the feedback on the flavor system's been phenomenal. So again, thank you. We're going to be kind of with you to more flavors, but again, you know, little parched from yelling at the axle. So when we blend them, yes, very good. What's your favorite flavor? Lime and lime or strawberry lemonade? No, I think it's strawberry lemonade. Yep, I think I like to lemon lime a little bit better, but because I've had a lot of lemon lime lately, I'm doing some strawberry lime. Cheers. I have this thing. We're going on. Good. Good. You're going to be back? You're glad? Good. Good. Stretch. Stretch. Good. Good. Keep going. Good job. Good feet down. All right, let's go. You're going to make this into a working set right here, that one working set. Two. Good. Full range emotion, full range emotion. And drive excellent. Good. Good. Come on, axle. All the way. Good. Excellent. Drive your feet flat. Good. Good. Keep going, axle. Keep going, buddy. Drive it up. Okay. Now I'm going to help them right there. Now using a good and down nice and slow. Nice and slow. Chin up. Up. Drive. Good. Now good on nice and slow. Good. Up. Right there. Last one. Slow. Slow. Slow. elbows in. Down, down, down, down, down. That's it. Cheechies got on this. Cheechies grind this. That's it. That's a very technical term. All right guys, just a reminder, those black sets that you guys are using. We do a lot of those and the other techniques that I'm using to increase intensity is on the FST7 app. So go check it out. All right. Drive it up. Good. Feed down. Go. It's going to give you a really good stretch. We're doing the flat panata press. It's called super horizontal and multi press when you look it up online. But basically you're able to either do a chest press with it or you can even do a cambered bar type movement with triceps, which is great as well. Good. Coming all the way down. Now the key is to make sure you're getting a really good full range of motion. You're going all the way down. Really deep. Drop the elbows, touching his chest and then driving it back up. Good. Drive. Good. Drive. All the way. All the way. Lock it down. Good. Okay. Working set. You ready? Working set. Let's go. One set. Working set. This is it. Go. This is one working set guys. One.

Go to press the right here, and there, now drive, push down. Come on, that's it. That's it, that's it. That's it. Squeeze that. That's all it. That's it. That's it, he's all. All right, guys. So I did go a little overboard with him this time because his form did fall apart. But the good thing is, that was more of a mental check. Can he do it? I never felt like he was at risk of getting hurt. One thing I would have done is write it down a little lighter if I was going to go into a press after the fly. But again, this particular workout was about one set to failure. And I felt like he did just that, one set to failure. I am Kierta. I like. Chichis, we grande, I like. I didn't get that. I like. All right, guys, we just finished up at Chis workout, high intensity, mic, mensor style. We tried to go to one specific set to failure. Again, not including the warmups, we still got a warmup. But we did that one set to failure. We did several different exercises. And then we did some posing at the very end. How was it? It was amazing. One set and I did. Isn't it too much? But I feel it better because he's more difficult. You know? Yeah. Part of him men on the four sets for a workout. For a walk. Yeah. For a walking set. So again, what you're trying to do is make sure you're fully warmed up. Go for full range of motion. Get peak contraction, especially if you have your workout partner helping you on those positives. So the last two or three, you're just going to slow in the eccentric, which is kind of being able to do that extra negative, is going to take so much. Taking so much further. So focus on full range of motion. Focus on being able to have someone with you to be able to help you with those extra reps at the very end and make sure you stay on top of your form. So honey, Rambot, here with the actual. We're just over six weeks out from the Olympia.
