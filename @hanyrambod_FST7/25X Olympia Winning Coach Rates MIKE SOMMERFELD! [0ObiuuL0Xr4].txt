Welcome back to Rate Your Fizique. This is honey ram bod 25 time Olympia winning coach and today on deck We have none other than the second place in the 2024 Mr. Olympia men's classic physique division Mike Summerfeld so another German looks like the Germans are definitely moving up in the ranks here at the Mr. Olympia classic division you had irres and third and we had Mike in Second place so a lot of you went on to social and Tag me and said please rate Mike you also went into the comment section So before you do anything make sure you turn on your subscribe button Make sure you turn on your notification and I want to know in the comments who you'd like to see next on the next rate your physique But on to Mike the badass so now we're gonna go ahead and start with the first pose the front double biceps So Mike Has an amazing X frame here look at that X frame it literally is a capital X He's got great great with great quads Great arms looks very very impressive So as we're turning around and looking at his shoulder with here that is another very very strong point in his physique and If you notice how narrow that waist is right there So the Mike Criticism out there is that he's starting to look too much like a regular bodybuilder and not like a classic physique bodybuilder I can see how some people would end up coming up to that conclusion I don't agree with it not yet now if he does get bigger and thicker could he lose some of the classic lines? Absolutely and we're gonna see here in the next several days What he's gonna look like at the Arnold classic but I do feel that he can control that by being able to make sure that He maintains a smaller physique and not trying to get full blown with just bigger Especially in this class isn't always better So again, this is not open. This is not too 12. This is classic bodybuilding So we want to be able to make sure that we're really really emphasizing that amazing X frame And again, this is all green because look at how great his lats are Look at that lat that big V taper looks awesome right now We're gonna go ahead and move to the lower body That great quad sweep so we have that vassus ladder allus the vassus media allus We have the sartorious all through here we're getting some really really good detail and once again I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys how great that X frame is we're going all the way now This is starting to look like Google Maps here, but what I want to show you guys is that this quad sweep Really fits nicely with that upper body Many bodybuilders have this great upper V taper But then they lose it when it comes to the lower body Mike has got both Angles dialed in from the upper as well as a lower Caves look great what I like to see a little bit more solius just a little bit more But again, I'm snipicking. This is the number two guy in the world So I would work a little bit more on that continue to keep growing the calves because his legs are so Big they do make his calves look just a little bit small because of the fact that he's so big in the quads And he's so quad dominant there. So continue to keep not that he doesn't have calves everybody He does all right now. What can he improve on? So let's go ahead. We're gonna go backwards here clean everything up and on the improvement scale his arms are full, but if he can continue to work on just really Supernating the wrist if you notice he's not supernating his wrist here And if he's not doing it here He's probably not doing it as much on his training as he needs to so doing a lot of curls with that really good Supernated wrist position are going to really help try to build up as much peak as possible Peak has a lot to do with genetics the Ronic home and peak you can't get that by adjusting how you're curling something But when you have full arms like he does you want to just really concentrate on making sure that you're doing Bicep curls with Turning that wrist so whether you're doing standing dumbbell curls or if you're using a machine curl You want to just make sure that you're really Supernating the wrist as much as possible so that you can try to continue to build up as much peak as you possibly can So that would help quite a bit in his overall look and again We're really nitpicking here guys, so but looks fantastic Also what I like to see is just a little bit more depth in the chest on that front double just a little thickerness a little more thickness But again looks absolutely phenomenal everything was on point and again This is number two in the world so we're really nitpicking but if you can get a little bit more of that arm peak And a little bit more upper chest and for the upper chest Continue with doing Incline dumbbell presses. I'm a huge believer in that or even incline machine presses or Smith machine incline presses. I think will help continue to build up that physique to be able to become number one in the world So again, he's in an amazing job and we're gonna go on to the next post and don't forget to make sure you let me know Who you want to see on the next episode of rate your physique? All right guys before we go into the next pose I do want to announce that we have just dropped a brand new flavor of I subject at eveginutrition.com For those of you that love eveginutrition especially the I subject You guys all know that I tirelessly work on flavor systems not only is it easily digestible But it always tastes amazing so the latest flavor I want to share with you guys is Chocolate Peanut butter banana. That's right guys chocolate peanut butter banana because those are the three favorite flavors I had growing up when I was making protein shakes So if you hadn't tried I subject yet Definitely give it a try the digestibility is next level and the taste is from out of this world So go ahead and give it a try and let me know what you think use code honey YT that's right my first name YT to be able to get 10% off at eveginutrition.com now back to rate your physique now what we're looking at is a side chest I want to go straight to those huge quads Do you see how full they look that looks awesome awesome right in there? That looks you got that full look, but it's also grainy So you had that conditioning to match the size which is always which are looking for you're seeing the group glutes Dryations here that looks fantastic really really nice hamstring drop Lot of great conditioning in his calves So again the detail is on point Right here the bicep looks awesome on the side chest again Just because I got to find something wrong a little bit even a little more on the triceps Can be there just a little bit more but again. I'm nitpicking here people Chest looks nice and full so I feel like I said you can always use a little bit more upper chest But he is chest looks fantastic, but what I will say here Similar to hers These guys are not twisting enough. I feel like he could use a little bit more rotation now I'm going to have some suggestions on the posing especially when it comes to the upper body here So what we want to do is we want to be able to rotate so as we're rotating this way We want to be able to show maximum shoulder width So his left shoulder could actually be seeing more if he twists just a tiny bit more and Then make sure to blow out through the midsection to try to really show that X frame from the side Again, this is something that was critical about with hers same thing here just wants to twist just a tiny bit more Get the shoulder squared up so you can get maximum width because that you see the width that's happening here that width here looks fantastic, but this can be accentuated even further by twisting his upper body Now we're moving on to back double biceps pose and this is a huge highlight of Mike's physique Number one you're looking at his glutes right? The glutes are completely etched in super-striated looks really really good the back great great V-taper so he's looking very very full through his back So you have everything from that upper lat all the way into that lower back is super tight All of that looks amazing great separation and it's gonna continue to get better as he ages and he gets more muscle maturity The biceps to arms the arms look really nice and full and like I said I think that if he can just work a little bit more on the peak and again guys Being nitpicky here, but if you can do that I think it's gonna show off even more detail So doing that is gonna make a huge difference and just by looking at his wrists I can turn around and tell that part of it's just part of it is his posing if you just supinates that wrist back a little bit And is able to get his chest up you'll see even more detail in that bicep peak now as we come down to his lower body Great thigh sweep Outside thigh sweep again looks like he might have led up on his calves where he didn't stick the pose or he might have stuck to it for a few seconds And then when the photo was taken he relaxed but you can tell it's all there the conditioning the fullness everything looks great hamstrings could be just a tiny bit We're gonna go ahead and I'm gonna give that a little bit of a red and That's just a little bit more detail through here just a tiny bit and If we can have that I think you're really getting closer perfection here guys This is of outstanding shot very very dominant for him and I feel like he holds his poses Really really well on his backside and you can just see he's got those glutes clenched hamstrings are really squeezing and What he just needs to do is just build up a little bit more of the adductor area and just get a little bit more detail But it's so close guys. I mean, I'm just finding things here to critique But he looks absolutely amazing on the back double bicep where I would say if he was working on trying to build up the hamstrings a bit more Again making sure that when you're doing your lake curls Being able to really really go full range of motion, but also I'm a big believer in contracting at the very top Pauzing in that contracted point just to be able to get a little bit more detail and that's what I feel really helps with detail So lying lake curls seated lake curls and then really sticking that midpoint of that rep So that all the way down on the contracted portion of the rep you're holding it for that one to two second pause Before you go full range of motion all the way up and then finishing up with some partials But doing that I think is going to help build build that hamstring area up even more on that backside But looks fantastic now it's time to rate Mike's physique what do I give him in the overall number of sandals from one to ten ten being absolutely perfection I give Mike a nine point two. That's right. He's been the highest rated physique that I have critiqued to this date And I feel like it's shown by his placing He's just knocking on the Olympia door and he's just a couple of days out from trying to win the Arnold classic 2025 so again best of luck to him and his team I'm really looking forward to seeing him up on stage and seeing what he brings but again Absolutely phenomenal so congratulations into him and again do not forget Like subscribe Turn on the bell notification and don't forget to make sure you let me know who you want to see on the next episode of Rate your physique
