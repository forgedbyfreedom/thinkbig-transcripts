I'm here with none other than the man himself, the child boy Wonder. It's still like the big baby because all you guys have seen the leg extension video from almost like eight years ago where it's probably gotten maybe like a hundred million views if you add up all the different sites that I'm still sore from the workout. For me years ago, that's it. But we're here in Dubai. So again, a little bit of a reunion Andre hit me up beforehand and said, let's get a workout session in and he is getting ready for the Romanian pro. So first of all, congratulations on the seventh place, right? Seven places. Seven place finish. I know the goal was to try to beat his original top five. But again, the lineup is even tougher now. So again, it's just every year. Every year, it just keeps getting tougher and tougher. It's not a top of that. It's like three years, though. Yes. Yes. And he had three years off and I use both to do classic. So let me know in the comments below that whether or not he should have done classic. I still think he should have done classic with this kind of physique. But ultimately with men's physique, three years off coming back, he's hitting seventh place in the world. Amazing. So good job to you and step on. Now you guys are a great, great job. And now we're here in Dubai. How are you feeling, brother? How's it? How's it been since the Olympia? It's a little different because taking so much time off. I feel amazing. I feel like I got the fire back. It's been a lot of the three years of the last few years. I've been traveling, partying, and stuff. Now I kind of got the fire back and motivation to I need even. To be honest, my goal for Olympia was to be in the first pullout. Yes. So I'm so excited because this was one of the hardest line ups, especially for me. So we've already for Olympia champions. Right. Yes. So we've already beat up gold and now the gold is to win a Romanian show. Yeah, my home country and qualify for the next year. I saw Olympia. So Romania is very close to my heart because that was this first show ever that we worked together. So that was amazing. We did our pro debut there. I think you went like 200 bucks. You know, we just spent on foot. You know, it was like, you know, it was like, you know, it was pro debut. You went qualifies for the Olympia his first year. The first time we did a show together. And it was amazing result. So again, I think you're going to look amazing because I've seen some of the videos. We're going to do shoulders today because he's got shoulder day to day. He's getting a little bit like getting over a little jet lag, right? Jet lag, yeah. I literally just been a week since I got back from big ass and the time difference, like Joe Bowers from Dubai to Las Vegas on to trying to get back into my team in routine. And it's been hard to be honest. I've been tipping the last week or so like three for hours and I'm not from painting a meal getting done. And we can only have two or three of the stuff. And then we kind of need to relax a little bit. Yes, yeah. So again, sleep super important. It's going to pick your body dryer and you'll be able to continue to get leaner. If you could have a lack of sleep, you're going to definitely have issues with drying out. So again, he's going to have to reset. We talked a little bit a little bit earlier today. Giving him some tips on how to be able to get some really good sleep so that it allows his body to kind of just dry out again. Because again, when you have high cortisol and low sleep, you're going to realize how much more water you get. And sleep. Yeah, yeah, you get a washed out look, right? So these are all things that are normal, especially when you travel 15 hours back from the states like he did. And now he's trying to reset and be able to get past all of the different types of, you know, basically jet lag. So right now, again, good hard workout, but he's at the booth all day today. So it was a crazy, crazy day today for everyone. And now we're going to get a good shoulder workout in. I was trying to get him to do legs, but he said no, he said he's still sore from eight years ago. No, this time. But let me know in the comments below if we should do legs. Because I know a lot of people ask me all the time when the video's out there about legs, right? No, we would have to do legs at some point. Yes. But no right now. Yeah, maybe we do it together. I would put you for my legs. Yeah. I don't think I'll say that. Let's go hit on. So we'll definitely go to do it. You ready? Let's do it, bro. So what we're doing now is obviously he's warmed up lateral head. Then we're doing the front head. We're going to do then posterior. Now the other thing that's really important is the fact that this here, what I've noticed about his physique is that taking those three years off, especially focusing on not getting his arms. That's literally what he had to do. Make the body part smaller to be more competitive because his arms were taking over so much. And again, I'm a kind of guy that I was hoping that he was going to go classic. So we kept his arms a little fuller. But now that he's focusing really on just solely men's physique, his arms had come down, which is better for that class. Again, I think he's got a great upper body classic physique. This leg's, he's more legs. Maybe one more run at the classic, bro. Come on. One day I was going to try and hit myself after I was 35 or 40 years old in the after I went to Romania showing two weeks. The plan is to actually focus on my legs. They've been improving, but because I didn't kind of like the proposes, you know, extra calories and stuff. That didn't train properly, they said I want to really focus on legs. Yeah, you come to Texas and then you get a little barbecue and then we're going to head and we'll train legs. We'll go in there and my gym. My gym. Like all times, we're going to do like a one second pause at the top and then we'll come down, start just to give it really good focus, archer back. Yeah, there you go. Hands in front, hands in front. There you go. Now get your lats out. There you go. Shores up. Bend the elbows a little more. There you go. Shores up a little higher. Like that. Now go out and turn. That's better. Good. Excellent. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. So if you notice what we're doing is we're really trying to focus on that lateral head. Elbow is slightly bent. You do not want to straighten out your arm for that. You want it slightly bent. You want to pull up with your pinky and twist slightly. Just like you're pouring a pitcher of iced tea at the very top. Andre's always had amazing shoulders, but now they're actually as he's getting more muscle maturity because he's almost 40. No, I'm just kidding. He's almost 30. Go. Two more. Two. One more. One more. Go. Now twist one more and twist your wrist even more and go out farther. Good. Slow. Good. Joulemur. One more. Go. Hold it. Good job. There you go. The way he counts. You say it's too much. Yeah, double your six more. Yeah. The Persians are Romanian to have exchange rate. The exchange rate is one American rep is equivalent to 10 Romanian reps. It's right. It's Gypsy counting. It's Gypsy counting. One for you, 10 for me. That's it. Good. Good. Only one sitting there. I'm actually getting more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Again, we're not going to kill the volume because what we want to do is we want to stimulate and then we want to be able to go right into recovery phase. So what does that mean? That means we're going to spend about 45 minutes doing this workout. That's it. 45 minutes. Because we want to be able to really focus on the deltoids and then we want to be able to get him food another meal and then to bed. So that way we can reset because he hasn't had that rest that you need. And remember, you don't grow on the gym. You grow outside of the gym and while you're sleeping. Really important. Good. There you go. Good. Down slightly. Straight right there. Chest up. Good. Good. Good. Really good delcap. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Perfect. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Out. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Up. Two more. Up. Good. Now right there. So now only your left side. Go. One. Two. Three. Good. Now rest for a second. Now we go together. Chest up. Chest up. Now together. Go. One. One more. Good job. Good job. All right. So we did there's he has a little bit of asymmetry. He's had it for a while, right? From a shoulder injury a long, long time ago. So what we're doing is we're trying to get his left shoulder to catch up to his right shoulder. I'm sure he hasn't been doing much. Oh, yeah. And we used to. We used to. So again, just trying to remind him because that's the strong shoulders is right. So we want to get that left shoulder to really fire to be able to catch up. So we're doing his extra reps on that left side. So again, remember if you had that asymmetry, focus on the weight of the weaker side at the end and then we'll throw is we're going to end up doing an extra set of just the weaker side. Yeah, put your hands on your hips. Stand right there in the light in the middle. Good. Good. There you go. shoulder caps. There you go. Now really focus on your left shoulder first then set the right shoulder. That's better. That's better. Good. Good. Squeeze right there. There. Hold it. Hold it. Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. Good job. So for those of you that want to know how to get really deep striations, it's about that mind muscle connection flexing is going to help that tremendously. Many bodybuilders now are so lazy they do not focus on flexing and posing. That's why the detail isn't there because pure laziness. The more you flex, the more you do those flex sets, the more you're going to have separation, the more you're going to have those muscle insertions to really pop. You're going to have deeper, deeper separation that makes that more impressive, grainy look that a lot of those physique have gotten away from just because they're not spending enough time posing. Watching you guys could be in this bottom action learning from you. You're not so cool. You're not. Because I never. I'm one of these lazy bodybuilders like you fucking go follow me. No, but when we're together you follow me. Yeah, when we're together. When we're not seeing you, we're not seeing you. Well, even doing it, you were doing it for years. But you got away from it a little bit. But I still see you doing it. But not as much. Yeah, but I still see you do it. You know? Yes, last set. We're going to do one more set. Last set. Let's go. Okay. Good. Perfect. Right there. Good. Good. Keep that eye on that left shoulder. Boom. Good. Good. Good. Good job. Good job, Andre. Good job. Excellent. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Turn that left for us, too. Boom. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Now just the left. Just the left. Two reps. One. Two. One more now. A little higher. That's it slow. Slow. Now together. Finish it. Good. One. Two. Good. Good. That's it. Good. Good. Good. One more like that. Go. Down slow. Down slow. Good job. There you go. There you go. Okay, there you go. So boys and girls, what you want to do is you want to be able to get in that flex set, but you also want to be able to get negative. So the negatives are going to be able to help because now you're going to take your body to the complete exhaustion failure that we're looking for. Don't go to fatigue. If you're looking to break plateaus, go to failure. If you have a good workout partner, they're going to work that through you. You can watch many of my videos for in the last 20 years and we've done these flex sets, but we've also done those four straps at the very end. And again, it's been a minute since I did them with Andre, but it's something that you should definitely put into your programs. So, all right. Up. Now squeeze, chest all the weight up or up or pecs. Squeeze that. Or up in your bats better. Squeeze that. Five second hold. Five, four, three, three seconds. Two seconds. There you go right there, right there, right there. One more, one more, one more. Good job. That's it. Yeah. Good set. Yeah. I'm shitting me. I'm almost ready for some of this. I'm just going to catch his breath right now. Stay hydrated again. Do by heat. It doesn't matter what month it is here. It's still dry. It's hot right now. Usually in the summer, believe it or not, it's actually hot and humid here. But right now, you're just constantly not able to drink because when you're at the booth, you can't take bathroom breaks every 30 minutes like you could when you're at home. So now you got to reel to make up for that last time by adding in much, much more fluids. So he's doing that right now as we speak, electrolytes, making sure that you're getting all of the different amino acids to help you with recovery. Now we're going to take a few like about two minutes rest before we go into a shoulder press. We're going to go into a machine shoulder press and we're going to be able to really, really blast some heavier weights and we're going to do about two working sets. It's a good time getting back together with Andre. Again, as many you know, I don't have a lot of clients all through the 30 years plus that I've been coaching people. It's been something where we built such a bond and relationship way above and beyond competing. That's one of the reasons why we are still so close because whether it's about family, whether it's business, whether it's friendships, whether it's just basically shooting the shit. It's one of those things that we were able to do. Andre was like my little brother and it was always really, really good to be able to have somebody who not just appreciates you but also has always been respectful towards your craft and your time. And that's one of the reasons why I really love being able to spend as much time as I can whenever I do have time to be able to see him at these events because it's such a good vibe. It's just always positive vibes. Like I like why it's enough to be grateful to have me to be able to be one of the lucky guys to be able to be trained by you. But not only do I have this kind of connection because even though we don't work together enough we always keep in the one thought we always get whenever we together in the same conscious things we always get together. Yeah, that's a big drink. It's always a good time. Let's go. Okay. Feet flat. There you go right there. Pressure. Good. Elbow is forward a little bit right there. There you go. A little deeper down. A little deeper down. Good. Okay. A little deeper. Good. There you go. Good. Good. Down, down, down. Perfect. Good. Good. Good. Good. Two more. Good. Good job. Nice and slow. Perfect. Good. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. So again. So what are we trying to do here? What we're doing is we're going full range of motion without losing your the tension. So if you go all the way down and you relax the muscle, that's when you've gone too far. You want to be able to go right before. So just get that range of motion so that you go right above the stopping point and then all the way up. 10 to 15 reps for the first set, second set, a little less. And then when you start going into your third set, which should be your first working set, right about there, then we can be able to go down into that eight to ten reps range. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Notice how he's pushing off of his legs, keeping the core tight. All the way down. He's dropping his elbows before you right beneath the wrists, which is perfect. You don't want to drive too far forward or too far back. You want to be below the wrist and you're driving right up with full power. Good. One more. Good job. That's it. Now we're going to go ahead and rest and then we're going to go into that really good working set. What do you think you want to try to do a dime on top of this? Another ten? Yeah. Okay. Time to work. You ready? Okay. Push with the legs, core tight and drive. There you go. Good. Good. Two. Come on Andre. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Okay. Come on. One. One. Six. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Don't stop. Good. Good. Good. Drive it. Good. Good. Good. Two. Two. Two. Two. One more. One more. One more. One more. OK. Make our slow. Slow. Slow. Good. Good job. Now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and rest 90 seconds, a minute and a half, two minutes, then get the second working set. But on that set what we're going to do is we're going to go into one of our previous grips that we used to use all the time, which is the neutral grip. So that way we can work a slightly different portion of that shoulder. Really important to change up the grips whenever you're doing some kind of press, whether it's inclined, presses on dumbbells, using up a change up of grip will change a lot of where you feel that tension in the muscle. So again we're going to wait about 90 seconds through it two minutes, then we're going to do the final working set using the different grip. There you go. Control. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep that. There you go. Keep the tempo. Good. Keep it going. Keep it going. Go. Good. Now we're going one more, one more. Up, up, up higher. Now slow. Now I'm going to help him with a positive. Up. Now we need to slow. We got one more just like that. Come on. Right there. Slow. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. There you go. Good. Good. Good job. There you go. All right. Let me see your most muscular right there. That's it. Squeeze. Good. Now hold that. You got seven seconds on that one. Squeeze. Chin up. Chin up. Chin up. Squeeze. Upper chest. Super pumped. He's got his deltoys that are popping. Loss of good fibers. Loss of good separation. You can see the delt all the way into the upper pack. I'll hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Three seconds. Two. Good. There you go. So guys, again, I go over all of these techniques on my app. I've been updating my app every week on the FST7 app. So if you want access to my workouts, go to honeyrambaud.com, check it out. Been doing updates all the time and who knows? I might get him to be able to come in and do a couple workouts on me. I'll throw some of that exclusive content up there when he comes out to Dallas. Next year. I'll be right there. So I'll be right there. Yeah. Where's Lixation? That one is going to be Lixion. What do you guys? You're hearty, right? There you go. Exalted. That's it. That's the proof. Yeah. It's on the camera guys. That's it. Otherwise, I'm going to take his IFBB profile. And I'll give it to one of you viewers. When are you subscribers? Make sure you like and subscribe. And don't forget to share. A lot of people think that this is just a workout is going to create the Andre workout. You've got to have good genetics to start with. But it's also what you do with your genetics. It's really important that you focus on being able to utilize your genetics to its full capability. And what that means is that you really focus on number one being consistent. Number two, using the right bio mechanics. Number three, the right nutrition. And number four, the right amount of rest. So you can grow. Just remember when do you grow not in the gym, but outside of the gym. So when you put all those things together and you maximize your genetics, you end up looking like that. Well, it's because of your, no, no, I just hope I helped you. But mom and dad first, second, you wanting to be able to proof yourself and others, what you're capable of. You know, because that's the coachability aspect that you've got to have. Being in the gym, you can have the good genetics by if you don't have somebody to teach you. Sure. You got to have a good mindset. You need things. Right. Then you just waste a bit of your needs. That's true. I do. Yeah. There you go. Looking sick, bro. Looking sick. That's it. Good. Good. Good. Good. There you go. Good. Drive it up. And then control it on the way down. Excellent. Good. Then to raise a little more. Bend over a little. Right there. And then now drive it up. Good. Perfect. That's what we're trying to focus on right there. So again, by being able to just lean forward a little bit, we're going to be able to really see the human anatomy chart that he's creating right now. Being two weeks out. Squeeze. Good. Good. Again. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Two more. Two more. One more. A little higher. Come on, Andre. Up there. That's better slow. Slow. Last one. Last one. Up. Slow. Control. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's it. That's it. Right there. Good. Do you have front relaxed? Okay. No. Do you have fucking bodybuilding? But that's it. That's it. Well, that's it. Boom. That's it. Now let's see it front total by set. No, no, no. I want you to do the way I shot you. Shoulders out. Squeeze your chest. Together hands crossed. And then now go into that slow into that front total by set. Good. Now twist that by set and show me your peaks. Give me those Arnold peaks that you have. Perfect. Hold that. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Oh, that's better. Good. I think we should try classic. That's it man. Lastic. Yeah. Yes. Classic. No. Coca-Cola classic. Coca-Cola classic. So for all you lovely ladies out there that are well. We're asking whether or not he's going to be able to wash his own head. He will not. So you can volunteer. We'll go ahead and go to the phone number below. 100 get Andre. Wait. 100 get Andre. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Focus. Good. Good. Good. Good. Got. Right there. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on here. Good. You can see all that diesel right now. Good. Oh, good. Focus. Focus. Look at that. Drive. Oh. We use good job. Go Andre. Good. Good. Little higher. You got this. Good. That's it. 33. One. Oh. Okay. We're going to go old school now. Okay. Fire parcels from the bottom. Half way to the top to my hand. Let's go. Come on. Five. Five. Go. Four. Higher. Three. Two. Two. One more. Up slow. That's it. Good job. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Right in the mirror. Side chest. Good. There you go. Set up those legs. Good. Okay. Good. Right there. Squeeze that. Twist. Right there. Good. Back. Twist that shoulders. Good. Twist your shoulders. More. Pull that. Hold that. Hold that. Hold that. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Good. Relax. Good. Catch a breath. Now we're in the other side. Good. Come on. You got this. Come on. Come on. Let's go brother. Let's go. You got this. Come on. Good. There you go. Good. Right there. Right there. Hold that. Hold it. Delt. To pack. To tell. Hold that. Five. Four. Three. Two. Good job. Good job. Good. All right guys. So we're doing rear delts here. Now we're going to do is we're focusing on that rear delt by keeping the pinkies up. Now you have a palm down position and then a pinky up position. The main difference between the two is that the pinky up position tends to feel much more isolating when it comes to being able to focus really on that rear delt. They both hit rear delt. You tend to go heavier. Be able to go heavier with the palm spacing downward. I recommend doing both. But specifically for Andre, where we're going to do right now is focus specifically on that red delts. So I'm going to pinky up for all the sets today. Good. And you definitely can't go as heavy with pinkies up. Three. Good. And he knows he's not swinging and he's not just letting go of the tension. He's keeping tension on the eccentric. As well as really concentrating on concentric motion, which is on the way up. Good job. Can you get your ass? Can you get your ass? We're going to do our final set here. Again, we're just going to really polish off these rear delts focusing on that rear delt with a pinky up position. Keeping it at 8 kilograms, so it's just over 16 pounds. You don't need a lot of weight. Just need to be able to really focus on that mind muscle connection and keep that eccentric on that way down by not swinging. Good. Good. So right in here. Good. Keep going. Come on Andre. Good. Now, I'm going to do some extra reps. Right when he ends up going to failure, we're going to end up doing three extra harshles at the very bottom. Go. Go. Good. Now we're going to start our partial scope. Half way up. One. A little higher. Two. Three. Two more. Two more. Come on. Just like old times. Two. Two. One more. One more. Good job. One more. One more equals five. That's it. Colin, thank you. Yes. Yes. We're doing, uh, we're doing Durham to E.S. dollar conversion rate. Three point six. That's it. Let's get one last set of flexing right there. Let's see it. Let's see a front last spread. This is one of my favorites on Andre that he never does. He only seems to do this one with me. So it's okay. I'm sure. Yeah. Okay. We're going to go right in there. Archer back. Archer back. And then we're going to pull out shoulders up. Shoulders up. Shoulders up. Boom. Right there. Hold that. Hold that. Hold that. Hold that. Now squeeze the chest now. Squeeze the chest. There you go. Good. You're seeing the lot. You're seeing the delts. You got the arm pop where you have bicep tricep. You have the breakie allus. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Four seconds. Good job. Woo! That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Well, work out courtesy. We've also got Toby in the house owner of the locker right over there. Toby. Thank you, brother. We appreciate it. You're giving us an amazing gym. If you guys are in Dubai. Make sure you stop by. Get a day pass. It's absolutely worth it. Great vibe. You don't have the riff raft. You don't have as many people out there with all the tri-pods getting knocked over and all the other bullshit. Again, I'm allergic to that shit. But he did a great job building up this gym. What year did you open up the gym, Toby? Five months ago. It's not even been a year. I'm over here real quick. I want you to say hi to everybody. Toby's the owner of the locker. Thank you so much, brother, for allowing us to do. I'm not sure to have you go through here. No. We opened just five months ago. The lighting looks phenomenal. You did every light by yourself. Yes, no. You did absolutely phenomenal job on it. Also, like I said, just not too busy. Some of the gyms have gotten way out of character because things look like a damn big as nightclub. I love the fact that you can focus on the physique, focus on your training and not focus on the lighting and feeling like you're going to go into a seizure because you have going on in the background. So again, great job on the gym, brother. Yes, yeah. I can buy it. Stop buying it, see you on the gym.
