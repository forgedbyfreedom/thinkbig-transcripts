You're right. You look good. Just checking on the man. The man. Ask a person to say, they're giving me shit that doesn't mean that line's taking place. I'm just calling him coming on my head. Oh, we're coming on the head. You're all right. You're good. You're good. You're good. I'm good. I'm good. I thought you probably entered that point. You were like, what are you like tonight? Oh. No, no, no. You're good. Oh. Yeah. Do you have time to be no shrimp down my boy to go to the end? Yes. All right. You're trying to get me. I'm going to tell you. I'm going to show my legs, though. All right. Good. We've got a reindeer for Seek. Are you going to show? Am I doing a show? Yeah. I'm being off season right now. We're doing an off season like the butcher name. It's that. Yeah. That was that kid and where are you from? Originally he has to Pennsylvania but originally Virginia now. Yeah. Okay, yeah, right, I think like if you do the 228 last time, I'm 276 right now. Did you get to get a couple of photos? Yeah, with this front door by the set. There's a waiting way to go back. Put your elbows forward, more, more, more, more, more. There you go, much better, much better. You sit, chest. Good, good, back double. Good, elbows forward a little bit. Down a little bit. The left one a little more down. There you go, good. Good, you got to build a little bit of cemetery on your left side versus your right. Yeah, yeah, but you got turned back around. So the front, to the front, go to the front. And just do a much more good. Did you carry your pack or what's going on? You don't carry it in your rear. Yeah, this is gonna be a good. Good, good. All right, so you gotta continue to work on upper chest, bounce it out. And because also that pet there, you try to bounce up the look of the pet there. You got one wrap that's bigger than the other. You gotta work on that asymmetry. Then you gotta make sure that you're winding your arms because you gotta be able to hit more by separate the Alice. So again, hammered pearls and also making sure you're doing like spider curls. Anything that's gonna be able to also be able to widen that arm is gonna go along the way. But yeah, you can scrape down and leg the leg so it'll just make sure you get a more wrapped. Thank you, yeah. All right, let's see if I can do it. He's actually my client. So that's okay. See if you can do it too. All right. Good. Better. Thank you. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. On this. You gotta go. You're going to wind her here. Work on the rear belt. Work on the upper chest. Quad hamstring with good. Back. Don't lean back so much. You're leaning back too much. There you go. Right there. Bring your elbows up. No, no, no, no. Not that way. Good. Good. There's much less going. Good. Yeah, just keep working on your arms, upper chest. Your back is good, but just continue to get stronger. And as you get leaner, just really work on making sure your legs are separate. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to do it all the way. You're going to do it all the way. Yeah. My last show. My legs were the last thing to come out. Like three weeks out to one week out. It's like everything came off from here. Like my whole upper body gets ready like six weeks out. But this here, that takes the longest to go. Yeah. It's like a bad thing to stay like. Yeah. Like a photo. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. You really need to work on your rear. You're rear delts probably one of the weakest parts of your body. So a lot of bent over lateral raises. You can really work on. Also front raises on that front belt. You can build a lot. You can make sure you're doing it. But make sure that you're also doing it maybe on a spider bench. You can do that or even do it on cables. Now, are you like coming straight or are you going to bring it up? Oh. You want to be able to be stuck on that. But you also want to be able to do one of those sets of two sets of two sets of that. Because that's all. And, but also, like it said. Make sure you do it on like a 45 different angle like on an inclined boundary. And then, you can be able to do that to the city. You'll get like different range of motion that's got a different tension point. So, more tensions throughout the range of motion. So, you can do that. And also. You can also set up a bench and then have cables. Yeah. So, you're using cable Dass mention. You can either use a rope or an Allen train and then downgrade the post potential at the wall. That's right. That'd be really good for the shoulder. Let's go back to the next one. Alright, we're going to need to continue to be... Hit your back. So, again, doing rows, doing low cable rows, making sure you're changing grip variations, so you're not using the same grip. Pulled-out. Make sure you don't just do overhand pull-down, so that it'll, like, pull-up. Make sure you do over-pour. Make sure you're also with a few bar, so you can change the grip. Because that will hit the... Yes, that's going to hit all the different areas. So, when I look at your body, I think you kind of go into a kind of... ...like kind of doing the same side of things. Yeah. So, you need to change your variation. That's what I'm just looking at you. I go, okay. Definitely makes up the variation because you're going to get broke. I think you have a great physique, but I think that you don't have... ...and all the studios you need, you're able to break the plateau because you need more variation. Okay. Perfect. Yeah. That's not the same stuff. That's a tough one. Okay. I think it's a really good one. I get it. That's it. Right. Oh. Yeah. Oh, and then the other thing you do is when you're going heavy, the shoulder press is ...go heavy. Eight cent reps would be careful that when you're doing ladder raises, but you're not ...putting your traps into it because if you break too much crap into it, you're not going to hit your ladder. So slow down and hard to exceed it when you're doing your... ...should be here at the middle of ladder raises, and you'll see if it doesn't. Yeah. I was going to ask you, um... ...why do you have a lot of weights? I don't have to decide. I'm going to mount my foot. No, I'm going to decide. I'm going to decide and then like, like you're pouring a bit of a bit of a icy. So I'm going to go in here and then you're going to mount right. You should be right and then roll it through left. Perfect. All right. I'll make a shift. Yeah. Yeah. Get a good pump and tap in. Oh, right. So I wanted to like, just suggestions. Okay. So hamstrings are not really there. But my back is just... Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I wanted to buy some. Just go to the safe. So good hamstring tie-in. So one of the things that works really, really well for that are actually... ...going getting on the step-known and doing step-known. So for hard-known, I abuse that machine. Yeah. So if that would be really, really good. And then also the other thing is that you've got to really... ...like it's like almost two different types of bodies, right? Yeah. So what you're going to have to do is... ...on an athlete's. Yeah. So you're going to do it in hard-known. Also doing a little bit of sprints. We'll also help you as well. I've noticed that. Yeah. Like a pole is like right underneath, like right right at the top of your hamstring. Right. And then exercise wise in the gym. Full gerryz blitz blitz blitz, walking lunges. Making sure that it's a hard stuff. Yes. Exactly. That's...when you do that, you'll start to see the match-up between upper body and lower body in terms of condition. Because this looks awesome. This just needs a little more help to catch out the issue. But it looks great. Yeah. Where's the front? Huh? Where's the pictures in front? You know what I see there. I don't want to see the front. The must be his knockout shot. You want to show his knockout shot. I'm skinny. You got a little front, lat. Okay. Oh, it looks good, man. It's really good. 18. Yeah. Now, it's great. Just continue to bring in the legs, but you got really good legs for being 18 and being as tall as you are. Because you're about over six feet. Yeah. I showed Chris the mirror. He's like, he didn't stick with it. I'm not a scholarship. I have what he's doing for a loss. That's why I got the legs. That's why I'm very much like, I would say. I'll be 23 when I graduate. I'm right back on his head. Yeah, that's pretty much pretty nice. You have a drum, a little bit. There you go. Right there. Don't slap your foot off of your bike set. Like that. There you go. That's better. You're such a chef. Such a chef. So you're collapsing it? You've just got a very young. That's better. Good. You've working your upper chest and you're aware of that. So that you can go with it and go more with it. Okay. Back to the license. Good. Chest up. There you go. Bring your elbows down. Bring your elbows a little bit towards me. Right there. That's too much. That's too much. Right there. You're strong. It's body part. It's your back. It's your back. Thank you. Just continue to keep working on it. You always get to have to do a little bit of a good job. Okay. That's a good one on you. Keep working on it. Thank you, sir. That's an honor. Yeah. Great. Come from you. Thank you. Keep going.
