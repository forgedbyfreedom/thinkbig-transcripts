Alright guys, I am here with our latest athlete for Eavision Julian. Welcome brother. Thank you. Yep. It's great to have you. So Julian Fitzgerald is now a part of Eavision. What made you come over to our brand? I've been seeing all our social media and I was looking into it. You know there's a lot of other brands and stuff like that. We're looking at, you know, you working out with Axel and you see, and I saw like some kids like deal with competition for Eavision and stuff like that. I was like this is awesome. And you know, I was going to have to sell something and it's everything is soon to be high quality. I really didn't see anything wrong with the company and of course you're here as well. So that was really big plus. It sounds like yeah Eavision 770 company when I go for it's just my aesthetic. Well, what's cool is that a lot of people go, hey, what's just right, but you said what's right but also what's wrong. And I feel like many of you out there are trying to find what company you might be able to just connect with. And it's about the genuine nature of the business. A lot of our athletes, especially like people like Sid, right, who was a customer before she was even eight-time misalimpia. You know, Laura Lee, who would, when the Olympia, you know, you start using our products before she became misalimpia, right? How do you show upon the same thing? You know, even past athletes, right? My thing is just that you just turn 19 years old, just turn 19 years old, right? And you're about five foot almost by 11, right? And you're about, how much right now? 100 and 200 pounds? 200 pounds? I'm going to say 100 and 95 depending on whether you eight or not. Yeah, you're going to take 200, I guess kind of, fly away, right? Right. How to hype right now just recently and about whether or not you're natural, right? Yes. So again, I know you did some stuff with Jeff Nipperd, you did some stuff with Greg DuSett and they did some blood work and the findings were that you are natural. Yes. And very, very genetically, obviously gifted. Your dad is good old pop. It's 65275, right? And is your mom tell, too? My mom is about like five, six, five, seven. Okay. Pretty up there for a woman. For woman, yeah, yeah, yeah. So again, your dad was an athlete and he played football. He played football. College football. Awesome. What position? I think he was a DN. That's a good size DN. Yeah, maybe I can't remember. Yeah, well, six, seven, you can do kind of almost anything you want. There's an amazing, big, I want to play this position. But in all honesty, you come from an athletic background, sports wise, just given the fans that don't know you. You played football? Right. And a little bit soccer? Yeah. Right. I've done football, soccer, fencing, wrestling. Most of the family. What was your favorite? Wrestling was definitely my favorite. Wrestling? Yeah, that was okay. And what weight class did you wrestle? I wrestled 195, but I went up to 220 because it was nice. Nice. How did it go? It was nice. It was nice. I only lost twice, but I did like six or seven matches I believe. And it was just fun, you know, being able to push myself, I always loved the grind. So like being in for the first year, it was like, you know, you know, you know, like, oh, this is awesome. Like, I'm over here working towards this. I'm a newbie. And you know, I get to learn how to kind of throw people around and, you know, have fun and stuff like that. So it was definitely a really cool experience, especially wrestling. Have you been here because I love competition. So like just walking up and seeing like six or four dudes and someone in that I'm like, I love to get it. You know what I mean? It was fun for me. You've been working out for since you were 14. Yeah, for 14 years old. And now, I feel like being able to focus on some body parts, you got great arms, really good chest, even your back is good. But to get you that maximum width that you a child made you're looking for is to build up the deltoids, right? Yes. And I feel like today, we were talked about what to work out. So deltoids number one, some upper chest. And then you were saying you're wanting to get some mind muscle connection on the tricep. Yes. Some crazy biceps, give them a biceps shot real quick. Boom. There you go. So a little, little Ronnie Coleman feel he'd ask. They have some goals. And I want to make sure that all the fans and people that are going to start following this journey are going to know, you got some amazing goals. Yeah. Once you share that, what you're goal? So recently, after doing some research, I found that Chris Bum said one, the classic physique, Mr. Olympia around 24. And so because I just turned 19 and you know, I have all the support behind me, I was like why not shoot for a young guy's, you know, classic Mr. Olympia. So that's my long term goal right now. I have about five years. And so I'm really excited to pursue this goal. I think it's something to definitely look forward to. I'm really excited for them excited for the grind. That's where I, you know, kind of make myself an outlier, for a lot of like and football things that such. Whenever, you know, some of the put in the work that's where I kind of specialize. And I just lock in and just do what I need to do and more. You know what I mean? Sure. And so that's definitely a goal that I'm working towards and really excited about it. And so yeah, I hope you all can, you know, stick around for the journey, man. Yeah. I'm really enjoying it because when you sat down in yesterday with me and we talked for a while and not only did you show me your physique, but we started to get to know each other. I kept thinking of myself and you got to meet my son Cameron. Yeah. You know, I'm like, dude, you're only 70 years different with my son. Again, this is a lifestyle, not just a basic sport. So, you know, when you play soccer, you play football, it's amazing. But it's a lot different when you have to eat, sleep, drink and really live it. And that's why bodybuilding is all about discipline. So again, with all the things he's doing, also, just talk really quickly about your school. You're also going to college. Yes. So getting your degree in business. Okay. Right? Yes. In the five year MBA program, I have the university. So I'm currently on track to getting my masses of business in five years. Yeah. So you're getting ready in your own scholarship? Yeah, I am on that level of scholarship. That is a little bit amazing. Right? On scholarship comes from a great family because they're all about the values. A lot of people would just leave school alone and focus on just bodybuilding. But he is literally trying to do both. Now again, first year's done, get ready for your sophomore year. Yes, sir. So we're going to go, we're going to do that. Local here to the DFW Dallas area. So that also makes it really lucrative for you to be able to come in here and train wherever you like here at our gym. How was it yesterday? Nice. Oh, yeah, it was nice. This is actually like going to the best and not the best in my room. It's a, that's all. Exactly, dope. Awesome. We're very happy to have you a part of the family, the team. And also, you want to learn a lot, not just about training, but you want us to go over supplements and everything else. And a lot of you people at home are going to ask about PEDs. Well, the decision you'd made, you want to make it sure, you know, like kind of give a little bit of joy. Oh, yeah. Basically how you want to go about doing this? Sure. So I guess with the goal in mind, I don't plan on hopping on any PEDs anytime soon. I'm finally staying at the National State National Monotaur Life. And I'm trusting honey to help me to bring the most out of my, you know, physique that I can possibly bring. I feel like we both agreed that I have a lot more to bring out. And so I'm excited to see, you know, what I can bring on that, surely. And probably maybe a year to the head of the actual, like, stage like the moment. Probably rallying 22, 23, some around there. I might do something, you know, minimal or whatever we decide to do. But as of right now, no time so. Okay. Maximizing as genetics, you guys have been hearing me talk about it. Maximize your genetics. So don't just jump into the dark side. Focus on being able to check every box, your nutrition, your training, your natural supplementation. Take it as far as you can. Then you can go ahead and make that decision down the road. But right now, we're absolutely, and that's what made me very, very, very, like, just excited and happy about this project. Because when he came to me and said, hey, could you help me? And I said, well, let's, let me try to get to know you a little bit. Yeah. And I could say, it sounds like you got a great upbringing. So congrats mom and dad for bringing up a great son. And looking forward to just being able to teach you as much as we can to be able to do this the right way and as natural as far and as long as possible. We're going to get started off. I'll bring work out wise. He has chosen non-stem. So we're going to go 3D. And then we're going to do the Glistoral solution, the EVPAQ. We're going to run a half a lid, which is the 10 gram dose. And then we're going to run a full scoop to a scoop and a half of the 3D non-stem. So again, no caffeine, no hymbe on this one. For those of you that like the caffeine, remember, utilize it, don't abuse it. So let's go ahead and let's get rolling. And this is the new Patriot Pop. So we made Patriot Pop years ago, brought it back a new updated version with a new packaging great proud of. And very, very excited to get him to try this. Again, if you like bomb pop, this is the one for you. I'm going to go ahead. That was the idea of it as a kid. I still tear him up. What's telling me? My son wasn't good old cam. So there you go. Yeah, just a big keeping scoop. So again, getting you your Argentine nitrate, your citrling, your beta-alony as well as the good old limes, man. And you got a little pot. Boom, pate pot. Get a little bit of that effervescence to give it some good mouth feel. Nothing crazy, but just a little bit. That's good. That's exactly like that. That's crazy. You all know that flavor though. Yep. So again, this is now available in the non-stem 3D extreme, which is the stem base, as well as a amino cam. So you check it out at ebogenetrition.com and take advantage of the sale that we have for 4th of July weekend. So go ahead ebogenetrition.com. That's good. Awesome. You ready to do this? Yeah. All right guys, let's start it. Bells. And we're just going to do some front, do about seven eight reps, then we're going to do lateral seven eight reps. And then we're going to go ahead and just start there. Oh, cool. Let's do it. We just go. Yeah. Let's just go to the side first. There you go. Good. Just breathe. Breathe normal. Just get some blood in there. Get it to peek out. There you go. Perfect. You don't want to go too high. You're doing perfect on that. Because if you go way up here, you're going to start activating trap and a lot of other places. So what you're doing is perfect, we just go just shoulder height. Just a slightly bit higher than that. Like that. Good. Good. All right. You start shaving your face yet or no? Not really. Not really. Not really. You thought that was a joke. I could tell because he's got so good at baby face. He's still having a shaving yet. Yeah. In 19, in the shaving space. I was shaving when I was nine. No, I think I was 12. So 13. I started getting peach buzz and I had to start cleaning it up. Yeah, the beard is definitely. Yo, probably see the beard coming in. I'm making a make that a highlight on the journey. Yeah, when he's like 23. Yeah. Twenty two. We don't have a little bit. Yeah, that's the right amount. Yeah. Good. So you see how you're letting go? Don't let go. Slow, that's better. A little more control on the eccentric on the way down, especially the last half of the rep, which is from here down to there. Perfect. Good. Put that eccentric tension on there. Good. So as he's warming up, guys, I want to explain to you a couple things. As I saw him yesterday, his arms are so big that it made his shoulders and his delts look a little bit small. And if that makes you look small, that can give you that narrow look that we were talking about. So again, what we got to do is to maximize that is to be able to really get those delts to blow out and get that 3D look. So it looks like we got a cannon ball, cut it in half and slap it on each side of his shoulders. Yo, starting to feel it. It's nice. Good. Good job. Just do two more like that. But now on the last rep, what I want you to do is keep your hands this way. Just look at the face that way. That way. Yep. Good. Go. Yes. Oh, yes. Nice. Good. One more. Two more like that. Okay. Alright. So we unlocked the first phase and that is basically understanding what he could be doing a little bit better. Not like he did anything wrong, obviously he looks great. But also just the fact that you have cheat codes with great genetics is not going to mean that you're going to get to where you want to go by just continuously doing the same thing. One thing I noticed was that he would keep his hands here palms down. The minute I had him palms facing, that's when he started feeling that lateral head of the delt. And then you're like, oh, wow. That was a new, you know, full feeling unlocked. So again, here versus going here, this is what he was doing before. So now palms facing. You know, because I think you were going here, right? Yes, up there. There. And then what was your hand motion? Do it again. Yep. And then do what you were doing before. There you go. Versus just literally all he changed was this staying here and then keeping tension on that lateral head of the delt, which is on that side. So I just feel it. Yeah. So now we'll start adding weight. Yes. Good. There you go. We're going to do the whole set. Now. That would be good. Keep going. It's like that the whole set. Good. We're going to do 10 reps. Okay. Good. There you go. Do you get two more? I got 10. That's it over 10. One more. One more. Good job. Good job. Put that weight back. Okay. Okay. Whoo. Yeah. Good. That was good. Yeah. Good. You can see now your shoulders are even fuller. So you actually look even rounder now just from just making sure that get that technique with your wrist. So yeah. Yeah. The wrist, I right the wrist and the shoulders I definitely make a huge difference. Huge difference. So that's what I'm going to do. Yeah. Good. Nope. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. There you go. Good. There you go. Come on, Julie. That's it. Come on. We're going to work on your strength. Good. Now you get the form. We're going to build up that strength in there. Come on, brother. So I have 22 pounds. Again. Again. Two more. Good form. One more. Good form. Keep going. Good. We're not going to make this into working set. Go. Good. Again. Again. Come on. Come on. Come on. You can't get up. Can't get me three partial. Let's go. One. Go. Two. One more. One more. Got it. How much is that burning, bro? Yeah. It's nice. You can see that sucks. Yeah. I love it though. That's your shoulder with that squeeze. Squeeze, get that shoulder out. Get your elbow out and squeeze down. Feel that deltoid. Yeah. That's how you want to be able to feel when you are in the getting really good pump. That lateral head. Make sure you touch. Don't be afraid. A perchest. Latter or head. Front. Del. All of those areas when you're training it. Don't be afraid to get that mine must with connection. Lots of times you'll see me go through the last 30 years and I'll put my hand on a quad or on a deltoid to get a better mine muscle connection. At the end, you need to do the same thing too. How does that pump feel? Then you can be able to discern whether or not you properly hydrated. Maybe it's not super full because you could be dehydrated or I'm getting a little bit low on my meals and I only had one meal but I felt way full or after meal two or three. I want to train at one o'clock versus training at nine or ten the morning. All of those things are going to get dialed in and you'll start learning all of these tag types of methodologies to be able to really maximize your performance in the gym. So now we're going to do the front raises. Pumps down this perfect. Good. Both arms together. Yep. Control that eccentric. Okay. Nice squeeze on the concentric part. Excellent. Good. Make sure you're breathing. Good. Good. Good. Good. Oh yes. So you're not used to holding it. Go. There you go. Good. Good. That's it. One more partial. That's it. Okay. So again, here's another lesson for you guys. But what I'm starting to learn is that he's not used to controlling that eccentric, right? Yeah. You're used to letting go. So with the greatest he looks, this is going to make him look even better by controlling that eccentric. So especially the last half of the rep from here down to here, he was dropping the weight. So now what we're going to do is going to get him to do it. That's why he started to get really weak very quickly because his body's not used to it. The muscle fibers are not used to being fired that way. So now as he's doing that, he's going to get bigger and stronger by being able to create a little bit more time-intention with going a little slower on that eccentric motion on the way down. That's what Jeff was telling me. He's like, you're super explosive because of my background like football. You know what I mean? Like, you don't hold him. We just explode. Yeah. We definitely cool to see how just holding you can call such a difference. So I'm excited if you see results. Yeah, that's awesome. So we're going to do one more set with that front raise. How does the pump so far? It feels good. Yeah. I like that little siren. It's a little buzz that I got going on. That's awesome. Two. Three. Good. Again. Good. Good. Good. Again. Good. Good. Up. Six. Good. Okay, carcels. Okay, come on. Control. Good. Control again. Good. Good. One more. You got this. That's it. So even doing those carcels at the end, he's not used to it. So adding those in are going to amount to even more time under tension so that you can be able to get more muscle sornus and it's going to cause more growth. Cool. Haven't had a big name yet. How do you get it? Make name like that. Oh man. I don't know. We got to have to work for it. So you guys, if you think of a nickname, he's going to have to come out with a nickname eventually. Maybe it's not time yet. But if you think of a nickname, go ahead and put in the comments below. So we can have, you know. Yeah, let's see. Yeah. Do I get to like, go to a fruit? Where is he just like? They just throw it out there. No, I usually win the one that does it. Are you a fruit? No, I'm kidding. We're just going to go ahead and see what you like. But down the road, you know, I know. Look at Ronnie. He had a bunch of them. Phil was the gift. Yeah. And when we go down South Africa, I should sign out for myself. Yeah. That was for you. Ash South Africa. But when you go down South America, he would be called El Ragalo. You know, the gift. So everybody had a nickname. You know, cutler was cut. You know, and yeah. So we had so many, a lot of guys. Not every single person, you know. Chris, you know, just see you, bum. See you, bum. That's classic. Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. We'll figure out. Yeah. Okay. Good job. All right. So this really good form. Only thing that I'm going to try a little bit different is for you to bring your dumbbells out a little further. Okay. To the outside of your deltoids instead of on top of them. So instead of coming in here, let's go a little further out as we push up and see how you feel out there. Okay. Out. Go up. And then yeah, keep. Yeah. There you go. Keep out. There you go. Up. Good. Good. Just something. Outer head. Outer head of that dough. There you go. Good. Boom. So we're doing is we're prepping them. So when he uses really heavy dumbbells, he's going to be able to hit them together. Because it's his wider. Give you the handle, those wider dumbbells. There you go. Good. Bring it on. Nice. Out. Good. And notice it's a different part of your deltoids work out. Oh, yes. Okay. Another level unlocked. So again, if you're going really narrow, just like a shoulder press, or I should say, like just like a chest press, you're going to start getting almost a lot of tricep overhead. You'll get some deltoid. But if you go a little further out, you're going to feel more deltoid. Yeah. So again, just like if you're going really narrow on chest press, you're going to focus a lot on tricep. You know, do you still get fiber recruitment in your chest? Absolutely. But when you really want to work that chest, you go a bit wider on the presses. Yeah. Same thing. It's dumbbells. So make sure that you're going far enough out. So it's on the outside part of your deltoid and not landing on top of your deltoid. As you're doing your shoulder press, that's going to help that overall mass. Okay. Makes us. Okay. So he's getting really good range of motion. He's not stopping. He's not stopping up. Sometimes you see people stopping up by their ear, the top of their ear. Now he's going all the way down. Really good depth, full range of motion and driving. Good. And again, he's shaking because this is a new fiber recruitment. This is he's not used to doing this range of motion. Good. Come on, Julie. This is how you do it, bro. Good. You want to build those delts. This is how you do it. Drive. Yeah, shoulders. Big shoulders. Catch up to those arms. Good. Good. Good. Come on. Two more. Oh, okay. You completely gone. Burnin'. Yeah. Good. Yeah. Good. So we'll do this. We're going to rest for about two minutes. Then we're going to go ahead and do one more set with just a little bit heavier weight. Bring the reps down just a little bit. And see how he does it. 53. But make sure that we're not going to fatigue him. We're going to give him a full two minutes of rest for this last set. Oh. Good. Again. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Don't feel like you have to hit your dumbbells either. Go. Just like that. Perfect. Go. Oh, yes. Yeah. So that added death is creating a bit more difficulty. Good. Up. Oh, you got it. It's it. Woo. Burn. I'm going to feel that tomorrow. That's that's going to suck tomorrow. I know it is. And then two days after you suck at a suck anymore. Because now you're going to be a rounder and fuller. Two takeaways were one range of motion. We were going all the way down to the deltoid. Number two, making sure you're going far enough out. So it's not right on top of the deltoid. So it doesn't get so much arm recruitment. But also you're getting those delts. And that's why he's fatigue. Because he's got that range of motion. And he also was able to go a little bit wider. So between those two. Feel like you hit it right on. You did a good job with that. Go ahead and rack that up. And then we're going to go ahead and go the next exercise. All right. Next exercise, guys. It's going to do a fly. I'm going to get him do one of my favorites here, which is standing multi-flight Tanata piece. This is an amazing machine. There's a lot of manufacturers make something similar. But what we're going to do is we're going to start it off with flies. And then we're going to work our way to a press. But right now, the key is going to be able to really set him up. So his shoulder joint is going to be in line with the joint center point. And then we're going to get a really good stretch. And then we're going to give it a really good squeeze. This is another really excellent machine. We're going to go ahead and get the started squeeze. Excellent. You doing a good job with your hands too. Keeping your hands open. I know you've been watching my videos. Yeah. Yeah. Squeeze. Good. One more. Good. Come on. Good job. Good job. All right. I know, but the opposite is just feel some more natural. Just having your hands open. Yeah. I mean, so you don't feel like you're doing this. You can get the full range of your hands. Yeah. Very big on open hands. If you want to make sure to be able to open your hands. Most important time to do that is at the midpoint. As you're squeezing, I feel like you get a really good contraction that way. And also, you'll see myself. You know, we saw you just do it Julian, where you open your hand on the way out. Because it kind of feels natural. It feels like you really want to open up to get that extreme stretch. And then that really nice contraction. Yeah. Where does no fly like this? Yeah. That was amazing. You want to get stretched. Keep your chest down so you stretch your arms and your pecs. Good. Good. You're going to get sore and all these new spots. Yeah. Good stretch. Good. Good. Squeeze. Good. Two more. Open and squeeze. Squeeze. Good. One more stretch. You're chest down. Keep your chest down. So, stretch. One more. One more. One more like that. Keep your chest down. Keep your chest down. Good job. Good. Warm ups over. Time to do some working sets. Now this is our warm ups. Yeah. Are you serious? Yeah. That's it. Now we're going to do a working set. So this one now. Remember, as you bring your arms up, keep your chest down. Stretch. You don't want to end up going up like this because then you're doing the opposite of stretching. So, when you go, hand goes up, chest goes down. Well, it's as far as. Mm-hmm. Yep. Eight. Nine. Ten. Now you got two more. Two more. Eleven. Gold it. Go down. Do another rep and hold it. I want you to hold it for five seconds on the bottom. Squeeze. Squeeze. Right there. Five. Four. Three. Two. Good job. How does that feel? I'm going to fill it mostly tomorrow. I can't have that. That's good. Squeeze your chest. Yeah. Let's see. You look like you got a good pump going. Let's see which it looks like. Yeah. Good. So this is the area we want to work on the most right now. So we can fill in the shoulders to be able to match up those arms because you got crazy arms. But right now, how's that shoulder pump? It's great, actually. It feels nice. How do you have how many is in a while, actually? Do a side chest and you can feel the chest as well as a shoulder on that pose. Squeeze that chest right there. Good. Big. Boom. Right there. Right there. Hold that. Hold it. Hold it. Three more seconds. Two. Good job. Good. Let me see that front of a bicep. Hold your turn. Those wrists. Perfect. I got it. Good. That peak. Squeeze. That's just like that. Squeeze. Smile. Like you're having a good time. That's it. Good job. That's it. Good job. Keep those elbows up. Keep that tension on the chest. Good. And then down the squeeze. There you go. Now you're working. That's it. Now you're working. Good. Good. Play time is over. Good job. Come on, Julian. Let's do this. Good. Three. Again. Come on. Go. Go. Go. One more. You got this. Don't give up. Go. Squeeze. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good job. That's it. That's better. There you go. Teach you how to go pass that point of almost that point of failure, right? You thought you can do anymore. You ended up doing two more reps. Don't let the mind put that limit on you. Because your body can definitely handle it. Thank you, obviously. Yeah. That was a good set. Good set. Good. Good. Squeeze that chest right there. Go a little wider with shoulders. And then squeeze the chest so that it strikes all the way through all the way to the top. There you go. It goes out. Keep your lats out. Squeeze now. And turn your wrists up like that. Boom. And then turn those triceps forward like that. Squeeze. Squeeze your chest. Squeeze that chest all the way through. All the way. There you go. Good. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Good job relax. Woo. So we did front raises. We did ladder raises. We did shoulder press. We did the standing belt. And then now I'm sorry the multi flight fly. Now when you go ahead and we're going to do an incline press for that upper chest. So we talked about try to get that to really fire off here. So we did front del lateral. We did secondary muscle. A little bit tricep obviously kicks in. But we're going to go ahead and really focus on that after we do your incline press. It's ready. Yep. It's good. Chin up. I've got to have a good perfect. Oh right there. Perfect. Good. Right there. Excellent. Good. Push. Excellent. Good. Again. Good. Again. Good. Good. Good job. Good job. Nice. Two. Two. Go. Three. Four. Good. Five. Good. Six. Six. Point where you got. To call it. Got 10. Good. Good. Good. Good. Well. Good. Well. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Thirty. Good. Good. Drive. Good. Nice and slow. Good job. Oh yes. Oh good. Squeeze that chest. Good. You see how those delts are looking 3D now too? Yeah. You got that pump in the delts from earlier. Now we're working on that chest. Now hit that front of the box out. Boom. Good. You're good. Yeah. Now that you're holding your wrist correctly, you're seeing even more peak now. Because if you keep that wrist supinated, that's what you're going to see that really peak just go next level. Okay. Yeah. Many of you guys make a huge mistake. Squeeze and keep your hand here. You've got to turn and supinate the wrist if you really want to accentuate that peak. That's what's going to do it whether you're training or whether you're posing. Good. Excellent. Good. Keep going. Good. Stretch. Good. Contraction. Excellent. Right there. Right there. Stretch and drive. Good. You see those fibers popping now. Go. Squeeze. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Squeeze. You got one more now. You called it. That's your number. Good. That's your goal. Up. Control. Good job. Yeah. Don't be afraid to you. Again, the super machines we call them the super inclined because it's got a self-spotting mechanism. Some of the panata equipment are not super. The ones that are not super means it does not have the self-spotting. You do have it. Use it. The reason for that is that especially when your muscles are super fatigued the last repertoire and you're going super heavy like as you grow and you're trying to add that weight, then you can go ahead and be able to self-spot. It creates a lot less chance for injury. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Very good. Here we go. Good. Good. All right, so right now we're going to get ready to do TRICEPS but he's going to run his intro. Very good. At Minochime, again then see visual amino acids along with S7 and hydration. So a rythm.��llss to boil. And then I'll show you how to do theumping pressure. Make sure that live is on tight. Because it does that. Boom. Nice. That's good. Nice. It's good, especially if you like a little bit of that carbonation. Yeah. It's just got slightly carbonation down and so forth. Yeah. You said that a bunch of the different exercises you didn't really feel right in your triceps. Yeah. Which ones would you normally do? Just so I know. Okay, so because of the elbow thing, I was trying to find what I could use to still work. Have it to triceps instead of work out. Okay. Without so much of joint pain. I get something like this. Keep it about that lower. Put as low as I can at my gym. Mm-hmm. And get a straight bar. Little back leg leg. And these overhead press? Yeah, try to do that. Okay. Yeah, that's a great exercise. Yeah. Let's try to do that. Okay. But let's go ahead and just warm up your triceps first. With just a basic push down. Okay. Good. Good. And when you go up, go up a little slower. Good. Go on. Good. Control it. Don't snap it. Control it. And squeeze that trice out. Not so fast. Just come down. Squeeze. Squeeze. That's best. Good. There you go. Right there and down. Good. Good. Good. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Squeeze. Good. Good. Keep going. Good. Good. Again. Good. Two more. One more. Good job. Wow. There you go. I feel a little bit. Keep that tension on there. Good, right there. Good. Nice stretch and down. Excellent. Keep going. You feel that? Good. Go. Good. Come on. Again. Good. Again. Good. How many got? Oh. Go. We're going to play some more. Yeah. Good. And then put it all the way up. Good. That's light. That's light. Go. Go. Good job. Last one. All the way up and rack it. Good. Good job. Most of you out there are going to have a preference. There's not a right way or wrong way to have your hand grip. You can have your thumbs back. You can have it forward. You can have it the way that he had it, which was right on the bar. It's personal preference. If you are scared of that bar rolling on you, then go ahead and handle it traditionally with your thumbs over. If you're advanced and you're used to doing thumbs over with, you know, where it's your thumbs right next to your index finger, that's totally fine. You can do that. But only if you're really used to it. If you're not, then I highly advise to use a traditional regular grip. If you use the thumbs on the bar, again, personal preference. It looks like he's been doing that for a while. You've been doing that for a minute now. Yeah, I just for a wrist stability. Because I do like to pack on some weight for this. Sure. So just to keep my wrist to say it was possible. I just throw my thumbs up. Cool. How have you normally go on this? I think that's what I do over there. We went to like, what's your 25? I've got some like that. All right. So let's put it in our shirt. Yeah, let's throw a quarter on or a 22. That's what I do. Good. Good control. Good lift. Good. Feet flat. I'm very big on keeping the cup of quarter tight. Feet flat. And your legs should not be flailing. Good. Just keep your feet flat. Push off the ground. Keep that quarter tight. Drive off your chest. And go. Good. Continue. Again. Good. Good. One more. You got this. So you're looking at the width of the arm, the width of the shoulder. You're looking at the peck. You're squeezing that peck and you're twisting. Squeeze that peck. There you go. Just like that. Boom. Good. Boom. Good. So the key is to just continuously build here to fill in that width. Right? Want to keep building those delts. And as we build the delts, rear delts, all of those. You're going to be able to see way more three-dimensionality out of that to be able to keep building onto that shoulder width. Good. Okay. Let's go. Two. Two. Good. Five. Good. Six. Seven. Go. Good. With me now. Stop. Stop. Good. Keep flat and flat. Don't win. Up. Block. That's good. That's one. Two. You notice how he's going down and he's stretching. That's really important. A lot of people stop right when they get to the top of their head. You do not do that. You make sure you go back behind the head and then drive perfect. Good. What's your number? Good. Keep going. And as you develop, the try steps more. You're going to see an arc form. And that's going to fill up his triceps. So it's going to look even more impressive. Keep going. Good. Good. That's good though. Yeah. Control it. Control the top. Up. Control the top. That's it. Like that. Little higher up. Good. Good. Just to try to really focus on that real delt here. So this, we're going to make this twice as big. All by just making sure that he's training it properly, getting the right mind muscle connection. Sometimes when you're doing reverse fly machine, you have a lot of trap kick in, you've got rhombus kick in. With something like this, this will help eliminate the ability for your body to cheat because if you do it right and you don't go too heavy. So, and we're going to be able to, when you do pinkies up, it does create a bit more of that contraction. So you won't be able to utilize as much of that momentum. So that's why I like using pinkies up. But I go back and forth between the two. Three. Good. Four. That's five. Let's go. Five more. Let's go. Let's go. Go. One. Two. Two. Go. Three. Four. Good job. Wow. How do you feel the burn? I'm just watching you. Three. Good. Good for him. Go. Let me get. Good. Go. Go. Two more. You got two more. One more. One more. Marshall. Go. Three. Go. One. Two. Oh shit. That's it. Woo. All right guys. So we just did chest shoulders and tricep. Through in those rear delts at the very end. And I believe we unlocked the next character. So again, unlocked the next character. We've got the 19-year-old phenom here who is basically looking to number one, compete. Number two. Get a pro card. And number three, his goal is to try to be Mr. Olympia someday, which a lot of people who are out there competing want to be, which is all great. But you're going to have to put a game plan together when it comes to training, diet, and any portion of your nutrition, including your supplements. So how was it? It's great. Yeah, I've got to feel the puff. I was able to give it a look at four. I love that like dead filling out to everything. It's very, I mean, she just looked right at you. Yeah. I'm going to put that under the seat. I love this workout because I thank you. Yeah, you're welcome, brother. Yeah, 19 years old. Follow his journey. Obviously, I'm going to put his link down below.
