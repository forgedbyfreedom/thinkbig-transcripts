What's up guys? We are back doing another rate your physique. So today We're going natty or not and I have an athlete who says he is So we're gonna go ahead and take a page out of the natty textbook with who sane Farhot who sane I believe he's around 23 years old There's some videos with him and Julian Greg Deussette I believe also there was Jeff Nipperd had just done a video with him as well some other natural athletes now What I want to go ahead and I'll let you know at the end whether I do think he's natural or not But let's go ahead and let's talk about this gentleman here I believe he's around 23 years old. I believe he's around five foot 10 Lebanese descendant great physique and what he did do was I believe that end of last year He competed in In classic as well as men's physique. So the picture I have up right now We have him in his men's physique shorts. So we're gonna go ahead and start there and but we're gonna also Kind of go a little bit back and forth between the two divisions because I believe he did both of these at the same show I believe it was the King Kong classic all right So we're gonna go ahead and break down his physique see the strong points talk about the weaker points that he could work on and Let's go ahead and let's rate this physique piece by piece with the breakdown first Let's go ahead and let's start with a little bit of the strengths So we're gonna go ahead and put those in green Good arms I really like his arms arms look really really good there Also, so it bicep tricep in the green shoulders in the green really good with he's got good chest So again looking at not just separation Development shoulders bicep tricep that all looks really good Also my eyes are drawn to that small tight waist which is exactly what you want to see whether you're doing classic or you're doing men's physique in the board shorts So again that really small waist I see some definition all through the Obleaks that looks really good the abdominal area The abs are popping which is what you want to see now Also, he's got good traps again some guys they overdeveloped their traps and actually makes him look narrow I think his positioning and his actual posing is really good and he's grunching down Not everybody can pull that off when you crunch down sometimes you lose your chest He's doing a good job keeping that waist really really tight But he's also keeping the shoulders nice and wide and even though he's got really developed traps Those are not making him look narrow some athletes have big traps and then they make him look extra narrow So that's not the case with him. He's also got a longer neck that helps with that because if you have a short neck Then we're gonna end up having a lot of discrepancies in terms of like the symmetry because if you notice guys It have really big arms or don't have a lot of width and up looking more narrow guys with big traps the same way And if you have big traps and big arms, then it makes you look extra narrow So again bodybuilding is an illusion, but I think he's done a really good job shoulder to waist ratio looks good everything else now again He doesn't have huge calves, but you don't need to have huge calves, but you can tell he's training him So I really like to fact that you can see that they're full So exactly what you want to see Developed legs many people do not do legs when they do men's physique You can tell he does that's why he's also doing classic so again you can see you can see his quads They're pushing you're not looking for crazy striations in this class But you do want to see that you have that lower leg Fulness because when things are close that will make a difference if it's really close between you and another competitor They're gonna make sure that you have those full fuller legs especially right below the thigh when it comes to the mid-shorts So you want to be able to show a little bit of that leg now Again, you have to be careful though because if your legs are too big You can make your upper body small because of the lack of symmetry, but also if you end up hitting your weight cap So you have a different weight cap as a pro versus an amateur and if you're a bottom heavy that can hurt you Especially if you're hitting your weight cap and you have some gigantic legs But usually the opposite is the case with men's physique guys, but he's got a good balance. He's got a good symmetry that looks good Now what would I want him to improve on is something that is coming out in a couple of people mentioned this on post that I did see was whether or not he's got Gino now Yes, he does have a little bit of swelling through the nipple and That can take off from your physique being judged so the judges will take away points It depending on how bad it is and Depending on the lighting depending on sometimes some athletes they get flat and they have gynautel now is the gynau From drug use It could be or it could not be because just because you have gyna doesn't mean you've done drugs Because a lot of kids as they're going up they hit puberty and they can get gynaut just from that But also some people that as experimenting with poor hormones can also gain gyna and that ends up becoming that hard tissue right under the nipple That as you lean out doesn't go away So which one is that from all that you know at the end what my thoughts are But for now that is something that could make a difference as he's going to keep competing if he continues to develop his chest And that's still there it might be something he may have to address But overall great physique the biggest thing that I see is that just that that nipple is a bit swollen So you're gonna have to keep an eye on that because it could become problematic as he continues his career But overall really nice physique all right now let's go ahead and go on to the back pose. Let's see how his back looks Okay, good all who's saying so we're gonna go in We're gonna throw a little bit of picture magic here and now I'm gonna go ahead and start off where what I think he needs to work on right off the bat We have a little bit of asymmetry it looks like going on into that left lat it looks like his right lat is a bit Fuller through here versus just a little bit of flatness on that left and you can see just underneath that Terry's right through there And that upper lat area how that right pops out a little bit more is it opposing issue Possibly because I'm not there at the show, but it could also be a development issue What would I suggest for him being able to fix that is a lot of single arm one arm pull downs using a Dehandle or if you're using a panodapiece of equipment or anything that's an ISO piece of equipment on that left hand You can go ahead and pull that down and I would use not only an overhand grip But I would also use a neutral or even a reverse grip to really hit those lower lats to be able to really get those to fire Especially on that left side because it looks like that right side is a bit Fuller and a little more developed again could be the posing but from what I'm seeing here It just seems like it's just a little bit of asymmetry and it's a little bit off It's also the reason why I think that is if you notice here through his rear delts his right rear delts looks more developed than his left and because of that area right there You can see how big versus a little bit smaller those rear delts are on the left side versus the right side So it looks like it's compensating So again, I feel like that's from what I'm seeing I'm not gonna be 100% if I send the less I saw him in person But it's something that comes to mind now again What I also want to work on is working continuously build up that inner back Rose to grow love the rose whether it's one-armed-dumbbell rose combination of barbell rose machine rose That's going to help making sure the peak contraction Obviously he's working hard. He's got good genetics as well and he's made a lot of improvements from what I've seen So he's gonna just have to continue that but what I do like are the arms if you notice not only are they're nice and lean But he's also got some good separation He's got some good muscle fullness through those triceps looks really really good from there But once again, I'm a person that's going to break down that physique So I'm constantly going okay great arms look good from behind rear delts look good I would like to create that a little bit of more symmetry through the rear delts But also keeping that back fuller getting that back wider another thing would just constantly work on being doing pull-ups Reverse grip pull-downs are gonna work really really well When it comes to overall back development on top of the rose now onto the lower body Just continuing to work on those calves he has him you can tell he's working them But just continue to keep working on those calves you can never have calves too big in my opinion Especially when they're not super super genetically gifted athletes So continue to keep working on those calves because it is something that they are gonna judge if things are close as well as the legs Now one final thing I want to talk about is his conditioning I think his conditioning is really good especially for a natural show now if he could get his lower back Just a little tighter on the next show that'd be awesome But again looks really really good feel like if he just fills up his back He's gonna do even better. I believe he placed around fifth or sixth at this show In this particular division now before I move on to going to his classic physique poses I do want to remind everybody that the FST 7 transformation challenge is about to launch So if you're looking to be the best version of yourself then take on the six week FST 7 challenge and for $49 I give you full access to training nutrition as well as motivational weekly updates to be able to help you get to your best ever In the first place transformation challenge winner will receive $5,000 August 11th I'm going to be starting that challenge So go to honeyrambod.com to get more information looking forward to seeing you guys all in the challenge So back to right your first All right, let's go ahead and start off with a front double We have a very artistic front double for his front double here that we were able to take from the internet He's doing a single arm I Really good pose on him. I want to be able to break this down. Let's go ahead and let's start off with all of the great things that we're seeing in his physique here Also looks like he tightened up a bit now posing itself is going to be able to show off a lot more But first thing that I see is a huge plus or the abs the abs look fantastic second thing is these awesome arms his arms look great again Lot more detail through here. I love that looks really good and for those of you that do two classes I do want to give you a bit of advice Sometimes you end up getting the nerves out so I wouldn't be surprised if he did men's physique first and then He jumped in into classic where he got a little bit of nerves out because sometimes when you do that whatever You do second tends to do better now do some people flatten out if they go from one to the other Absolutely, but sometimes you end up peaking and then you end up beating one guy in one class That you didn't beat in the other and you want to know why well It's because sometimes just the nerves themselves or you just had a really good pump backstage And then your nerves were able to subside and then you were able to get that fuller drier look that you were looking for So again, he looks fantastic here the other thing that I really like is the fact that he Has great great stage presence like he's looking up in the sky He's like the gods have gifted me with some good genetics I'm looking up there he's got that smile and that smart going on so he knows he looks good All right guys, we're gonna go into the next pose We we can see his legs where he has a ab thigh pose So let's go ahead all right really good separation looks really good You can see his hip flexors you can see the outer quad that passes lateralist media Alice everything Nice and separated Cabs are poppin which I really really like again small small waist Really good detail nice phones and arms. I actually look at the arms on the ab thigh pose That's why I like athletes who flex their arms when they have their hands behind their head because it does fill in the gap between Your arms and your head so it's really really important But a lot of really good stuff going on here so again Conditioning looks really really good. He's gonna continue to work on being able to get even more condition as he seasons the new muscle But everything looks really good on that end now. What could he improve on here? Let's talk about that So from here what I would like to see is his lats And you got a little bit of a red background here, but his lats being a bit bigger I'd like to see more of a V-taper So as he builds those lats up he's gonna have more V-taper So his conditioning is good, but if he can create more V-taper by having a wider back That's gonna be fantastic. That's the biggest thing that I see obviously he can't always be bigger He's gonna continue to grow. There's a lot of good things happening with his physique But it's gonna make his waist look even smaller if he can continue that V-taper So I'm gonna go ahead and go into blue only because of the fact that The background was already red, but if he can create more of that V-taper again Building the back a lot of pull ups pull downs being able to do rows are gonna continue to fill in with thickness But just being able to just continuously build and develop that V-taper by building that back is gonna give him much more of That hourglass look that we're looking for big sweep from the legs smaller waist big back All right, we're gonna go on to the next pose back double biceps So let's look at what he has going on here. Okay, again, what I like the arms shoulders look really good I can see the quads from the back really really like that and again You can see the conditioning that's going on in his terries his traps his you know His inner back looks good Now what do we need to work on what we've been talking about is which is let's get that back bigger Let's really work on getting that back again I'm gonna go to blue so that you guys can see it but that blue here V-taper here Continue to build the back and also glute hamstring could be a bit tighter again Not every guy is gonna go out there and get stride of glutes But if he can continuously build that glute hamstring and just really dial in the lower body conditioning It's gonna be even more impressive and I think he's gonna do that as he starts to get more muscle maturity But overall really nice good job holding his pose just needs to continue to keep building up the back for better V-taper That we talked about and then getting a little bit of conditioning dialed in for that glute ham insertion Okay, now I kept the best for last guys We went into the side chest pose so side chest We are gonna go ahead and break this down and Let's talk about these really nice things. I see shoulders look really good really like his chest Striated he's got that nice fullness. It's going all the way up into the collarbone which I really like So he's not only got conditioning, but he's got that fullness I'm also seeing conditioning on the opposite shoulder Which my eyes are always drawn to when I'm judging a physique I like to tricep the fullness and separation conditioning really nice bicep peak You can see from the side when I say peak what I'm saying is that you can see the fullness of the bicep from the side not the same peak Is what you I normally think about when you're doing a front double bicep But as you notice here you can see really nice fullness and separation into the bicep break-yallus that looks fantastic and then you're looking at His inner costal slash of bleaks that there's a bleaks just are really firing looks really really good He's got some really good Dice weep from the side so that's really nice diphonus Little bit more here on the hamstrings so on that area I would like to see the hamstrings a bit bigger a little more conditioning on the glute eventually Good conditioning on the cab that looks nice But overall the only other thing that I'm gonna close this off with is Right here which is there a little bit of that guy knows showing so again Depending on how bad that looks as he grows He may need to get that taking care of now some of you're gonna ask now Do I think he's natural or not? Absolutely I do think he's natural. I do not think he is taking drugs I think that chances are again I don't know 100% but again if I was a betting man I would say he's natural. I would say that what had happened is some point as his Developmental growth happened during teenage years you end up having hormones spikes and lots of times that can happen now have I seen natural guys who've taken pro hormones that have occurred? Absolutely I have seen that as well I'm not saying that he's done that and I do know that he's done some drug tested events or he's done drug tested types of shows on YouTube where they've drug tested them or not But I do think that it's one of those things where he does need to address it at some point if it gets worse as he builds It could or it could not sometimes it just takes care of itself because the muscles end up just kind of Inveloping around it and it doesn't become as bad it doesn't look as bad anyways So again that tissue doesn't tend to just go away It just sometimes just doesn't look as bad and some people just say you know what? I don't want it. I just want to go in there and get that fixed. It's up to the athlete But do I think he's natural? I do think he's natural But if you're coming up as an athlete and you're gonna take pro hormones Whether you want to consider yourself natural or not I do think that you have to be careful because even pro hormones or anything that sometimes you can buy online There's not considered an a quote unquote drug is still very drug like and depending on who you ask It is a drug but You can it can cause you Gino so be very very careful because it's a painful surgery and a costly surgery But overall I think he's got a great physique now again I'm gonna figure out exactly how many natty cups do I think that who saying is on a scale from one to ten ten being like absolute perfection I honestly think he's an eight point eight when it comes to natty cups I think he looks really really good But I do give him an eight point eight for an amateur Natty individual maximizing his Personal genetic potential think he looks good I think he's gonna continue to fill in that frame and congratulations to him on all his success and again Let me know who you'd like to see on the next rate your physique honey ram bod 25-time Olympia winning coach I know
