All right guys, we just landed here at West Palm International Airport in Guddlesani, Florida. It's hot, but a different kind of hot, it's like 105 hot and Dallas, but dry heat. Here, I've been outside of you, but I'm sure it's going to be humid. But that's okay, we don't care because we're just here to do work. Getting ready to catch up with Seabom so that we can be able to get some really good workouts in. We're just under eight weeks, eight weeks as of yesterday. So it's going to come out here, be able to get a status update, spend a little or a month since the last time we saw each other and we trained together. And basically now, we just want to be able to make sure that everything is tracking correctly for the prep. So it's going to be a good one. Let's go have some fun. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. What do we got right here for us? Here we go, milk before we get food, come and get them in. This is my version of post-it. I don't care. Post-it. I don't care. World of World War's house. Better take care of myself. Oh, that's all we need. That's gourmet. It's me following you. You can potato, it's a goal. What up, Seabom? It's a goal.

But if you give us some rations, some chicken and potato, chicken and rice, as well as some steak and veggies, and can't wait till my stuff comes because this is an Alaska bout half a day. And in the air conditioner took us forever, that would be called. You heard that beep, beep, beep. That's been going off. But luckily he's been able to go up there and eat meat at it. But I think the battery is probably the one. You should just take it out and take the battery out. Can't be here. Yeah, it's in the tall. It's been a serious four. Dude, you couldn't do it either, but the chair. Yeah, you can only press the button. Should I have to do it? I'll let you go. I'll let you go. You should have more. Yeah.

You're allowed to be loud. We're not a planet fitness. Just remember, when you're doing presses, make sure you're not just using the typical grip. Want to use also a neutral grip because you can be able to work a lot of different angles of the chest, not just one particular one to do. So variation is going to help rate touch on this. You're going here. Good. Good, you're pushing. You're going here. Good. Good. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Good. When you press it, when you go, you're going to want to work. One more. It's me.

Let me know in the comments below if you think we should drop it. Because I really like the design. I had my boy right here, Rob, put it together for me. And I had my boy G turned this thing around super quick for this trip. But I want to know what you think because we want to put some new designs together and I want to know what you all like. Go ahead and put it in the comments below. Let us know what you think of the shirt. And you guys like it. We'll drop it. We just finished chess. How was it? Good. Really good. I feel like you haven't done 150s and like a month or something. I have pretty much like a PR in the way that we're going to do. Yeah, I mean we're just under eight weeks out. Strongest. He's been strongest at any instance. We both have the other. And I don't know. Have you ever been strong in this? I did the one like one with young guy, the one with the 17th. I've been there five years. Oh, five years? Yeah. Just different. It's right. Got it. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. You've full energy. Yeah. Not old man. But that's what I'm here to do. It's just kind of a cesspool we're at. Just under eight weeks out. Number one. Strongest ever seen him. Again, just confirming it last five years. We've been great. Now we're going to be sure that we make weight. So we're going to have to drop the calories a little bit. Change it to cardio and be able to make weight because we're a good 17th. It's a good 19th pounds away. So we got time but we've got to start really moving that direction. But it was a really good chess workout. I guess pretty disappointed. You know, you low in parks. Yeah. No, I mean, it's really good. Probably the strongest I've felt in a couple of weeks. You're going to have to just suck it and come together. And as we're pulling my calories and I'm trying to lose weight on since I'm strengthened and not dropping it all. So moving at the right pace. And we have every bit of it and push. Yeah. So that's what we're going to do. So again, it could be here for three more days. So we've got a lot more going on. Make sure you comment and let us know what you think of the workout. And if there's anything else that you guys want to see because I'm going to throw a little bit more behind the scenes for you guys. Just so you can see what the journey's like getting ready for the 60th anniversary of the Olympic.
