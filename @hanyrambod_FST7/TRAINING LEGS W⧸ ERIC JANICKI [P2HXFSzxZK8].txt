Alright guys, I'm here with Eric Janaki and we are ready to hit quad. We're gonna do legs, but I guess are you normally used to splitting your quad and hamstring or do you do like quad with a little lamb and do quad dominant and dominant? I do a little bit of the other. So I do have like twice a week, since my hamstrings are not good at all, pretty good dog chips. I do, I make sure to hit hamstrings both times, but I always got kind of due balance, but like one day is a little bit more hamstring focus, but I love to do kind of like a balance day with you. Or if you want to just do quad today, it's really cool. Yes, you're the master. Again, he trains twice a week legs. He has a quad dominant, but it does hamstrings, and then he does a hamstring dominant. And we're gonna work around that together and be able to truly pick the support. So he has some really good stuff to take back home. I'm just plunging it today guys. He also said we could try to break my ribs to make my way smaller, but I said maybe maybe next trip will do that. Yeah, so the Jake color part. And then we'll barbecue him and throw him sauce on there, because that's what we do in Texas. Two good. Good. Come on, Eric. Go. Good. Good. Good now, let's go ahead and go to his pointed. Good. Huge, huge, huge quad. Let's go. Keep it rolling. Keep it rolling. Keep it going. Come on, buddy. Keep it going. Go, go, go, go. This is where I feel you can actually add a little bit of tempo, just a little bit. Go. Good. Good, go. There you go. Keep going. Good. Great job. Keep in your hips down. Good. Keep going. You got four. One. Go. Go. Tow, toe, toe, toe, three. You got two more. You do way more than you thought. One more. Good now. Give me part from the bottom. Good stretch. Half way up. Good. One, two, three. Up, one more. Good job. Good. Good. backwards. Booth. Whoa. That's a lot of stuff right in there. Good. That looks good all after. Yeah. You do. And that's why I don't know why more people won't talk about that. Because it's something that I've been doing for the last 20 years. It's been like your foot position has a lot to do with it. Not just back in the day, it would be like, okay, toes and toes out, doing all those things. But literally just going toe straight, you do feel like you're in that upper claw, you know, the rest of the Morrison, everything that you just mentioned, you're going to feel that in a different, it's going to hit different. So that's why doing those things are going to add up again. It's not going to be overnight, it's like a 1% 1% 1% 1% adds up. Very cool, man. Good. Good. Good. Good. Drive. Good. Good. Now we're going to go toes pointed. This roll. This roll. Let's go. Go. Tose pointed. Go. Good. You can get that glued down. You're going to stretch and you're going to drive. Excellent. Good. Good. Again, keep that took point like a ballerina. Go. Again. Go it. Again. Again. Come on. There you go. Easy, easy. Oh, yes, this leg is strong. Go. Good. Toto, toe, toe. Now, part. Go, toe, toe. Now, part. Go. Go. Right there, good. Again, toe, toe. Again. Again. One last one. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Put it off. You're in the back. Good job. It's one leg. Good job. You're in the back. You're in the back. pull that. You're gonna hold that, you're gonna hold that for 10 seconds. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Good job. There you go. Good. Okay, so position. Toe position is going to be a regular. Toe's up towards the ceiling for the first four and then we're gonna go to the toes point. Let's go. Come on here. Yeah, rock and roll. Good. Bend that and stretch out that upper claw. Good. And then you're going up. Good. Good, good, good, good, good. Again. Good. Excellent. Again. Good. Right off the bottom. Excellent. Toe. Out point. Got a point. Point, point, point, point. Good. Good. Good. Point. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Again. Good. Okay, now we can pick up the tempo now. Go. Five, four, three, slow, a little bit. There you go. Right, there's a little bit. There you go. Right, there's a little bit. Bad, it's good. Good. Slow it down. Two, two, two, two, two, one more. One more. You got partial, let's go. One, two, and you're done. That's it. That's it. Good. Awesome. Good. That's your breath. Catch your breath. Now go right back into that front relaxed pose and let's just hold that for a few seconds and just see how that feels. Right? And then we push that there you go. And then we'll do a little bit more. That's it. Just right there. All the way up into the cabin. Good. Good. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Good job. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. So I want you to go right to there and back up. Just pass parallel. You don't have to get so deep in the hole right there and back up. Good. So I want to try to keep a little bit more tension in the plot and back up. That's how you do it. The biggest difference is the fact that I feel when you go so far, you actually start to release a bit of tension in your plot and then you have so much of a extra-transfer to glue. So I have to do that. Yeah. And that's why I wouldn't have you do that. So what I want you to do for today and it's up to you how you want to do it going forward but just what I would suggest is actually just breaking parallel, keeping tension on the plot and then coming up and seeing how your body is going to differentiate itself from what you were doing before and how it's going to differentiate your quad growth versus like, see building your butt because as you go too deep, you're just becoming glued builder. Right? What we don't want is your glue is to be too big because it actually makes your back look smaller on the back poses. So you want to have big enough glue but with your problem, you're going to have your glue to out-angling all the rest of your body parts. Very enough. Very enough. How do you do that? Um, do you want to respond today? So you tell me how many of you are talking about you? Tell me a minute. So what's the tip? We add weight. And then we put it over plate on and work our way up and just remember just past parallel and right back up. Keep the tension on the plot. So I'll be as right. Just a tad bit lower. Right there. Right there. Excellent. Right there. Good. You just slow it a little bit there. Right there. Good. Up. Good. Excellent. Good. Again. Good. Good. Good. Good. Take your place and you want to quarter or plate. Let's go. Well, what do you think how nice of all those are? I would always err on the side a little bit being a little bit more conservative got to mean the start was quarter and then quarter. Quarter. Good. You got to go on. No matter. Good. Good. Good. Excellent. Excellent. Good. Good. Good. Keep a moving. Good. Good. Good. Good. Time to grow. Good. Come on. Come on. You got to go in. Keep going. Keep going. Good. Good. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. And drive. That's it. Last one. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Pull out. Good. Put it on. Good. Hold on. Okay. Hook. demiş. Left hold up. Press your back. Good. Up. Good. Drive, drive, drive. Oh, good. Come on, go in here. Let's go. Who's solid, solid, solid, solid. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Drive. Good. Come on. Come on here. Let's go.

Good. Keep going. Again. Good. Again. Good. Good. Up. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Let's go. Go. Come on. Come on. And drive. Drive. Last one. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Show me. Let's go. Let's go.

That's it. That's it. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. All right. All right, guys. So just a reminder, if you're looking for any of the workouts just like these, go check out the FST7 app on your ambot.com and you have a full library of all my workouts. Very, very big tip here is the fact that you do not want to just kind of fatigue yourself with long, warm upsets. You can do three to five to do a warm upsets, especially when you're much deeper into that workout. Good. Good. How's that weight? Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Right there back up. Good. Just like that. Just like that. Again, go. Good. This is your working set. Now, let's just sit. We're going to finish throwing together. We're going to finish throwing together. Go. Good. Keep a moment. Keep a moment, brother. Go. Good. Up. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Excellent. Up. One more. Right. Up. Good. There you go. You're like, which handle waschannel? I was the worst really. I'm just going to say that. It was a little bit of panic mode. For now, the first person. It did not deploy. It was the second one. Good. Good. Just a little slower on the way up. Not so explosive. Perfect. Good. But just go a little higher. Good. Go. Good. There you go. You know, straight near Lake stretch stretch stretch stretch. Now, curl. That's better. Good. Good. There you go. You know, straight near Lake stretch stretch stretch stretch. That's better. That's the right. That's a right. That's a right. That's a right. Good stretch. And drive. Good. And you guys just so you notice, I like to be able to spot at the ankles. So that way, I can feel exactly how much I need to help versus on the machine. Good. Good. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.ерor. Slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slowly got one more, big positive. And you work the negative. Right here. Mull that, pull that, pull that. Hold it now, I'm going to give him a little bit of negative here that's how you do a score. So we're doing a straight leg done lifts. We're doing this error style, which he is brazing against. He bar long to do the same. There are Smith machine where you can do this on a rack and again. Very, very isolated. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You got this. Good. Good. Drive it all the way up. Oh, my god. Drop it. Good job. Excellent. That's all hands from you. Good. Yeah. No, that's very mobile back. It's a straight-lake deadlift. But your hinge and your posterior chain. Very focused. Very, very isolated. Again, multiple ways of doing it. This is a way that really does not allow you to cheat. And I've seen it a little bit more than James became a little more popular. And I do feel like it's one of those exercises that if you really hit a plateau and you want something that's going to allow you to get you that next level. And you've been doing the basic straight bar belt, straight lead deadlifts where you're doing just dumbbell and you want to be able to really isolate. This is going to really hammer the shit out of your handstrings. All right, guys. So, which thing, how does the workout? It's not that. It's on. It's like so much fun to learn from the goat. And like I said, just an immense experience. It's very, very humbled to be here in your gym and have you invited me out here seriously. It's like, um, internally grateful so thank you, man. No, thanks for coming out. I know. It was one of those things that we talked about it. And then all of a sudden, again, you're such a go-getter. You hustle online. You do so much content on YouTube. And a working man's bodybuilder, right? A lot of bodybuilders do not like to work. You got to just have to get him to stop because I've seen him. I've seen his filming guy. That is a videographer. The guys are crushing it out there. He definitely makes sure you check out his channel because it's just growing tremendously. And I like the fact that he's taking the bro science, taking the real science, and then he's combining the two, and he's actually utilizing it on himself too. So, it's not just a matter of application, but also being able to utilize that and then focus on sharing the journey. So, again, honey, Eric.
