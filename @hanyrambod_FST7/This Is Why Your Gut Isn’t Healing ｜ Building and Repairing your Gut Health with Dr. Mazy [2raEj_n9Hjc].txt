Welcome to the Truth Podcast. I'm your host, Ronnie Rambad, and I have a very special guest in the house today. We have Dr. Mozi here who's my GI doc. Dr. Mozi say hello to all of the Mr. Bodybuilders and all of the wonderful trainers and everybody else who's listening to this broadcast. Hello everybody and it's truly an honor to be here and I am a guest hunter-alleges here in town in South Lake Texas is my practice and I did my training in I went to UT Dallas to do my undergrad and did my medical school training in Galiston University of Texas Medical Branch and did residency in Fellowship in San Antonio and back to Dallas so kind of been all over Texas. Where's your medical school? In Galiston. Galiston. Okay, so not far. Not far. Just right outside of Houston. Yes. Yes. Very humid down there. Very humid. A lot of mosquitoes. Oh, there's a lot of mosquitoes everywhere but especially on there. There are ginormous mosquitoes. Yeah, so I you know I live to always preface different things with stories and and when I got to meet Dr. Mozi for the first time you know it was funny because I was getting ready to get rolled in right? Yes. I was getting ready to do my colonoscopy you know and everybody that knows that I just turned 50 and I do my colonoscopy every like three to five years and it's when you find polyps and we're going to talk a little bit about this you need to go more often. Correct. Right and I think the recommendations every three. It depends. So depends on the size of the polyps and the number of those polyps. So generally if the polyp is greater than a centimeter or you have three or more polyps than it's three years and then anything after that like if it's like only one or two little polyps you can go as long as seven to ten years if it's you know we generally in the current guidelines as you can go seven to ten years some of us still recommend five years because we've seen that rise in the rate of cancer. So but you know it just depends on the type of the polyps and number of polyps and the size of those polyps basically. Yeah and what they had found polyps made way back in the day and back in California and so it was something that when you get to it early enough those are pre-cancers cells basically and those polyps if they're removed and I believe you're just kind of burning them right or is that point is that kind of what you're doing? Well they're from techniques of removing the polyps depending on the size of the polyps. So generally if there are like you know small and millimeter polyp or two you know we can just pluck it off with a biopsy forseps if there are like anything greater than two to three millimeters now we have a little snare kind of like a lasso but around it and we're just kind of cut it off and if it's sometimes the polyps is just too large and we have to use a little bit of heat and and we do that so but it just depends on the you know the size of that polyp but we have different tools to remove the polyp so. Gotcha and once you start seeing those obviously what happens is those are pre-cancers cells and are all polyps considered pre-cancers? No so there are different kinds of polyps so we have the adenomas which are considered the pre-cancers type of polyps and those are the main ones that we want to look and look for and remove because they're the ones that if you don't remove them some of them have the potential of turning into cancer and there are the hyperplastic type of polyps and there are kind of benign polyps that they don't have the potential to turn into cancer of course if you see them and there you know there's a big one we remove them but if there are some people have many of those tiny ones right close to the you know in the rectum or something we typically can leave them alone because they really don't have the potential of turning into cancer so we remove them with some of the pathologists and we have a pretty good idea when we remove them what kind they are so we give you an idea hey the next colonoscopy will be probably in three years or five years or seven years or whatever and then goes to pathologists and they're viewed and they can't confirm it you know sometimes we're wrong and so hey this polyp was completely hyperplastic and based on that we can change that interval recommendation for you say well your polyp was completely benign you can come back in 10 years on the series of changing your family history which is very important or you develop a symptom because not everybody reads the book and there are people that kind of fall outside of that bell-shaped curve and they make those recommendations nice so again this is all geared towards the incidence and the rise and incidence of colon cancer and being that I wanted to be able to share the wealth of knowledge that you have with the audience because as I was speaking earlier I go in regularly and there's a lot of talk on Instagram and as well as social media TikTok about now stool tests right and some people just don't want to do either the prep that's necessary because you got to drink a ton of of poop juice and I call it poop juice just you know it's sometimes of I think it's like what is it potassium citrate or what are they using yeah that's magnesium yes there's different there's different varnish and that prep basically cleans you out you got to drink it several times the day before to go into your prep for the colonoscopy because obviously you can't have any poop left you got to let completely clear clear you out so that your GI doc you know doctor moths you can get in there and be able to look at everything and make sure everything's okay and like I was mentioning earlier what when I'm away for his met I was like you know there's not very many Persians and Texas right especially in the Dallas area and then when I was you know getting ready to get wheeled in I was like wow I got one of you know I got I think the only Persian GI doc in the 30 mile square radius or 50 miles square radius got the L Persian cowboy there you go is that what they're calling you now that's it that's it and and it kind of runs in the family because I know your wife's also a doctor too yes yes she's an endocrinologist and she manages obesity and the GOP one agonist and all those medications that are hot in the market right absolutely I mean a lot of bodybuilders are currently very into that people in general have been using it for weight loss but and and she would be an amazing house to so if guys if you would love to see uh moths these wife um it go into the comments and let me know he'd like to a board certified endocrinologist would be a great conversation whether we're talking about GOP one HRT any of those things because I do want to be able to give you guys a broader sense of what you're doing because whether it's for yourself or whether it's for your clients you know uh we just hit a million on YouTube which is fantastic we also are obviously streaming the podcast through all the different channels whether it's Apple whether it's through Amazon or any of those other spotifies make sure you go ahead and go in the comments below and let me know if you would like you know what you liked about this particular episode any questions you may have just in case we do a follow up and then also if you'd like to see someone like moths these wife who's an interconologist because I want to bring in some specialists to be able to share as much as we can to be able to really you know broaden up our base because it's been so bodybuilder and related but now I really want to be able to to get deep in the weeds with some of these things because again if you are not getting checked out what is the recommendation right now for colon cancer and colon cancer screening is it 40 is it 45 what is it now so it used to be 50 right and then we saw this rise in colon cancer in younger populations so in 2021 we lowered the age 45 and that's for an average risk screening there are patients that have a family history right so they have a family history of colon cancer or a large polyp we call those advanced adenomas and then you should get it sooner than age 45 right so usually 10 years earlier than the then the person like first degree relative like dad, mom, you know children, siblings these are considered the first degree relative so but for somebody that doesn't have any family history 45 is the is the average recommended for colorechocancers screening but they're different like you mentioned briefly about stool study I mean stool testing and things like that and there are pros and cons to to all of them so colonoscopy of course is the gold standard because we can actually visualize the colon and when we find these polyps we can actually remove them okay so the problem with like colorechocancers and all those things I always tell my patients if you are absolutely not going to do anything what so ever then colorechocancers better than nothing right and that's basically taking a stool sample and then they normally send it in and they do basically check the stool for DNAs and things like that but that test can miss actually it can miss 8 to 10 percent of colon cancers meaning that you can have a cancer sitting in there and it can miss it and it can miss a large number of polyps like the simple added almost we talked about can miss up to 80 percent of those polyps okay up to 80 percent of the sample added almost the advanced added almost it can miss about 40 to 50 percent of those and so the goal of colonoscopy or anything in healthcare should be more of a preventative thing and colonoscopy is really a preventative test. Colored and things like that sometimes it's like I mean okay well we diagnose cancer in you so we didn't really do a whole lot we just diagnosed cancer and you instead of preventing it so it is colon cancers now the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and it's one of the most preventable cancers so I always tell my patients I mean yes the prep may not be the I mean it's not the worst thing you've done it I've had it done to even though I'm not 45 I've done earlier because I was just paranoid and I see colon cancer all the time and I said I want to get mine done and and the prep yes it's not fun but it's not the worst thing that you just you know is to taste of it I mean you just added with some clear liquids of Gatorade or something and you just drink in there different kinds of preps I want to the audience to know that this there are used to be you know the gallon of go lightly and go lightly is a misnomer you always go heavily it's not it's a misnomer it's not go lightly used to be like the big gallon and now we went to the smaller volume preps like the soup rep and you know all those are a small volume preps yeah you can take those and there also pills you can take there's sous tap that's a pill but it's 24 pills and there are larger size pills but you get 12 and you still have to drink a lot of water with it but people that don't like to taste of that liquid they can do pills if they're okay you know so allowing 12 pills at the time but it beats the alternative which is the colon cancer and you can really reduce your chance of getting this deadly disease because if it and even if it's early on and it's diagnosed colon cancer you can still at stage one you can theoretically cure it because by a recession and things like that but once it spreads then they're likely to have surviving it goes significantly lower yeah so so again as bodybuilders and as my audience who eats a lot of meat and they have a lot of different you know whether it's red meat chicken I mean just the high protein all of the things that are also known to increase the risk right this is one of the reasons I wanted to bring this to you guys because not just because I turned 50 and I've been doing this that was my second colonoscopy and being able to sit down and say okay great you want to be preventative but I also just because of the fact that I'm seeing these different tests the you know the stool test and people don't realize it might or might not tell you you have cancer but it's not going to pre-screen for the polyps that are going to actually cause cancer right yeah it's not a preventative test I mean sometimes luckily somebody has a positive call like art and they come in and we do a colonoscopy and we find polyps sometimes it's false positive and it gives you a lot of anxiety can you imagine like you have a cancer detection test or call a garden they said tell you it's it's positive now you have to wait until you get into get a colonoscopy right to confirm it whether so the amount of anxiety creates for people waiting I've had patients are like can I just come into more I just need to get this colonoscopy down I can't sleep I can't sleep I wouldn't be able to sleep I don't blame depression you know if I if somebody tells me hey you potentially could have cancer in there I wouldn't be able to sleep I would be up thinking about it all the time and so so just it can be false positive you know we have hemorrhoids or something have a little bit of bleeding in terms of test positive and at that point you have a test so the actual blood in the stool can also so that is where it positive yes it can turn out positive so it's not really looking just for cancer sales percent it looks for the DNA and I'm blood in the stool there are two components we don't exactly when it's positive it doesn't exactly tell us which component was positive just says that the test was positive okay and especially in bodybuilders and lifting and hemorrhoids are very common and you know if it turns positive then it just gives you an unnecessary anxiety until you get your colonoscopy done so you know I'm just I just always say you know just get the colonoscopy done remove those pre-cancerous polyps reduce your chance and you know live a healthy life and you know the diet you mentioned is also important I've been seeing a rise in colon cancer younger population I don't know exactly what how young have you seen I mean I've seen a 20 year old with colon cancer I've seen a 30 year old with colon cancer well really no genetic background is if you have genetic stuff then we're meeting a lot where they bodybuilders or were they just just regular we don't we don't know right so I you know this hasn't been proven but I have my own theories right this is my personal thing it says you know but I have a feeling that it has to do with our diet and the processed food and even the microplastics that is you know and everything that we drink water out of the plastic bottle right there you know right and so I have a feeling that these are probably contributing and the stress and anxiety people are more anxious nowadays and you know stress plays a big role in a GI tract I mean we see that there is more serotonin receptor serotonin production that got then the brain actually and so we see that stress and anxiety overall it can reduce your immune system your immune system is not working as well and you know it can cause you can maybe it's multifactor it of course nobody I cannot tell you exactly what's rising the rate of colon cancer but there you know they are just my personal theories so sure yeah I mean a lot of people are talking about the processed foods using a lot of industrial ingredients that are just I mean some of the stuff was even banned I know they're trying to think about trying to pull from the US market but I mean what is your thoughts I mean again just your personal thoughts on like thighs and artificial dyes and in those kinds of things do you feel like that's still like kind of in the same category as the processed foods where you feel like the risk is also increased because of the problem I mean it hasn't been really a definitive study on it but I mean to me anything that is not really natural a process I mean made up you know it can I mean but we don't know we don't know for sure exactly what what's the likelihood or is it really doing it or not but the chances are it is if it's not natural and so that brings up another point of the importance of introducing fiber into our diets and so I know a lot of body builders do a lot of protein and things like that which is which is needed but also adding the fiber is very very important that fiber kind of you know helps you promote more regular bowel movements kind of getting rid of the toxins and you know fiber in general is good for your heart for your cholesterol for the liver for fatty liver disease so I always recommend I always tell my patients you know get some silly and husk powder which is in metamusol but I don't like metamusol per se because as I added it is actually going to give you ours because we're about to come out with ours and it is all natural flavored it's a silly and husk with a little bit of prebiotic as well and I again for the reasons more so not because of bowel movement per issues but because I know it binds to cholesterol as a binding agent I to be able to help the lower cholesterol helps with satiation it helps with also blood sugar there's so many different things especially when you don't use the sugary one because regular men don't use so has a lot of sugar in it and there's a sugar free one but then they also have a synthetic sugar in there that's basically like an aspirin based versus using something like stevia based so what I did was I was kind of selfishly kind of made it for myself because I was trying a lot of other brands and I'm like you know what I just should just make one but again I was doing it more for the cholesterol because I know that it helps with binding brain and reading a lot of the studies and also helping with blood sugar and then also just being able to be a little fuller at night so you're less likely to snack but I think that when you recommend the fiber do you recommend a 10 grams a day is it like a supplement side what do you like so I always say you know total fiber of 25 to 30 grams a day total yeah and so that that can include your fruits and vegetables right and but if you not I mean and everybody hits 25 30 grams of fruits and vegetables you know in terms of fiber so if you don't you're not you know you're not eating fruits and vegetables all the time you can always add the psyllium husk you know five or supplement to it to get to that 35 the 25 to 30 grams of fiber okay and then in regards to also hydration it's such a huge component right because it doesn't matter how much fiber you have if you're not properly hydrated right what do you recommend to your patients in terms of water what is is there a certain amount of liters is it you know at least 60 ounces of water okay and so and and water like you mentioned is very important because fiber can actually the psyllium husk per se can be actually constipating if you're not drinking enough water that's right because there's expands right if you can still cut if you ever have a psyllium husk and you drink it right away it'll actually puff up or right gel right so it becomes a gel and so you know of had patients that are like well you know I took this and I'm now more consipated on what we're drinking off water no what it's important to have in adequate amount of hydration water or something to kind of at least 60 ounces to kind of get the fiber working and you know make it do what it's supposed to do basically got you so mechanic go ahead so if for those that you don't don't really know 60 ounces is just just just just under half a gallon 120 ounces is a gallon so just under half and again if you're working out you're getting that in no matter what normally you're getting in about three liters um 3.78 liters is a gallon so I recommend to my athletes and everybody out there try to get in if you shoot for about three to especially during the hot summer months if you're shooting for four like a gallon you're going to hit three your fine three liters but again especially if you're training if you're taking creatine if you're if you're really sweating profusely and you're in places where it's hot or humid you got to really make sure that you're staying on top of it because it can really affect that now going into a little bit more the gut health because again it's it's just completely intrigues me because now everyone's trying to understand the gut gut biome is dialed into everything from your immune system to even your mental health right um what are the things that you are either taught during medical school or things that you had taught been taught through symposiums you've done or any kinds of meetings where you've learned more about that because from a lot of the things that I've looked at when it comes to medical schools they're very it's very black and white they don't go into like the wellness portion of it right um is that's something that you guys got into in medical school you know because it wasn't very long ago you're not you know 75 years old right you know you're under 50 so you're you're relatively still a young man and been into medical school did they teach you any of the proactive you know wellness types of things whether it was supplement related whether it was gut biome related or is that stuff just still not really being taught they're not really being taught to be honest with you so and and a lot of gut microbiome stuff still in the research phase so we still I mean there are certain things that we just you know for example seed effinfection which is causes a lot of diarrhea and patients which we do still transplant you know we used to do it and how it's there are actually microbiome pills or animals that you can do to treat that but it uh no in medical school we didn't really talk about these things a whole lot because and a lot of it's still in research and I think the future with the microbiome is wonderful because I think I think even obesity there are studies that you can even cure obesity with microbiome you can do a lot of things with microbiome I don't think we're there yet but it's an ongoing research and it's a it's a very attractive heart debate about about microbiome and they important so I think it's very important and I think a lot of it you know even the whole even some degree of aeridical bowel syndrome or you know abdominal pain or like said obesity even diabetes and certain things can have you know probably has to deal with with our microbiome and if you were just going to learn more as we go yes yes it certainly research is there and we're working on it and hopefully we have better data and better information on how to use the microbiome because I've seen patients go get the microbiome testing done and I get these papers of like different things and I'm very honest with the patients I'm like I really don't know what to do with this information it's great that we know it but we just don't know how to manage or what to do with the information you have and you know there's uh there are companies that sell different things and they say it helps with this but there's nearly not a good research behind it to support those things yeah a lot of that stuff also is just conjecture right there people are just kind of exposed to so many different things on the marketing side um let's talk about probiotics you know I know that my previous GI doc back in California recommended them right especially if I went through a cycle of antibiotics for any reason if I'd do it through a Z pack or whatnot to try to do that do you also kind of believe in in in reintroduction with some type of probiotic it depends right so I always tell my patients probiotics help some there's not a big body of research behind probiotics and prebiotics but I have patients that take the probiotics and it really helps them okay and if that's the case I say continue with it right because there are some patients that are they really benefit from it and there are some and I tell some patients that if you try it and it's not really helping you then don't waste your money so much money right so but there are not a family members on probiotics and they love it and I'm like well continue with it if it's helping you if it helps with your bloating if it helps with your abdominal pain take it it's not going to really harm you per se harm your wallet it's expensive but uh but if it's uh if it's something that is not doing a whole lot for you then it's probably better not to take it right just if it's not visibly beneficial yeah I mean even my my previous doctor in California he knew it worked for same same exact mindset you had for for some but not everybody but what he would do say is that if I had any patients it says well what brand do you recommend and get I selfishly whenever I need something I just designed it for evegian but um so we have a probiotic now that's got a great spectrum but back then I didn't have it and I asked him what brand do you recommend and he told me something very funny he said buy three of the top rated brands whether you go on Amazon or go to the store you know like Whole Foods and then what I want you to do is take a bowl okay and I want you to take out all of them and pour them and mix them together and then basically you just kind of average them out and then go ahead and take two of these a day and and I go well what about the dosage and what about this and he's like no no no just cover you're making it over complicated and this was his way of basically covering his bases right but he just said this is what I do so I recommend and again I don't think it was horrible because this was again 10 years ago but at the same time I do feel like because of the lack of training there's a there's a there's a huge disconnect and I feel like I can't wait to get more of that in terms of medicine so that there's a more of a wellness component in there so that there can be actual more wellness training and medicine versus it being just something that's procedural or whether or something you can sponsor suitable and so I think that again you know whether it's doing probiotics or whether you're doing like digestive enzymes right like I know we also make digestive enzymes that I take when I'm using you go out and have kubita right and I burp less I have the digestion is way way better I'm not you know again you do something with a lot of onions and garlic and it's something that's heavy or if it's barbecue and I'm having a digestive enzyme I can really feel the difference and how how my body is able to absorb it it doesn't feel so heavy but I think that those things are also still there's there seems to still be a line though with okay made that I mean what is your thought on that process have you ever used digestive enzymes before or anything of that not about had patients that use it and they love it and they're like it really works on me and I'm like continue with it and so you know it's so diff because the GI track is so depends on your microbiome like you mentioned depends on your stress level depends on what you eat right like bloating is very very common a lot of people have bloating and bloating is generally in of course a benign thing most of the time but it has to do with what you eat so we have our patients go through this hard process of eliminating certain foods that are known to cause a lot of bloating and then then reintroduce it back into the diet and then kind of keep a log it's a very tedious process culture uh well like okay what when I have the onion I guess it's a good elimination type diet all right I mean it's a we have put the patient basically on low-fod map diet which is certain foods that are known to cause a lot of bloating and gas and so we tell our patients well eliminate these kind of foods we have a little hand out we give our patients you know do it's that's like the onions and broccoli yeah certain foods that are cause a lot of bloating. Thank you. And so and so the patients usually you know it's hard it's not easy to go through this elimination diet and then the reintroduction is also you know gotta bring them one by one and see okay want to have this I have the blood so keep a log and then you have a list of foods that they're your trigger foods basically and so I mean if you have those foods it's not I mean you just get bloated it's not the end of the world but yeah it's it bloating is very common and it's one of the most challenging things to treat because we just don't know what kind of food I mean we used to even acid reflux right hard burn yeah and that's very common too yeah and and some you know it's divided some people say well avoid the acidic food avoid coffee and you know alcohol and this and that and yes to some degree those are the known foods who cause acid reflux but it's not not everybody it's so we we started I'd start telling my patients well maybe my coffee doesn't do that to you maybe you know bread sauce does or something else so that's your trigger for that's the one that rather than giving this general blanket statement to avoid all these foods I just say well avoid your trigger foods and that's different different for every patient so so that's that's a challenging thing because everybody is a little bit different and so you know like I said I can't just tell the patient what avoid this and then that and patients like well what if what if I take that and I'm okay well it's fair I mean if you're okay and you don't it doesn't give you hard burn or bloating then it's okay to take it but it's just depends everybody's so different so do you think it's race driven at all it could be I mean I mean we know fatty liver disease is it's more common in Hispanics and South Asians we don't do we have a proof no but I could be it could be related that could be related to the genetics you know your parents you know if they had a lot of part burn that you're probably tend to have part burn too the time you eat you know I usually tell my patients don't eat late at night you know absolutely or don't eat an exercise immediately after eating you know give yourself a few hours before you know especially in your world yeah and when people you know I would say just if you if you have a meal don't exercise immediately right yeah you want to go do squat right after you had a heavy meal yeah because you know it's gonna come right back up exactly exactly no that's that's all really good advice in regards back to the to the gut do you feel that there's things that you're seeing more and more that's become prevalent here in the last five or ten years I mean do you feel like that people with the red meat versus chicken or any of the things the foods that you're seeing that could be causing these polyps and it be cancer cells do you like what's your gut telling you I'm pardon upon but yeah so I think the diets that are high in red meat yes I have a feeling that they tend to have more polyps and things like that because you know red meat I mean I do you think it is in the red meat do you think do you think it's a contaminant where it's like it's better to do like again organic foods and grass fed beef and and all these things where it just just I think it's just the nature of the red meat with the nitros and all that how it breaks down and things like that so of course I mean that's a whole different debate on organic versus non-organic exactly and there's many people go back and forth with this and that and that's that's a they you didn't afford it guys by all means yeah make do it you know but but especially the people that are listening to this that are younger they're in college I remember I was in college I would be buying up you know stakes are a line for like a dollar fifty a pound and then I would you know at the butcher it was at the vans grocery store next to UC Santa Barbara where I was going school and and I was pre-med actually at the time getting my bio degree and I was competing as a bodybuilder and I would see it on sale and I'd by 10 pounds of it and it was half the price of lean ground beef and it was at 97% lean so I would just have them ground it they'll trim whatever still was left on the stake and I'd pay a buck 50 a pound you know now it's ten times that and what I would do is just put it in the freezer and then I would make a sauce and then I would do it with rice and then have my rice and beef a couple times a day and then I would have chicken because again you're trying as a bodybuilder you're trying to get protein throughout the day to keep that positive nitrogen bounce so that you can be able to recover so whether you're doing egg whites or you're doing chicken or you're doing beef or tuna all of these things and then say okay well now tuna you got to be careful because of the mercury then you got to worry about like the chicken because of all the hormones now the beef because of hormones you hear about the vaccinating animals now and that could also be affecting you and then you have like we talked about earlier microplastics I just like there's like no way of getting away for that yeah so that's that's just our culture and our environment and I think you could just do your best as much as you can but I mean if you cannot afford buying organic then you know it's un you know like can tell a patient could just go buy all organic things because it's expensive and so do your best you know beyond a you know fiber fiber fiber I always tell my you know patients fiber is very important that can reduce the chance of a lot of these things so okay great so basically fiber and is there ever a time where you feel like there are certain things you recommend like I guess my thing is that what do you do when these people are coming to you with IBS and they don't know what's from and I remember going through it with my gluten intolerance and it was a doctorate Stanford who I'd seen about 15 years ago and he at my stomach was just they couldn't figure out why I'm having all these issues and ultimately what ended up happening was they ended up saying look pull gluten out you didn't test positive for gluten but let's see what happens two weeks later my stomach sold down then all of a sudden you know the random diarrhea went away and I was like I went back a month later and he says how are you feeling and he said much better and he's like okay well it's also a fructose test so he gave me the crystal fructose to see if anything happens I test a negative for that and he says you don't have a basically or I'm sorry I said fructose but it's actually lactose it was a lactose crystalized lactose where when you drink it then you have to blow into the machine to see if there's any residual by product to see whether or not your lactose intolerant came out negative of them that so again just they wanted to just make sure but I felt way way better so for years and years it was just gluten for a gluten free which is very very restrictive right what is your take on the whole gluten situation is it you know how how do you feel about it so when a patient has symptoms of bloating diarrhea or even constipation or after I'll know this comfort I was checked them for celiac disease right so that's that's a test that I always do it you can do it through blood work you know make sure they don't have celiac disease and if it's negative it doesn't they could still be celiac negative but be gluten sensitive right so it doesn't rule out gluten sensitivity so we can always do what you did some cut out the gluten see how you and of course not the easiest thing to do but nowadays you see easier with all the gluten free options that we have and there are patients that do it and there symptoms go away completely well like when maybe you're just gluten sensitive okay and so if that's the case well if you're exposed to gluten it's not the end of the world you just pay the price by being bloated or having symptoms but if you have truly celiac disease that's a different problem you have really have to be very strict with gluten you cannot have gluten because it's a whole immune ramped up immune reaction so so it is very reasonable for patients that have a lot of bloating and symptoms that sound like maybe a gluten problem to eliminate the gluten and say hey don't take it for a month or two see how you feel if you feel well then you know we have our answer but some people doing like I didn't really notice a difference but maybe gluten is not the problem so we can do that with you know lactose and all those things too kind of like more of an elimination thing rather than rather doing all these expensive testing because you know you know your body the best and you can feel the difference and you did or sure when you eliminated gluten so that's that's usually my way of doing it you know just talking to a patient like hey can you think you can give up gluten from month or two see how you feel and some people doing they feel great and some people doing it they're just the same so if that's the case then gluten is not your problem so yeah as long as we rule out the celiac disease right yes I got tested I was native for celiac but again whether it's gluten sensitivity and then to take it even a step further to go down that rabbit hole I started getting a lot of people telling me hey look next time you're in the Middle East or you're in Europe see if you can eat their bread and see if how it goes and I was like I don't want a touch bread right I remember coming back from a trip a mr. Olympia competition 2013 and I was with Phil Heath and he had just won the mr. Olympia and we went to Europe together and he had done the Arnold Classic and just won that and I had the worst food in Spain because they didn't have any gluten-free options so I ended up having just a bunch of meat and some salad and I got on the ploughed plane in San Francisco I was living in the Bay Area at the time and I had on my driver was driving me down the 101 and I said look can you find me some of the eat and the guy's like absolutely not a problem and it's like midnight and I said what's open and he's like hey there's an in an helper and I was like okay I can just get like a protein stop so I went there and I just said you know what I hadn't had any real food forever I said I'm gonna have some stomach discomfort I ate the bread with with the bun and I just said let's see how bad it is my body hadn't had it in so long that I went home and I started vomiting yeah and I was vomiting for hours and driving me my wife she extends around to me fairness and she goes she goes don't ever do that again she goes you kept me up all night throwing you're not even worried about me but I paid the price but and but then I went back several years later and went to Italy and I was able to eat the bread and it didn't bother me and so again after hearing stories and talking to other athletes and people that were going back and forth and some celebrity clients I ended up asking them hey do you have a difference do you feel a difference because some of them were like gluten sensitive and they said absolutely I don't have the issue and some people think it's because the the roundup that they use in the soil here that was destroying the gut but because it's on most of the the wheat based products that's why when you eliminate it it's it's your sensitive to to to the chemical or also the GMO because it's a while their stuff is non GMO and it's not allowed in Europe that maybe allowed here the food supply is very different have you experienced that yourself at all or any of the anybody that you know of had patients saying the same thing that they when they when they travel their symptoms gonna go as a way when they come back here I mean they have their tried to food but it's hard to prove it right so but you make sense I mean I trust my patients when they tell me something well you know your body the best I mean if you had it there nothing happened you come here so it kind of goes back to the the diet we have here so I worry about the type of food we have here it's just I think we all do again enriched grains things of that nature I know they can modify it modified fortified there's so many things that they've done to it where they don't even categorize bread in Europe our bread is bread it's not allowed to be categorized as that so that's kind of scary and then I go when I eat meat chicken and I was in Kuwait and I was eating chicken and I go wow this is the most amazing chicken effort and I was at a Persian restaurant and we had jjikwap jjikwap and I was like it just doesn't taste like just because normal chicken just doesn't taste like anything then you go there the middle east I was being Dubai or Kuwait and I'm like wow it's just different or when I'm in Italy we were just there for almost a month and eating their food it's just the much more flavorful but it's also very easy on this time like you would eat pasta pizza and we'd lose weight yeah and you're like you have less bloat I mean the other thing I do feel though that helps that is the fact that you're walking so much in Europe you know you're constantly walking that helps a lot for processing um versus just being here you just get in your car anywhere you go you got to get in your car over there we're constantly if you're in Rome we're in Venice or we were in Lake Komo we're constantly walking we were doing on average like 15 20,000 steps a day and so that also helps but I do feel like the digestion like you can just feel like you're not bloated you're not burping you're just again not note no diarrhea and then I can't right back I was like I think it is sandwich and my stomach was turning I mean it's not I mean you leave a bread out here on the counter and it can last two three weeks nothing happens to it right and then a bread in a different country goes bad if like you've been in a few days and they'll be really exactly and so that's not normal for the bread to last that long on the counter so there that has to be something in it to kind of preserve it and so and then yes walking is very very important for the GI tract and even patients that are in a hospital for a long time that can't really move their that bounder in a bed so that that regard GI tract really slows down so walking is very very important walking hydration fiber limiting red meat all these things getting your screening colonoscopy things that you really can do to help yourself and back to the I you know the whole irritable bowel syndrome also has to do a lot with the stress and anxiety right we live in a world that's everybody's always working and doing this and doing that and maybe in the European countries are more common and you know we're mental health and other stress of a daily living and so stress plays a big role as I mentioned earlier because that is I even their studies that meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy works better than certain medicine for irritable bowel syndrome Wow so getting a medit if you can do some meditation every day five ten minutes I just started doing it for the last well last 28 days really yes and I can see the difference what do you see I you just look at life just you know and just take it as it is and you're like well this is just part of life and you accept it it helps you with the acceptance and I think that's the biggest thing right is that we all are trying to control outcomes that we can't control anyways whether it's the news on your phone whether it's just being able to deal with just politics all the crap that people get rubbed up about the most and I feel that that's exactly what it is it's like you're trying to let go and I think with me taking the the time with the family I took a camera and and found out when we were in Europe it really helped to step away a bit so that you can again just kind of enjoy life because you're always chasing chasing chasing right I mean you're a sport sort of medical doctor and you're still very busy you've got a lot of things going on but it's just being able to relax is very hard to do because we're always always trying to level up there's always trying to do something whether it's your in our practice whether we're doing it in our business whether we're personal trainers and we're trying to be able to get the best of half weeks out there I think it's always or your competitor and you're trying to come up with a next show it's really hard to reduce stress and I think social anxiety's uneven worse with social media because everybody's so tied to it Instagram you know TikTok all the different Snapchat Facebook back in the day and still people use Facebook too but in general I feel that that's a huge thing do you feel that that that stress also do you ever have to have those conversations with your patients about that stress all the time okay all the time I mean I focus a lot of time with trying to just you know things that we all have anxiety right and this is what we do about the anxiety is the most important thing so I always try to talk to my patients about mindfulness and trying to live in the present as much as we can and it's not easy right so that's what I'm doing the meditation myself right so because I I also we're always living either in the future or in the past right what did we do in the past or what what's gonna happen tomorrow what's gonna happen this or what if this or what if that rather than just trying to kind of live in the and the meditation is basically teaches you that to live in the present to focus on the breathing and it becomes a practice it's not like you're just doing it for 10 minutes and you do a you know it's like a checkbox I did my meditation for 10 minutes and that's it and you go back so even you do it over and over again like set up been doing it for almost a month now it becomes kind of like when I mean that moment of anger or anxiety or something I am now able to take the pause right and then kind of pause for a little bit see what's going on and get through the problem before I act you know before before this I would just we all very reactive right something happens and we just act very quickly right and so now I'm able to pause a little bit think about it before I do something so that I think that's like our parents when they use a scream right exactly and they just lose it and it's the very person thing to do and it's not so that that's an important stuff meditation I think so yeah I mean it's becoming bigger and bigger and I feel like what you're saying is very important because people don't live in the present and and be able to live with intent so it's very important that people be able to take a page out of this I think Dr. Mozi has been doing a great job explaining not only the factors of what gut health is about but also mental health and being able to be able to balance it because they're so intertwined right your gut is so intertwined and I feel like there's going to be more and more information going out I wanted to just I know you're super busy and I do want to be able to ask you about a couple of supplements like some of the people in the office were asking about creatine do you know anything does it have you noticed anything with creatine or amino acids or or any protein supplements that were causing any issues in a long or creatine I mean it can falsely elevate your kidney function right and so but it is fairly safe there've been many studies on it and you know it really doesn't I'm okay with patients taking that when they come saying that they're taking creatine I'm like well I mean if I if I get your kidney function and it's elevated I know why it's for letting me know because then I would freak out I'm like well why your kidney function I have normal and so but I haven't really seen a lot of problems with it and the more of because I I looked that at it for myself because I'm like oh maybe I should take some creatine you know right I'm exercising which is takes them okay I got a guy who could get I know a guy so I was just looking into it and I'm like oh okay well so I did some search and I asked around I even asked a friend of mine was in a phrologist and they're like it's it's just falsely elevated it's not a real value so I'm okay with that some of the other supplements it depends on where they get it and you know it's important to brand of the supplements and if it's from reputable place or not because some supplements that are not you know that have a good quality they can really cause liver damage and cause abnormal liver enzymes and you know that's one of the most common things one of the most common things we've seen are clinic is abnormal liver enzymes so I always ask about supplements right because we don't we don't know but if it's a supplement that we know and it's from a reputable name then I'm okay with it you know we'll just rule out other causes of liver enzymes and you know we may briefly pause it for a maybe a month or two see if the liver enzymes improve and if you know if it improves then we'll maybe because even the medications that are studied extensively they're like given the FDA approved medicine or antibiotics taking sometimes cause abnormal liver enzymes right so so maybe that type of supplement is not for that person so if that's the case if you stop it and the liver enzymes normalize they'll tell the patient hey look this was probably from your supplement if it doesn't make any difference and there's still want to take it and then they probably can go back to it so it's just depends. Oh that's good that's good information and like you said it's very very mildly regulated when it comes to supplements so anybody with a credit card can go out and make a supplement company but you don't obviously know exactly what's in it so you again dealing with a reputable company right yeah I have my company but whoever's products you use make sure you trust it because ultimately you're digesting these products you're ingesting these products and they can be harmful so make sure you're getting with a company that's reputable who's going to be doing third-party testing and making sure that everything is very very above board because you could be taking something that's super cheap and again Amazon's had issues without in the past with getting products that have just not been properly tested and then the end up finding out that hey look this is not a good situation and then people end up getting sick about red wine that was another question what is your take on just whether red wine white wine any wine alcohol like on the gut health what is your take on that is it just moderation or is it something where are you guys seeing anything so you know some doctors that are just like anything with alcohol in it is bad it's bad for cells it's bad for your brain cells it's it's just it you know basically you can just basically each you up from the inside then there's other ones that are just very doctors that are very more into just okay moderation a little bit of red wine red wine is better than white wine but just making sure that you're not overdoing it what is your take on it on alcohol also there is not a quote and quote safe amount of alcohol right so patients always ask so what's kind of have one or two I don't know there's not there's everybody's different right so but based on guidelines maybe you know guys can have like maybe a couple of drinks and and woman can have one drink a day or something so you know that's the limit per say but there is not a safe limit a have patients that have one or two drink a day and they have abnormal liver enzymes and they should stop that right there are patients that do that and they're fine so again I'm a man of moderation mostly so if I mean if you want to have one or two drinks here and there's probably okay red versus why I don't I don't know I mean I don't think there is I mean well we said maybe red wine is a little bit better for your heart and this and that but I don't know if I can back that up with any scientific research personally so what are you drink none of you know you're not in beer no okay okay you're you're a gatoring okay yeah awesome awesome no I really appreciate all of the you know going into this again I know you're super busy thank you for stopping by you know the the podcast studio I can't wait to be able to just as we speak and again I'm always constantly referring people to you you know because you've done an amazing job when you have a doctor who gets you in you don't remember anything and you walk away and you're like yeah that was that wasn't bad that was okay then he gave you the good stuff he got I was able to do the procedure no issues and whatnot and then even even Nick Evegen Nick came over and saw you and again he had to get a rush and was able to to book time with you so again we got Dr. Mazir Malakuti again appreciate all of your time and of course you know I know your time is super valuable so thank you for sharing with the audience everything that we were able to go over and I can't wait to be able to at some point but love to talk to your wife about the hormones are you got a regeek out on those here and she loves talking about those things and again please get your screening colonoscopy if you can it's not it's not bad I mean you get anus you get sedation you're I mean the day before yes the prep may be not the best thing but you know if you can if you can get it I would restrain the recommended high fiber diet healthy diet meditation water so it'd basically healthy things I think that would go a long way and at the end of the day if there's a problem with your booty call Dr Malakuti I love it I love it thank you doc appreciate you honey rambo Dr Malakuti and that's the truth字幕
