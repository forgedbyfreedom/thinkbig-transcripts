And then we're going to add more. So guys, we just remember when you're doing these working sets later, you don't want to end up doing 15 to 20 reps to get tired. Then you won't be able to do those working sets later. So make sure you stop it about eight. Then add more weight. There's no point in just trying to go up a T yourself by doing 20 reps. Let me do a shorter explanation of that one. Let me do a shorter explanation of that one. I think this is a good one. I'm just going to put that on the ground. Good. So the reason why we're not doing 15 or 20 reps is because you don't want to go to the T you want to eventually go to failure. Use a warm up, use a warm up, and beat 10 reps. That's it. Stop. Add more weight. And then repeat. Okay. What do you throw a little bit? Deeper. Yeah. So deep. Oh, wait up. Go. Is it too heavy? Go warm up? Good.
