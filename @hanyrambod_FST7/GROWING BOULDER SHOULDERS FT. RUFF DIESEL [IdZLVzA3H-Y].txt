I'm supposed to be all you two. Come on. Come on. I got eyes on you. Let's go. See? Oh, now I'm gonna help you. Huh? Drive it up. Drop it up. Drive it up. Oh, my God. I'm gonna get it to the three more with me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. One, one, two, one. Two, one. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What's up, guys? What's up, guys? I'm here with none other than Mr. Ruff Diesel himself. I'm sorry. God am out here in Dallas to be able to train. We've been talking about this for the last year. Yes, sorry. Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm excited. I've always seen this guy for years. I mean, when I started in like two down 14 or 13, I had been seeing you. And this is like a drink. I'm true. So, you know, I'm excited to see what the FST 7 is out about. Yeah, man. So we're going to get to put him through an FST 7 workout. We're going to do primarily shoulders. These shoulders and arms. We're going to get to do a little bit of both, which is amazing. And I know he wants to try out some of the chest equipment to panata. So we're going to have some really good fun. But, you know, and again, if you haven't seen the podcast, we just did a podcast right before this. So it's going to be awesome. We're going to throw in some loud raises here to warm up and then work our way to process. Sorry. Sorry. Good. Good. There we go. Good. Good. Good. You should bring the jewelry. Good. I want to stand top of the breathing. Good. Good. Good. Now what you're going to do is we go up. Go down a little slower. Okay. We'll do it some more. Yeah. Yep. Now we're going to do two just like that. Two more. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Go up up front front front front front. There you go. Good. Good. That's it. All right. Go in, rack that. Next step we're going to do is we're going to do some rear delts. We're going to do some rear delts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You like that on? The pumps already coming. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Two is we'll take the 18. You're just going to bend over our shabak slightly. Then we're going to do a lateral raise here. Okay. So again, just try to keep your palms facing downwards. I'm this side. Okay. So I'm going to worry about the negative. Go on the eccentric. Make sure you control it. A lot of people get it wrong by going in just dropping the weight. We don't want that. Okay. Okay. Good. There you go. Good. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Here we go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. So we're going to do the same thing. But we're going to do the same way. But we're going to do it with pinkies. And it's going to isolate a little bit more of that rudder. Okay. Your pinkies up. And so you're going to be dumped together. And then out. And you're doing a great job bringing it back. Nice and slow. Okay. So just that's the key. Because again, the number one mistake people make on these rear del exercises is they just drop the weight. They end up just relaxing too much and not having the eccentric tension that's needed to be able to really activate that rear del. Two. Excellent. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good. Perfect. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You're going. Good. Good. Keep going. Two. One more. Good job. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You feel that? It's been short a little bit. There you go. Nice and wide. Like that. Last week's. There you go. That's good. Good. Hold that. Hold it. Good job. So what we're doing is we're going to really focus on the rear del because I feel like I need some rear del. You need some rear del. But what's going to do? The rear del is super important because as you go into the side to be able to really look at the process on that side pose, you need to have more depth. And that's where I feel like you're lacking a bit. Okay. When you start to really organize the workout, the prioritized rear del at the beginning, you're not tired. Like you would be like, it's like, it's like training paths. Yeah, we can. We should be doing them at the beginning workout. Not after you're doing quads and hamstrings, right? Because you're not going to do it or you're going to barely do it. So what you want to do is you want to prioritize the weaker muscle crew. And at the beginning of the workout. So that's why we're going to go into heavier weight and do the same exact exercise again. I'm going to troll it and really hit more rear. And then go into the stronger body parts. So we'll start off with the weaker first so we can get more benefit. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. There you go. Just to get that better isolation. You feeling that? Yeah. Control. There you go. That's it. Control. Yes. Come on. Good. Good. Oh, wow. Keep going. You got four. One. You got this. Two. Three. Good. No. That's for safe. That's for safe. Maybe three. Okay. Our Quebec. Just a go. One. Go. Two. Go. One more. One more. Good job. That's it. Cool. There you go. So again, what's so important about this is that as he stands from the side, we want that depth. You want that bowling ball look, but you want it to be complete. Not just the front, not just the side, but the back to roll into that turtle shell back. You guys all want. It looks like you just literally got a turtle shell that's been just bolted onto your back. So as you're starting to fill that out, you have to be able to make sure that on the side poses that your rear del keeps up with the front del so that you don't end up having that slope shoulder. Good. Good. Good. One more. One more. You got this. Good. Nice this long way down. Perfect. Oh. Good. Nice this long way down. Perfect. Nice one's motion and drive it. Boom. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Watch your tries to kick it into with your top. Boom. Keep going. Good. Come on, T. Good. Good. Come on, T. Good. Good. Come on, T. Let's go. Keep rolling. Good. Good. Good. This one more. Good job. Should we put down? How you feel up in the quarter-off? Yeah, yeah. You're going to keep it to eat 10 reps. I think it's enough. Yes. All right, yeah. All right. Be sure to think of how your shoulders are going to the con state. Think the front relaxed. Very good. You want to get that thickness in the belt. That's what this is going to bring out. Okay. All right. Let's go. Top. Top. There you go. There you go. Forget to breathe. Two. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Breathe. Don't forget to breathe. Good. Good. Good. Good. Drive. Easy. Go again. Go again. Good. Good. Good. Good. One more. Good job. Feed down. All right. So this is where now he's getting the rhythm of the machine. And now he's actually getting stronger. So what's important is that we're going to actually add a little bit of weight now. I think she had nothing too crazy. Maybe like a 10. And then throw that on there. Okay. You know, how do you feel? You want to go 10 or you want to go ahead and put it played. We didn't put a play. Okay. There you go. Okay. You got this. He's 10. Let's go. Boom. So you get a stronger with every set. Two. Good. Three. Good. Good. Go. Four. Good. Five. Good. How far there are six? Good. Seven. Eight. Nine. Okay. Now we're going to really work two more reps. Okay. Let's go. You got this. Good. Easy. Good. Good job. You got to have some weight on their brother. That was easy. I'm so, I'll give you a reference. When I've lived there with like Hunter and Nick and I'm Nick, I've done chest that with Nick and I'm pretty much on for her. He does a few more reps with same weight, same with, I don't know I could do more with with a lot of stuff than really. Yeah. Yeah. And then I want you to put your pounds. I don't think I need 100. I think I need 100. Yeah. He's like 280 right now. Yeah. I don't think I need 100. He's like 280 right now. Yeah. He's pretty really. Yeah. Yeah, man. Let's go. Oh. Oh. Drop it up. Good. Keep going. Good. Come on. Three. Good. Good. Oh. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. That's a strong one. Keep moving. Keep moving. You got it. Oh, you. Yeah. Come on. I got eyes on you. Let's go. See. Oh. Drop it up. Drop it up. Good. Oh. Slow. Slow. Nice and slow. Good job. Good. Oh. There you go. Good. Go on. There you go. Good. Good. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Okay. Doubting a little bit more. Good. I just want to go on this all the way down. down to right before you end up having the stack on top of another. You do not want to let it relax. Okay, so what we'll do is just go ahead and stop your set. We're going to rip it. Add away. And but don't don't cut yourself short. Make sure you come all the way down without the stack losing tension. Okay, and then from there, arch it back and just drive up. Again, and the key is not to go too high because you don't want to end up kicking in too much without trap. Okay, so I want to go just slightly above parallel ground. Okay. And then back and arched so that you don't end up throwing in too much of your traps. Okay, you do this. You can just start and it's almost like a, you know, like doing through more of your delt and then throwing it on the same as shrug. Okay, we want to try to really hammer those delts. And if you're more upright, you need that lateral head and that's going to give you even more width. Okay, up on stage. Okay, and it'll be like man, that one workout. Yeah, one first of whatever. You have your own FZC set workout before. That's it. Oh, good. Leave the elbows. Good. Down, down, down, down, down. Right there. Good. Keep the tension on there, but go as close. Low as possible. While keeping tension. There you go. Now you're working. Now you're working. Good. Now you're working. Go. Keep going. Now you're working. Good. Go. Good. Go. Yes. Two more. Two more. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, good. Good. You got one more. Good. You're chest up. Good. Slow, slow, good job. And then we got one more set. Breath for another set. We'll do it. One more set there. And focus on, we're going to focus on keeping your chest up. Keep your core tight. Same thing. Perfect height. You're doing it exactly great, great pace. And awesome tempo. Yeah. Great shot. Just remember to breathe in. Good. Good. Don't. Good. Let's go, Terps. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Keep going. Go. Go. Good. I can guarantee you you can do three more. Go. One. Two. Three. I guarantee you can do three more with me all the way. Two. Good. Good. Good. Go. Go. Go. Go. Now good. Slow. Good. And then we can go off the bottom. And you can five parcels go. Go. One. Two chest up. A little higher. Good. Four. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Last set. Make it work. Go. Higher. Higher. Higher. That's it. Woo. That's it. I love the count as good. Oh, yes. One more. Yes. That's what we call that. The Persian exchange rate. So US dollar exchange rate. It's a very, very skewed exchange rate. It's like one and close guys sometimes five. Sometimes it's skequel to ten. You know, whoa, that's it. That was good. That was really good. Good job. Good job. Just a little water. Stay hydrated. Get your water. I think I'll let you know. Over here. They put looks and you're skin and they look. It looks to me like you might end up having under hydration shoes. Like you're not hydrated. I'm not hydrated right now. Honestly. Yeah, I'll tell them like, I didn't, well, obviously I didn't drink. I want to travel. I don't like to drink you much. Yeah, they got pullover and they drive. Also, but just make sure you stay on top of your water. Okay. If you use really something else. I need it a lot. I sometimes do need to go. Yeah. How could you tell? That is kind of like, I can tell why it's kind of what about this? What about the skin? It just dirt. It's a texture. Yeah, texture. And I know that if I blow you out, I mean, like if you have your super hydrated, your skin's going to look thinner. And when you're flat, you're going to have this almost a thicker skin look. Okay. Okay. And I can get little bits and pieces of it where I can see it. It's certain areas. And I'm like, well, I know if you made it up having two or three more of those, you're going to have a whole different look. Okay. You're going to say and that's the best thing. Yeah. Well, that's why I'm saying it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We got filtered water out there too. So we're going to refill that for it. Okay. We're going to get you some more water. Go grab the uh, sit us in that room. Yeah. So just right here. So and then um, so what we're going to do now is I'm going to let you drink the hydration for like down to like half of that. Yep. And then when you're done with that, then we're going to do one FST-7 set. Yeah. So that's why I want to get you to rest a little bit. But also hydrate. And you said you were cramping a little bit. And I said you look at the hydrated. And then you said, oh, yeah, I was camping earlier. And again, it's a good time to just hydrate it. Then as you get a little bit hydrating, then we're going to go ahead and hit a good set so you can get a pump because you are not hydrate properly because you've been taking non enough fluid or you're not enough. You don't have the electrical light balance or you're taking too many stems. Yeah. And then you end up even with this. Like I told you, I'm not used to even doing like that. Like 200 milligrams out off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So when you start doing a lot of those things and I feel like get that rolling, we'll push it all into the shoulders and then we should get really super 3D and just forget to blow it out for the shoulders. I'm not F.S. He's having a sack. Yeah. So we're going to have some fun. All right guys, so we're going to do a reverse drop set on this one. So we're going to start off with probably about 22 pounds. How much do you normally go up to on your ladder raises? I can probably get up to 35. 35. Okay. So we're going to go go do 22 26 and then 31. Okay. And then as we go higher and weight, we're going to go down and reps. Okay. So we're 20 20 reps and we're going to go 15 reps and then we're going to do 10 reps back to back to back. Yeah. I'll do my best. How about I'm a little like a food. But I let's give you all right. 22 for 22. 22 is my two sort of better for for 20 reps. Yep. All right. I don't do my best. Okay. There you go. Let's go. A little slower only. There you go. Good. Good. 15 16 17 18 19 slow down slow. Good job. Okay. One two six. Ashcrut for second. Good. Now grab them and we're going to be doing 12 or 15. Okay. One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 two two two two 11 and 12 good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's your breath. All right. We're going to go from the 26 to the 31. Okay. Okay. Catch your breath. We're going to go down under eight maybe six to eight range. Okay. Let's go. All right. Go. Make sure you go wide. One two three four five six seven eight two more two more partial one one more Good job. Good. All right. Good. Right over here. Come on. Right there. Okay. Let's must you over this hit it. That's it. This squeeze. That's it. Good. That tight. There you go. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze three seconds two seconds one good job. Oh. That's it. And then just turn around and see the little striaches in there. Yeah. You see how much more striped you are and how tighter you are. And that's just that's room the great pump but it's also from hydrating. Right. So I said I can tell that you're dehydrating your skin looks so thick and how you can see the striations and I said see what you're going to look like after you drink this much fluid and bowl. Right. So again, something that you got to stay on top of. Make sure you stay on top of your hydration. Now either it's not wide you can long drive. You didn't stay on top of your water because you don't want to pull over it by mess. But at the same time, but just make sure you go into the gym and make sure you're hydrated and make sure you've got your intro fluids going to. I'm going to go. And like more chest up or just right there just in the back. Good. Don't swing the bottom. Good. Keep going. Put on it. Go go go. Go go good. Go this is it. Go ahead. Good see more. One. Oh, two. No. Good. Good. Okay. Get your breath. Get your breath. Get your breath. Get your breath. Get your breath. Sorry. You have a preference like on this way or this way. Oh, both. I like to do both. So here you do is on the one that you're doing right now. Your palms down. It's perfect. Give me the last one we're going to do. We're going to do a ring with thumbs up. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Two. Three. Three. Three. Two. Go. Two. Two. Six. Go. Go. Two. Two. Two. Two. Three. Two. Two. Go. Good. This is it. You see it? Okay. That's your breath. That's your breath. That's your breath. That's your breath. That's your breath. All right. So instead of going heavier on this one, I think you're going to end up doing like four by breath. Yeah. I'm going to give you the same weight again. Just get your breath. And then we give you the same weight again. But where do you see it? Thumbs up on this one. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Good. Three. There you go. Good. Three. Three. There you go. There you go. Go. Go. Good. Good. Four more. One. Good. Go. Go. Three. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's how you do it. Okay. Wow. Oh, good. That's good. That's good. Amazing. Amazing. Good. Good. Just a moment. Good. Good. Good. Good. Just a moment. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. So hold it. What I want you to do is don't bring your forearm into the biceps. Okay. Open it up because what you do when you're narrowing yourself up when you start to really get your forearm Touching the bicep. It starts to make you look a little bit narrow. Okay. Open it up a little bit wider. Okay. So a little bit. There you go. And there you go. And there you go. And there you go. And there you go. And there you go. Yeah. Yeah. If you just right there because when you start to go too far in, you start to end up losing lines. Okay. Right. So just open it up just a little bit. There you go. Hold it. Good job. You're so long. So up to the shoulders. Yeah. You're just like this. It's filled like I looked down. Yeah. He's like. Yeah. Now do a side chest right here.

You are the best. Yeah. The pump was covered in that. guys yeah so the pump was crazy I got some little heavy wigs some things I didn't have to go with heavy which probably helped out my joints quite a bit you know even with the elbow stuff I've been dealing with didn't feel any of that with the hem across the knee and the other nice I think that again didn't go crazy properly warmed up also noticed he was dehydrated so give some hydration powder make sure you can hammer that but notably he ended up driving four hours didn't want to pull over every two minutes but at the same time it's so important that it doesn't matter how much you know metric oxide precursors you take if you're not hydrated it's you're not gonna get a pump or you're not gonna get the full potential of which you could in terms of muscle fullness so super important and also what was really cool is the fact that we got to do some posing yeah and your 14 15 weeks out right now yeah and from the Pittsburgh Pro looks great for worries that obviously he's gonna come down in another almost 20 pounds yeah right so 20 more pounds so we've got to definitely have you back so you can be able to come over and see some you know progress yeah in shape next time yeah yeah so we can get a little bit more out of the bowing to yeah yeah but tweets a little bit opposing cases some things to work on but now man I appreciate you of course of course yeah yeah thanks for coming by those are great time honey randomized rough dec ked
