There you go. I'm worth it. He's no more. Come on. Come on. Next. He's gross, bro. Okay, let go. Hey guys. Kimodo. Laura Lee Shafato. We are here at E-Vigen. Get ready to bust off the show to workout. So you guys pay attention. I'll also on the workout. We'll have a full lot of fun and we'll share a whole lot of knowledge. Go. Every single day. But yeah. You do I already. E-Vigen baby. Did go. We're gonna get you some stuff so we can pop you up. I know if it's inside of me. I got it. And down a little bit. Now some of you back out and load that. You're sweating. Actually I did. I did. Really good. I came down. Got way to get to. Came back up. Fuck three pounds. Locked it up. That's what I mean. That's what the nag is. Yeah. Now I got to pull my musculos back up. So I don't like to go like skinny men. Yeah. It's two of the people going to you. You okay? You sick? No, not sick. I really was asking me because they're facing so sorry. Yeah. I'm just getting it all the way along. You know, these are a couple of two we do away. Yeah. Do we do we do we do? One could do we do me the way. That's it. This is too high. It losing all of my. So there you go. So I start here just do a little warm up. Let's get your shows over right now. All the way down the ground. Oh. I love this machine. Just got a whole range of motion. Little Bob-Mau. Yeah. Kim said I'm looking for the beard angle. Interesting. Interesting. Enjoying your beard is a shame. You get yourself the different getting an angle. I feel like. Well, the problem is the basis of the thing. You're not making it. I just love how we just see your eyes. I just see my face. I just love how we just see your eyes. Yeah. It's a little bit off. All right. Put it all the way down. All the way down. There you go. Stretch it. Good. Three more. All the way out. Stretch it. Chim-o. Stretch. And just a little baby warm. Is this the first time you've been in this room working out? No. You've been here for the first time. I've worked out that. You took me through the last time we were here. It was just quite off in a round. Yeah. You should all be here with that. So I need to know that. Let's talk a little bit about the machine. All right. So we're using is a power Smith dual system. So what does this do? The power Smith dual system is a Smith machine that Singulates instead of a barbell dumbbells. So what is the advantage of that? Well, you have the independent system. These left side versus right side. So your stronger side isn't going to carry your weaker side. Best number one. Number two. You can turn around and change the angles. So you can go upright for shoulder press. You can go back a little bit to be able to get inclined. And then there is a system machine that does flat and decline in the same format. So it really gives you a full range of motion. And it gives you a safety of a Smith machine. But with the advantages of what a dumbbell would normally do. So that's what pieces are special. Now, like the fact that the machine angles in it angles in. So your range of motion angles in instead of Engling out that shortens that range of motion. This gives you a full range of motion. So a lot of times it would turn in shoulders. We didn't cut off half of it or which I was stronger. This keeps it to a full range. But I like that attack them through. I just want to say that you just put 10 pounds on it. And this machine is already heavy. So you better get ready to spot me because, hello, just sit you going down and push. Let's go. Alright, so what we're going to do is we're going to keep those hands in. Again, you keep the hands in. You keep the range of motion for them. The independent like honey was in the independent ratio. It really helps to balance the sides out. But we want to bring this all the way down to it. Almost touches the top crown. There you go. Sometimes we shorten that and we lose the bottom tie in. Just going out stretching it all the way down. But what it also does is take the cheat move out. So you can't bounce it or cheat off of it. And that's where your tempo comes in. So we want to get that little pause at the bottom. Good stretch. All with there. Here goes. Good. Come on, I got you. These are the builders right here. Squeeze. Come on. Three more. Always make sure you keep that back flat on that head. Two more. Don't arch your back. Don't push through the legs. Use your delts. One more. Like a little rowing travel. Try it. All the way. All the way. All the way. All the way. Good. Don't you come down slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Stretch. Good. Okay. Just step to the side here. What we're going to do is we're going to do a little burn. So sometimes what I like to do is when you get your first exercise in, I like to get the muscle warm. So supersetting them together. We can go heavy here. Get a lot of our strength stuff in here. Come by right behind you. Get into the fast twitch fiber. Get the burn going really warm up the shoulders. So we're going to do lateral raises, palms down. We're going to come straight, pause, and come down nice and easy. Okay. Straight, pause. That pause is important. Because again, it takes the swing out of motion. Notice how she's keeping her lower body so soft locked in. She's not bouncing her knees. She's not bending. So the number one problem we see is coaches are girls or guys. Used too much weight and then they use their traps. Right. So by being able to walk that in, she's not forcing her traps to kick in. She's been, she'll take the tension off the delus. So right now, by being able to really go nice and slow and controlling the motion, she's putting all the tension in her delus on a trap. Because if your traps get too big, you're going to end up looking narrow and I'm going to have that really nice pillow. You got it. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Down to the ground. Three. There you go. Take your time. Two. One more. Come on. You got it. One more. Oh. Now let's come down slow. So you just get a little bit of negative there. Good. One more time you know. She's getting up. She's not. Here you go. Good. Good. All right. She's not moving. Oh, she's getting out of the way. She's getting out of the way. I didn't think much. Five. Round two. Right. Welcome to No Wrestling. This is Kim Houdos. Good. We got time. We're ready. That's what night time for. That's what baby. We don't like that. All right. Round two. Here we go. Let's take a look. Yeah. I'm going to have five in my body. I really have five. Sorry. We'll make it the best driving. Okay. Here we go. I say we want to. Oh. Oh. I'm going to have five in my body. I really have five. Sorry. We'll make it the best driving. Okay. Here we go. I say we want to. All the way. Good. What? Excellent. Two. That's your good. Four range. Great. Come on. What? Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Three more. You got it. You got it. Take your time. Two more. Orange. One more. Here we go. Five. Come on. Come on. Come on. Five. Down nice and easy. Here we go. Flo. Spire. My God. It's back to you, Dumples. Here we go. Good. And you notice we have just a very slight bend of the elbows. So we're trying to keep as much of the work as we can in the deltoid. Like honey was seen. We don't want to activate the traps. So she's keeping her chest up. Sheen up. And she's putting just that little pause in there. Just enough to take the swing of the motion. Good. Come on. There you go. Come on. Five. Slow. Excellent. Four. Come on. Three. Here we go. Five. Three. Here we go. Two. Slow. One more. And a negative to it. Hold it. Now. Here we go. Easy. Easy. Easy. Excellent. That's what we talked about when we did a little interview. Sometimes athletes become their own worst enemy because they feel especially with like men's. They feel like they have to push to do everything. And you don't. Sometimes taking a step back like you did. You take a step back and you let things settle down. Let your body get healthy. Calm. This happens. It's a fresh, healthy, ready to go body. So it's going to be fun. We're coming to a stage. Need you that? Who? Who? You. You. All right. So see. Round three, baby. Teacher. Did you get to know Rass? Is that a thing? No. Not so much with mine. Because we mind. What happens is you're trying to rest enough to be able to get to failure. Where with this, you'll also want to go to fatigue. So your combination of adding in a little bit of action. You know, right up. That's it. With the winning. It goes to different phases depending for where you're six weeks out of the WW. You don't want an injury. So it's not like you push him when you're like 12 weeks out of where. Okay. This is the time when we're focusing on muscle. It doesn't. Now we're focusing on the fine. And we're fine with this. This. Yeah. I like the. It's not seen. We are six. I feel it. You're going to sit. Yeah. All the way down. There. Yeah. Oh. Full range. So if you notice this stretch part of the notion is really the most important. A lot of the area is stopped right up around the shin level. And with this allows you to do just like dumbbells. It's going down low. But having the security of being able to hook it on is next level. So that she squeaks it all the way through. Good. And again, this. Kim was talking about earlier with this particular piece of not a. You have to pay for it. So it's converging at the very top. All the way. Come on. There you go. It's really works at tie in area. Yeah. And she's going all the way down. Getting full range of motion. Getting the stretch at the bottom. And then driving all the way up. Three more. Good. That forms straight. Drive. Good. Two more. Come on. Stretch. Hold. Good. No. One more. Good. Hmm. All the way. Drive. All the way. Drive. Nice. Squeeze. Now slow. Now we're going to do a negative down. She's going to be nice and slow. What Kim's doing is doing it here. A negative slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good. And she's locking. There you go. Here we go. Here we go. Good. Now by keeping her palms down. What we're doing is we're keeping the activation point through the center line of her Deltoids. So depending upon your angle and how you're turning palms, it can change every little aspect of way to hit the shoulders. We want this driving right through the center line of her shoulders. There you go. Good. Up. Slow. There you go. Slow. Come on. Two more. One more. Now what we're going to do is add a firm set here. So down. And once you go as quick as you can. Go. Go on. Don't bend your body. Let me help you. There you go. Let me help. Good. Come on. Five. Go. Four. Three. Come on. Two. Go. One more. Come on. Come on. Excellent. Good job. That's what I said. All right. Final sorry. Our next, the next machine will be just a sink. Excellent. Let's find something. Maybe it's the sheet you got down here. So we just did a standing loud praise. And going to a seated, it just what it does is it lets her lock her body in. So it takes the legs out. Anytime you do anything from a seated, prone position, then you take the chances of bending, bouncing, you take all that out. So this way we can go a little heavier. Get a heavier side, dealt woman in. Keep it locked in. So we don't have any cheat to it. And make those dealt working. To your seat height, you want to be able to have it at such a way where you can come all the way up, parallel, all the way down before it bottoms out. Once it bottoms out, it lost. That's where you've taken all the tension off the muscle. But I love about the panata, that they show you the joint center, which is like your point of access. So your joint that is moving right now is your shoulders. So you can, I want to have that access aligned to your joint. I do it with it. And then you can obviously play with the pinning on your range of motion, like in the same, which we're trying to do. So let me know if you want to get a breeze. I see that a little bit because of the mushy. A line correctly. Perfect. So that's good. Perfect. So this is a first set warm. What we're doing is a warming up. But also be finding out where we are from a weight dispersancy. And see how much heavier we need to go keeping warm correct. Good. Straight up. There you go. Notice she's got her chin up. She's keeping her traps out of it. She's keeping all the work in the knee field. Hold range up. Go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. One more. And op and easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. So you can see how controlled that range of motion is and moreover, understanding and knowing the pivot points, that's important because it's important for athletes to not only do the exercise but understand the exercise. That way you know how that's supposed to hit in that knowledge, they now know what you're down. So good job, Jim. So the even Jim ball. Now we have your buddy. Yeah, Jim ball ball. Evil ball ball. That's it. That's it. How's that felt too? Really good actually. Yeah, great. Yeah, and you know you have a stem flight which would be amazing. You know, I use the stem flight. Yeah, the stem flight is really good too. Because it's all put with that. Yeah, we're going to do a real deal with that, with that stannier one. Same thing. Shut up. Good. So guys, isolation is the key. Target the muscle. We don't want to train shoulders to get a try set. We'll get a four. Everything is targeting in. I'll be covering up. Yeah, you want to see her. But, but, but, but. Good. Come on. Squeeze the mouse. Squeeze. Come on. Let's go. Full more. Come on. Got it. Got it. Three more. Come on. One more. One more. One more. One more. Now full. Slow. Slow. I get it. So, kids, you guys don't know. We've been pinging each other like this 30 years. Oh, my God. Over there. A lot of the holders are hurt. He's Sammy, it's actually up there. We've known each other longer than most of your clients are even bit a lot. Yeah. That's true. That's been a minute. Whatever we do videos, like I do, I can change him. I'm like, no walk from this. He's like, okay, literally, for these productions. Like, I give you guys around all the way. I'm always in walk. I'm always in walk. Okay. I did while I'm on a boat over there. You're not. Always in walk, boys. No. I'm just like, you're always in their break place. You're always fighting. I'm spotted. Because he's even walking all the photos. Right? The ball. Oh, God. That's the ice. We got show to, we got show to purchase from home. Yeah, we got it all. All right, craft. Yeah. So think about coming to this gym. You've got a flex. You've got a flex in this gym. It's like, it's mandatory. It's part of the ambiance. Are you in this gym? Look what she did. Look at the light there. No, if I was just hauling this to now. No, I didn't see you when she did. It's like everything is okay. It's a very nice process. Let's go. Hi. Here we go. Same thing. There you go. Keep chin up. Keep your back flat on that pad. All the way up to parallel. There you go. All the way up. Access. So as you can see, Kim has your setup perfectly between the joint center point. The obligator is shoulder right in line. So if I put a bar right through a shoulder, the right and the mat middle of that camp pit. So if you're too low, you're like, it's that cool. Feel right or just. I can feel right. I'm going to let's go. Go. Go. Squeeze. Let's go. All right. We got four more. Come on. All the way down. All the way down. Three more. All the way up. Come on. All the way up. All the way up. Two more. You got it. Come on. Squeeze. Squeeze. Hold. One more. Just go. Just up. Come on. Up. Up. All negative. Slow. Come on. Come on. Fight. Come on. Make that face. Let's go. Good. There you go. Almost that. Ah. It's wrong. Now I do this. Pretty light. Back up. Right there. Right there. Turn around. The flex. Boom. There you go. Turn around. We. I was actually thinking we're open. And then. There you go. $1 million. $1 million. So million. I don't know. I don't know. You got to think of your bonus. Yeah. Yeah. $1 million. $1 million. Did you can feel the heat? You know, and it's what you want to feel. You want muscles to exert heat because that's your core metabolic rate. So when your core metabolic rate is moving and it's sped up and it's if your body releases the heat, it's not trying to internalize the speed itself up. It's actually hot enough. And it's releasing it. Second thing is the heat coming off the muscle. You know you targeting the muscle. I don't want to feel clammy here and hot back here. Because in it's like we'll keep we're missing here and we're tawking in through here. It's all coming around outside now. We got one more and then we go on to the other end of the deltoy. And if I were doing this at first time, what happened with that? That's in your deltoy. We're going to do a drop set here. Oh yeah. Oh we got it. She's locked in. Not even a flight we're bringing him out of. No. It's tough. But anything. What she's basically saying right now is you get sides that and this is where like what Hime was saying with being independent machines. This is where independent machines come in handy. Because you're always going to have a dominant side. You're going to have one side trying to work harder to compensate for the other side. Her left side is where she feels it more. Is it trying to compensate to keep up with the right side? Doing it independently. You are forcing that left side to match the right side. It's not that you've got to do 10 reps over here and 20 reps over here. Because this side's going to work harder to keep up with this side. You've got to make sure the form stays right. So you make both sides work equally. But again, that's the independent motion that really helps that. And this being a machine rather than dumbbells, you can control the range of motion easier because that those dumbbells are going to move around. You can hold them sheets locked in so it's letting you control one engine. Alright, here we go. Good. Excellent. Everything is up. Good. Good. Good. I'm going to do a great job breathing. She's not holding your breath. She's keeping her core tight. Kim's got her making sure that she's got a really good tempo. She's not going too fast. She's not easy momentum. Because if you use momentum, you're going to end up basically cheating yourself. Okay, now we're going out for you. Good. Good work. Come on. Good. She's got a core still really tight. And she's just pulling. There you go. Two L. One more. Squeeze the�s. Drive it up. Good. Good. Good. Can't escape. Go. Good. So again, we're tapping into that fast twitch fiber. We're burning it out. Good. Good. Go. Go. Three. Keep the core in good. Come on. One more. Drive it up. All right. Fight. There you go. I love that face. I love it when girl. Even though they try not to face them. I like how she. I'm saying girl. I'm saying girl. Guys, we just make on the face. It's just because that's what we do. But girls, they try not to. And when you can give them do a success. Yeah. Otherwise, the bow-tock's face. It's like, this is burning really bad. That was a funniest joke. I'm so angry at you right now. Don't end up having that face. I can't wait to have that. I have so much emotion. Yeah, motion. You're in the emoji. Oh, you out. Come on. All the way back. Good. Let's go some air. Come on. Come on. Good. Good. Good. Drive. One more. Come on. So good. Good luck. Back, back, back, back. Good. Back. Old. Now go ahead. Yeah. Now stand up. What's this? That's for flies when you lay with guns. Yeah. Go on the other way. Okay. Stand up. Grab right here. And right there. Now what I want you to do is pull straight back. Here. Pull straight back. Here. Like that. Now put it once you're burning them. Go. Good. There you go. Good. Come on. Good. Keep them on. Good. All the way back. Come on. There you go. Squeeze. Right there. Good. Come on. Squeeze. Excellent. Squeeze. Come on. Squeeze. Keep your delts up. Elbows up. Five. Excellent. Four. Keep your body still. Three. All the way back. Two. Come on. One more. Good. Yeah. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. I love to see when it targets where you're trying to target. So you can see. See, do not here. That's exactly the back end of the heart. Then we're trying to hit. Yeah. And what Kim was saying is that obviously your body's going to compensate with bigger muscle. Because it's such a small, tiny muscle. So the range is very particular. is very particular. Even I was doing it with Sid and Jacqueline and we all had different ranges of motion. It's not as early as how far you go. It's really how much you can keep the tension on to the muscle. Well, it's what muscles you activate. So if you start dropping that arm line down, it's going to activate all through this upper line. You keep that arm line up and you keep it targeting through this band. That's a hard band to hit sometimes because two things could happen. Number one, you could target here. So if you drop your chin and you turn your body over, you're going to target all through the traps. Number two, if you drop the arm lines too low, you charge the out of line. So this sits right in that little median range right there. So you've got to keep everything parallel to the floor. You've got to keep your chest up. So the squeeze comes out of the rear del. So like a hinge. So as you come through here and you arm back, you're going to hear to there. You want to be able to keep exactly what Kim said. elbows in line through your del. So you can be able to really fatigue your del. If you go too heavy, you get over compensation from the trap and if you bring it over to town. But he said, we're going to start getting more of the upper back. So again, where you want to be is right here and the back. And if you're using dumbbells, you use a peency back instead of it being just palms that way. So if you want to isolate and walk, you're going to be pink and so on that way. So it's all my no. Geometry. All right, you and go. Okay, bring this down. All on the side. There's chest up. It's good. Get this out of the way. There's a little chest warmer. Like, finally. But it is like, it was unfolded and right to go my eyes. There you go. Go on. Good. Now make sure that you keep. Make sure that you keep your chest up. Chin up. Good. So guys, when you tuck that chin, you are going to activate these traps and you roll that chest over, you are going to activate traps. Yeah. So whenever you're doing a rear-down weather, it's on any kind of tech deck or a dumbbell, keep everything on. This is one of those exercises where you do not want to overload the weight, because you will engage all the assistance buss approach really easy. So we're keeping that weight down good. Excellent. Come on. Here we go. Squeeze. Hold. Excellent. It's all really focused on the rear-down. I want to, I want you to feel it right here. Go. Come on. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Excellent. Three more. Come on. You got it. Squeeze. Go about those over me. A little bit more. Shake and baby. Two more. Go go go go. Go. Come on. Squeeze. Go on. Squeeze. Hold. One more. Come on. You got it. Last one. Squeeze. Come on. Squeeze. You got it. Hold. Come on. Squeeze. One more. One more. Burn out. Come on. Just up. There you go. Now all the way. There you go. Come on. I want you to get trapped. There you go. Contract. There you go. So you can see when she pulls all the way back, keeping these levels up right here. That gets targeted. Come on. Good job. Straight back. Excellent. That will always up. Come on. Move on. Let's go. Move on. 10. Go. Nine. Eight. Come on. Go. Seven. Come on. Six. Let's go. Five. Four. Come on. Keep it moving. Three. Excellent. Two. One more. Come on. All the way back now. Hold. Now fight. Come on. Four. Gise. It goes pro. Okay. Let go. You got to pull a muscle. See you guys. It's my beloved core. Yes. So this is what's known as a nice bull round muscle balance. Wow. That's it. I do a front of a bicep. I knew you would. Thank you. It's coming. There we go. Boom. That's it. That's it. You didn't great job. You got so good opposing. You know why? It's really good. It's really good. I responded really well. Guess where to play. This was seen because heavier here. Were you pushing? No. No. It felt like you were pushing. It's called fatigue. Well, you get to remember also the violin mechanics of the machine. As really cannot put together these different machines, he knows where you're getting stronger. So the tension becomes actually greater because he's trying to maximize the actual violin mechanics and the ability for your body to actually be able to feel it. Where lots of times machines are very linear and that's the difference between using a piano piece of equipment and many others is that it's not linear. It's actually in a sprinkled bird of your natural body. So you're going to add you stronger the tension becomes your. Now remember keep them on top. Hi, Eric. Yeah. It's just elbows in line with your ring. Yeah. There you go. Okay. Now let's get that. That's stuck. It's not good with the butter. Good. It's nice. It's like it just come on. All the way past it. Well, if it depends so. Yeah, the tension. The session and the tension. It's the back out. Okay. We're done. Good. Don't just squeeze back a little bit more. Go. Back to be it. Oh, go go. All the way. Eric, all the way back. There. That's bad. Good. Keep them moving. Good. Good. Keep going. Come up. Let's go. Let's squeeze. Let's go. I'm on a champ. Keep your head up. Keep you. I know that left arm is dragging a little bit. So go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. You focus. Three more. Good. Come on. Drive it. Drive it. Good. Good. Good. Go. Go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Two more. Good. It was dropping. It was reset. Good job. There you go. Go. Come on. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Come on. Go. Go. Go. Go. Come on. Go. Go. One more. All the way back. Come on. Go. Keep your elbows up. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Hold. Right there. Hold. That slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good. Good job. There's still heat. Let's go. Let's go. Chest up. And squeeze. Come on. Beautiful. Beautiful. Come on. Let's go. Excellent. Now I want you to hold that squeeze. Hold. That slow. Hold. There you go. Come on. Put a little bit. Little more eyes of tension. Good. Come on. Squeeze. That's just squeeze. There you go. Come on. Good. Two more. Squeeze. One more. Squeeze. Now you bar it. Go. Go. Come on. Good. Good. Good. Come on. Back. Back. Good. Come on. Seven. Six. Come on. Five. Four. Three. Come on. Two. One more. And slow. Tension. Tension. Tension. Excellent. All right. How you feeling? Good. I think my take of whatever I have. Whatever was in it, ain't Daniel Mo. It's the evil burn done. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're shooting. E.T. Extreme. And I'm living. I can't believe you. This I don't shoot with rest it. Some relaxation. How's it going to do? A cuba can do the calories. All right. All right. Here we go. Rock and roll. Good. Keep it up. Go, go, go. There you go. Good. Slow it down. Just a little bit. Slow it down. There you go. Slow above the squeeze. Come on. There you go. One other thing that she's doing is she's going all the way down. So she's coming all the way together to get that stretch. This stretch point is right here. She's going all the way and then she's going all the way to the top. So she's not coming halfway because that beginning is so important that stretch. That stretch position. This is the beginning in the end of the point. So this is the beginning at any point. The midpoint is all the way to the top. That's the midpoint. Good. Three more. Come on. There you go. Go. Keep the elbows up. Go, go, go, go, go, go. You've had it all the way back. Two more. Go. Go. Go. You've got this. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on. Hold. Now we'll slow. Don't drop it. One more. Okay. How was that? There you go. Stop. Go. Come on. Go. Go. There you go. Go. There you go. Go. Now let's just go. elbows up. There you go. Now keep your chin out. Get your head out and fight it. Fight it. Fight it. Stretch. Good. Good. Good. More. Sit. Sit. Okay. That's good. Keep you back. Like Hanmi said, keep that flat right through here. So it's don't activate the subscapitalist. You activate. Right now. Okay. Here we go. There you go. That's a beautiful sight. Good. Don't squeeze the elbows. You get it. Go next.

It's a little late. It's a size like. Jesus, thank you, school. That's your limpio workout period. Put down this. It's great to have not only the champion, but we got none of the living legend. The hundred and your old Kim Oda. I knew it. So we're the men of the lady. I knew the Civil War. Yes. Or a hundred years. It was present in Lincoln and Trinja and Wayne. It's written all the way back. I was in. I was in. I was in. Yes. Yes. So welcome back to Texas. It's great to have you. It's also great to see that all the progression, everything you guys have been doing in the office is in the hard work that you both have been putting in this Olympia prep to be able to continue to continue to continue to be the queen of the Heenie. Let me know. How do you feel right now? I mean, we're just about six, seven weeks. Six weeks, seven weeks. So we were six weeks of Saturday. So it's right around the corner. How do you feel she's doing? How's the progression going? Especially with everything that you guys put into it. And the office is going to halfway through this prep right now. Well, this year's, I mean, every year has gotten better this year. It got even more complete. So at a six week mark, we've never been here before. Her intensity, her focus, how her body's responding. Like you and I have taught having that great. I, you know, breaks are important for where you can take the zeeks to go. Fresh body, fresh look. Yeah. And so I think having that nice break in there to let her mind and her body align up, it really lit a fire to where when we got ready to go, she was go. I mean, it was from day one, go, go. And so long and short of it is the nice part. Now we're sitting here six weeks out. We've got refined that work left to do. We're almost where we need to be. You know, we'll start all of our stage prep stuff. And but we're not going to leave any stone unturned. You know, we're going to do everything we possibly can to polish every angle. Because I don't ever want to be complacent or I don't ever want to take anything for granted. I want to make sure the physique that we put up there is a combination of her work and us doing every single thing we can to bring the best physique we can mentally and physically. Very good. Wonderful. Great. I had a good time. I have fun. You know, it's allowing myself to just come and travel and do the work and enjoy it's part of the journey and it helped me a lot throughout the whole practice. So I'm thankful. Yeah. It's awesome. Because I know you guys were back at your HQ and so you've been spending every couple of weeks together. So I think that was really beneficial. I've seen each other a little more often. And we've intense, right, not just herks and passing that event. Right. But actually being in the same way. Let's make sure we get together. Let's go through a workout. Let's get also any of the actual updates in person that always helps. And you're how many pounds of wear here do you guys right now? Probably three, maybe three-ish at the most. I don't know if we're four. Yeah. We're between three and four but skin prey pro-salt. Awesome. Awesome. Well, the focus has never been this good this far around. You know, and I think that makes all the difference in the world in your confidence levels and you know how how you bring things to the next level and strength. So this like you said we've had a lot of chance we talk every two weeks each other every two weeks had out all the through the other. So we'll come back out to California to be with me for two weeks before. So we can get our accrimated to the weather and you know get her settled. It's all about embark. Keep that environment calm. Keep that environment positive. You'll beat around you guys have been a blessing because you guys help her. You help not only from her presentation but knowledge is invaluable. And anytime she has a chance to talk to you and share experiences on what you have learned. That's that's it. We are tapping in. Everybody we can tap into. Yeah it's it takes a village guys. There's not one to do a person. It works as a team. So you know you know, Kim does his job and so that when she's in doing her job in the gym we can make everything happen. So the programs put together. I help with the recovery aspects of it with supplementation making sure that all the different supplements whether it's a meenows whether it's protein whether it's fatbrothers everything's diled in and all the nuances because everything that I decided was to decide to wrap prep. So all of those things and you know you've been using it for a long time with your athletes but knowing when to pull them in and pull them out because we want to be able to just continue to keep going forward and not hitting platoes. So but you also don't want to overstimulate too. Exactly. And it's all the legs of the stool. You know you got full legs I stewed nutrition, training, supplements, cardio. You get that you get those legs solid. You get solid students. So all this all that all that excess knowledge you know you have a wealth of knowledge with working with supplements and working with elite level athletes. You just pull it all together. Everybody work together and it makes things so much more better. Especially yeah. But then you end up with these counselors. Yeah and again remember you guys it's about your stress management because I don't care how hard you train. If you can't manage your stress you are not going to allow your body to recover properly and you will see those results in and there. So again on your seat right now. Don't miss out on this video.
