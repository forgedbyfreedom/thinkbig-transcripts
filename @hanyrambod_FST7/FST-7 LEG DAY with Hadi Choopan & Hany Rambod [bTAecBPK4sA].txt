Guys, I just want to let you know these are some of the workouts that we haven't posted yet. So these were a build up to the Olympia, the last 14 days that Hottie was here. And we didn't get a chance to post them because things got absolutely crazy with the preparation, the last couple of weeks. But I want to let you know that these are actual workouts that we did not after the show, but before the show, we just ended up posting them afterwards so that we can give you guys a full view of what the training was like during the final stages of the 2025 Olympia crowd. And for those of you that are showing so much support for Hottie, thank you guys so much for this very, very close show. It was an amazing show. And again, I love all of you for all of the support.

Trying to get in the heavy stuff because of the second to the last leg workout. So we usually do the last leg workout the week before the show. We are under two weeks now. So this is going to be the second to the last leg workout. So let's go. Yo. This is big quad training. It's really warm. All right. We're always doing sampling here. So they're given me even during the workout. It's just because of time. I mean, I worked 18 hour a day as lots of times. But at the end of the day, we're trying to make sure that we're getting everything done training and doing product development. So again, flavor extensions on this one. Just the right of it between the two. Come on. Awesome. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Let's go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on. Let's go. Good.

He'd love to go even heavier than that. But what we do is we just kind of negotiate and do a tripset. So he just about roughly about four reps with six plates. Then goes down to five plates and goes on four and so on and so forth. But it's a way of him so feeling like he's engaged in super heavy weight. But not as heavy as he'd like to go because we do recognize the fact that it's only two weeks out. Less than two weeks out now. Second to the last leg workout. So for those who are asking about why he does so heavy, it's a lot of it is mental because he's used to training super heavy. That's it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Good job. Good job. How about you, honey? Good job. How about you, honey? Tell him. You're having a good one. He had to call you. He said he killed that tickler. He really gave him a good one. Hold on. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on. All the way down. Come on. Come on, honey. Come on. Make some effort.ank Éit, all the way around. I'm done.快 off. I'm done. Here. hèê視. Sue. Allez, let you pack my bullshit. Gonna have some new one Ø We just finished up, we got legs and see it. Show him how to do the wall shake. Awesome. Full boot. Holy no. I got the usual. I teach you how to do that. You're saying that two weeks out, very, very good. Working really, really well. Really, I felt that he did not only a good job, kept the stamina up and the strength, and now looking forward to the final push. Again, guys, the only has another really good eight, nine days of training. Then after that, it's going to be just taking a couple of days. Rest right before we show. You have the press conference. You have the neat and great. We have all of those other crazy things that we have in the Olympia. Again, if you haven't purchased your tickets, go out there. I think they're still some available. If you're not going to Vegas, make sure you sign up for the paper view. It's going to be an epic epic show. Again, looking forward to all of you. And then also do me a huge favor.
