today we've got Patriot questions we've got a physique critique and I wanted to start this thing out with a topic you know I look at our demographic on the channel and although we do have a lot of the guys that are like the 24 to 34 we also have a lot of the guys that are like the 40 for whatever 34 to 44 and then the guys beyond that even so I thought it would be a great conversation to have how has our body building evolved as we've aged you know at the end of the day if you freaking love this sport and it's something that you want to keep doing you're not going to continue doing what you did when you were 22 years old so I thought we could just share some tips and maybe I could learn something from you guys and maybe part of this is because I'm going to be honest I'm getting older my birthdays coming up this next weekend so I'm kind of like feeling the age you know what I'm saying but I'm like I'm starting to embrace being the old guy I know skip you've been the old guy since you were like 32 you know wow yeah so I why don't we start with our guest host and Ron last time you were on you were very chill all right listen okay critique this is like producers critique you were very chill you know you were like very like I'm just stepping on a bunch of toes you know we got it you got to get the energy up today you know yeah I got to redeem yourself a little bit you know okay okay I didn't realize I didn't realize I'd put in a lackluster performance yeah you didn't say anything we didn't say anything I thought I did all right you know you have a conversation with your wife right now or yeah we're going I thought I did pretty good but I'm gonna back to finish the job gentlemen I was at you okay yes well how do we want to break it up do we want to start like with training approach nutrition approach to supplementation PED what what do you think the best way to do it is I'm thinking just one thing that you can think of off the top of your head we could go around and I bet you the as you go that's gonna spark some thoughts for others you know okay I got one right all of my supplements are about not dying not in a mergot performance right yeah yeah I just want to wake up tomorrow yeah like my my like whole shelf of supplements it's gone from like maximizing everything yeah I got the creatine and protein powder in there but yeah everything else is about like health yeah but now are you taking the creatine more for sleep than for actual now you have right it's like cognitive you know enhancement I'm trying to fight dementia as I age yeah yeah extra rep is just a nice side effect yeah yeah you said something in the opening side that kind of made me perk up about loving training and loving bodybuilding and everything else I think my position has shifted more toward it's a obligatory because as bad as I look when I do train I look like dog shit when I don't train you're stuck with it yeah it's not it's less about passion and it's more about obligation it's not sort of the levels at this point if I'm leaner and I'm training I look a little bit younger I certainly feel younger yeah I can take four or five days off shelf it if I'm on vacation or something seeing the kids and I'm not kidding I feel 20 years older yeah things start to ache even just a day and I'm one of those guys I'm all are none if I'm not training I'm not necessarily who breeding you know six times a day with burgers and that's like but I'll just not eat I'm tired of eating I'm tired of looking at the clock I'm tired of everything that everybody loves we all love when we first start doing it but here's the thing we'll back in the gym and I don't want to be anywhere else yeah so it becomes now I want people to understand that I'm not saying that I don't have passion for it and I don't love it it's just shifted to this very novel I can't wait to get to the gym I'm gonna get bigger every rep that I do I'm gonna get bigger too now it's part of what I do I have to do it it's therapy yeah and I'm not me without doing it so there are those days when I go I got shit to do I got a lot of crap to do but I have to have my meals on time I got to stay in this familiar comfort zone so that I feel grounded and if I'm not there I'm a giant my life for 32 years so tell you my kids might take I'm a mess I'm gonna have salute can mess what is this then what where am I now yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right and I'm not for what it's worth I do have two reasons I literally had to force myself out of the gym two days ago because every time I go back here my eyes are getting better but since the show I have had either a bacterial infection in both eyes or sties that will not like you can take it up half of my face I'd wake up in it look like someone went to right on my eye it would be stuck to the top in the bottom and I'd be like pulling on it like it's disgusting absolutely yes that would get I noticed it would get worse because it was getting better I go into the gym and I train and I don't know what the hell it is whether it's pressure or what but it just it would just literally just make it worse so but the bigger reason is my rotate my right rotator comes to go nice it's pretty bad when an eye infection won't take you out of the gym even though you realize it but your shoulders getting in the way you train it's now you got arrested yeah yeah I can really tell that I'm gonna kind of echo Ron's sentiment about supplements but more guided towards a PED side of things like for me now PDs or more it's how very little can I take and maintain at least a certain type of look and a certain type of performance and then the choices are also not based off of you know no longer is it anodraw versus superdraw today it's more like am I gonna take MOTC or I'm gonna take an extra dose of methylene blue something that's gonna improve my cognition or my overall longevity and health and I just think as you get older echoing you know Ron's sentiment about supplements for health versus an avalism I think you try to program your PEDs the same way like for me I want to have consistently good blood work all the time I don't want to see red on my on my sheet anymore so a lot of my decisions are based off of that yeah I'm going in for my what is it well you're first rectal exam if you're getting in on your age but for I'll be 49 I'll be 49 this year you're a year away from getting finger bang they don't they don't do that no skip they do they do they've got blood work and then they've got a box my doctor's lying to me she's not a doctor's yet yeah that guy in the alley the girl with the whip and a big weather really heavy set guy here coming out of his nose and anything else come up here hours for you now is a figure with that oh for first yes mistress she's not a guy yeah I'm going for my calcium score so I a little bit nervous you know for that one but I feel like it's gonna be all right well find out let me know what it is I mean curious I will yeah well it's so you know here's one of the things I've noticed and this is also as man I hate using the word educator now you know like everybody is an educator but we've been doing PED education for a long time skip you've been doing it longer than me man I remember listening to the PED radio you know well I was working for the pop company still and my perspective on even like the cycles that I would put out there was a little bit different now I'm thinking about the big picture the long term I'm not as likely to even suggest risks and part of it is I recognize I recognize that we can do a lot more with less than we need to think we needed so you know with more experience it's like you don't have to just dump it all in I know exactly how much we need to dump in you know in there are times that you do need to put a little bit more in it's a calculated risk so I guess that I'm better at that but I pay a lot more attention to you know what those risks are but for me personally my training now is about I mean I'm happy because I'm looking better now being consistent now again for a good chunk of time longest consistency I've been able to have since I had gotten sick in 2021 and I see that continuing to get better but as much as I want that I'm kind of thinking of it as like my insurance policy at this point like the longer I can hold on to muscle in my lifetime the better off I'm gonna be because I thought he was sleeping I'm sorry my bro you have to just pretend that you like what we're saying just like just fame you know just but it's like it's like an insurance policy right I want to have as much muscles I can for as long as I can we are all way above the average you know what I'm saying if you ever even stepped on stage one time in your life I bet you that you're gonna be able to have more muscle when you're 50 60 70 yeah and having that more muscles gonna keep you more mobile in the world and you know less likely to get hurt and all of that so it's funny because I didn't ever think of that stuff like in my 20s and 30s it's like it wasn't a thought of my head at all it was only how to get bigger how to look crazy you know I thought I'd be dead by 50 yeah I didn't even plan I'm like I'm pretty sure I'll be in the ground yeah and not from bodybuilding but just that was my night night like I like 50 is so far off that I couldn't even comprehend like what am I gonna do am I gonna be like an embarrassing home or so that's how my brain I don't mean to give the impression like oh I was trying to kill myself with you but you make a good point from the streets man I got interrupted guys so I'm looking out my window right and I there's there's this movement that catches my eye and because my pool's like right out here there's these two geckos they're going at it the little gecko lizards like yeah like I've never seen a half sex before they literally nature channels going right to it is a yon top of her from behinders or tail in the way is a belly to belly I don't really know I think the tail tail can be cool control I think it's also it might be the mess in leather boots of the web it might be salt because like the she keeps on putting them away the animal kingdom has consent I don't think they do either but I don't know if I want to risk my yeah what would dispatch say if you call 911 yeah there's a guy who are both sexually right now by my pool yeah mine's a scene of a crime I'm gonna get kicked out of my house okay he's my pool we only ones get that hey how about training and we had a great conversation last episode I mentioned one of my clients and we talked about him getting stronger and we ended up getting into a pretty deep conversation about that because you know your take skip was like I don't know how strong you want guys to be getting when they're you know in their 40s and 50s as we age you know there's got to be other ways around it to still be able to make progress you know there are a lot of guys that are still is that is that include the 40s then skip I mean here's the thing I don't want to give the impression or imply that you know we don't want to go into the gym just because we're older and not trying heavy what I'm saying is it shouldn't be the main driver of you know I I have like there has to be this yeah you have to roll about it right exactly so it's still it's still important and it should still be a priority but it shouldn't be at the risk of of everything else and that's just based on primarily my experience going through those ages but also the clients because the older I get my demographic you know like anybody else it changes people will see those parallels know why to come and work with me because they're like yeah he's had some injuries he's been around for a while I'm a dinosaur too I'd rather work with him than work with someone who's 25 and doesn't can't relate yeah I have that experience where 25 year old be like okay see it's got a lot of wisdom everything but he's not really all that cool he doesn't do very much he doesn't have much to talk about other cats and watches so I'm gonna go with this cat that's you know 25 years old and you know those are the parents those are the things you know people don't just come to us as trainers because of you know strictly for our track record and our knowledge these days there are a lot of good trainers back in the day there weren't we're gonna do so now you're matching up to with you know do I have a can I is he really is this person relatable can I have a you know essentially maybe even a friendship you know with this type of person do I like do I vibe do I do we dive do we do we get along versus back in the day we used to be able to tell him even the trainers you're still trying to ride this and it doesn't work you just be shitty to your clients and tell him what to do and tell him to f-on I told you what to do this is what you do you know drop in the hammer it's like it doesn't work that way anymore shouldn't work that way back then but you could get away with things like that you can be a total asked about people would want to work with you now there's this giant sea a turds they can pick and choose there's a lot of people who know what they're doing there's a lot of people who don't know what they're doing all right did we give them anything do we know no not not all all right that's the way I felt to okay it is we all vented about getting older I guess you know that's that's what exactly that's it it was injured you look like you're thinking to something you got anything you wanted to throw in there I was gonna come up with a nice salilic weed just putting it all together but yeah you're good all right well let's talk about this then did you guys hear about the new Olympic Qualifications dangerous brought that up I saw that for matches in the classic right and bikini and bikini so they're going back to a point system sort of yes so want me to read it to you yeah you got it yeah I got it right here yeah yeah yeah let's see what I can I've been looking at it a couple times today so system for classic physique men's physique bikini and wellness so the top 25 in the point standing is qualified for the Olympia all right there's automatic qualifications for the Olympia if you win two contests all right so for people that don't follow those divisions as much there's a lot more classic and bikini shows and men's physique shows than there are open body building there's certainly more than two 12 there's certainly more than women's because they're the more popular divisions they turn to at most of the pro qualifiers two people turn pro in each class and a lot of them okay yeah but for the Olympia top three get an automatic qualification if you get fourth you get 12 points if you get 50 at 10 points so you start off with a pretty nice you know stacked deck right there because if you look at like the Arnold Classic which is now the Arnold the Pittsburgh and the New York the Romanio muscle fest and the Dubai probe would be considered a second tier show okay winner gets automatic qualification and then the points go 14 11 9 and 7 for 2345 and then all other body building shows all are all of their contests whether it's the like this weekend we have the Florida Pro and a couple weeks go we have the Tampa Pro if you win that you get 10 points if you get second you get four if you get third you get three you get four to get two you get 50 get one so let's just say I mean I'm just trying to remember how many shows there were I think there's like 45 opportunities for girls to win say pro bikini shows right usually someone like Ashley K will come in and win like five of them and then there's another couple girls that will come and win two or three in that season so you're eliminating you know 25% of the show is right off the bat right so the point system I think is going to be nice but I would like to see so it gives someone like my wife a shot is if you win two you can't compete anymore I would really like to see that because then Ashley K or some of the other athletes and honestly and I see both sides because it's like well you're professional athlete and your job is to win and make money if these contests so I get it but I also I just want to see my wife make it once just once yeah I always feel yeah the qualifications like that have pushed people to do more shows which is good for the audience too because it's kind of fun to to be able to root for guys that might not have necessarily one that you want to see you know keep doing better and I'm like oh man you know he's only X amount of points away but this guy's only X amount of points away so if he gets second and he gets third you know they're both going to the Olympia or one of these guys get to push the other one out kind of you know I think that makes it a lot more interesting it does make it a lot more exciting towards the end of the qualifications season you know because I can remember specific situations when they did the point system I think they did a way up to about four or five years ago where we were watching those scores to see oh she's gonna get it oh no she got it and holy crap she came up with a great package that they and she moved up by one place so it is interesting it I think it does add a little bit more excitement to the division with the points I mean it's kind of like NASCAR right you know it's it's kind of similar in terms of you know where you start in the pack based on the points yeah you know um but obviously you know making the Olympia is still an honor and and I know people will say well I don't want to sit there in much 50 classic guys and 50 bikini but it's like it's still the same percentage of athletes making the Olympia that would have made it in the 1980s and 1990s it's just our sport and the personnel in it have grown that much you know like I was talking to Judge Billus Billio the other day about all the pro cards that are given away and he's like hey listen if you look actually at the numbers because I thought it was a little excessive North Americans gives away like 127 pro cards and he's like if you look at the actual numbers it's still 1.6% of all athletes that join the NPC get a pro card for a year which is right on point with where it was 15 years ago 10 years ago when you look at that percentage I mean gosh it's because you always hear the people are they're just given them away nowadays but yeah when you look at that percentage it's like that's not a lot there's a lot of people walking away without a pro card out of every national show his point was that it was about it was similar to like NFL football players you know out of the college at the school about 1 to 1.5% go pro and actually have a career so I love that video with the breakdown of football yeah the actual stats that you have this many there is in Bantam we've just many players in high school and they break down all the way to the NFL and then who actually plays more than three seasons and like it's just astounding how it shows you how good you have to be to have a even mediocre career for more than three years even to play one real down of a regular season gain you're in like decimal point percentage. You know when people say like oh let's say so and so it was a journey man backup quarterback and like oh he sucks I wouldn't want him on my team it's like he's still one of the 64 best in the world at his position and he's probably making 8 to 10 per year 8 to 10 million per year he's got his knees and joints still he's not getting beat up every game so honestly beat up backup quarterback is probably the best job in the world so those guys low-key make good money and they just retire healthy yeah exactly I think it takes far less of a qualification to live by carelessly on social media through these big names and then trash them when they don't perform at the level that you want them to from the couch while you're stuffing your face with cheetos and one hand and Mountain Dew or a really cheat sharing your mother's kind of like bodybuilding except for it'd be like protein shakes and right yeah exactly I was thinking about you know this far as yeah people people who who troll I remember back because I was editing it's just bodybuilding this morning run and our topic was five bodybuilders yeah yeah yeah Rod knows about it Rod knows about oh my bad sorry the topic was five bodybuilders that you should follow for their training and the section about Nick Walker I remember when I interviewed him like way back when he was like he had you just gotten into like high intensity training and we're doing like progressive overload like one two set type thing and I remember having said that he noticed his joints didn't hurt as much with that as when he did more volume and people in the comments were tearing him up like you can't my point is is no matter what you do have a good you can't win because at that point he was like yeah I'm going really heavy to hard failure for you know one to two sets and I'm finding that it's a lot less wear and tearing my body and people were like that's BS you know if he's going that heavy that's going to be much more you know straining on his joints than if you were to do multiple sets and now he's you know still getting called out so it's like no matter what I mean someone like Nick's always going to get picked apart and someone's going to always have an opinion either love Nick or hate him right and I feel like the ones that hate him love to hate him more than the ones that love him yeah more vocal one but the other thing I want to say about Nick is it also shows his his evolution with his training because yeah he doesn't just do that anymore he's now evolved to a point where he's doing multiple sets sometimes we'll call it reps and reserve but he has kind of thresholds and whatnot and the dude is still progressing yes that's right now now the thing is it's like that's BS you know this is the training he's doing now isn't what built him is it not akin to a plain landing in a third world country and he's out with all this food and then the kid comes up with the flies on his eyes he goes I don't want that like that no I am trying to give you food I'm trying to I don't want that I don't want that I want something like it's so bizarre the thought process that I can't sometimes I just can't wrap my brain to run brain around it you would think that the people listening would be hungry and you try to feed them arguably maybe a little attention because you're trying to expose you know get exposure and everything else too for your brain for your name whatever point is trying to feed them and they don't want it's not good enough if you remember back because all of us here were on the message boards and maybe hopefully most of our listeners were got the experience of message boards maybe our younger ones didn't but the message board were different because you kind of just shut the f up and listened and read and interpreted and took the you'd clean the good points from it and tried it out in the gym without your opinion and without and that's the difference of social media today is everyone has a run account where they can you know post and an answer and put all their own replies onto things whereas back then it's like when I first started out in the forums I was afraid to type anything so I'm like well this guy's gonna think I'm an idiot if I'm asking this question you know what I mean yeah no challenge I'm just asking a question but I didn't want to be taken the wrong way so you know I'm just gonna sit wait until he talks about it some more yeah you don't have to be respected in the community and more because social media is not a community I used to get on it's a big time yeah he like oh echo chamber there's echo chamber that I'm like oh you know shut the fuck up because it's Adam you know I mean he just just missed Apple what he said anyway but it really is because the message boards are part of a community you wanted to be long to the community so you wanted to be respected and most of the time that was to shut up because if you didn't and he got blasted I mean good example is Adam yeah little aren't no new little Arnold back on the message boards other than just being kind of a little troll but yeah on social media he you know he thrived in that environment so you know we can all have our opinions everybody's allowed to give their opinion then you have to just go back to well do I find it on the receiving end not me but anybody on the receiving end do I find that it provides any value and that's really where we are because everybody can give their opinion we don't want them to but there are people who don't want me to give my opinion so it is what it is I tend to I tend to remind people like in situ if someone's going back and forth to me I tend to remind them you follow me not the other way around and you're entitled your opinion but I'm just saying like yeah this is my page or this is my show or whatever it is you know and and just give them a healthy reminder of that it would about this question we got from Kate Denonzio over at Patreon she says what's the weirdest adjustment that you've made late and prep to actually work something that you never would have thought of at the start yourself or a client and what were the circumstances things you know like major changes like kind of wholesale changes that's where you're looking for here oh I got one something big is that which I'm not a little tweaked yeah it could be small if it's something that maybe provided something for you that you didn't expect well I mean I've told people to like I've told people you have to change all your gears fake there's something going on there's that like I've had that and had it be obviously right like two weeks into their new brand they're like rapidly changing like Lou you know first weekend four pounds down it's like okay here we go like all your stuff is shit like whatever brand you're taking just get rid of everything and so that's that's one would be like common and cutting cardio out like I've had people where I'm just like just take your cardio out I can't stand all this there's something fucked up about your body or a stress case you're just a mess I just want you to stop cardio and get some sleep yeah like to stop cardio for a week and just sleep in a bit more and let's just see what happens and now all of a sudden it's like four pounds down dry ankles yeah it's like oh my god you're just like a cortisol bag of not sleeping and over doing everything and mentally just stressing yourself the fuck out so yeah that's a couple yeah I think that's surprising to us I think well I think the caveat is what was surprising to you maybe the first time you tried it was someone or the first time yeah could you take a cut cardio that's the last thing I've got to burn this calories and like sometimes it's just like yeah I'm thinking of there's been a couple of times where you know traditionally people are expecting to be carved up into a show right and I went with my gut and didn't give them a single gram of carbohydrates the Friday before the show and it's not because we've ripped map rapidly front loaded it's just that you know what they look at her flat he got some good one we do those low carb days he looks really good the next morning look at the photos again you're like cookies dry a shit and it legs in the morning we got to look like that I'm one of those guys are you extension yeah and that was agreed upon by my trainers wow okay we yeah but and also because of extension there are guys in the masters who I don't want to say a lot but enough to note that arguably don't tolerate very aggressive loading for that reason whether it be distension or being more watery age plays a part in that to some degree and I can't put my finger on exactly what it is but it does right one of the things that I I wasn't surprised by I'm not surprised by is a trainer but a lot of clients are and that is later in a cut phase or later in a prep when you start to add back you literally I don't want to say squash them with tablets but you've milked it as much as you can yet to start bringing calories up and they are blown away that the incremental changes sometimes can be relatively big and they're getting leaner oh yeah not only leaner than like leaner to the amount of calories are taken but leaner and progressing better than they were the last few weeks when the calorie is really hard yeah and that comes back to the cardio as well sometimes you can drop that cardio and it's actually beneficial that they're not metabolically losing out on calories they may fill out a little bit they look a little better they look a little tighter or dollstone drops sure they're stress hormones go down they get drier like cutting cardio out and then having someone lose weight is just like whenever I do that to someone on my calm man yeah it's like goes against what you'd expect but I'm trying they're drying out right they're not getting leaner all but some they're just dry some's going on there's stress you know leg training becomes a little bit better yeah yeah that's look a little fuller let's see get an extra hour sleep like you're in nap you know I'd say that's one of the biggest things I can think of the like the counter intuitive stuff I can think of like like peaking and the first time that you try adding more water back in and they look harder and drier yeah you don't I mean because you get to that point where somebody's getting too dry they are flattening out there's that first time that you try it you're like I don't I feel like we've been pulling a lot of water and they just look worse it's like we can't add water back in like there's that thing in your brain telling you that you know until it works oh yeah yeah and quickly yeah yeah that's 20 minutes you had water 20 minutes yeah I can't see something you probably need more I don't know about you guys but the first you know when I get pictures first thing in morning or even if if I have an inkling that that's happening I'm like 200 milliliters water just go drink that some of your more pictures of 15 to 20 minutes and that'll tell me if we're on the right path that a little bit more water or note it's not the water we need to go different directions yeah yeah you'll see it fast you had a few of them she said what's what's the lesson prep teaches you about life outside of body building that you wish you learned earlier in life don't get what you put into it yeah that's almost obvious one you get what you put into it I was going to say you don't get what you put into it you know I'm saying well I'm saying this I'm saying it's like it just proportionate amount of effort for a little trophy yeah but and you just need to be okay with that and understand that you know there's more intrinsic benefits the goal versus winning your class or your program it's not about the end result yeah both the work along the way yeah I mean the friends you made now I learned that I was capable of doing anything that I was willing to like just freaking put my mind to and keep going with you know that like there's gonna be those days that it you're not seeing the results but you have that faith that like while I'm still doing the right thing and you just keep doing that right thing right and eventually it it turns into something I think that I'll have like Ethan's comment being on low-down rates making realize how easy it is to spend money I was just gonna say that because it's so true your Amazon goes up like 20 times what it does when you're in your office season yeah yeah um should I figure out I was gonna say now oh yeah you wouldn't I think one of the things prep taught me looking back and I think it's a personality trait now that's in me that I've had people comment on in like an interested way you're like the thing I've had people say this to me like family people really close to me like one thing I like about you is you don't have time you don't make time for anything you don't do a shit about you just do what you just do what you want to do like what do you want to do this what I'm doing with my day is that I'm doing with your compliment is that could compliment like you're like I have all these I do all these things I've got that one hasn't been a compliment yeah it's got the other way well maybe they're dressing it up yeah they're dressing it up but they're like you just and I think that comes from prep because like you know you've got a job you're going to school you've got meals you've got your cardio so you just completely strip mine your life of all nonsense that doesn't have to do with your goals that's true like you just I mean to be successful yeah you're like you've got your time for a series yeah you have to be a highly structured very routine and I think most of us find this and then stay with it because that's our our pathway to success not just bodybuilding but I remember business three years of my life it was the first three nationals I did or like I don't watch a TV at all yeah like you just have work in two jobs training can really show like it didn't have didn't do anything like you know I didn't have a bunch of other stuff going on and just focusing on what you like to do and I you know it's what it was that dysfunction or is it not well to some people it is I guess some people it's a dysfunction it does it impact other people around you negatively much like right you know alcoholic or right so I think with me as I purposely cultivated my life so that it's all about me you're not married oh we're getting married soon but we're we're we're we're we're dog parents right we don't have kids that was the plan so you know I understand that there's other things going on with with certain people's lifestyles but yeah I just think prep teaches you prep teaches you like oh you know that friend I have that's actually just a vampire of energy and always brings problems to me I actually don't have time for coffee with him because they're not active they're a huge pain in the ass and there's so much time for that so you just stop doing that sort of stuff because you're busy I'm a bad I don't know that's one thing I think can be a positive yeah I take that with you you got well porous yeah I mean I touched on a little bit but I don't know I guess I've been doing it so long that sometimes I I was reminded my wife isn't here she's got to stop into get cash for lashes here shortly so I got to hurry up I was reminded two days ago now that prep is done her words not mine that I do things in my time and on my own time schedule and that I don't factor in other people's it's a little close to homescape well here's here's the reason I bring it up because it isn't to slam my wife and build my wife for 32 years and she's she's awesome all right but I had to sit there and not say something and she's like you're not saying anything and and I'm like I'm processing it I'm just trying to figure out how to tell you how wrong you are yeah I couldn't because I thought like it kind of hit a little bit like a hit a nerve yeah I thought and there's some truth in this yeah and I touched on that towards the end of prep because I realized it but then I get out of prep and I have to be in that zone I have to be in my fucking sorry my safe place and my safe place is routine and structure and things the way that I want them and to hear that she never said that for 32 years so it kind of did impact because at first I was like like in my brain I was like bitch what the fuck are you talking about like you're crazy and I'm like very shortly after that I was like oh crap I got a I got a process this because there's some truth to this so she's looking for a little bit more balanced a little more selflessness now that we're out of prep can't blame me do you say that you're looking for more savings maybe we don't need to go to those nails today I know you are I'm just mine would automatically turn around to like well maybe we don't need to blank you know if that's the game playing do I not get any bonus points for that anymore I mean you know things like that I get you say it is it's and at the same time because we've been together for so long and you know I don't back on you know I didn't take it that's me just kind of taking it and going now I do wish she'd be a little more introspective when I break it really go made you know he's right I promise to be more you know selfless if you're more into girls I mean that kind of brings about you might do something John I don't know a meadowset on a podcast years ago and then he'd always tell a lot of his clients that obviously during a prep situation you gotta be selfish you gotta be what you need in the next ten minutes span is what you need your meal your cardio whatever that could is but he said you know tell you spouse tell your family hey I'm gonna be a little distant here for the next three months or whatever the heck it is and then but be like after this contest prep we'll go on this trip or we will spend more time doing x y and z and then he said the flipside is or the the thing you gotta do is actually follow through on that there you go yeah there's that given take for the next one and the next one there's not these resentment feelings every time you go into a prep oh that's why she doesn't understand all of that until I don't make the ship yeah and that's the realization oh I didn't make the ship then I publicly acknowledged okay so it's fair yeah it's fair you know you're still rebounding you know there's that yeah yeah I'm not gonna say that I just shut up yeah yeah I did well I shut up and I owned it I just you know score one for Mrs. skip yeah nice I got a quick question what's up one of my buddies literally just texted me he's a non competitor but he trains really hard and for years his testosterone was like 105 and he was still making progress hardest one of the hardest working dudes in the ring I'm not gonna say his name just because I think he has a you know a job that he doesn't want it out there you guys think it's appropriate and save for me to run three I use of GH five days a week in perpetuity just looking for recovery as I seem to have less eggs and nagging injuries since I've been running it just want to make sure I'm being smart thanks I think technically three I use five days a week you could do that forever and it's gonna hurt you I know you guys said it yeah yeah I know that someone did a post I can't remember who it was it was like kind of one of the educators it did a post the other day it was um hey yeah I you know if you're thinking of following oh great don't my wife came into the like if you're thinking of following yeah they're thinking of following the five day a week GH protocol here's why it's dumb and they like broke it out but it's just from the old days people trying to save money on those thousand dollars here pretty much right because you're buying a hundred and twenty eight I use a sarostam for like fifteen hundred dollars back in the day and you're just trying to stretch it out yeah that's uh just for some reason I found that funny there I was trying to get scat to laugh too but he fights it better than I do yeah yeah I remember uh a few like this is the the the different trends that we see in bodybuilding you guys remember like a decade ago everybody stopped doing the five days on two days off because they wanted you got to do it every other day it's got to be every other day otherwise you're in saline sensitivity is gonna go remember that yeah yeah yep yep yeah and fact it was stated a more than a few times our on our own podcasts if I had an and I backed it I did wasn't there a trend for a little while doing like two massive bullest doses a week like similar to how they try to dose it for you know kids with them that are unwell I think I remember talking to guys back in the day who were like from like England hookup you know guys that I knew that new people from England and you know how it used to be and they were like Dorian takes his GH like three or four days a week that's it but he takes big shots yeah and he said that's how they give it to kids and that was like the lore that was floating around yeah you know I'm taking my my twenty units of GH all wrong I need to divide it up into two ten units shots instead of four five unit shots yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah all the right yeah kind of doesn't matter well if you take it enough if you take it yeah true true but it's like yeah that worked in this works in the stuff it also comes down we Dorian yeah it also comes just just train like him at that time and eat all that food and that just you know what I mean it's just it's dumb well for dumb it's just not optimal but Dorian also had no money yeah yeah like people forget like he was poor like that jet Jim never made money ever once what do you want to go what's that they were like selling gear to pay the bills at that Jim the whole friggin time like I know a lot about temple because my buddy Dino was like really good friends with Dorian and like that was all like the whole time Dorian was Mr. Lampia there was just it was crazy you know like all the guys in there hardcore man and just crazy time more of us is gonna be sued for libel yeah he gonna be well it probably too because Dorian was still in that that cusp of before the big contracts you know in the 90s like really you know like the most ex and there's all just a cult like all the way you really didn't you did it because you wanted to be Mr. Lampia you loved it that much yeah you know it's pretty much you did did any of you guys start because you wanted to be different than everybody else and then at the end of you know like I'm I'm closing in on crossing the finish line having the tape on my chest and everybody else is everybody else like everybody does it's not it is true so culture it's not that weird thing anymore everybody I mean it is in the sense that it the extremism of it you know that you're saying where we drawn to it because it was an exclusive club for a long time yeah I know I was yeah I know I definitely was it was a whole thing that attracted me as a kid yeah like you stood out of your body building I don't know if I would have been interested in it now right yeah that's it I love walking around with my little can of tuna fish you know in high school sitting down eating two plain baked potatoes and and I just think to myself I really loved it I wanted nothing to do with nothing that wasn't bodybuilding related but I very clearly in retrospect wanted that attention and then these days I abort it like just I go somewhere with my wife and I'm meeting her coworkers and executive people and like as soon as they asked me what I do I tell on my right I'm not lying yeah but I right I'm not going to bring up anything meadhead is because I know where the conversation is two things oh my God my nephew competes yeah or you know he's way better than you like I can tell he looks way bigger than you my bro car just big you know six months ago or they're going to think of you know he's a trainer at Bally's apparently his wife is just sure them out wait that's Bally's what's Bally's yeah I think it's around for I think it's still the name of the parent company I think it is still the name of the parent that owns gold honestly really is that right uh hold on let me look it up over time yeah I don't know why I don't know what is Baldy yeah yeah that is I dated myself without one at least you can say Vic Taney gerondas Jim yeah so in 1999 the Jim chain Bally total fitness did acquire gold's Jim okay yeah but then they went under um and now they were bought in 2020 by a German base fitness company called RSG group oh yes okay I've never seen that I used we didn't have gold's Jim where I was right so I'm like I just can't wait to go to a gold's Jim someday it's gonna be so hard court it's gonna be heaven there's gonna be real weights and you know tons of hacksawats and and then I read like when I was I think I was working at a GNC or something back then and I read in one of the muscle magazines that Bally's by his goals and I'm like I don't want to go to gold's like Bally's is like a pussy fucking health club company yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I worked at Bally's for about four weeks I got a really yeah but maybe it's a little bit longer there's two months I I was like you know I wanted to do something in the fitness world and I got my training certificate and started working for them and then they paid for me to go to these classes so that I could like upgrade my training and like become like a level two trainer level three trainer all this stuff but I I couldn't get into it I didn't it felt like very scamming to me the way the charging system worked and you know how much money I made is a coat is a you know a trainer and I so I didn't really stick with it but it was an interesting couple months few months experience the the level trainer the levels that you were at had nothing to do with your experience or knowledge and just had to be with how many people could you sign and get to repay everyone it was like how many sessions could you book and then oh now he's a level three trainer oh now he's a master trainer because he's pulling 40 sessions a week now yeah yeah you know that's where you're getting 17 an hour and they're getting like there's yeah yeah exactly oh this is fair yeah I remember there was one guy that had it just wired though he was like this little afkin American guy decent shape and I can't remember his name but it was like it was something unique like Sergio will say all right and and he ran two classes per week at our bales and then he ran two classes per week at another bales and these classes were all like like I don't know what it was but it was like a fitness class where like 20 people could sign up and about 15 minutes before the class all these hot moms would come in and they'd all start gathering around you know and always Sergio here yet we Sergio and dude he would pack that class with 20 people each paying the full cost of that you know training session right and then he'd do that again on Thursday and then you go over to the other two gyms and the other gym and do it two times over there and these women were just like oh my god it's Sergio I've been in real name was Frank like right changes name to some more exotic yeah right but he had like the the pizzazz you know and I mean like you could picture him pulled up and it's here convertible and yeah I can't even remember now but probably you don't have said yeah video good here yeah the strengths mama always said go with your strengths yeah yeah he was probably gay yeah because probably we each seriously yeah the ladies women they just are just like a gay dude especially a good looking well dressed gay dude they're like magnets to they just like attract each other and the gay guys do like oh what did I miss do like that middle skips preference talk about valleys is talking about valleys I went and took a parcel delivery but that there it's just magnet magnet it's I don't know no I think you're right because our our I recall when I was working at a health club and there was a guy so similar what Scott's saying I don't remember they maybe like for briccio or something right exactly that might have been the same guy actually tell you what this guy did okay because he did the same thing you ran women's classes and then I was only there for like a year and a half when he was there and he was a master trainer because he could sell any of the soccer moms but I remember he had made up enough so they've done enough money he was moving down to Miami to open a women's shoe store and that was his that was the next segue of his life so yeah anybody and women's shoes you know they're kind of weird you know they're kind of weird you like a meeto you like I'm kidding skipping people like you that all like I have some kind of fetish with feet but I don't I just notice when women have nice shoes it just says something about the woman that they they pay attention to something that most of them got a wealthy husband that's what it says true maybe the single I don't know bro I know my wife would not have the nice shoes that she has if she didn't have me because she says all the time that those things don't matter turn but I I'm living by curiously through her because she has a real job and it's like I know I say it all the time but these guys over here behind me straight across the top level this building behind me is Goldman Sachs my city's walk out for lunch in six thousand eight thousand dollar suits they're two years out of college and I gotta be careful how I say this or how I know but they make a ton of money this is this one's ad they hold the top hold the top calling never have I oh you got a hold it oh we got a glass it's gonna do it what's going on I'm going to be on camera oh I gotta get you wife doesn't want to be on camera okay I got you I got you doing up a bra what's he doing yeah so I feel like he's happening here I get an injection given her an injection she has to go out as she wants to get changed anyway sometimes in the now she's got like making a mark sometimes in the morning if she can't zip it up she will wait till she gets to the office we're on the 20 second floor she's got to go the second floor and she'll have one of her employees zip up her dress for that's how bad versus waking me up second she got anyway okay about that one later ensure oh you're footing though on the shoes get there there is a site called only feet that you might be interested in no lie no lie oh you know I know I got a client when we get done training I'm gonna give too much away but when when she's done training she has someone hold the camera and make a video over taking her shoes off and pulling the socks off and really she sends I was on the people makes money off that I know it's the thing I've heard about because I get people who say that to me all the time I don't got to foot that as you know there's websites for that like it's the shoes I swear it's the shoe I don't it I did I'd be like I believe you actually I believe you those are hot feet you can imagine that would be the best fetish to have you guys sound like Tarantino you know it's incredible is this whole episode has been like just one kind of semi-off topic that's all we have but we have yeah this is the episode of all changes but we have 31 people watching which for the life the life channel isn't pretty damn good so it's like ask the question answer everything except yeah make it leave them make them leave want more I couldn't get it out there's wisdom in there somewhere yes hey I do have a kind of a surprise for a guy that I work with Dallas all right and his dad said you know Dallas would absolutely love for you guys to do a physique critique for him on BSG so I was like you know what man let's let's freaking make that happen so Dallas has been training for I mean he's consistent he's got a great home gym I want to I don't even know how long he's been training but he's he's a pretty young guy though he had done one shows a teenager and now his goal is to grow as much size as he can before he gets back on stage right now we're holding it at about like I think two 12 as of last week and we're really working hard on training but what we want to do here I just want to see what you guys have to say what would you say he needs to work on the most you want me to start and you want me to leave me to trash him you go first it's you have me to meet you go first we should be that guy like for all future assessments I'm going to be the guy that just trashes everybody with a straight face you don't know what's his age yeah he's about what's his age he's a 120 yeah yeah okay I did a 21 oh there's more than one picture this time okay that's nice thank you yeah appreciate that yeah I see where you're going with that yeah I got a back shot here all the way this way there we go now I'm going to tell I'm going to give him some advice right off the bat we got to work on your progress picks my friend because the lighting the lighting behind you yeah yeah yeah I'm not going to pick apart his room I'm going to turn the night once when I was as a team but not at all but but if you want to get likes on Instagram change the lighting source because you got a decent you got a good physique man I definitely think you got a future body building does he have any posing picks like in the front double real double no we don't not not right now not not that I could easily access I just said that he's he's standing in the worst spot like if you just stepped on yeah yeah that's what I'm getting yeah but overall I think he's got good muscular development for a 20 year old he looks like he's got a nice wide shoulders to a small waist yeah he's got a good taper he's got like a blank canvas that you're like I can see what another 20 pounds of muscles going to look like and it's going to look good so yeah so the blank canvas is a very good analogy like it's like you know looking at a guy you know and being able to just go oh everything's in the right spot you know like they don't have a bunch of problems handed to you like just grow mean you know I mean you can't hesitate run I learned that's the hard but you know what I mean like that's the best way like here's no there's nothing wrong with your physique you should be able to just develop a nice body building physique yeah I mean I said I just go no glaring weakness is your two young usually to have already got a nice it's like okay this is an easy one just put on size everywhere like you are because there's nothing at this point in this at this early stage that is a glaring weakness it is hard with that lighting but still okay let me let's let's go hyper critical I'm cap the shoulders um because I'm getting I mean shoulder to waist ratio mean he's not terribly wide from a clavicle standpoint right so but there's no glaring there's no there's nothing that stands out the main thing you go land you suck you know like the other guy could keep like a month ago I got an idea for another show I'm getting a comeback on and and post our 2020 world pictures so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so Ron you got to come back for that one by the way because you actually know you can't because you were pretty good back then what am I talking about yeah well it's still pretty fresh so you may even you could you could hack it and get some share we'll just keep him out so tell you guys what Dallas is uh he had like no upper body as of a year ago like this is all that upper body he had only had legs like was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it uh it's one of those guys that loved training legs pushed them really hard but then when it came to upper body didn't have that same level of you know what you know where that comes from and because I got that same story for myself when we'd go to the gym with my buddies you know when you're 14 15 16 or whatever yeah and I had buddies that you know I had these long link-ass arms right so everyone's doing the bench press and my bench press was part you know like I could hit 225 for 3 it like 15 or 16 years of age right yeah some of these guys could hit like for a set of 6 to 8 so I told myself okay that's your game I'm gonna be good at legs and I made sure I was damn good at squatting and I was squatting 405 at 16 for sets of 10 to 12 so I think my necessity maybe that was kind of his calling he's like okay maybe I got some buddies that are stronger they do better pull ups they can do more benching I'm gonna make sure I can out squat I'm not like press them and I mean it's got a decent set of quads already so yeah I think just keep growing everywhere keep doing your thing man yeah he looks good he looks like he's trained in hard and he looks like he's trained in legs and you know we so he's learned to play a tax already that's one yeah he's learned to push chest and back with that same level of intensity I just have to watch him because we're trying to use good technique yeah your coaching him yeah your coaching him yes I'm sorry I thought your coaching is father I didn't pick up on that I did I used to coach his father I'm not no and I wanted to hear what you guys had to say you know and I completely with you on the photos though I feel like for where he's at I can't leave these pictures you guys can't hear me you're little in and out okay I thought I was the only one that's why I waited oh anybody was can you hear me it says trying to breathe now we're good all right so it's trying to connect there we go I'm back yeah no I helped him you're really good now you guys can hear me alright yeah you're good all right yeah I helped him for a show got a head to be it had to be over a year ago now and and since then now the goal has been to just grow and I'm with you guys on on the lighting quality but at the same time I feel like you know I can read these pictures good enough that it hasn't been an issue for me so that that hasn't been a big complaint for me but when it comes to like getting ready for a contest I want to see some better quality the main thing with him is that I can only put so much on him so fast because he will get fat like and we found it like it's easy to get him like these two twelve right now we could push him really hard to 20 in the next six weeks but it's not going to be pretty and when he died it down he had to be like hard keto in order to get in shape like in order to get the lines in his legs like he's going to have to do keto again so I'm trying to ride that line of let's use strength to put on as much mass as you can versus you know it used the food to support that the food itself is not going to be the direct driver in this case right now and I mean I think there's something like I think we're lost smarter now there's no more I'm going to get huge after the show and just pull up and use the scale as your your common denominator I mean when people come to be and say that I just want to get huge with you but I know you got a plan about I have a really hard time with carbs I get fat really easy it's like I'm not the guy that's going to get huge then we're going to be doing you know bikini girl jumps in terms of calories week to week here and there so yeah you know I think he looks awesome yeah he's coming along like I said he was all legs in the past but the main thing I'll see with him because I'll have him send me my train his training is and we just went over this again he's getting strong but then because he is young I'll see like that rep range starts to get a little bit short you know because he's still progressing I mean he's pushing like the 90 he's pushing the 100 pound dumbbells but you know and dumbbell press but so name is the range gets a little bit short and got him for three now he's doing better than that but right yeah well get the younger young guys eager young guys well I was saying you got a couple eager young guys of send you a video of like you know they're doing something you know the 120 pound dumbbells for four year I got four good ones yeah but do they say it like this four for reps that a coach or 120s for reps that a and you're like one two and a half yeah okay I guess we can maybe say three there you know yeah so thankfully he's better than that you know it's like at his level at his age I mean I feel like I'm excited for him because I mean realistically I wasn't training like that in order to mean at 20 years old so he knows how to do like a good rest pause and keep it in the muscle already you know so he's he's got something ahead of him I think nice yeah can you guys still dumbbell press yeah like an appreciable amount of weight that like you would wouldn't be scared to like have posted on youtubers often I don't think anybody wants to see I said not about it I was doing years ago but no I see I saw an old video on youtube me just banging out one 30's like they were nothing I'm like wow I used to move those yeah a lot more fluid than I then I do now if I picked the one 30's now I'd be like this is really happy guys notice that as you get older too I was thinking about that we were talking about age earlier yeah the same weight just even though you're moving them and you might even get 12 or 14 ramps it's just like by the fourth record like god this is heavy like how does this even move I can't get him into place anymore I can't get it like my grip so far is task getting yeah you should just be like grab them off the rack sit down and whip them up and just start racking them out and now it's like hey can you watch me while I'm putting this dumbbell up and make sure I don't drop it on my face yeah yeah we still occasionally do flat or incline dumbbell presses like third on chest day yeah yes yeah that's the third notes that are first right yeah I mean we might do them third if we train at Brains house sometimes we'll do them second you know and I think I use maybe like heavy heavy would be like one 10s yes yeah okay I try to stay around the hundreds you know I want to be decent I want to still be able to press hundreds yeah you know where is in your peak you're probably like 160's 170 yeah I remember the gym I trained at an emiton had they they said 160 on them but that didn't include the handle so they were like 168 168 or 167's in reality and I used to do those on the incline like that was a big goal of mine was to do a money incline for like a solid set you know like get 8 to 10 reps on the incline with those that was like my very very strongest yeah and that was an incline of probably 45 degrees back in the back of the chest I share like the standard like 35 not the 15 percent or for the final and I would kick them both up like I put my foot one on my knee and have the other one hit to me and then I took it out yeah yeah I had good kick up skill I remember and this is how quickly it can go away just and it's really the joint integrity for me but I remember two weeks not even like maybe eight days before I got I went to the Master's Nationals in 2021 I got a video of and some of my Instagram with me with the 160's and just like you said Ron it doesn't count the you know the handle the handle but I also have I took these orange lead up to yes bands and I dangled and I put two tens on each side and so I bought them up to 180 plus and I ripped out like 10 to 12 of those fuckers and now Halo Test and Works people it's a Halo Test and it's a powerful drug and but I'm looking sometimes I go back and watch that video and I'm like I'm only like four or five years removed from that like where did it go like I wouldn't imagine even kicking that dumbbell across the gym versus trying to pick it up at this point you know that's what Victoria reminds me of though so if I start quoting numbers that I used to do compared to what I'm doing now she's like well you were using more gear like you've been on like basically T or T for the last five years so you know there is there is that difference yeah but it's like legs like my hacksquat I can do the same thing I was doing five ten years ago you know yeah like press same thing like extensions like curls all that stuff is about the same rows about the same it's it's pressing strength and it's and well I don't know about you guys but I haven't touched a barbell in probably two years like they can't use a straight like I can't have a straight grip for anything I need to have like a little bit of a you know what I mean and even when I use a Smith for in-clin I kind of put my hands in it like a little bit you know Smith is a little more forgiving right 100% Ron are you still considering doing stem cells well yeah I mean I'm gonna get a hip replacement is my primary thing I'm trying to get done here but I mean I think stem cells are going to get a lot more accessible and a lot cheaper very rapidly in the next year or two I can see that we're on the curve of like a bunch of legislation being changed especially in the states there you guys had George Bush you said you guys out wasn't it Bush you said you guys like in like the no stem cells because of the religious element in once all he's wondering what you're talking about he's talking about your video to build and yeah because that the really good stem cells is linked to it like in Biblical I don't know how it all works but I know that's the best stem cells that's why they can't do them in the states and that's why you have to go overseas to get a done but I think all that's gonna get like we have to everyone has to do stem cells so they do they do in Biblical stem cells in the US but they're last I heard they weren't allowed to expand yeah that was the thing yeah yeah what the number where you you what you got first is like if you go to Panama they'll pull the you know the blood from you they'll pull the stem cells from you and then you sit on the beach for a few days while they expand the cells and then they pump them all back in you so they basically like culture them in a petri-growing multi-ri-um and then put your own stem cells back in but from what I understand that thing that passed is for Florida that like Florida's like you're allowed to do experiment things that are not approved stem cell wise you are allowed to now do in Florida so yeah I bet you're right man that it's gonna become a lot more accessible like at least five years you know also I mean we all see this already we see the the the sputtering's of it inside the bodybuilding world for the last 10 years with like TRT clinics and you know assign your own I want to pick my own blood work markers like we were like guys are doing now you guys have your clinics down there where you're like I want my want this checked and I want my APOB checked and I want my you know five different information yeah yeah different information markers like stuff that no doctor would do because you're not in any categories it required right like they just what do you mean I think it's because doctors don't even know right general physician yeah no idea what you're talking about you know but if they do it and there's something off then they are responsible for it you know what I'm saying really all well this worker was off and your doctor didn't say anything now it's a lawsuit you know well then you should up your game as a doctor as coaches for the ones we have in the upper game and our knowledge and we're not even out the ethics standards you know yeah right yeah yeah oh here's someone Ryan in the comments seems to know his that 2001 federal policy how there was something about yeah and then Jeb Bush opposed the state yes something about Florida so he knows his shit yeah embryonic and so research yeah yeah all right you know I think wrong take it over stuff maybe the angle they were looking at it you know I don't know if this was mentioned but I'm just thinking out loud here because we all see I don't know if you guys have seen the videos of awarded fetuses going to research centers and then the push for plan parenthood to encourage more abortions to be able to money off this kind of stuff I'm wondering if it's also the push to people that are pro life you know of which I am and not wanting to see people make decisions based off finances that all I'm going to get paid to have this abortion possibly right and you're going to turn around and sell these parts these these human parts for research and development I can get that you know yeah but I think I think eventually we're going to get the point where we grow this stuff in a dish and just manufacture it like car exactly that'll be that that'll be the leap is when it's just the stem cells are just as good and they're just made yep like how do you guys feel about the lab grown meat not going to do it yeah I don't I don't trust the guy around the people making oh yeah okay what are you like I've been out of for three weeks I just see it as amino acids it's all it is you're just arranged in order and I'd consume them no problem and I think it would solve world hunger and send us to Mars well and it is clear that we do not have I mean you know I'm not you know vegan and vegetarian all that but I have no problem with it if you have that for ethical reasons right because if everybody we're eating beef everybody we're eating meat it's not sustainable I mean it's really obvious right I can't happen I think we need it right and I think also too like you know I mean I don't want animals to suffer you know true like I always feel better but I don't want to suffer I'm just like you know when I got a hunter friend and he'll give me some like elk yeah and I always think hmm I do feel a little bit better about eating this elk then I look good like I'm sure that actually was nice before he killed him well it's just no I mean what I'm doing as I'm being sarcastic be no no the other side will see it that that way and when I say the other side the older I get I do think I'm like if there were an alternative that was exactly the same right but didn't involve anything suffering right I'd be like calm down but until then we have the food chain right and I'm at the top sorry well we're not talking about that you guys ever wonder like why does protein taste a certain way but carbs taste so good like why couldn't have been the other way around yeah yeah yeah yeah that has some really weird rules it's kind of like training why not just the more you train and the harder you train the bigger you get right why not just do that yeah you have to make it nuanced and you have to dig into the we have to find balance very little type of crap yeah got's a real funny guy any are hard or how about this one great physique up here what the hell's going on did you is he laughing or someone who's really attracted with a messed up physique like he's like oh let him mess with this let him deal with this for a while like what did I do in a past like to have a face like this I don't know which is everything I have no idea yeah we're talking about who we talking about who knows name names I don't know it's tangent today yeah what yeah what yeah okay all right I guess that's a podcast we didn't answer a single question straight on yeah no we didn't um yeah we better than I think that was good Brombo
