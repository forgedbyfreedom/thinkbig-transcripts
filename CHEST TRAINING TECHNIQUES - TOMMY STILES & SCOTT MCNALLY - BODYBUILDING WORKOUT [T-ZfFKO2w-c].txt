What's up guys, welcome back to Think Big Bodybuilding Media. I'm Scott McNaley. I'm back with Tommy Styles. We're going to continue our case study in training today. We're going to talk about chest. You know, I have a couple notes before we get started Tommy. Anybody who is catching this on video. We also have our audio podcast. It's been moved. New RSS feed is Think Big Bodybuilding. So you can find that at iTunes, Soundcloud, Spotify, Google, Play, Store, or whatever. I don't know. Also, we are presented by True Nutrition. All of our programming is. You can check us out and support our show by using our coded devices. A lot of great health supplements, performance supplements, bulk supplements, all sorts of formulas. Enough of that. Tommy Styles, man, it's been a minute. How you been? I'm good, brother. I'm going to go back to see your back moving around. Yeah, tell me about it, man. We got a lot of really good feedback on our first installment of this mini series. If you guys haven't seen it, it's been a couple months now. Tommy and I broke down. And basically, the anatomy of a back workout. We talked about everything from start to finish and what's going through our minds while we're doing it. Both of us have been training for a long time and neither of us have had, I would say, the best genetics. But we've been able to make some decent progress. Now, Tommy is out in Arizona training with Dusty. So he's been getting some cool insights out there. I've had the opportunity to train with a lot of really well-known people that I've respected through the years. And we're going to try to share that with you guys here today. Like I said, Tommy, we got some good feedback on that one, man. And I got sick. And everything fell apart. I couldn't really think about training for a while. But I'm glad to be back, man. How's your training going? It's gone good. Still strong, haven't really lost much. Pulled back the volume a little bit as we move on in this prep. So I'm eight weeks out tomorrow, eight and ten weeks out. So Spood's still pretty high. Cardio's daily now. But I still believe the best way to burn body fat is with your training intensity. So that's my performance is something I constantly audit, constantly make sure I'm able to push it. And then obviously listen to your body. But we'll be able to touch on some things that have helped me. Still keep training intensity high in prep. Because you and I are the same. You don't really, you don't lower the training. You don't change the training up just because you're in prep and calories get lower. Claw expenditure is higher. You still try to do what you did that got you the muscle in the first place. Sure. So we'll be able to touch on some of that. But yeah, I also got a lot of good feedback on that. The first episode we put out. So somebody likes what we're saying. We'll try to keep this going now. Now that we're back, we'll bring the next installment. Well, let's shoot for maybe every couple of weeks. We'll put these out. If you guys have any suggestions, anything that you would like us to cover next, let us know. So we did back today. We're going to do chest. Chest is something that Tommy and I both have had to really think about. This isn't an excellent, this isn't a muscle group that just came naturally for me. And I believe that's the same for you, isn't it? Very much. Yeah, when I learned how to press, I didn't learn how to press with my chest. I learned how to press just to move the weight. Yeah, like anybody who got into the gym, I might have just wanted to have a really good flat bench press. Yeah. Like we were all chasing at one point. So I never learned how to engage my chest in a press. I was very delt dominant. So I grew big front belts and had no chest. And the presentation that I had, if you look at my physique from front relax is almost like one of those big salad bowls. You got your two ends out here and then it caves in. Okay, so that's I had to fill in the gaps and really break everything down. Toss the movements that don't work with me. I'm five, ten pretty long limbs. So I've had to play with Rangers emotion. I've had to work on mobility as I have with every muscle group I've had to increase my mobility. Just really get analytical with my training and with my performance, the cadence to the reps down to all the details. I mean, we were talking off the air, but you and I are blessed with the ability just to pick up weights and grow. We have to really have a stubborn approach that we're not going to quit because it's harder for us. Yeah. I think that's a blessing because it allows us to talk and bounce ideas off of each other and even have the opportunity to put episodes like we're putting out right now. Sure, absolutely. Yeah, it's through that experience that, you know, and here's what I'm hoping. You know, I know both of us get asked by other people, people who are newer to lifting weights, that they want to know, like, well, what do you do for this? How do you train that muscle and having had to think about it a lot? You've had the ability to then learn how to articulate what you're doing too. So I definitely think that having to go through the hard work is helpful. Let's just dive into it, man. Where does your chest training start? It starts with mobility and potentiation, which we covered in the first episode. So I really got to get my shoulders moving. I've got some, I don't have any major shoulder injuries, but I've just got, you know, they've taken a beating just from pressing and I was a baseball player before I got into bodybuilding so that takes a toll. So I spent 10 minutes with bands just doing different warm-up stuff. I'm actually making sure the rotator cup, the different spinators, all of those little muscles that are in the shoulder are ready and warm before I even touch a bar or dumbbells. From there, I'll do some some light flies on the packed deck. Just to get some blood flowing in my chest, that's kind of where I just really squeeze the reps out. I'm not even trying to accumulate any fatigue. I just want to make a connection with my mind and my chest. We talked about it before, but everything we're talking about in these episodes is from the perspective of bodybuilding. I could move something with ease from point A to point B, but if I want to move it with my chest, I have to engage it in the stretch and then contract it to the maximum contraction. Yeah. So that's what I'm trying to build that mental connection. It's kind of like starting a fire. When you first get the fire going, it takes a while to really get burning, but as it rises and the fire builds up, then it starts to stoke. That's kind of the mentality I try to take when I'm getting into it. Then from there, I'll do a cover workout that I did Tuesday for chest because it's really fresh in my mind and I'll be able to, like everything at short and sweet, I don't do ton of volume, I don't have a ton of movements, but I try to maximize the effort that I give to each movement. I started with incline barbell and I haven't done incline barbell in weeks because Dusty was dealing with a peck tear. Our chest training was kind of abbreviated around that, which is fine with me. Otherwise, when I get deeper into a prep, the first thing that will start to take a hit for me is pressing strength. I don't have as much fluid around the joint in the shoulder and it's just a long arms. I've never been a strong pressure to begin with. I'll practice that right now. I do not have any amazing numbers. I don't put 405 on the bar and rip it out. Every five pounds that I've been able to add to each side, I've had to grind for. If you struggle with pressing, I'm here for you. I hear you. I started with the bar, just 15 reps. The peck deck is really trying to feel the chest open and then contract at the top of each rep. I think that's a big thing to really make sure you're doing when you're getting into your pressing, whether it's your first exercise or any exercise, is make sure the chest is opening because it's easy to take the bar to the bottom but not open your chest. You still be shoulders rolled forward and closed. It's moving but you're not moving it with your chest. I think making sure that that chest muscles opened up or both pecks are opened up is key. I don't think a lot of people get themselves to a point where they have a full active range of motion before they start training. What do a lot of people do? They probably go in the gym, maybe they go to the flat bar belt or if they're bodybuilders and they've listened to all the podcasts you put out, maybe they have a different program. But a lot of people are going to go in and they're going to put 1.45 on each side and they're going to start wrapping, right? That's the traditional approach. My thinking is maybe taking a step back and take a slower approach to getting up to that 135. Make sure that when you get to 135 you're already primed and then we go from there. I did 45 15 reps. I did 25 on each side for 10 reps and then I put a 45 on each side, 8 reps. As I increase weight to get to my work and set, I decrease the reps. It's a sending weight, descending reps. It's kind of how I would describe it. I had a gold my scheme for the workout was I wanted 2 sets with the incline bar belt. First set 6 to 8. Second set I wanted it to be anywhere from 8 to 12. From 135 I go to 185, get that for 405, from there, go to 225, get that for 3, from there at a 10 to each side and get that for 2. I had another 10 to each side so now we're at 265. I didn't know what my working weight was going to be because I haven't done this movement weeks. I'd rather play it. I don't want to say I'm the side of caution but what I don't want to do is put away down the bar especially just even perhaps I'm only going to get for 3 reps. Sure. That's a risk, man. I've done that in prep before where it's like you think the strength is there and it's just not and it's not a negative. You're not going to be putting up record numbers when you're at some point of your prep. You have to just accept that. I don't think I'm at that point of my prep yet but I just knew on this movement that I needed to air on the side of caution. I wanted to still keep the mindset that I'm a bodybuilder. I'm not trying to have a 3 rep press. So 265, that went for 6 reps on my own and then a 4.7 which I was okay with. For the second set I backed it down to 225 and got that for 9 and then another 4. So 9 plus 1. That's how my first exercise went and then by then the whole, I had a full pump from right underneath my clavicle all the way down to where the pectise in and the pectminer. So when I think I had that because I did all that warm up work, it took me about 30 minutes to get through that first exercise. While I'm doing that I was drinking my intra hydrating, you know I have EAA's, I'll the same stuff everybody else is drinking but you're getting all that, that intra workout in you, blood's flowing, the pump is starting and then from there and I'll still touch on the rest of the workout but I felt that the rest of my session went really well and I had a good mind muscle connection because of the warm up I took with that first exercise. So I took you know 6 warm upsets, 6 or 7 warm upsets before I did a working set. Yeah, yeah I do a lot of warm ups too to get where I want to be because I'm doing something similar. Like a lot of people are doing a heavy set and then a back offset that's been kind of my common theme. I'm not going by my workout from Tuesday because I'm still just coming back but I can tell you this that learning to be strong on the pressing movements has been a goal that I set at the end of 2019 and I've told this story a couple times on the podcast but it was David Smith who saw my dumbbell press and he pointed out to me he was like hey that's really good I shot a video and it was like the 100 pound dumbbells and it was like all I had and it was when I was out at Ron's gym I was at West Coast Iron and I was going pumped up and I got this set up and I shot a video and I posted it and I'm like yeah and I did say now I'm going to try to stay at this weight and keep working with it you know and try to get more efficient and more effective be safer with it all that but his comment was that's really nice it looks like you're working on your lockout. It's like that was like you know other fucker this is a full set you know but it wasn't the thing was is I wasn't using a full range of motions so I've I had to back off at the beginning of the quarantine I was training from home with light dumbbells that allowed me to actually start working on that full range of motion well we can add video to this so I'll show some video to demonstrate on the range of motion I use but I had learned a lot from from David Smith on making sure I get that full range of motion in with that came really an understanding of as you said the importance of having like good mobility you know good flexibility in my body and that went beyond just the packs like all the supporting stuff that goes to that like into the ribs and to the lats my shoulders everything so I've worked on a lot of stretches between training just to just to try to be as strong as I can I think that I think that chest training is one of the more dangerous exercises for a bodybuilder I know a lot of guys are torn a pack and especially as you start getting older if you want to continue to be strong and my goals bend to be as strong as I possibly can be I want to really make sure that I take my time and warm up I want to make sure that I've got all that mobility stuff so for me a lot of the mobility is before I train on other days a couple days a week where I'm actually doing like mobility stretches and you know and massage and stuff like that lately I've been starting with that big key lift you know we talked on chat or on back training that will do a pull down first and then we'll go to a row movement and the row movement is that like that big meat and potatoes exercise lately I've been going straight to that big meat and potatoes exercise on chest in the past I would pre-fatigue by going to one all-out set on the pack deck and then one back offset and I found that to work really well I'll get to that later because we we both have the common issue of being shoulder dominant and we did want to kind of touch on some of the common issues that people deal with so we'll get to those common issues later and I'll talk a little bit more about pre-fatigue and how that helped me to help grow the chest but now lately I just go straight into those double presses and like you I'll do the same thing where I really take my time trying to warm up and I'm watching my form I'm using incline dumbbell that's my favorite exercise and I make sure that I get that full range of motion I think what I've learned and you know like I said I've talked a day with Smith about this a lot for me it's important that I engage that muscle from the very start of the movement so I bring it to the bottom where I want to be and then I make sure you know it it sounds it sounds like common sense I don't think everybody thinks about it though is making sure that you're engaging you're pushing that with that pack muscle you know from the very beginning I have known a lot of people who end up having really good shoulders really good triceps and you know no chest and I think that that's from what I've analyzed working with some of my clients that have been in it position that's what I've seen where they aren't engaging from the pack first and I think that that's the number one thing you can do if you have weak chest is to to make sure that you are engaging from it so I'll start really light I've worked up to the 125 pound dumbbells that's been it's actually 130 pound dumbbells we've become the handle but that's been my my best up until I had gotten sick and that was a couple months ago so I'm rebuilding at this point but if I were to warm up with the say the 25s I'll go to the 40s for eight reps 10 reps and then I'll go to the 60s or 65s for you know four five reps and really take my time on those 85s for you know two reps the hundreds for two reps and then from there if I was going to like 115 I'd be good to go maybe I if I'm going to 125 I might need to pick up a little bit more and just do one or two reps with with a slightly lighter dumbbell just to make sure that I'm ready to go and for me I want to make sure this is what's critical for me I want to make sure that my form now is 100% on whatever I'm doing and I really control my negatives they're pretty slow I think they're pretty slow look I could go faster on them but I get a lot out of that and I feel like it keeps me safer you know I could move faster and use a heavier a heavier poundage but I would rather have that control and get as much as I can out of a slightly less heavy weight I feel that it's going to be just as effective for me then having gone heavier like I said I'll work up to one heavy set I try not to go lower than eight reps that's that's where I feel comfortable I do think that chest is a muscle group that you can go slightly lower reps and then some other body parts and get a good workout with it and get some good growth but for me if I start getting down into like the sixes and then that means maybe if I lifted something that was too heavy I might only get four or five for me that's a little bit too much of a risk now in my 40s so I want to make sure I can at least get six at all time and shoot for eight you know work to work 10 something like that but like you you know I'm I'm hitting a set for about eight and then after that I maybe will reduce it slightly and then try to get just as many reps as I can which you know if if I were to get the 125s for let's say seven to then I might drop to the 115s or even the 110s hell on some days maybe even the 105s and just really work on perfect form and get as many reps as I possibly can maybe I get 13 on that I don't know but that's where I met and I'll like I said sometimes I in the past I've used a pack deck actually sometimes I should say religiously used that but now I just go straight into that that big main exercise for me yeah I'm going to touch on that I'm the same because with back we both like that one that one movement before to really almost get us mentally ready yeah yeah you can take a movement and then with chest we both like to get into the meat and potato movement right away and just spend a good bit of time warming up I mean my whole session is probably an hour 15 and the first 30 minutes is on warmups for one exercise yeah now are you treating chest is trust chest uh I buy it self or you treating it with other body parts buy it self okay okay we've had it that way for a while so we split up chest of shoulders I've done push pull eggs I mean I did that for years yeah I've done DC so I've done chest in a bunch of different ways and actually the best progress I've made is when it's been by itself okay this five-day body part split we've been running for for months probably since we were doing two days so yeah that was one thing I wanted to touch on that you said and then where are you at with with hand not you're on dumbbells but for me hand placement I used to go wider and I think I have wider because it gave me the ability to move more weight okay now I've moved my hands in and I'm not I'm trying to get less elbow flare so I've moved my hands in to a point where I can almost my elbows earn at 90 they're almost they're not tucked completely obviously because I'm on a barbell but they are I am turning them downwards like when I'm pressing yeah that allows me because you touched on pressing with the pack out of the bottom yeah I think I didn't do that when I had for years that's why I pressed wrong because I used momentum from coming down and then I kind of used like an elastic recoil where you would just like let go of that last four inches and then use that re for that inertia to go back up sure I'm in a totally bypassed the pack and then went all to the shoulder so my front belt's got great you know in an or an innovation but the pecs were just being bypassed and now a key for me is just to try to feel at the bottom of my warmups not with that heavyweight obviously but the bottom of my warmups I might like hang there okay and really feel where my peck ties in I want to feel that activate and then press I'll probably do that with my you know my first three warm ups that's when the weights really light yeah I just want to feel that outer pack fully engage fully stretch and then drive it up real slow I don't even try to explode out of the hole on some of those reps I try to just move it up with you know a good pace but I'm not trying to explode that's for the the working set yeah and then you mentioned um the negatives I obviously I'm pretty big on negatives does the night count for each other but um with the warm upsets I try to be extra extra with the negatives like I'll take them really slow just to have us that mind muscle and that kind of gives me a little bit of leeway when I'm grinding out some reps on the working set that the negative may or may not speed up but if it does it's okay because I think I've established that mind muscle and everything's engaged yeah I'm connected so I don't feel like I'm cheating myself I think for anybody who is listening to this because they're genuinely trying to improve their chest training and I'm thinking of especially like a like a newer guy maybe somebody who hasn't even broken their chest training down the way we are right now I think that what I've noticed personally is when I first started analyzing my training like this my negatives had to be extra slow my pauses because I do a pause at the bottom my pause at the bottom had to be like an extra long pause in order to be like okay I'm engaged now go the longer I've done it the faster I've gotten and if you're to watch it the pause might not even look like like an actual long like it's not a long pause anymore but it's a long enough pause that I can get that engagement going I would say exaggerating those things in the beginning is okay you know you may sacrifice a way but it's okay to really take your time and be like come down to the bottom and then you know engage and be like okay did I engage? oh yeah I'm engaging and then begin to press on that negative really feeling that negative and you know really kind of like you said learning to make sure that you're getting what you want out of it is really what it comes down to and then with time you know if it does speed up you've you've put the foundational work in to make sure that you got what you need you still always have to check yourself and be like am I going too fast but you know it's it's it's that's something I've noticed is that my my speed has picked up some but the engagement is quicker yeah and I agree with that I think as it becomes you know repetition leads to well I guess you could say experience but you have more control the more repetitions you've done yeah so over time you're able to pick that speed up a little more each each time John Metallus is a great one I always reference because he doesn't you know he's not really brutally slow with his negatives but I think that's because he's he's got such an established mind muscle connection because he's been doing this for decades that he doesn't need to be a slow yeah whereas like I think I even touched on the first episode there's some exercise is still right half to go slow intentionally just to keep the mind muscle because it's just it's stronger than it was for me but it's not to that point where I can blast through reps yeah yeah hey one one thing I wanted to mention too uh when you talk about we're we're talking about making sure you're engaged you said you know and not really blasting up until you got to your working said one interesting thing that I learned I learned a bunch of interesting things from them that I learned from Dave was he explained it as that you want to come out of the whole cautiously in add momentum as you get the bar up or as you get the dumbbells up you know that we we are in our most vulnerable position you know if you're listening to this and you're like hey I'm going to retool my training and you don't bring the bar or the dumbbell you know all the way down and now you decide you're going to try to go a little bit deeper with it you don't want to just drop to the bottom and then just rip out of it because that is a vulnerable place you know like I said I think that in my opinion chest training is can be a very dangerous thing for body builders we can get hurt there you can tear a pack you would not be the first um so I think there is an amount of caution which I wanted to mention that I use coming out of the hole and then I add to it like step on the pedal you know and then floor it as as my shoulders engaging as that triceps engaging and then drive through you know with it that's a good point to make because I think you know we probably use the word explode multiple times already yeah and when we say explode we mean through the muscle we're generating all that force through the muscle we're trying to target if I wanted to just explode with my full body you know I could I could throw the barbell through the ceiling if that was my goal to explode you know what I mean like yeah we say explode we're saying generate all as you're lowering you're loading that muscle loading that muscle you're and then from the bottom you're going to hit that quick pause and then generate all the force from your pecs on up drive your back into the pad whatever you're on and then you know push it up we're not saying explode as and use everything underneath the bar to get that bar up right yeah yeah that would be eight eight a beat training and we're training as we're talking from the perspective of bodybuilding so what what happens next after you you're done with that mean you know heavy lift you're using the barbell press I'm using the dumbbell and client where you go from there so following Tuesday's workout I went to the incline hammer strength so to prep us I don't lock out on my barbell presses I lose the connection to my chest if I lock out and my front del or my shoulder will roll over yeah and it it just it's not beneficial for me so I go up I only my range of motion is as high as I can get the bar where I still feel tension on my chest when I don't feel that anymore is where it stops so from an outside or looking in it might be like oh he's not doing full reps but I'm just doing the reps that are keeping the tension on my chest I don't want to fully lock out and put my tries to lock my arms out and then have the weight down my front delts yeah that's one thing David does do I know because he's he's talked about like pressing through and I I don't do that either I still have been stopping shy for me that's what I feel most comfortable with and really I can say that with most exercises I do from the time that the weight is unrapped to the time I rack it there's tension on the muscle and there's no point where I'm actually like completely locked out anywhere I guess I feel the same thing I get a lot of I get a lot of bicep tendonitis and when I can't completely lock out I definitely I definitely feel that there yeah maybe it's because you know we both have pretty long arms maybe that that contributes leverage is contribute and you know Dave's he's a crazy strong presser right so yeah he's crazy strong on everything yeah he's he I mean he would know better than us of what's the right way or the wrong way I just try to do the way that where I keep tension on the muscle that I'm trying to work and you know the results are there that my chest finally started growing when I stopped doing the things I was doing so I just I followed that it's a very gross science approach but I'm not telling you don't lock out I'm just saying yeah if if you are maybe you know auto you're training but what I what I'm getting at is next up sing climb hammer strength on this one I will lock out okay I don't that thing that happens on the bar door or the shoulder rolls over it doesn't happen on the incline hammer strength I think because I'm at a more fixed position I don't have to worry about stability yeah all I have to do is you know come down I keep my elbows tucked so I set the seat real low almost as low as it can go yeah yeah because a lot of those machines especially hammer strength brand they can cause like a pinch in my shoulder for me so I'll drop to see all the way down the grip I take is one thumb length away from the MW handle that's exactly what I do everything you've explained so far when I'd use that machine I try to do the same low seat yeah hands right in there yeah the hand placement I have to get credit to Dante on because I I used to probably be wider again because I could I could move more weight and I was you know chasing the log but when I first got on DC I was very like focused on beating my numbers by any means possible even if I met shit form so Dante I think you put a video out or he sent something to do see I can't remember go since then I've been thumbs from the end of the the handles that's where my grip goes and to there I feel like I can really drive and I pushed my back and I put the pad and then I squeeze everything from here to here nice inward and I'm almost trying to make it touch my chin and I'm not when I lock out so my thinking is that I'm getting the overall load and gravity and a lot more stretch with the incline barbell and then when I go to incline hammer strength I'm still getting some stretch but my my main emphasis on that is is the lock out so I'll still take it as low as I can before you know my shoulders take over but I'm really trying to drive my back into the pad and I want to finish you know up here yeah yeah almost like I'm trying to squeeze my wrists and elbows together you know what I like doing that that type of movement on we talked about this machine before all around all the different metro Detroit powerhouse gyms have the Magnum brand incline press machines it's kind of like a slightly cheaper incline press machine and it's converging handles and yeah just the way that my hands come up it's like I could get this drive and the squeeze through the packs you know while completely locking it out at the top I've I've done a movement you're talking about with that machine and like did a lot. I love that machine my gym had one I would use that exclusively. Yeah anything that mimics that because what it's like a you know a 75 degree angle with the bench and it's almost like that little gap where it hits is like exactly what I'm missing in my chest that that fullness right here okay you know what I mean so like when I when I when I'm able to do one of those machines if I'm traveling I love it so yeah that I think it's called like a super high incline press I don't know the hammer hammer has one yeah Magnum has one I think Legend has one too with the converging handles yeah they're they're nice they're very especially I feel like but guys the long arms are still for us how many sets do you do with that exercise? two working so with with that one I wanted to get two working sets of eight to ten and the goal was to hold the same weight with the second set or go up weight if I felt that it was an easy ten it wasn't an easy ten so I kept the same weight and my goal was just to match the reps which I did and I got you know three plates on each side for ten and then three plates on each side for nine which I'm okay with warm up wise it was just one plate each side and the warmups already done for me at this point I just need to touch the weight so it's nothing to surprise to me yeah so it was just you know five reps of one plate on each side three reps of two people at each side end of three and I'm ready to go by this time like I you know I put down three quarters of my intra which is a leader and a half of fluid I'm mentally I'm checked in I just had my my meat and potato movements out of the way it's an hour everything else is just icing on the cake yeah and this is right just try to really you know push blood volume and and training as hard as I can with each rep yeah yeah that's cool man I feel like what we're doing isn't too dissimilar I have um it's a company called F-light it's a chest press with converging handles um when I bought it I actually looked at the guy had both the incline and the flat version I generally feel better on incline machines but for some reason the flat machine felt great and you can incline the bench slightly it goes it goes up moderately but the higher you go the less clearance you have to get under the pad under the handles so I have it on a slight incline and I keep my elbows in what I'm looking for on this second exercise now is more like to flush the blood full of muscle or excuse me flush the muscle full of blood is what I'm attempting to do um I'm you know I've gotten my my big scary lift out of the way where I really challenge myself and I've done something I've never done before and at this state I want to use a weight that I can get you know a ballpark 10 reps with now 10 to even 12 maybe I'll even go higher on a random occasion but at this point though I really like to just flush blood into the muscle and I'll do about two sets of that you know two failure both of them are two you know absolute failure but at this point it's not as much of a challenge for me like the the stress is off of me for the sexier size now I feel a lot more relaxed and I'm obviously pumped from having done the first exercise and from here now it's it's it's more about like I said getting to like finishing the muscle off I may use that occasionally I'll do now I also have a bar a kabuki strength a catalach bar which has neutral grip handles on it occasionally I'll use that instead but I'm thinking the same thing it's not like a heavy be all end all weight this is now a movement where I am just working on like trying to get more out of the muscle in that you know round top 10 reps yeah very similar to how we're we approach things very similar that's interesting I knew we didn't some ways but I didn't I didn't realize it was to that extent yeah I mean I followed your your progression with the incline dumbbell because I know you're a post and I want pretty heavily just the ability to get strong I think is key yeah for anyone listening like our end goal is still you know maximum strength with proper form all training like bodybuilders when we had you know I know I had to lighten the load and I think at the same I had to completely go back to square one and reinvent my press almost yeah to be it to press with you know with chest and my inverse is just overall weight on the bar or weight on the machine but then from there once we established it the goal became the same again as to get as strong as we can yeah push you for strength in every movement so that's still the mindset I carry you know I will not so much right now but even in the offices and like I'll use vibes out of an incline hammer I'll use tens I'll use those little ways just to progress anyway I can because those they add up that's what gets you to a 45 is 5 10's 25 right so absolutely keep in mind that anybody listening especially newer people like once you do standardize your form which you should just attempt to do from the beginning don't do it like we did and do it wrong for years and then have to go backwards and then go forward again right learn now yeah strength is a stronger muscles a bigger muscle yeah in a quest to admit do you do another exercise from here then yeah so I go from incline hammer right next door to it is the decline hammer that's awesome because I just take my weight right up the incline hammer start putting them on the decline hammer nice um that one is I still train for strength but with the way I position my body into that machine we're going so strong I'm gonna get because a lot of it kind of can be a stability one so I again I dropped the seat pretty low I go same same grip from away and then I'll slide my hands out ever so slightly a little bit more so I'm a little wider yeah just somewhere where I can feel that lower peck stretch as I'm at the bottom this one I put both my legs in front of the in front of the bottom of the seat and my legs the seats lower but it's not a little way down so my feet actually don't touch when I put my legs in front and then I'll cross my feet and then from there I try to scoot my butt forwards so I'm not all the way flush against the back of the pad I'm kind of my butts forward and I'm almost at like an angle now yeah my upper backs against the pad and then when I press so if I'm in the stretch here my heads forward slightly and then from here as I press forward again same thing as I did on the incline hammer I drive everything back and I try to lock out and squeeze those pecks together okay and this one I'm really trying to feel everything contract so on this one every rep has to have a two count contraction okay to the count pause with the contraction yeah so I can really emphasize finishing that that's where my mindset is with this machine in particular and I don't do anything else I don't do decline barbell I don't do a decline fly it's only decline hammer is the only thing I'll do and for some reason I think maybe because my whole chest is already activated by this point like I get a lot of activation in the upper peck too like I feel like everything's coming across and really squeezing up okay so I'm feeling everything from here I'm going to hear yeah and this one two worksets maybe the same way maybe different they're both a failure but tend to 12 so two plates aside usually will be my first set and then three plates aside will be my second set again I could go heavier but I wouldn't be able to do what I just mentioned I wouldn't be able to get full lock out and get that two count contraction on each route okay and that's my ultimate goal with this one is to really make sure I'm sticking that contraction and holding it and I'm holding it I'm not just holding it there I might chill and thinking about what I'm going to have for lunch yeah I'm actively thinking about squeezing the hell out of my pecks I'm going to have each fret and then come back down it's almost like you're loading up and then driving loading up and then driving so I think you touched it on the first step so like these sessions are very mentally stimulating so you know this would kind of differentiate between some of the ghosts of the gym just to work out for general health and then like what we're talking about is training yeah it's a mental stimulus just as much as it is physical and if your head's not in it if you're you know thinking about some other shit outside of the gym your session is going to suffer because of that so yeah that's a big thing too is to you know leave any external bullshit that you got going on in your own personal life at the door when you walk in I mean I'm only there an hour 15 I can whatever problems I have or whatever else I have to do is you're going to be there when I get when I get done you're going to have 23 other hours of drama just take yeah and you know what to you're right because I think to here's I think where an issue can come in with if you were training like me that second exercise that I'm getting into it would be easier to unplug when I say that the stress is gone I'm still very focused on what I'm doing you know and I'm still only doing a couple sets on this movement so I am making sure that I stay plugged in I've seen it where you know you get through the heavy stuff and now it's all fun and games you know and I do want to have fun with my workout I want to keep it enjoyable but you know it is important to continue staying you know plugged in for me that's all I do I only do two exercises because I'm training push pull legs and so far I'm going to two shoulder movements and then one try set movement so it works out a little bit different for for me at this stage that's generally what I do right now coming back from being L I am just training one body part but that workout's not even worth talking about out of podcast it's is not podcast where are these so when you're in your full push pull legs swing are you rotating chest exercises that you're doing session the session are you sticking with those same that same two depends on how I'm feeling there are going to be times where if I'm getting really strong and I'm like hey I'm gonna push this out so that I hit chest again in five days and I want to try to beat that number there may be a time that I may be able to do that otherwise I am rotating it you know I mentioned heaven the the computer I just got that but before that I'd use a barbell just standard barbell and I may do an incline press and work on getting stronger with that for me I'm not a very strong barbell incline or barbell presser in general I I feel like my shoulders have seen their better days I have to be careful with it so it's almost like my less hard workout you know I'll I'll do barbell movements more for like 12 reps to failure instead of 8 reps to failure with the dumbbells so it's it's not as hard of a workout though I am still working on getting just as much engagement on if it it's not the fun workout put it that you know the way it's not the one where I'm like really overloading it so so yeah there I would say there is a level of intuitiveness on how often I am pushing but I would say in general there's going to be like one more intense chest workout and then one less intense chest workout where I'm not going to like the absolute you know the absolute ends doing something I've never done before okay yeah I found you know what it is is that I found splitting it up helps me a lot I I was doing five day split for that last prep Uni both ended up at out in Grand Rapids for the the Western um that prep my shoulder was really bothering me on my on my presses so what I ended up doing was doing two chest exercises one day and then coming back on my shoulder day and doing two more chest exercises and I found that if I were to only limited to two exercises my shoulder didn't bother me so I could still hit my full chest workout which had been four exercises at the time but split it up through the week and then what I discovered was I continued doing that after the prep and I did everything else one body part of week and then I thought okay I'm looking in the mirror my chest grew like I changed nothing else nothing else was different the only variable I changed was how I trained my chest the frequency and volume and I saw the results from that so that's when I decided to myself well what if I were to do everything that way and slowly over the next two years I transitioned over to training push pull legs then my volume or my frequency started getting to be you know a little bit more spread out too I don't do two times a week that would crush me but I would say about every five days I trained a body part yeah I'm very I mean similar just I don't split it and there's one more movement I do which I'll get to oh you do yeah because I hit everything every body part gets hit every seven yeah we're on a fixed schedule right now so we have the same two all days every week okay so everything's getting touched every seven I mean obviously that you know other muscles come into play on different days but so I hit chest on Tuesdays I'm not gonna hit it again till next Tuesday right so for me that's when I because I did I found a push pull leg same as you like the frequency start once I got to a certain level of strength it almost the frequency was too short I needed even though the volume was low I still needed more time yeah and that might be my own recovery capabilities everyone's different but you know I can really hammer the muscle on one day and still keep still training the way I want with low volume high intensity and then it's almost like piece of mind knowing like all right even if I feel sore as hell for the next three days I still have ample time to feel good by by the time I have to do this again absolutely so yeah that fourth movement I run to is a flat fly dumbbell okay and this one's all about the stretch for me I like to finish with the movement in the stretch um I got that from um obviously in DC you finished chest training with a fourth stretch a fourth loaded stretch yeah so that's kind of what we incorporate into this movement so every rep has a five count stretch in the whole so for me that allows because I I probably couldn't connect with flies dumbbell flies for years I did them but I I had no I think they were not hitting my chest at all they were just you know right across that front del just really didn't feel good um and I'm not terrible strong on them so what I've done to make this movement work for me is it's I don't try to get real wide I keep it almost like a 90 and I just try to keep that chest up through I have to explain extended and let the elbows drop almost like it's almost like a fly press but it's not a full fly press okay um but that five count in the whole allows me to make sure like we talked about in the beginning where I'm engaging peck I'm not letting my shoulders hop up and I'm not holding the weight on my front del I'm still down here the chest is stretching the chest is stretching and then like you you mentioned I'm focused on driving up with my peck versus just moving the way out of the whole yeah so we'll do two sets of that to finish it off you know eight to ten reps but with a five count hold in each rep that's like that's a minute under tension that's a lot yeah and that's how you're finishing and then you're also finishing by you know getting the benefits of loaded stretching post training which is just going to help with her hypertrophy so after that one I mean my chest is fried I could do another movement if I wanted to so you know four movements as our caps sometimes three you know if we're really not even if we we tax it on the other ones but formal be the absolute max and then um so with shoulder training since I don't do that on this day we don't really do any shoulder presses so I'm kind of the same as you as I've got some spongy shoulders um and I'm trying to keep longevity in mind so we might throw in one shoulder press and if we do it's after we do a lot like it's after three movements so our strength is already going to be compromised and we're not training that movement to all out like we would you know I'm chest yeah we're only going to be as strong as we could be for being the fourth movement of that day so that's how I'm able to keep my shoulders intact or pressing is by putting 75 to 80 percent of my pressing work is only for chest because that's what I need over delts yeah um and then you know obviously everyone has different needs so I'm not telling everyone you have to do it this way this is what I customize to my you know little tweaks and injuries that I've had to work through and to my programming and scots done the same thing but the point is as we're trying to get you to look deeper into your training other than just thinking like oh yeah I train hard to check that box I'm all good yeah what's my next cycle right yeah I'm fascinated by the ability to dive into our training the fact that you and I can have a genuine conversation about our training sessions and and really you know get into the access and those of it like that's that's the stuff I love and if you're that hyper focused on on your training anything you take cycle wise is going to have a positive effect absolutely and you'll probably be able to handle taking less you know if you're if you're getting that much out of your training and look you know what we're talking about too I I did we did get one criticism on our last show somebody said look you don't need to do all this you don't need to think about it you just get in there you lift weights you lift heavy and you go eat food that's bodybuilding bodybuilding isn't analyzing everything and breaking it down but the reality is is that after you might not need to do what we're doing that may work for you it may work for you forever and if that's the case more power to you but if it doesn't then then this is the next route is thinking about well if I am pressing this and my chest isn't growing why is that and there's a lot of people out there that have that very issue so I thought before we wrapped this thing up we could maybe talk about what are some of the common issues that we see if somebody's listening to this they're 50 minutes in that means that I think they're they may need some help with their chest training hopefully they've picked a few things up you know what one of the common issues I think we've talked about is the the shoulder thing you know so the shoulder mobility 100% yeah and pressing from the shoulders you know not not using the packs I think that that's that's all I did from the start and like my first contest my delts had popped out but my chest was just non-existent still you know it's kept by comparison when you started out were you naturally a stronger presser on shoulder movements that's absolutely absolutely yeah and do you think that you gravitated towards that because you had a natural strength towards it so you might have wanted to go in on that more because I know I was the same way shoulder pressing came easier than anything with it you know I could probably military press as much as I could venture in kind you know back when I was first starting out so dude yeah I wanted I wanted to go in on that movement that was like all right yeah at least look semi-respectable on this so yeah let's blow these delts up I think that's the case of everyone you know you find something that you're good at and that's what you that's what you keep doing yeah man I I remember training shoulders as a middleweight with a guy who was a strong man and we were pressing the same dumbbells like because and I thought good about that you know but in reality though man my chest was way I think at the time I was in-clined pressing 90s and I was shoulder pressing the 130s a seated shoulder press but it's like that was the heaviest I got and I could do sets of you know four sets of that you know for for good reps too like we're not talking like five reps we're talking to eight reps but yeah my my chest was way behind I think you make a really good point man at the time though I didn't change that I was just happy I could press something that was 130 pounds you know yeah I remember 100 ton dumbbells were like that's almost like what it was like to get to 200 pounds for V was like if I could move if I could do something with a hundred pound dumbbells yeah I'm somebody I'm in the triple digit club yeah yeah I'm doing the hundreds that's because that's the end of the stat or that's closer to the end of the stat that's like the higher you get the gym I'm going to be respected because I'm using 100 so absolutely I think I fell into that trap I think that's interesting that you did too that's funny that we're both naturally strong with shoulders so we decided to go after that one of them just kind of chest was an after thought no when I ended up learning was to we talked about it a little bit before was um uh pre-fetiging my coach I started training with him after that first show and every day we did chest we would start with the pack deck and I could not do as much on the barbell bench press after that as I could if I had a gone in fresh but it made a difference uh I've talked to Scott Stevenson about it on some muscle minds episodes you do get more overall activation in your workout if you were to start with that so I found that to be my work around I didn't focus on better engagement like we're talking about I just focused on pack deck first and do you find that I guess if you had to pick one of the other which way would you say it's the better ways as I have to be a better way as either one option I think that learning the engagement was probably a smarter move you know I probably could have avoided some shoulder issues because I still was doing the same stuff I did before but I did I did I do think it helped because I did get more activation out of the pack and then when I went into those pressing movements they were already warmed up and I could already feel it you know so I do think that it did make a difference so it almost like you coached yourself in the ability to have the mind muscle down the road where you missed and I'm just in the way yeah yeah yeah yeah because I did some similar I had a strength block where I I did cable cross over just my opener yes for that very very purpose was to I I deemed it as like I was getting blood in the pack so I was getting activated all that yeah and now that I I don't think it was wrong but I just I think there's a better way to do it I agree and that's kind of the way we're talking about I think you shouldn't do a movement long-term you should be doing a movement first that's going to take away from your overall strength because what have we covered and this is that a stronger muscle is a bigger muscle and if I'm compromising my strength on my press because I mean we're if you have a press versus a fly I mean a press is how you build a chest look at it I mean success is clearly anybody with a big chest they have some impressive press in movements right so it's good that we were able to find a way to activate the chest and learn yeah but long long story short is that the best way to do it is to learn the overall movement learning the overall engagement of the packs and then start with your press I can't argue with that man if you could retrain yourself to get that activation out of the pack first I think that that that would be that would be huge I think another thing that I see with chest is overall tightness being an issue and I see that with a ton of people now I lean forward when we're sitting here you know and everything's kind of coming forward but in reality when I'm sitting natural I'm more like this and the thing that you want to see like I learned this from Dr. Kenkenack and he said like look at your hands if you're sitting there and your hand is turned forward if you could see the back of your hand then your chest is pulled you that way you get the you know the way you get the body builder knee and their fall ape will look you know and I mean you don't want that and we end up having a lot of issues I think in body building with with tight packs you know we're we're pulling forward that those muscles get tight and that they're pulling you this way that can cause those sorts of issues like the shoulder issue I've talked about that's impart responsible and I think that if you can keep that stuff loose you can you could definitely get stronger you can stay healthier while you're doing it and long term will have a bigger chest yeah I think that's a good point to touch on I definitely have to credit to a lot of the body work and the the maintenance I do on my body is my mobility has increased it's allowed my range of motion to increase yeah and that's allowed my muscle to have a bigger threshold to grow if I look at videos of me pressing four years ago versus today the range of motions probably half yeah and the chest development was probably half or less so I think the more we're talking about activation in order to get activation you have to have the ability to get to those points of activation so I know I see a PT I see I have a guy that does some body tempering on me I've worked with plenty of people and Michigan before I moved out here I look at that as like you know some of it was for pain and actually had injuries but other parts of it was like this is an investment in my training performance and I know you saw learning Becky yeah yeah yeah you saw her did you the back translate into you having better range of motion with your person so with my shoulder issues what yeah well here's the deal with my shoulder issues that I had I stopped doing a lot of pressing for a while and I could I got to the point where it's like if I went to this gym I can use that machine if I go to this gym I can use that machine and then I'll add a fly to that and that's what my chest workout is that's where it went for a while having see if I used a dumbbell even like 25 30 pounds like light I would feel it in that by September and it would scream at me and I just couldn't do it I saw Becky in the very next day I was doing sets of 90s on dumbbell press flat dumbbell press so it was a huge overnight difference and that's that's what I'm getting at two men with that that tightness because I do see a lot of the young guys that are especially like you're getting geared up your new and into body building you have started to grow some muscle I think one of the first things I see is those packs get overly tight they're pulling you forward and it's going to affect your ability to continue progressing from there you know absolutely and I guarantee there's some people that are going to listen to this and they're going to have the aha moment where it's like I'm that guy I'm the guy who was 25 pound presses are a grind for me and like you said you had one session where they were moving 90s and how many people are just like they just they've accepted that that's where they're at sure I've had that with certain injuries not related to the chest but like I just accepted like this is as much activations I can get this is this is life and then I got fixed and I'm like it's almost like a real weight getting you know like oh we hell I have I have all this range of motion that I haven't been able to tap into for X amount of time so that's what I'm getting at with the body work because if you are listening to this and you're that guy that's like you know you feel 135 on a bar not a good way and you're someone who used to be able to press more yeah that's your body's telling you something you're something is not opening up and there's a there's a blockage there's a trigger point somewhere that needs to be released and that's what a lot of these experts can do if you have someone in your area I'm everyone's different I'm blessed to be where I'm at and we have a lot of good people out here but um I would I just I mentioned that when it comes to training because I wouldn't even be training I train I could work for the Bauer people I've worked with so I look at any money and that is an investment in your performance yeah yeah I agree 100% man well listen let's wrap this thing up while we're here I think we shared some really good information hopefully hopefully some light bulbs get turned on here like I said at the beginning you know I have people who are interested in learning you know what do you do how do you do this and so hopefully being able to sit down with you and being able to have these conversations we can answer some of those questions that those guys have and you know they might be able to get a little bit more out of their training uh if you were to tell people to do one thing today to change their training what one thing could they do Tommy to improve you know next time they walk in the gym and train chest I would say with whatever you're going to do pause everything for a full at least one count in the stretch of every rep and that will show you you will learn right then and there if you're activating your chest out of the bottom of the movement or not I like that or if you're if you're bypassing it completely right then I touched on it I did the same thing I blasted through the chest I completely bypassed that to get you my chest out of the bottom for years so that that's almost like a litmus test is do that do it with your warm-ups obviously don't do it with a weight and you're probably going to have to lower your numbers but test yourself if if you're at the bottom of a press and you're going to get like yeah and your shoulder wants to from that from that pause position it goes up and then you go up then that's telling you something you're you're not getting the full activation you code or you're not keeping the tension you could and that might not be a tightness issue here that might be something in the thoracic that might be something tear like something back everything can kind of seat belt and so that's why it's you know the point is it's just a kind of turn turn that light bulb on and make you think if you are someone struggling to develop a chest and I think I think everything kind of falls into two-kit like there's some people who the first time they started venting they grow a chest right yep and then there's guys like us that didn't so I think you're either going to go to one or two ways and maybe you're in the middle and you want to get more chest development this is just meant this whole thing is kind of just meant to help you turn that light bulb and think and audit your training and really ask yourself am I training the muscle or am I just training a movement and am I training my chest or am I training everything that has to do with my upper body just to say I'm training my chest you know I mean I just want people to turn that light bulb on and really get really get in depth with how to learn how to use an training yes sir I couldn't agree more if people want to reach out to you Tommy where's the best way to follow along with what you're doing and follow along with your prep right now it's Instagram I have a website being developed but nice it's a takes it's time so Instagram T styles to STI LES and then you know obviously I train with dust and so anything he puts out on his YouTube I think it's training wise I'm in there too nice yeah that's that's it for following along with me right now cool man while I'm looking forward to seeing how things you know come along for your prep I'm sure we'll get another one of these knocked out before you get to brain dead you know everybody who's watching thank you guys for following along with what we're doing here and like I said in the beginning if you have suggestions on the next muscle group that you'd like to see us talk about definitely let us know Tommy Styles man it's been a pleasure as always brother thank you
