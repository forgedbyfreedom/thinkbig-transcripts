The biggest thing for me that made it so amazing was the reaction of the kids. So the kids are in the audience, they got your signs made up. This is very in mind, they've never met you before, they've just saw an image of giant and they've made your banner. So look around the arena and see that and hear them shout your nails. Phenomenal. That's surreal. Welcome everybody to Esges bodybuilding episode two from day one. Of the 2024 Arnold Expo, Ron Parlo does the Han Shah and the producers coming now on board. Remember to like, share, subscribe, comment and ring the bell. Ring the bell. Today we got special guests all the way from the other side of the booth. He's not even, he's not even Jamie the giant anymore. He's just the giant. The giant. What's going on my friend? I think good. It's been a while, that's not necessarily a bit on the podcast. Yeah, but I guess we thought fam got to you. We got to act at your, your, your, your, your publicist. Yeah. What does on the list? Yeah, with my agent and then the agent. Yeah, the broadcast company. And they said, don't call us. We'll call you. Remember, I am mutant.com, go to I am mutant.com, get your ISO search, get your all in, and everyone should get on the gear. Let's end. I got to announce it's not, I'm not going to make a big deal out of it because I don't know what I'm talking about, but we were launching a new product today at the Arnold. Oh, we're launching the mine. Yes. Yes. That's how I'm saying it. Some people might say mine freak. I'm saying mine. This is like, Marcia. Marcia. Marcia. So how would there be a freak? Mine. Yeah, I don't know. You'd think they'd leave the other are. They're going to be the other. If you wanted it to be, the mine. Yeah, and it's our, our new tropic formula. Yeah. We work out new tropic formula. So I'm very excited about that. So yeah, that's the news here at the Arnold X. But we're launching the mine. And, uh, scutty be busy editing this one. Oh, yeah. And, uh, don't even know what it's called. Yeah. Yeah. It's called. It's a new product. And we got Jamie the giant. So let's get to that. Jamie the giant. Whoa. Just on that note about the product name as well. Yes. I'm going to the podcast a few times before. I have a bit of a potty mouth like you, Rob. Yes. As the many of the bridge do. However, because I know I'm on a family orientate show. Yes. After rain night. So you're ready to do it. You may not find me, uh, using any f-bombs today. Oh, yeah. That's okay. I appreciate that. I totally good with that. Less sending. He, that's what happens. The public just comes in and give you the Tom Cruise speech. They give you the, they give you the the Ryan Reynolds. Everyone's got to love you. Break it down for you. Hey. Wait, it's funny when we're, uh, auditioning and going through the process before filming. I obviously do my stories. My morning walks. And one of the editors like messengers, I Jamie. Right. I'm just going to give you a bit of a word of advice. And take it. How you will book imagine your audience. When you're doing your videos. You're speaking to an eight year old child. Oh. My ass, you're a bit, is it my child? Yeah, yeah. My kid needs to learn the tough words. It's a hard life out there. Okay. Of course, for those of you that don't watch the British broadcasting company, where company or corporation, where they call it. The BBC, the, like, I would say the biggest broadcast company in the UK. It's British broadcasting company or corporate. I can't remember the how the word goes. I would go on the spot. British broadcasting. It's how we got to say it. Yeah, the top dogs in England. And so Jamie's on the gladiator show. And it's going really well. Yeah, it's got amazing. I mean, we filmed the show in June. So it started filming, sorry, Aaron on the BBC on the 30th of January. It's got to run for 11 weeks. So I think there's that four weeks left. Yeah. And the ratings are smashing at the minute. So nice. Yeah, it's so good. I, uh, it's been a big year for you. So you got to, got to gake. Yep. And you couldn't really tell us anything about it. And then you went and filmed the whole season. Yeah. Over the course of two months in the summer. Yep. And you had to downsize for that. And you had to work on your athletics. Yes. And you had to get your feet back. Yeah, that's all that stuff. As an Asian man as well. Yeah. You quit. You quit. You really realize you're not as young as you used to be. And things are, things are come back quite as quick. Yeah. I mean, I did one thing. You know, at the same time, I'm trying to double up on being more involved. I'm involved as a father. So yes, you know, do more things with the kids because we know we all know bodybuilding takes you away in your own zone for a lot of that time. Oh yeah. So things like football and, you know, just spending more time with the kids with commonplace. I remember one day when I was trying to get fit and doing all these functional things for training for it to be a glad year. I said, I raised my son to the halfway line on the football pitch. Right. I was like, we're as neck and neck. We're at 9.14. So that you show that slow iron. You turn it halfway line. I'm like, growing just goes, oh, oh my god. Maybe I should be doing this crap. That's limits. Yeah. I was going to ask how long it took you to get your first athletic re-entry. Because every guy that leaves bodybuilding and goes like, Jiu-Jitsu or, hey, like four months into ride might be a mex that's on my hamstring. Yeah. I had to learn it quick. I was like, oh, there we go. Yeah. That's going to happen. I'm going to learn how long it would take you to get hurt bouncing around and changing direction and all that. Listen to the music. Listen to month. Yeah. But hey, you get better for it. Yeah. So so you did all that and you couldn't talk about it. Because you don't want to ruin the season. Like, can't say anything, right? It was difficult. Yeah. Yeah. The massive thing that's happening in my life. I can't say anything about it. And then, you know, as a sponsor, that's as well. I'm no longer a bodybuilder. So I imagine Jim's not pulling his hair out saying, and we're paying Jamie or his money and. And he's not doing it. And he can't even talk about it, right? I don't know what I mean. So yeah, that's, that's, and we were all kind of like excited and waiting. Like, when's this show going to come out? Yeah. I can't wait to see Jamie in this set of this outfit. They got him in a three quarter lead. It's a rock in a single. Yeah. You know what they should have done? They should have let your character wear an old NPC. Yeah. Listen to it all the old NPC flex wheeler one. They should just let the one gladiator wear that. Or the old crazy wear, you know what I mean? The thing is, I was one of the gladiators. It was looking off to wear more clothes and his new fan grip. Right. Yes. They're all feeling naked. You felt like, oh, yeah. No problem when things sucks and shoes. And yeah, exactly. Yeah, the old physique shorts. There was good. Yes. Plenty of coverage. You're almost too much. So we got to ask a few questions, obviously. So what was, what was it like when you first showed up and you met all the other gladiators? Were there was everyone like sizing each other up and you realized like, I assume they went for like a real. They wanted a whole bunch of different people, right? Yeah. So back in the day when gladiator's on the BBC and I noticed in American or the countries, they predominantly back then in like the early 90s. Nobody built it. Yeah, that was crazy. Yeah. It's all about to look. Yeah. But with the advancements of most like sports now and got trust for, we got Olympic sprinters. As Bob Slee, team, there's such an array of athletes within the gladiator squad. There was a bit of sizing up, I guess, but there's more and appreciation of someone's ability. Yeah. We got a guy called Harry Ackens, G.B. Sprinter, his name's Nitro in the show. And I put a comment on his Instagram the other day because I watched him sprinting. He did a real sprinting. And I said, I could watch you run all day. My miss is ghost. That's a bit of a weird comment. He's just a spectacle. Yeah. I know exactly. It's like watching a gazelle. Yeah. You're just like, I couldn't ever move like that. Like, you know what I mean? Head is perfectly level and just flying down the track. Yeah. Workable. Yeah. Workable. Yeah. Yeah. What did they think of you? I mean, you're the biggest guy. You're the tallest, you're the biggest. We're in the fly. Now, one of the oldest as well. So, kind of take on that father role. Right. I was, I think as big guys we got the respect to people anyway. Right. But I've got the age factor as well. So it's like now now children listening. I'm going to tell you a few stories. I love it. Great. So it's good. Back when TV was black and white. Yeah. But when we had four channels. Yeah. Channel five got added. What were some of the things they said? You said you respected that. You like watching that sprint or move and you're like, Wow. You know, what were some of the things like after you started doing your stuff for people like man, you're just like, you're so hard to move or like, where were the comments they were again? I mean, yeah. I think it was quite clear. We was all there for certain. Like role and reason. Right. And my reason was to be the big guy. And as a game called the Jew, you have a big stick. Yes. And you got a knock to give a go. Yeah. That's the best one. That's the one that used to be the number one feeder. I'm an American Guardian. What was it real adjusting one? Yeah. So there was a UK guy named Chateau back in the day. He was known as the King of the Jew. So that was like, I want that time. Right. And no spoilers. But as it's airing in the UK now, I think I'm four and a. And I've got three more bounce left. Right. Because he does he goes seven and a half. So we see. We see. Okay. But yeah. That was quite clear. And then it kind of, I think to me, it took a bit of pressure off me because I'm thinking, why don't I go to climb a wall? I got a swing on these rings. I got to be able to sprint and all this and obviously very short period of time to transition from being a bodybuilder and working in one plane, up and down forward and backwards. Yeah. So that took a bit of pressure off because I had the support of the team who were all there for an individual specific reason. We've all got a strength. Yeah. So I've got to try and be the all-rounder. Around the big guy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They're not really asking anybody to do that. No. Right. Yeah. But moving forward, you know, season two has not been commissioned yet, but I'm very, very positive at will be. I want to do a few more events for next season. So I'm already working on my upper body strength and the pull ups and the ability to even hang from one on. Right. It's just, it sounds really simple, but it's not for as kind of guys. Yeah. Yeah. And then swing with one on. Yeah. It's like, you know, people don't understand the physics, like, you know, 170 pounds is different than 270 pounds. But then also when you're swinging, there's that G4 on your grip and all that stuff and you become 500 pounds. Yeah. I mean, how many body builders have been to, I don't know, whatever they do in the US or Canada, but they've got the show, the Ninja Warrior and the UK. Yeah. Yeah. And then in the UK, they've also got the center set up to replicate the Ninja Warrior, try yourself. I know many of the bodybuilders are for great idea for YouTube video and I come back with Tom Biser. Right. Absolutely. That's the number one thing that happens with people do those hangs. Yeah. But yeah. What about the contestants that you're going up against? Do, is there any, like, time spent with them or are they just, like, cold? You have no idea of this? They're just knocked this guy up a platform. So we actually filmed it in an ice hockey arena. Yes. So you imagine a tunnel that surrounds the inner ring as it were. Yeah. So you meet your inner tunnel before the match. Ah. You kind of like, given the eye. Yeah. As a show goes on, we see the contenders, multiple times if they get fruit and the next rounds. Yeah. So there's a little, there's a few niceties. Well, they know what's coming. Right. So it's always fun. And I don't think the contenders know before hand, who they're going up against. So the first time they'll find out is when we're in the tunnel. Right. So someone's on jewel and they walk out and giants in the tunnel. God's. Yeah. I got to go against the big guy. Yeah. So that's fun. Who's the smallest glad eater? Um, there's a chap called a Viper. I think he's the shortest. But in terms of shortest, I'm saying 510. Right. Yeah. He's still a big guy. Yeah. Yeah. He's still a glad eater. He's actually a really, really cool guy and a great character. So on the show in the UK back in the day, there was a character called the Wolf. The Wolf was like the bad guy. The heel. Right. He's one of two of our current gladiators at play, like a batting. Right. So the kids love that. Yeah. And they cheer for the regular gel over hand. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. And he's not a favorite by the audience. Well, how did this selection go? How did the process go? I see they've been sending you out to like breakfast TV and the talk shows circuit in England and doing all the London TV stuff. How did you get selected? You're just visually very, obviously visually very impressive. Yeah. So that's probably one of the reasons they opted to send you to all this stuff. Yeah. But you've also become one of the more popular gladiators. Yeah. I think that's down to obviously the stature for sure. Got a good set of legs in the Lycra. Help. Yeah. So people love the wheels. Got a bit of fake tan on the show. We look nice and brown the white teeth. Yeah. It goes in. There you go. But I think ultimately. And I do a bodybuilding in the current climate social media and YouTube and things to thank for as well. Is that you have the big good on camera? Yeah. Yeah. Be good at speaking to people and portraying the character. Now, look at me. I'm just being myself. Yeah. Yeah. That's very interesting to do. Are a character. Yeah. So I'm laughing at Jo, Cosmyl. I win and gracious with it at the same time. So I guess it's easy to be liked. Right. Yeah. So how do the heels? How do they heal it up? Do they like stomp on guys after they beat them? And act on sportsmen like like how do they heal it up? They give it a crowd the finger. How does that work? That's a bit of odd you, Bob. I think it was a bit of odd you bit of pushing and whatever else. I know we just said a word I don't know what it was but I think it was English slang. I've got good about it. So odd you biology. Yeah. It's a bit of pushing and shipping. A bit of odd you biology. I'm going to use that moving forward. There you go. Okay. Um. And then they had the foam on the microphone. It's like the wrestling microphone. Yeah. And I remember Viper once he like bit the foam off the microphone. Spat it out. So we're a little bit of a taste. I saw one of them on Instagram. They showed a clip. And they had the one. Remember back that they run where they had to get the ball into like a cylinder. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They put ball into the dunk. But one of the gladiars picked the guy up and then threw them back in their ball. Yes. Was that one of those guys? Because that was funny. Well, that was Apollo. He's a really nice guy to be fair. And he's an ex NFL player. So you can imagine a rugby based tackling game. It's savage. Absolutely savage. Yeah. He literally picked the guy up and then threw them back where the balls go. Yeah. Six, about six. About 270 pounds. Actually going against someone who's actually five, six. Two hundred pounds. It's dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. But he actually did it gingerly. You could tell how easy it was to place this guy in the ball bin. Oh man. But it was funny. It is funny. It was an interview after it was like, yeah, just taking out the trash. Yeah. That's very sad. It was great. Good good stuff. So what about the, is there any coaching with your microphone time? Or did they disguise it like wrestling style? Or they're like, let's see what this guy's got? Yeah. Pretty much. I mean, they obviously all did their research and chose us for reasons. And I guess one of the reasons where that we were good. That stuff. Right. I mean, we didn't need much coaches. But it's one of those things where it's got a crum across natural on the TV. Because anything that comes across natural is just better isn't it? Yeah. So a lot of things were just off the cuff. And the good thing is the presenter that presents a show, him and his son, Bradley Walsh, is the main guy is his son Barney. Because obviously there's a lack of number two. They both work great together. Hi, cheers. Jim. Hey, man. So Bradley Walsh has been in TV in the UK for years. It must be 30, 40 years. I don't want to be nasty to him. Yeah. He's got all the guys that are very experienced guys. So he can just like create a conversation and lead you into certain things. So if it wasn't for him, I guess it might have been a bit clunky. Right. Right. He's actually running it. Yeah. Yeah. You don't even know that he's guiding the whole. You carry character to get there. That's it. Yeah. I remember hearing the rock story about the first time. They gave him the microphone. You know, he was like, kind of a lower level guy and he's like giving the mic to me. Give me the mic to my dance. Yeah. And I was like a big moment where they were like, oh. Okay. He can do this. He just lit it up. He can go out and just take over. So yeah. I'm excited to see the show man. I haven't seen obviously we don't get to show. But I want to find out how I can watch the show. Like, you know, I'm sure it'll pop up somewhere where we can stream it. Yeah. Like, once the season's done, it might wind up on. Yeah. They, they, I don't know, right? Maybe. Um, I don't know whether this is like, League or not. So I'm saying it from a position where I think it's legal. Right. Wait, if there's going to be a lot of editing involved. I'm on a bus stop. So what you do is you film the show and then you post it to you. I was going to say what some people do in other countries is they got a VPN app. Oh, yeah. So the class is being in Britain. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Something might be wrong because then you wouldn't pair TV license and yeah, the BBC, we don't pay you TV license. Yeah. Well, that said use Lord VPN code. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, what I was saying is I'll leave it up to you to find out how you do this. Right. Yeah. Some of the BBC, I'm going to say, as there's a way to get pretty much anything done. Yeah. Understood. Understood. What would be like, did you have a chance to do this? Did you have any bad episodes like, did you get hurt on the show at all and have to kind of get through it? Or anything like that at all once too? I was pretty good. They went smooth. Yeah. Then what I would class is about episode is if I wasn't in it as much as I would have liked to be. Because there's, there's eight guys, eight girls. There's only five events each show. So they got to share it out. Right. So there's some weeks where I'm in one thing and I'm like, man. That's what I want. But now with that, let me ask you that I watched a documentary recently about the American lady. Yeah. And it was a great documentary. You guys haven't seen it. It's on. I think Netflix. I'm going to watch it for sure. It was so good. And it's got, it got like cool animations and stuff. But it really took me back to when the show came out. They worked those guys hard. Oh yeah. And then they went on tour. Yeah. So they were like night after night after night. How was this spread out? So we basically filmed it over 11 days. So we did a show a day. And five weeks. Three, four, two, seven is one final. I think my maths is right. And so on day six we had a break. Right. So we did 10 days filming in 11 days. Okay. And the semi final. We filmed it one day. We just had like an afternoon and an evening thing. But generally speaking, we just did one a day. So it's quite cool. Right. There's long days. You know, I've won event in the morning. And then one event in the afternoon is I got to follow up then. So how does that work with like catering and stuff? Because he like I've never been on a TV show. So like so. Like, like, do you have a trailer first of all? Is there a star on the door that says giant? Oh no, no, no. I was thinking what's a trailer like it. I mean, that. Yeah. Like a trailer where you can take a hang out in. And then I was like bringing you like food. And like the foods you guys want. How does that all? So so we have a room. They call it the green room. Yeah. Yeah. We have the green room where we hang out. And they got a lot of snacks. Oh. From a body building background. When you walk in the green room and you see just sweets and crisps. Yeah. Potato chips. What I'd be on a call and that's a kind of level of nutrition. You're getting so. It's down to my stomach. You're getting government nutrition. Yeah. Remember, this is a government. Oh, and it. Yeah. So saying that. I think they fed us to like twice a day. You'd get dinner and an evening meal. Yeah. And then you response with your own breakfast. And that came in within the arena. It was very good. Right. And that was like chicken salmon and rice. Potatoes. Good stuff. But obviously as a form of body building. Six, seven meals a day. That wasn't enough. So I take chicken bagels to the arena. And I'd be yummy. And then two, three times a day as well. Right. Okay. Yeah. Did the other gladier think you eat a lot? My breakfast was a salad bowl full of oats. Right. I'm on butter. The banana. Bit of everything. There's a what that hell is that? Now, were you guys all like sequestered in a hotel? Or were you going home every night? Like, was it all seen? Yeah, to keep you. Yeah, they kept us all in chef food. But they did keep the guys in a set of things. And then the women were over the other side of chef food. In another area. I think they thought he did that based on the, the muscle mayhem. American gladiators. Yeah, they knew they keep the men in women. They were in that last set. They weren't there less than the 90s. Well, that was, that was fun because that's when you get to know each other better. Right. Going out for food with the guys at night time after the show speaking about things. Going to train with them. Yeah. The camaraderies important because then that comes across on camera as well. Right. Yeah. What about the lead up? Like, when did they call you? First of all, how was the trial? Did you send video? Or did you have to like go jump around and live? I, how did it work? Yeah, yeah. So I basically went to an athletic arena in England and London. And I think on the day there was 40 people there. And I think they had, now had that already been whittled down from video or anything. Or was it just like that? Yeah. Yeah. So the first day was an application video. It was like a one minute. This is who I am. This is what I do. I want to be like it. I want to see your video. I was just looking there. I need your video. I'll have it somewhere. Yeah. But sure. Can you send it to us? Yeah. Definitely. I don't see one. Yeah. You shot it. Yeah. Stay tuned at the end guys. Yeah. So that was stage one. Stage. With that was an application form. So this is quite funny as well. I feel like an application form. Personal details history. Oh my god. You're bringing a friend over. It's a lovely dog. Oh my goodness. Hello. Who's this? Beautiful. Beautiful dog. Amazing. How many of us show? Yeah. Yeah. I need a massage. Sorry. I need to move the camera there for that. It doesn't dark. It doesn't dark. It doesn't dark. It doesn't dark. I don't know if he still does it and you wouldn't have seen it on camera. That was a hundred laboradas. Massot. Massuss. Okay. Yeah. So we needed to come back after the podcast and give us on a massage. Yeah. Exactly. Sure. So yeah. I'll keep this short because it could be a long story. But I feel that an application form. Followed by personal details. Everything as well. One of the questions was. Have you got any holidays? Put the shit. So I was like, yes. May whatever. For a week. Croatia with the family. That was the week of filming. Or one of the three weeks of filming. So that's that waiting. There's two months gone by. Three months gone by as I. I've got over to my back now. So some divine intervention. I had an email address of one of the production cast. Email them. James. I've sent his application for me. And like, I think I'm perfect. I think like that. Yeah. Of course. What's happening? Give me some feedback. And because I bought down a gohull, they'd readmarked it. Ben straight. Oh. So I didn't have been. So that got me out of the bin. Oh my god. Thank god. And then the last part was a physical audition. So that you went to a physical audition. I think people have got down to a physical tryouts. I don't know the exact number book. You. They're in the hundreds. And you go on individual days. I went and there's 40 people. He gets split in two groups. There's rope climbing, sled push in. Broad jump, pull ups, burpees, all functional stuff. So I'm like still at this point 295 pounds. But they knew that obviously I'm not going to be able to hold my body because it's a dead hang as well. Some people are dead hang in the two minutes. And getting off because nobody else is there. And they're like bought. Right. There's done. And after 30 seconds, I'm shaking. So I think the way I understand it is. There was a scoring system. And you had to get so many seconds, so many pull ups. So much distance. And you went in a, you got one or two or three points. Based on how good you did. They tell it all those up. And then they got a big board. So it was like the best and the best. Yeah. And then they, they marked you physically against like how good you were on camera because there's a bit of a camera thing. Right. What you look like. And I'm sure they had in the head. What kind of characters they want and people to. For trust. Yeah. Is it, is it in that process and something that you know, you you're going to some real hot tub. Yeah. For sure. What do you think? Like was there, was there a moment where you think you definitely got it? Like, like, do you remember doing something in your, and you looked at them? And you're like, oh, it doesn't matter now. I mean, I don't know. I mean, there was points where I thought I've got to be. But every conversation you have with these guys because they are right. Same if I look at your version. Yeah. Right, following Rawr and the highest, the lowest. Yeah. That's good. you saw an image of giant and they made your banner. Yeah. So look around the arena and see that and hear them shout you know, it's phenomenal. That's cool. So real. Yeah, because I guess episode one they would have had no usable footage for you. No. Nothing. They can't really promote you other than just an image of you standing like that. Yeah. And it that goes to show as well the power of a physique. Oh yeah. To children. That's why super heroes and action man. That's why they all do they all and in society. And that's reaching such a more mainstream group than bodybuilding, right? Yeah. Like I remember like you mentioned Lehanie earlier today. And I remember like Lehanie inspired me. But Lehanie didn't inspire most of the kids like they might do your high. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember when I went to Gold's Venice for the first time in 96. Yeah. And I saw Billy the blonde bomber Smith. Yeah. And he was a gladiator. And I just remember seeing Billy Smith and Jim because he used to train with Jim Quinn. And they were in there just going animal like his old days. And I remember this famous photo shoot of Billy Smith Lake Pressing with Jim Quinn sitting on the Lake Press. Okay. And I remember just thinking like, oh that's a real life gladiator. Yeah. Oh that guy's one of the American live years. He's a reason. He's a machine. And I was already like 20 years old. And I was super impressed. Like something like Smith. Yeah. You know, so imagine a little eight year old or ten year old this, you know. Pretty much. We forget those days. Absolutely. We get old enough that we forget how excited we were to like give me. Yeah. Man. We got a TV. Yeah. Talk about like passing it on. Yeah. Yeah. We got to go back to the kids to gain to fitness. Yeah. You know, just to eat properly. Got the meals in. It's got to be a good thing. What about? So episode one airs. What would day with that event? January said. Yeah. That was a third to you. So it would be Saturday night. Okay. So Saturday night. Episode one airs. And what do you do on episode one? What's your first thing that you see of you? I think the first thing that sort of me was true. It was true. Actually. Not the park trailer. The trailer. But it comes under the start of the show. Like the head of the show. It's a sequence of every single guy there. Bro. And I am the first to appear on the screen. So when everyone sees. Um. Glad it is on the Saturday night. You're the first guy. Yeah. Yeah. So that was quite cool. Absolutely. And then I think the first event was true. So yeah. I think the guy lasted. One point three seconds. To be precise. So then what happens? Like how many people viewed it did they tell you? Like BBC would know they got millions of viewers. Yeah. So I think the expectation or the hope is that we would. Get anywhere around 4 million. Because. Wow. Just to give you some context. The show. I think Peter and average audience of 17 million back in the day. Yeah. But that's when the UK 4 channels. Right. Right. When it went off air. I think it was getting around 9 million. Right. Well now we've got thousands of options. Yeah. Even if it's not TV, we've got YouTube. So the expectation was 4 million. Anything above there. Happy days. First week got 8 million. Oh wow. Nice. That's when there's like, okay. This is a hit. That's awesome. And then it. Yeah. Where you relieved when you heard that. Where you worried at all. Yeah. I don't know whether it's worried. It's just like. You just don't know TV is going to work these days. Yeah. You don't know. You just don't know. It's 10 TV. I don't know. Yeah. But then they say, well, I can't get too excited. Yeah. Because we got a retain the audience. Right. And the retention. I think we hit 8 million again. And I'm not sure that average viewing figures now. Because you've got the live viewings and then the playback. But we're still hitting. And I'm sure around like 6.7 million. So it's like blown the everyone's kind of expertise. Expectations about you. Yep. Thanks, sister. I had you. My brain's like, just like a... I need to spit that out. So okay, you go to the grocery store five days after it airs. Yeah. Great question. Like, what does that start? What happens? What's the first thing that happens? It's not body building. Like, you know what I mean? Yeah. It's not a body building thing. It's like your, the gladiator I just saw. Yeah. And that's when you realize how big it is. Because I've said before. I was widely known as a body builder. I went to my local store and I might get one person say, I'll go to meet a week or a month. We're now a bit like someone saw me walking off the show. And you can see them talking at checkouts. And then this is quite a 41 so it didn't test goes my local super store. Getting my groceries. And I saw this woman. She must be mid four. It's clocked me from the checkouts. She's with us on the sun's 15 years old. So she's coming running over. Can I have a photo? Yeah, yeah. Cool. Do you want you to sit together? No, don't worry about him. That's amazing. He's in the video games. Yeah, he's not mine. He doesn't want you to be. Yeah, I don't care. Just leave it. That's amazing. What's on? Yeah. And I've been asked for a lot of school visits. Kids love you. We come in a parent school. I don't know whether it's for the kids or the teachers. I'm a bit about them. The kids love you. Yeah. So what's, how is it now? Like, is it, is it every time you go out? What if you go for dinner with the misses? Well, this is a funny story as well. So if I go out on my own, or I just put my son, women don't mind coming over. And men as well, you know. Very popular of the males. If it's not from my rainbow community. Right. It's from from dad's I say, no, can I have a silver for my son? We're just cool. But when I go out with the misses, I get bombarded, run a knot with her. When I go out with her, I don't know what it is. I don't know whether they just show a sign of respect. Like, he's with his misses, we'll leave him alone. Right. She probably doesn't want any of this crap. Yeah. Well, she just got this face that says don't come near me. Don't come near me. Yeah. Don't come near my man. Probably a bit of a mess. Probably a bit of a mess. It's like evolution has taught us to respect the misses. I get bothered for less. So I call him a personal security detail. Right. Right. What does she think of it? She watched the show in the yard. She got to go, ah, you look all right. Leave the room. No, no, no. We watch it's a family. And that's the best thing about it. Like, for the past, I would say six, seven years. We've not really sat down as a family. Right. And I remember when I was a kid, you'd sit down on a sat in nights of family and you'd watch. In the UK it was like gladiators blind date, family fortunes. It'd be a list of shows you'd watch together. Top of the pots. And the pot. Yeah. And then the head of the show would be like, you need to look it up. Because top of the pot was great. It's hits. I think they do an annual every year. Right. In the UK. So not everyone by CDs anymore. They do. So yeah, this is the first time in years. That was a family on a sat in night on a sofa. Ready to watch something together. Right. That's amazing. And that's the same obviously for a lot of households in the UK now. So that's really why it's blown up. Right. You're bringing families together, Jimmy. There you go. And what have thought? Now, here's a question for you. Have people mentioned or brought it up transitioning because of what you're doing with the athleticism? Yep. And hey, you should give a, she give Vince a call or whoever's running WW now. I guess Vince is out. But the, the, the, the ever thought of like what's the pro, pro wrestling ever reach out to you or anyone from the pro wrestling community? I mean, we all know at Connors. Yeah. And at Connors spoke to me way back in like 2012. I remember talking to Ad Connors about you like when you first joined Newton. Yeah. Yeah. So that was on the cards way back when. And I just think that is a hard life. Yeah. And that's even harder at 38. Maybe 10 years ago, but not now. Right. What about, uh, I guess you don't have a Hollywood in England. What do you have? Yeah. Whoa. London. Got the BBC. Got the BBC. I'm just wondering now from here like, you know, what, what, what, is anyone said anything to you like, you know what you're pretty good on a microphone? Like you might be able to, I'm going to do something else with this sort of front of the camera stuff. I think that's what it's going, you know, the, the physicality of gladiator is an other thing's like that. I hope I can do that for number five years. Right. But even in five years time there's not going to be another five years after that. Right. I don't in physics. Yeah. So you got to be looking towards the next things and there's whispers of like panto, which is, you know, panto, like pantomime. It's something that they're doing the UK Christmas, like a theatre show. Right. So, don't have to describe it. It's just something that the family would go and watch. You know, like, in, in, when you're at school or high school, you do school plays. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just like that by an adult version. Right. For the family. So that's really a form of acting experience. So I think from now filming the show, I would like to get as much acting experience as possible from that kind of stuff and other things. Like theatre. It's a theatre theatre background. Yeah. And then, you know, along this journey, just make connections, network, meet people. You don't know what doors are going to open. So I just want to be physically and verbally ready. I'm verbally. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've asked like 20 in a row. I know what's going to happen. I've been back so run does this thing where he just, like, gets into the room. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, that's a real. It's like, no, I'm watching a show right now. I feel like, okay, I've done 20 now. I've got like that row seated the yard. And I was like, oh yeah, that was a really good one. It's all just stuffable to gladiators. It just leads to the next question. Yeah. You think that answered to that question. Well, now I have to ask this question. Yeah. And it just leads leads. Like there's, you know, that it must have been just such an intense. It's, I know it took months for it to happen. Yeah. You're in the bin. Yeah. Right. But for it to all just come together, must seem like, you know, I mean, you know, if someone told you, you're in a half ago, if we said you'd be on, you know, you take ladiators to be like, what are you talking about? Yeah. I remember, in 2022, it was the last year competing. Yeah. And I remember the wife saying, in the time of 36 and in my head, I always had that round number 40. Right. You can't compete up to them. And then that, then I think I'd be doing. And I think it's after the second show. So that would have been like the Arnold Classic or the French show, one of the two. She's like, this is going to be the last year competing. And that's like, what are you talking about? And I don't know why. But every time I say that story, I like a twin-giver motion. So it means a lot because I don't know whether something just made that happen for a reason. I don't know. I get that feeling when I say it. The power of suggestion. Yeah. Open your mind. It did. Because then I thought, you know what? And a conversation I would Jay Cookler in the body power. Sorry, not body power. Yeah, I'm at the Arnold's at year. So breakfast, I think the day before the show. So Jay Cookler, I've read first. We had a bit of a conversation. So that was you Wade. That's like 300 pounds. I was seeing the day before the show. It was like right. Because as I think you need to be 30 pounds heavier on stage. It says, where does that leave you? Or where do you finish your hours? Like, dead. Right. Yeah. And I think that was a realisation that, although I was probably inspirational to a lot of talk. But I was inspirational to a lot of tall body builders for being able to have a balanced, big, physique and do pretty well in the pro lineups. I would say a low tear show. I just know I had so much more that I needed to put in at that point. Right. That even if I committed everything I got up until 40, I might get to Olympia. But I'd be placing it at the back. Right. Yeah. And what would those three years take out of me? What would it cost me? Right. So it did open my mind. I started thinking about these things. I was like, you know what? This might be the last year. And then I competed in October. And then they released the announcement that, hey, we're bringing back gladiators. I was like, whoa. Things happen for a reason, right? Right. You told J that story? No, not even there. You sure? J has to hear that story. He would love that. Yeah, he really works. Yeah. You're the second guest in a row that brought J up like that. Really? And Drea said something about J giving her advice and how it changed her career. Oh, cool. Yeah. The way I see it, too, is that this is such a positive thing. Right. We got an option here. Oh, okay. Oh, thank you. He sounds extra good. But I know some people like the project, Jackson. To me, it sounds normal. I love people say I sound like I'm from Australia. I'm from the UK. Yeah, you know I took Kingdom. You have some Aussie friends growing up. Or something is there a little bit of a way to say. I think you may be the people from Nottingham. Sound like I'm from Australia. All right. Okay. Good. What I was going to say though is that I feel like, where you're at now versus where you would have been. Eventually we all have to stop competing. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. And to be able to go out on your terms and be able to kind of parlay that into something else. Yeah. What we're hearing is like a, this is the success story that I think everybody will look once. This, yeah. You know what I'm saying? There's a ton of guys out there that would, in hindsight, probably rather have this. Yeah. This, you know, as a, how did your competing days end? Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's a good message for bodybuilders who are in the, even 20s. Yeah. Think about what's next. Where are you going to go? Yeah. It's massive because, I mean, I know people that were huge when I was coming up, you know, the UKMF, they see MP days where you got open small and, um, successful pros, they all, those people now, they just don't know where they are. You know what they're doing because they didn't think of what, like, life after bodybuilder. Right. It's super important. And I think that's why people end up coming back into bodybuilding, completely because I, I might have done it. If I didn't have a reason to be okay with losing that identity, right, that part of my identity. Yeah. You've always got to create a new identity. And then when you've been doing the same thing for 20 years, that's hot. Yeah. Yeah. Targeted one thing for 20 years. Yeah. It wasn't until we talked the second time that I asked you when you were going to quit. Yeah. Yeah. The show. Yeah. Yeah. I was back. We had a good little audience here. It's even. It's good. Were they here for you, Jamie? I don't know. Pretty sure. I think they call all five of them. They didn't show up until Jamie can. They're going to show it talking walk away, walk away. Yeah. You were just dropped it with the Americans. Just like that. Yeah. It's easily done. I was stereotyped. Dealed by association. Oh, no. I know. What about, um, what about your training? Like, I saw you sprinting on the bike. I see you doing some footwork. Are you doing that stuff right now? What do you do now when you go to the gym? Do you just add some stuff on to the end or is it all different? It's pretty different. I go in the gym. I've got no real plan other than because I'm busy. And I'm here there and everywhere. I find it hard to hold down a routine at the minute, which is a nightmare for any bodybuilder. Right? Right. It's just something that I've come to terms with because I can get two days notice and they want me Manchester or the all-me-in-london. Like, for a just promotional experience. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So what I'm doing now is I'm going to up a lower. And then I'll try and do that twice a week. So I'll train four times. And I'll cook everything. Yeah. And as long as I'm getting my cardio and on top of that to keep the, you know, the cardio fitness in there and do what I enjoy. So I love the bike. Yeah. Right. Although the weather's not obviously very good in UK the minute. Yeah. Right now especially. And my miss is La Sereda because she calls me a people pleaser. And I'm always, I can't say no. So in January, I got a friend who did a run for charity. So every day the month, he did a kilometre for whatever day it was. So I joined him on the 26th. Those 26k. Wait, he says, if you can't on your bike, that's not cool. So I met that stage as well way. I've got clipping pedals. I've got cycling shoes. Yes. Clip into the pedals. So the pedals themselves. They clip. It's not just like a harness on the pedal. No, so yeah, the pedals have got, it's not a harness yet. And the pedals have got like a groove. Yes. Under your shoes, you have an attachment for the groove. Yeah. So I have those two. Yeah. My next question. Have you fallen yet? Well, this is where the story is going. Oh, no. You're going to throw your head. Yeah, so it's not fun. So I've joined my mate on the canal toopath. Do you know what canal is? Yeah. So the canal toopath. And in my head, a canal toopath is like gravel. So I've got these thin road ties. He's slinks. Yeah. Super, super, super, super. I've got in the canal toopath. And it's muddier's hell. Slip it. It's like an ice rink. Right. The worst thing is, I'm causing my mate and like out. Just getting on a canal toopath where all you says. I'm not far ahead. Catch me all. He's running. So I'm, I'm caining it. I'm doing some. But I'm thinking, oh, I'm going to fall off. So I'm being careful at the same time. Right. I'm going to fire me and it's down the canal. Not found. So I'm running again. He's confused me. He says, I don't know how. You must have come past me. So I turn back. Go the other way. And that's the annoying part of the story. Because if I didn't do that, I don't think we ought to fall on off. But I goes back to the way for two minutes. Now this is a right. He's definitely this way. So I pegged it again. And I know if he's saying pegged it. That was a word as well from the UK. So I pegged it down. It's going to be a towpath. And I've just gone sideways. And I've slits. And then I've gone head over heels. Oh, gosh. Smash my head on the side. I don't know how I would end up in the water. That's the only saving grace. But to make this long story short, I've never caught up with him. I've then lost my phone. And I've got a puncture. Oh no. Which meant that it's a run with the bike I'm about to the gym, which was the mile away, where my miss had find my iPhone on her phone. Yeah. So you know what I fear? 500ers. Yes. So then I have to proceed to drive 10 miles in a fear. 500 in my socks. So collect my phone. Oh, god. So yeah, that's fun. My story wasn't nearly as good when I fell. Yeah. I was at a stop side. And I couldn't get my foot out in time. Yeah. It's a four way stop. And there's cars everywhere. And they watch a growing man. Just going like that. It's easy to. Very easy to slow motion. Yeah. I never forget that day. And anybody who doesn't know your she. Your action hooked in goes. Why didn't he put his feet down? Yeah. Yeah. So the worst thing is, when you clip your right foot out, to stand on your right foot, and then you lean to the left. Yeah. That's the worst. Yeah. I nearly done that a few times and I'm to rip in my foot out of pedal. Yeah. Just. Oh man. What do you weigh now? So I'm not. A buzz between 28 and 28 you five. So you're not down at time. You're down at 20 pounds of actual muscle. Yeah. So competitively, I competed 300's. I'm 28. But yeah, in terms of muscle, if I was here two years ago, a 345. Yeah. Then I'm 65 pounds down. But 20 kind of ton more body fat as well. Right. Yeah. You're blowing up our season. Yeah. So I've just shot with a few people this weekend. I still don't feel like. Right. So you're hip sort of so late in your lower back. It's so late in. And it's a warm up before. You know, there's a time when you was a kid where you could just spring up and start sprinting. That's definitely not the case. So yeah, I still don't feel like. I think another 20 pounds. I would feel a ton more agile. Right. But I go below 280. And my miss is it's like a beacon goes off. He's like, what are you where you look skinny? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Too easy. He's like, well, don't drop any lower. Okay. I'm thinking about your TV deal. Yeah. You've got to be a giant, right? So you've got to be at any lower than two weeks. That's it. Do they ever talk to you about your body weight? Like, do they even ask you what it is? No. Well, we have stats. So when it's at on TV, we all have stats. So they come up like a boxing match. But they did just weigh your wants. And that's a stat that you use. Yeah. Yeah. So that's on there. The weirdest thing for me is obviously as bodybuilders. We weight, we measure everything in inches. Right. And the stats are in centimeters. So my bias I've been measured in centimeters. My quad's measured in centimeters. And I've never known that bit of thing. But I don't know that's because I've been in bodybuilding so long. It's all up. No. Right. That's strange for me. Yeah. That's what it is. So what do you like 54 centimeters? I don't even know. Yeah. I can't even remember. I think it's about 52. It's 20 and a half, 21 inch by step. So I think it's like 52 54. Right. Yeah. And I think the quad's when I was bodybuilding. Like it's all in. Maybe a quad's like 32 inch. And I'm sure they're like 29. So they're downsides. Well, they're still decent sized. It still look really good. I saw the shots of you in your outfit. Yeah. And they're still like real big. Well, legs are huge. Yeah. The next and those guys. Right. Yeah. So that's a message to like any, you know, bodybuilding's out there. When you stop, if you still keep on top of your nutrition, you train in and all the things that we've learned along the way, you will retain a lot of that muscle. Oh yeah. It's hard to lose weight. If you have to make it come down. Yeah. Yeah. So when they put your stats up, I got to ask. Is it real stats? Or is this? Okay. So this isn't like made for TV stats where they're like, these 345. Yeah. No, it's really. Start running cards on. No. Yeah. The old wrestling thing. The ultimate warrior from parks on the right. Right. But the funny story to that is, so the UK tried to bring back gladiators about 10 years ago on a different channel on a on-sky one. Um, Sean Clarita. And that's true. You're up tomorrow, buddy. You're on tomorrow itself. You're definitely up tomorrow. Yeah. That's true for whatever reason. It didn't take off. And I think that's because it was on a Thursday night, a weird time on on a sky program then you know, didn't get the ratings. But fully enough. So I would have been mid-twenties. Mid-twenties. Mid-twenties. I applied to go on that show. No. I know how old it was because it's before I probably started competing. So that's like 23 24. And at the time, I was 15 stone. So in pounds, what's that? 210. Good. Wow. That's just quick. Wait, so only because it's around number of like 15. So, weighs it 140 pounds per cent. There you go. Um. I remember lying saying I was 16 stone. So I would have said I was like, 2, 2, 24, 2, 24. Yeah. And I think back in thought, God, I lied to say I was 16 stone. And I ended up being 340 bucks. Dude, do they know that you tried to get on already like 10 years ago in this guy one? Yeah, we discussed it. Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, that's crazy. You know, that's why as well. I think your body building at the minute, we're in an age where people want things yesterday. Yeah. Things take time. They're going to trust the time. Yeah, trust the time. Just the journey. Like everything will happen in the end. Yeah. Yeah. That's a big, big message. Yeah, for sure. What are some of the other things like when we had Dre on earlier and we talked about, you know, the ability to handle delayed gratification as a body builder. You have to put work in in order to get results. It might be a long ways away. Yeah. What are some of the lessons that you've learned in the past year with this whole experience with the show and stuff and interacting with the other athletes and the regular joes and just the whole thing and how the British television system works and just, I don't know, what lessons have you taken away whether it be business or family or anything like that? I think one of the biggest messages is how influential we can all be. Actually did something this morning that kind of makes that point. And then we're going to have a ton of messages from kids, from parents and it's too many. If I was to, do they have an email or somewhere where they, that people can just reach the giant or are they finding you and reaching out? Yeah. I think it's, at the minute we're all navigating this thing. Yeah. It's extremely busy. So they will, they will our places contact to try and get in contact with a giant. Ultimately they'll contact Jamie to try and contact the character. Right. So I got tons of messages daily and I can't reply to them all. Why I saw I think, you know what, if I can reply to a couple of days, and that might make their day. Absolutely. And I've been to the ability to do that is something that we shouldn't ever frown upon or turn away. I love that. Yeah. So that's what it's been, and then that goes for us as body builders and we've all got influence. And sometimes in the past, I've looked at those messages. Not, not now, not current in bodybuilding days when you've got some kid asking for advice. And it'll be in the message request, I'm like, no, but I know we can't reply to everyone, but I'm going to make a conscious effort to try and do some. Right. I like that. Skip it, but it recently, he said, he said, there's going to come a day that nobody's going to care about me at all. Yeah. He is like, so I'm definitely going to get back to the people I can. You know, absolutely. Yeah. And I know what you mean about that request folder. You know, you go through your primary. You mean, you got, like, there's days I open. I got 22 primary. Yeah. And then I go to that general. Yeah. And you got 15 more. Yeah. And then you go, well, what's the request like? And you're like, oh, geez, I just. I can't even see that. I can't even. Yeah. I can't even. I just can't do that right now. Yeah. And I'm trying to eat my breakfast. Yeah. And so I know what that means, but yeah, they times that by 10, but general television audience reaching out to you. Yeah. Menso. Yeah. The good thing is about the quests. It's like, read risks on WhatsApp. If you got them turned off, you can't say if they're ready on them. However, there's a question for you. So read, receive some WhatsApp on or off. Off. Yeah. Yeah. I leave everything on. Yeah. I don't know. I saw it and didn't answer. Yeah. I just like it. What I do all the time is I'll be like, oh, did the send of, like, oh, just take a quick peek. Oh, he's looking really good, but I don't, I'll get back to him in a couple hours. Yep. I'm just like, you know, you're working on red, but I don't want him to think like, Ron didn't you back to me, you know, yeah. So I just market on red and I go back after him done my meal or whatever and like give a good answer. Because, you know, there's those little short answers. You can fire off and then there's one where like, oh, this requires me to think and use both hands. Yeah. And so I'm like, I don't want that guy to see that I read it and then maybe feel bad for like five hours. Yeah. Yeah. I do the exact same thing. Yeah. I just, whereas, like, I understand Dusty's personality is the, the, it's the insult is part of the Dusty experience. So if you're going to, it's part of knowing Dusty is that is that hurt feeling you have to go through. Yeah. It's like a gateway to really get to know him. No. There you go. If you get that phone with your friends. Yeah. Who can you have on it? Yeah. I'm a stranger and you ignored me. Dusty, do you have, uh, I think you had a closing question. You had, you had, you had, you had, you had, you had. Yeah. That's, that's, that's, that's, I'm getting a got some rapid fires for you. Yes. That's good. We're going to rapid fire real quick here. And remember, no deep thinking. Keep it in the shallow into the pool. Okay. Need like a three second minimum. Right. All right. There you go. What is an item that you think is worth spending extra money on. So it could be fancy shoes. Good, to the paper. Good. Yeah. What, what, what, what, what, the one thing you're like more money is fine. Comfortable pants. But I'm not, not pants like underwear. Oh, all right. All right. I get those like kind of, itch the crotch or, yeah. Use the separator one with the package. Never mind. Come. I love like the sack. So yeah. Oh, I love that. This is what I mean. All right. What's the one thing that you regret spending money on that you've spent before? Oh. Okay. I got a good one here. So I am, when we moved into our first house, we got some China. Some China plates. No. So nice China. We got some nice China. We got some nice China. We got some nice China. These plates are like very grown up. Yeah. For four plates. It was 400 pounds. Oh, God. And then that's about a bowl as well. And they were like another 400 pounds. And it is a little fork and the big fork that match the China. And you never used those. No, no, no. Well, we do. And the worst thing is, I haven't been in the dishwasher and they faded a bit as well. Oh, God. And the even worst thing is I bought a set from like next, which is a home store in the UK. I bought a set. Why in gold? And these nice ones are white and gold. This set was like 40 quits. And they're just as nice. There you go. Never fails. Never fails. All right. Finish this phrase. The way to my heart is. Food. That is not the way you're going to say. That is not the way to say. That is not the way to say. We know the second fastest way. Jamie's heart is food. Thank you. Jamie. There you go. All right. Couple more. Would you rather travel to the past or the future? The future. All right. What are we doing while we're there? You have 10 minutes. 10 minutes. Oh, my God. We're going to get out of the bank balance. We're going to see where we live. Check the wife's rack. Make sure it's still heading north. If we need an upgrade. I'll farm the future. Speaking of that, what was your last impulse? I'm a post-bomb. I'm a post-bomb. I'm a post-bomb. I'm a post-bomb. I'm a post-bomb. I'm a post-bomb. I'm a post-bomb. I'm a post-bomb. I'm a post-bomb. I'm a post-bomb. It was a chair. A chair that told me that it was going to be great for my bank. Yes. And it was a backlash chair that you kind of like nearly to luck or a sea salt. And it was terrible. That sounds terrible. It was like you fell for it in life. Yes, that sounds terrible. That was your own sale. Wasn't it? It was a terrible idea. That was a broken chair today. It was just cool. That was a solid stool. The price of good advertising. Last but not least. What holiday activity do you think is overrated? So in the UK we are boxing today. Yes. Yesterday the day after Christmas day. And on boxing day you normally... We got that too. Go around the family's house and have dinner around the family's house. It's the family that you don't like enough to do Christmas with. But you're out of the gate and you go see it. Yeah. So you go. That's exactly what it was. I wasn't going to drive to your house yesterday. But today I had to come. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to work excuses. Oh, that's amazing. I can't close out better than that. But Trina's impulse by boobs and not like in his experience. Yeah. I can't feel that he lied. He lied on some of his answers. He never took to the right path. He goes, oh. But we know what they thought. I saw BBC wrink about the screen to go. Food. Yeah. Think about your audience. I don't know Jamie. What have read that differently? It's corporate overlords or watching you. I'm going to turn the dial. There we go. There we go. Okay. That's good. That's awesome. It's good to have you on again man. Nice question. It's great to be on a podcast again. I've got no more for a long time. You know what else about you Jamie? I think we all feel the same. You're one of the guys where like, Once last time we actually spoke. Yes. Like some of the messages he did over here. Yeah. But it just feels like I just saw you at the last expo. You know what I mean? And you know, it's your recent extraordinary famous. I changed you sir. No. And I do feel as though I've been changed. And I don't foresee me changing. And when people say, oh, don't let it change. I just think there's a type of person that it changes. Oh yeah. I don't think I'm not talking to person. Wow. So I have one more question. Yeah. We forgot the real question. Oh, exactly. Do they send you a weekly check? Or do you have paid once for the season? Oh, I don't know if I can answer. Oh, okay. It's split. Split into pups. Yeah. Okay. Split into pups. So you get paid to do the show. And then there's residuals or something like that. I don't know. I don't know the right words. So we got a fee for doing the show. Yeah. And then it might be fees for promo work. Or extra appearance. Yeah. Okay. I think that's all. And then so it's season two and option for them on the contract. Well, how does that work? Yeah. So we're contract to the minute the green light was for one season. But we all like rent down for other seasons. Right. Given the BBC's authorization. So we just all on that and keep that rolling. Yeah. We're in that situation again. We're looking good. What is not 100% love this game with you. Yeah, they love that life. No, they do that life. Okay. That's awesome. Well, we always use the most success. Yeah. It's we get excited when we see like one of us. Well, any of us, you know, doing well past competing. Because like you said, competing takes a lot out of people, takes a lot out of your life. And if you do it the right way, he can lead you in an incredible direction where you can do some really cool things. Yeah, it can.
