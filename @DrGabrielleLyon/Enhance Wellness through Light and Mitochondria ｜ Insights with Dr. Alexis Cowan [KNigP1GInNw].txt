Welcome to the Dr. Gabriel Lancho. In this episode, I sit down with Dr. Alexis Count. She's a PhD from Princeton. She did a postdoc at University of Pennsylvania. She's an expert in metabolism. On this podcast, we talk about things related to health and wellness and movement, but do we talk about how our environment impacts our metabolism, our environment impacting our overall health and wellness? Well, today we do. You're going to learn everything about light and the impact of light on your overall wellbeing. And as always, if you like this episode, please take a moment to share, subscribe.

We're going to be talking about new things today, though, so I think it'll be exciting. Yes, no one could ever get sick of you. And I just want to give people a little bit of background as to our friendship. So you and I met through Dr. Tracy Anthony and Dr. Josh Anthony, both of whom are incredible scientists and trained under Dr. Donald Lamin as well. And you and I met while you were still finishing your P.C. President. Yeah. And then went on to do a postdoc at Penn. Yep. You and I collaborate on many projects. I'm so grateful. And today you are bringing us light, mitochondria, and something you can't bioharminizing. I did. Yes. I mean, the term biohacking is common, but I prefer the term bioharminizing because we're not trying to hack our biology. We're trying to find out how our biology is working and work with that instead of trying to cut corners. Let's say. I love that. Yeah. And you and I, again, you and I are friends. We talk all the time. I ask you, what is new? What are you really interested? And you said light and light biology. That's right. Why? And by the way, you have been, I guess, who is staying in our house. I find you in the morning outside, sitting on grass, seemingly very productive. This is my favorite time of day. The best way to start your day. Why light? Great question. So I went down the rabbit hole in light about 14 months ago. After hearing a podcast with recruitment and Jack Cruz, who's like a quantum biologist, light biologist, also a neurosurgeon and Andrew Haberman was also in that conversation. It was on Rick's podcast last year. And as Jack was explaining this story and kind of unfolding it, I was just having, I mean, ironically, lightbulbs are going off in my head. Like, I can't believe I missed this. Like, this is crucial because prior to that, I was really thinking a lot about the gut and the microbiome. And I was like, this is the most important thing. This is what I need to focus on. And then right when I started hearing this story unfold, I was like, basically back to the drawing board, because I realized that this was actually the most foundational piece that almost everybody is missing and nobody's talking about, that if we can get it right, it's going to improve our health in literally every arena of health and every organ system and our cognition and our mood and our relationship quality and our ability to critically think. It's so fundamental that I'm just like, all about it now and I just can't stop talking about it. And it's interesting to hear you say that you had a lightbulb moment because you're a very well trained PhD, which is why. At number one, why I have you on the show, but also I really appreciate the way in which your brain works as a friend and as a human. Do you remember the moment? Do you remember the moment where, and again, you had been focusing a lot on gut, gut muscle access, you and I talk about that frequently, but why the light, there had to have been something. I can appreciate the conversation, but again, you are trained at Princeton and Postdoc at Penn, there must have been something. Yeah, well, I mean, circadian biology was on my radar when I was in grad school and in my postdoc, but I didn't really occur to me. I thought, you know, it's important, but I didn't realize how important it was and how that interfaces, those processes interface with light, until after hearing this podcast and then doing my own deep dyes into the research and understanding the science behind this. And so, I mean, the biggest moment for me was probably just reflecting on the differences between the ancestral environment and the modern environment. So a lot of people will think, you know, it's the food, reading a lot of process foods, or maybe, you know, it's living outside of an actual environment, maybe, you know, we're living indoors, that's kind of a new thing for our species. But, you know, light isn't something that people think a lot about just because, at least for all generations alive now, we all grew up with just having artificial light in our lives and also being propagandized with information about the sun being toxic and bad. And so it's something that kind of just gets ingrained from a very young age and doesn't really elicit a second thought. But I started thinking twice about it. I started thinking twice about it and going into the research and understanding just how nuanced and how specific different wavelengths of light have these differential effects on our biology and what they're doing to regulate or might a conjure function and regulate our neurochemistry and our hormonal milieu. And once I started going into that research, I, it became very apparent to me that this is a crucial piece that almost everybody is getting wrong because we just don't even have, this is even on our radar as like a culture. Do you think that it's that we're getting it wrong or is it that? So I think about my dad, my dad lives in Ecuador, he spends most of the time outside. You've met my dad, he is pretty unusual and unique in his behavior of patterns. Spend a lot of time outside, walks if it is going to take three hours or let's help walk it. But I wonder from what you're saying is it, is it that being outside would not necessarily be optimization, but would be almost standard operating procedure for the body versus being deficient. So for example, does my dad have better health because he's outside? Maybe do people that are outside working the field or if this is part of their life, do they have better health because they're moving there doing those things or on the flip side, is it the deficiency of light that's the problem? So this is why I really like thinking about light as the specific wavelengths of light as like essential nutrients because we think about it in that way we can very clearly see that depending on how we're living our lives we may be very deficient in certain wavelengths of light and we may have an excess of other other kinds of light and the three wavelengths of light that I really like to focus on in this conversation as it relates to regulating our biology, our red and end thread light, which is a very long wavelength light, blue light which is a shorter wavelength light and UV light which is perhaps the most important of the three and yet also the most demonized and so those are kind of the three pillars of light that I like to think about because if we're seeing an indoor artificial light environment we're virtually getting zero red and in thread light because all energy efficient modern light sources including our device screens fluorescent LED bulbs they're highly enriched in blue light and completely devoid of red and in thread light and that's because like their energy efficient quote unquote infrared light is just another word for heat and so if a bulb gives off heat gives off heat it's thought to be like a waste of energy meanwhile there's a disconnect between not understanding that that heat that infrared light is actually and really important let's say nutrient for ourselves and so by eliminating it from artificial light sources we're actually doing our biology a disservice even though it's you know more energy efficient when it comes to like the electrical bills let's say so there's a major disconnect there with regards to tech development and like pushing technology forward and at the same time not building tech that actually respects the way that human biology functions and where would someone say there's red a blue and UV light where would someone in nature get red and infrared light naturally with that be from the sun yep great question so I mean if you think about it in the ancestral environment we weren't really living indoors we were primarily living an outdoor lifestyle and we would have encountered sun throughout different times of the day so if you're outside around sunrise you're encountering primarily red and infrared light um that's why it looks like a redish hue on the horizon it's because sunlight the horizon has to pass through more atmosphere and that means the shorter wavelengths of light are basically being scattered because they're not able to penetrate through the atmosphere so the red and infrared light gets through along with you know maybe some yellow or in should et cetera so then as the sun rises up towards the center of the sky we're getting more penetrance of the short wavelength light which includes the blue UVA and UVB which maxes out around solar noon and then as the sun settles towards the west we're starting to again reenrich that red and infrared light and kind of depleted out the blue and UV light and but importantly though midday sunlight is still over 50% red and infrared light and that's actually the reason why sun fills warm on your skin it's the infrared light that's literally vibrating your tissues to generate heat so the sun itself is actually you know if it doesn't interact with matter it's not gonna fill warm it's the interaction between sunlight the infrared light and matter that actually generates heat through by vibration that's really interesting how long so it their sunrise sunset does the length of time do you think that there's a natural cadence with our biology the length of time that it takes for sun to rise meaning again I don't know this answer that it is sunrise red infrared and then eventually that light source changes from what I'm hearing you say the time it takes from rise what that might be what 10 minutes so it's actually a really interesting question and also it's highly dependent on the latitude at which you're living so if you live really close to the equator there's a very short window of time of about 15 minutes let's say like as you come towards the summer months it's pretty like a stable there throughout the year but um a 15 minute window where you're gonna get primarily red and infrared light in the sunrise time but then very quickly the UVA light starts penetrating and so if you download this app called the circadian app you can look at the UVA and UVB rise for your latitude and so it will tell you so this time of your new jersey where I'm living and I'm just visiting here in Houston 24 north latitude I'm coming from a 40 north latitude how does she know that what's it called the circadian app we guys try that okay now we guys try that the circadian app we're on it okay so in New Jersey if I look at my app you know sunrise is around 630 let's say by seven o'clock UVA is already starting to enter into the wavelength wavelengths of light that are present there UVB doesn't come up until roughly 45 minutes to an hour later because UVA is slightly longer wavelength than UVB so it's able to penetrate more efficiently earlier in the day and it's actually really interesting because we have specific photo receptors on our surfaces on our eyes, our skin and actually deeper in our body too which we can get into what about muscle so actually that's a good question I'm not sure if these receptors are present on muscle we'll have to look into it but there's three receptors maybe four that we could get into one's called melatonin it's a blue light detector it's present on the skin it's present on the cornea and it's also present in the retina and it's job is essentially to relay information about the blue light in your environment to the master clock in your brain the superchized medic nucleus for the SCN which is the master circadian clock and so blue light is the primary input that's regulating our bodies interpretation of what time of day it is so you know if you think about this in the context of the modern environment it can become a bunitly clear why being under artificial lights on an appropriate times of day is detrimental because we're putting in the signal that it's the middle of the day roughly because blue light is highest around solar noon even if it's you know the evening time and we're just working you know out of sync with natural light rhythms because we're you know productive modern humans one would argue though that maybe that would make us more productive well so it does increase alertness on a weakness but the problem with that is that when your body is out of sync with natures rhythms now you know it's kind of you know I think that is this regulated maybe yeah it's highly just regulated and I think you know our bodies as it relates to nature as like a part of nature we're not separate from it although our frontal lobes make us think that we are that we're somehow above it when we extract ourselves from nature I think we see the consequences of that in the modern day with just the incredible rise in chronic disease and we can also see and as we'll explore with the different wavelengths of light and Heather interacting with our biology to let's say save off some of these diseases including diabetes, obesity including high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease including depression and mental health problems and multiple types of cancers as well all through just optimizing the light environment and so we can impact some mechanisms of that but just to circle back to the photos that really quick so we talked about melanopsin we also have neuropson so neuropson is a UVA light detector that's present on the skin and the eyes the cornea and so in that morning light you know your outside you're getting your red and in front light that red and in front light is actually penetrating into your body it can penetrate multiple centimeters into the body and it directly stimulates mitochondrial function it interacts with cytochrome coxidase which is complex four of the electron transport chain directly stimulating ATP production and improving mitochondrial function so the way that I kind of think about this is that we don't need receptors for long wavelength light because it's able to just penetrate in but with the short wavelength light the UV in the blue it's not able to penetrate very deeply and so we need receptors on our surface in order to actually relay that information to you know deeper parts of our systems and that's UVA light that's able to penetrate directly no you so red and infrared compendentry directly UVA is interacting with their opson which is a light detector on our surfaces so we have the melanopsin we have neuropson we also have one called encephal opson which is another blue light sensor it's also called penopsin so we have a couple you know different ways for our bodies to sense short wavelength light environment which you know as Jack Kruse says like doesn't nature make mistakes if we have receptors for these wavelengths of light clearly they're really important for regulating some aspect of our bodies and it's our job to figure out what it's doing and there is an abundance of research that actually is unpacking this and I'm I'm guessing that you would say spend as much time as you can outside so yeah maybe not I would say as much time as you can that doesn't mean you have to be in direct on the whole time so depending on your skin type you know some people have more or less melanin is kind of dictating where your ancestors came from right so for me like I'm mixed my dad's side is black my mom's side is Scandinavian so my mitochondrial genes my maternal genes are from Scandinavia so I'm used to getting essentially you know mitochondrally speaking cold in the winter and then better quality sun in the summer versus somebody who has maternal mitochondrial genes from more equatorial regions will be more accustomed to getting high quality sun year round and that's why they also is associated with more darker skin because you have to be able to assimilate that light so that it's not actually damaging your skin and so that's really the purpose of melanin is to help absorb that especially short wavelength light so that it's not creating DNA damage and other things but even pale skin fits Patrick type 1 skin individuals can make melanin it is a human birthright but there's a lot of things that we're doing as a species in the modern day that's going to block melanin production which is problematic if we're trying to you know prevent sunburn and skin cancers as an example actually you mentioned something earlier about outdoor workers and like you know whether they're more healthy there's actually really cool research showing that if you're an outdoor worker you're less prone to developing melanoma than indoor workers and I think we should at some point talk about melanoma because I think there's a lot of propaganda around it yeah and is it I definitely want to come back to that because I'm curious is are they just more diligent? Are they seeing more covered up? Could that be the reason that they're more resistant as opposed to just overall exposure? Yeah so I mean one really important aspect for melanoma that we need to address head on is that low vitamin D status is highly associated with melanoma. Now vitamin D we didn't supplement with vitamin D in our ancestry you know and then tick-wiety we we're getting primarily our vitamin D from UVB light exposure specifically UVB light when it interacts with 70 out dehydro cholesterol in the skin produces pre-vitamin D3 that gets processed in the liver and the kidneys to the final active form the the 125 hydroxy vitamin D. Obviously you know today we have access to vitamin D supplements but the research actually suggests the vitamin D supplementation has next to no benefit for health other than preventing or reversing records so at the very very low deficient status of vitamin D you can improve and like protect against records or reverse records but outside of that you're not getting any improvements on cancer incidents for example or diabetes which are linked with vitamin D status so but we would say that there is so there are vitamin D receptors on skeletal muscle and we would say that those with low vitamin D status are at fall risk it seems that those individuals suffer more from falls so potentially vitamin D supplementation if you are very low that definitely would impact that so this is this is a really important point and I want to really now frame vitamin D as a biomarker for your time spent outside and so if you're thinking about vitamin D is like it's low I just need to supplement it's gonna solve my problems I don't think that's true I think especially once we unpack all the other benefits of UVB light it's gonna become increasingly apparent that supplementing with vitamin D is gonna be a very very myopic way to approach the problem and I think that a lot of the interactions and associations we see with low vitamin D status are really a reflection of not being an outdoor environment not encountering UVB light regularly routinely because think about it people are going outside they're putting on sunscreen they think that's what they're supposed to do to protect themselves they think you know that they're going to get melanoma if they don't put sunscreen on but it's actually really there's really striking evidence to show that yes sun exposure might increase your risk of squamous seller basal cell carcinomas that is a link that's shown but the mortality rate of these cancers is extremely low meanwhile there's evidence on the same token that vitamin D and and sun exposure actually can decrease your risk of a whole host of other cancers that have a much higher mortality including colorectal prostate and breast cancers there's actually some quotes I'd like to read at some point yeah I would love because I'm curious you know when we're talking about cancer our dear friend Dr Joe's on dial you guys should definitely give him a follow he will always question me and say okay well if you think that what's what's the mechanism so what would be the mechanism behind vitamin D and sun exposure helping with colorectal cancer great question what do you got some uh you got some quotes for us I'll talk okay yeah I'll just read the quotes really quick so here's a quote from uh study there's like p.m.id we can link in the show notes of people interested so it says studies in the past decade indicate that insufficient sun exposure may be responsible for 340,000 deaths in the US and 480,000 deaths in Europe per year and an increased incidence of breast cancer colorectal cancer hypertension cardiovascular disease metabolic syndrome multiple sclerosis Alzheimer's disease autism asthma type 1 diabetes and myopia I actually thought all those things were due for uh to read me oh I know right that's what you would be glad to think in this in this culture right uh we also have another quote here frequent regular sun exposure acts to cause cancers that I have a 0.3% death rate with 2000 US fatalities per year this is the SEC and the BCC skin cancers I mentioned and acts to prevent cancers that have death rates from 20 to 65% with 138,000 US fatalities per year that's the breast colon and blood cancers primarily and my understanding is the reason that you're pointing this out is because we've been told a lot to say out of the sun we do spend a ton of time indoors I'm curious as to what the numbers are and potentially that is doing us a tremendous amount of harm and so then we are told to go outside put sunscreen and I can appreciate what you're saying from that perspective that we are not getting enough sunlight but it's more complicated than that isn't it? Well so I would really as as a really some mechanisms of like cancer and sun exposure I'd like to unpack another part of the story maybe briefly to wrap up the vitamin D side of the story when UVB light hits your skin it's not only that pre-vitamin D that's made there's also over a dozen other vitamin D like molecules that are made in response to UVB light so if you're supplementing with vitamin D you're not you're missing out you're getting a very narrow spectrum result but if someone couldn't get outside let's say they're institutionalized or in the hospital they have eliminated exposure to sunlight what could someone do with after-changer light bulbs what would be an opportunity for change so I mean I think this is one reason why this story has not really been popularized because there's a lot of implications as to actually how we're living our lives how people are being led to think in a certain type of way and actually an inability to critically think due to a lack of sunlight which we will talk about very soon but you know if you can't get access to sunlight there are light devices that you can use indoors so for example red and infrared light devices they can that can re-engineer that red and infrared that long wave length light back into your indoor life which is largely not present due to modern light sources there's also UVB lights available so spurty is a brand that makes UVB panels they also make UVA panels and we use that actually for skin for eczema, psoriasis it's use for eczema and then the red light we use bond charge I'll put a link there for you guys yep yep so red panels can be great if you're not accessing outdoor light and you want to re-engineer some of that light back into your indoor life style you can absolutely do that the UVB panels are great I would just recommend that people try to time the use of them at the right time like to make it so that it's kind of concordant with when you would have those exposures outside so if you're going to be having UVB and UVA light that should probably more around like solar noon time like middle of the day because those receptors special like the neurops and it's going to be telling your body like this is the signal coming in that means it's midday. Thank you to Ned for sponsoring this episode of the show let's talk about mellow magnesium mellow magnesium is a three four magnesium with 70 different trace elements in it and by the way it comes in four amazing flavors like lavender berry and pomegranate make it if you want it plain but let me tell you about this mellow magnesium is a three four magnesium with elthianine gabba whole bunch of other things in it in a tiny little pack that you can take with you and why do you need this 75% of Americans are deficient in magnesium magnesium is a critical mineral for bodily function and that means three out of four of you are actually deficient in it here's when I take my mellow magnesium I take it later on in the day like around four or five and oftentimes I will take it before bed it is an amazing product if you google it you will see over 5,000 five star reviews that's not schlovey that is an amazing product go to hello Ned that's he ll o and ed dot com use the code doctor lion for

so I've teamed up with timeline nutrition to bring you one of my ultimate favorite products and that's my dopiero might appear is a science backed url if an a you're a liven a sounds like a species of something or other what it is it's a post biotic and 30 to 40% of you humans cannot make it why is it important it's important because it's one of the first gut muscle access connection might appear helps the muscle and all mitochondria when you take it you can take it in pill form you can take it in powder form I recommend trying the starter kit they have ginger and berry I put some in my yogurt it's amazing here's what it does for you it will improve your potentially your energy your strength your endurance again might appear helps with mitochondria and the name might appear it helps with the regeneration and cleaning out old mitochondria and if you remember anything about I don't know fifth grade science mitochondria they are the powerhouse of the cell so you have to have good mitochondria to have good energy and one of the hallmarks of aging is a decline in this mitochondria so if it sounds like you need more energy more strength more endurance and something that tastes great might appear as a way to go go to timelinenutrition.com slash doctor lion that's timelinenutrition dot com slash doctor lion and you'll get 10% off your first order I recommend either the starter pack or the pills try it I know that you're gonna feel great back to the episode you'd mentioned that there are skin receptors does someone need to sit in front of the light naked do they have to not wear glasses what what what should they be doing and for how long okay so really important by the way doctor lexas said our house we walked down where why are you making front of the right pedal now that did not actually happen but it was close I know right I mean hey I was trying to wear crop top outside of mosa crop tops shorts are for how long and in what kind of capacity yes so there's another really important part of the story that we didn't mention that's also related to UVB light and that is a molecule there's a pro hormone called pro opium alana cortin or pomsy so pomsy is produced in the skin and in the brain in response to UVB light and pomsy is cleaved into 10 distinct hormonal products three of those are alphabeda and gamma msh or melanocyte stimulating hormone so if you're not getting alphabeda and gamma msh stimulated in your skin and in your brain you're not going to effectively tan in response to UVB light you're going to burn so this becomes you know becomes very clear let if you're wearing contacts sunglasses or prescription glasses outside and you're blocking the ability of UVB light to get into your eyes that doesn't mean stare at the sun it just means getting ambient light into your eyes you're not going to effectively stimulate your melanocyte to make melanin which is tanning same with your skin if you're blocking that UVB light with sunscreen you're not going to be able to generate that melanin and melanin is really interesting actually because melanin is to mammals as chlorophyll is to plants which something a lot of people don't know but chlorophyll light comes in interacts with chlorophyll chlorophyll can split water molecules into molecular hydrogen molecular oxygen and two free electrons melan actually does the same thing and the papers that show this are quite old this has been known for quite some time and so when we're developing melanin our skin and interacting with sunlight we're actually able to cultivate more free energy so it's a way of actually eating by just being outside it's a way of cultivating and releasing liberating electrons into our system same with ground it where what do you mean eating do you mean we're just leveraging ATP utilization ATP utilization is happening because we're not actually eating food per se well I'm glad you're asked because I think it's really important to think about a light diet and a food diet as being you guys heard it here first this is very fringe ask map my producer is laughing but you have to understand before ideas come into the mainstream they typically come from very intelligent people that are thinking about things that are very well steeped in the literature so this is what my listeners are experiencing from you so it's amazing it will make perfect sense in just about one minute as I know 10 years you guys will get this in 10 years is along with myself when you eat food you're not you're might a country it don't see carbohydrates fats and proteins mine do they see electrons no no my my definitely like this was steak I know right it's ground beef steak salmon good stuff but so when you're extracting you're when you're breaking down a simulating nutrients the whole purpose of eating is to extract electrons from macronutrients so that those electrons can enter into the electron transport chain and support ATP production in mitochondria so anywhere that you get electrons is food technically so you can get free electrons from eating so by extracting those electrons from food that's powering your mitochondria ATP production you can also get free electrons from grounding so getting your bare feet on the earth gives you free electrons from the earth there's plenty of research to show this also to show that grounding you know reduces inflammatory response and inflammation within the body which is related to mitochondrial function we also get free electrons from having sun interacting with melons so they're all different ways of getting access to electrons you're mitochondria to access with electrons they're all equally important and they're all equally accessed within the ancestral environment too we would always encounter all of those things we weren't wearing rubber sole shoes outside we're in contact with the earth we were getting sun on our skin if we weren't getting high quality sun on our skin we were getting cold because that's just how nature works if you don't have high quality sun you're around you're gonna get cold in the winter that's interesting pause there I I'd love to hear more about that basically what you're saying is there's an interface if it is warm you're gonna have less close on that I think that is speaking you're gonna be outside that makes a lot of sense but if it's not we would if it was cold we would obviously be covered and I mean that's just I've never thought about that I might have you thought about that if you are so it's almost like that that's shown naked in afraid but different the more the less exposure on your skin to sun the colder you should be is that is that what you're saying yeah because cold actually has a lot of reciprocal effects on the body that sun does so if you're I mean think about it in ancestral environment if you live in a northern latitude you're encountering high quality sun for part of the air in the other part of the year it's winter time you're getting poor quality sun there's not much UV light the earth tilted away from the sun and you're getting cold because you know it's winter time so that cold is very very potent medicine for a mitochondria upregulates mitochondrial biogenesis that increases mitochondrial ATP production mitochondrial density mitochondrial function in general also increases mitochondrial light production so we know you know we make infrared light we make heat in our bodies if you look at you know somebody on an infrared camera you can see them because they're literally making light in their mitochondria um there's actually also some evidence that mitochondria can make their own UV light as well it stems back to the 1920s you that must have blown your mind and you probably couldn't sleep that night yeah absolutely and I mean it's really important too because UV and infrared light they're outside the visual spectrum so we can't see it with our eyes I think that's probably by design I think nature probably didn't want us to see it because then we would muck around and like mess it up it's probably quantized to our system meaning that like we need infrared and UV light in order to actually function internally and we can either get it from outside in or we can make it internally so it has to come from one direction the other and we see you know basically all chronic disease are rooted in dysfunction of mitochondria and I think that's honestly rooted at a failure to produce light that's actually regulating so many of the biological functions in our tissues in ourselves and you would say that if they weren't able to get light they may they have to spend a lot of time being cold yeah exactly this this does really bring up major challenges for living in an environment that is going to support what I'm hearing you say mitochondria and I'm sure that there are other lifestyle factors that one could layer on like exercise yeah a robotic exercise resisted training why did you care about the mitochondria it's kind of the connection between light and mitochondria yeah I mean mitochondria is something I've thought a lot about for a long time you know my PhD was in Rebina What's Lab at Princeton very metabolicly centered lab and I'm sorry you guys listening so I know these answers to the questions that I'm asking about her but I want you all to get a perspective of where her training comes from Rebina what's his a world renowned PhD and researcher yeah and actually I'm dying to go back and give a talk on this topic to them because I know it's not on the radar right now maybe the somebody in the light listen to this podcast and be like yep this is really cool we need to study this but there's no my dream is actually to make a sunlight research lab do you think that it changes it it has changed the outcome of results because of the light that the the studies in mitochondria are under yes exactly there's no doctor jackruse talks about this a lot there's no light controls in our our translational research so on one hand that is kind of consistent with the modern environment because everybody's under blue light artificial light all the time and I make some feel better that's true but on the other hand we're not actually understanding how biology's working because we're looking at it in a in a weekend state due to artificial light being the predominant light source and I also as a little bit of an aside I really think it's funny that if so when I was at Princeton I was working a lot with rodents and if you wanted to go into the mouse room at night you it was pitch black you had to go in you had to turn on the red lights you could go inside it was only red light because they know that red light is going to be far less disruptive to circadian biology and to you know how that mouse's biology is happening and then you know I do whatever after doing the mouse room at night red light and I go back to my lab it's blasted with fluorescent lights and we're just totally not putting the pieces together that on one hand we understand the role of light in you know regulating the mouse physiology metabolism and we're being sure to not disrupt that and that's because in all fairness they're not turn on creatures it's not because of that so I mean if you they're on different lights like also yes they're not turn on but we're as dire no mammals we require light to regulate our physiology they're sleeping during the day they still have a requirement for light exposure but at nighttime they become active and they know that it's time to become active when the light goes away we are no we know how to become active when the light comes out but if we're never in sufficiently bright light so also if you look at into lighting it's very very dim compared to the power of the sun and bright light is also important for stimulating alertness cognition focus and then of course the blue light component the UV light component that comes out midday is also serving to stimulate those circadian pathways to tell your body it's the middle of the day so you know if you're getting artificial light in your eyes during middle of the day it's not the end of the world because you're supposed to be getting some of that blue stimulus so I would argue that it's problematic because the blue light that's coming from these you know lamps let's say or whatever lights you're exposed to is devoid of red and in for light and we talked about the power of red and in for light to support mitochondria blue light actually has the opposite effect on cytocrimcy oxidase it actually inhibits cytocrimcy oxidase on our surfaces our eyes proxmal brain regions on our skin so if we're encountering blue light in the absence of red and in for light we're actually going to be harming our mitochondria because we're not encountering that balancing force of the long wavelength red light my question is these lights all exist together red light infrared light blue light and there's a third light UV UV light we are supposed to have them together and they we they are just going to be in different ratios yes and that is the way in which we were designed to experience light now we've come into a very unnatural environment whereas the ratios are different the amount if any especially now because how often are people even outside yeah and what you're saying is these have these situations have significant impact on our overall health and what we've heard you say so far is everything and anything related to mitochondria I would love for us to for you to teach us all the wavelengths that we should be looking at if we had to design a life around modern living yes we want to be outside as much as possible but what are the wavelengths that we're looking for what are the things that we're going to do I use a red light easily three times a week actually probably more we were sitting here working we're working on again we have a few projects coming up we were sitting here working and being exposed to the red light I'm not sure if that's going to balance these overhead blue lights yeah so I would love for you to take us through that yeah so depending on the time of day I will preface this by saying if you can get outside that is the best solution for how long so for some okay let me also contextualize this it would depend on your health status if you're very sick you need to kind of go all out because your biology is very disregulated at that point if you have cancer if you have diabetes if you're very very sick you have auto immunity you want to kind of go go go home but if you're well and you just want to stay that way you can get away with maybe 15 minutes rising with the sun trying to see the sunrise because then you're getting that red infrared and then you're also getting the rise of UVA which stimulates that neuropson it kind of turns your circadian biology on not to the full extent because the blue light needs to come up as well so you're getting some blue and UV that's rising as the sun rises that's going to help turn your brain on turn your bodily functions on there's over 3000 genes regulated by an acircadian fashion is that also in the acute immediate yeah yeah I would say so I mean the acute immediate is primarily like an endocrine story but there are knock on effects of course to the right like the regulation of gene expression as well and actually that reminds me to circle back to pomsy at some point if you want to bring us back there there's many other important things we need to talk about there as it relates to obesity and also what we have to talk about light and body composition yes that's going to come into that story wonderful okay yes so if you're you know trying to re-engine your light into your life and a more circadian fashion you want to get red in the morning then you can add some UVA you can get UVA bulbs for your room UVA light is actually extremely important it's a major liberator of nitric oxide in your well it forms in your skin and then it can actually diffuse into your blood vessels so nitric oxide is what's required for regulation of blood pressure it's required for vasodilation for reaching of blood vessels into tissues to deliver nutrients and oxygen and one of the major problems with modern living is we're not really getting UVA light if we're living indoors we're not getting it and so we're gonna have higher blood pressure we're gonna have issues with hypoxia too because we're not getting that proper perfusion into the tissues so obviously there's other things that impact that as well like like is our gene you guys need to get enough dietary proteins you can make an arginine nasal breathing so big one if you're breathing through a mouth a lot not only is gonna push you into a more sympathetic state but you're also not gonna be producing nitric oxide which you can get through nasal breathing and friends it will make sure that you remain single if you've ever seen a mouth breather so reason that's an insult mouth breather so take me back to you before we move on red light wavelength wavelengths what again we use bond charge you have a company that you love how do we there's so many red light devices that are sold for skin for hair what are the wavelengths that people are looking for yeah so there's been research on a handful of them in contrast if you think about sunlight you're getting a full spectrum because if you look at the curve of sunlight spectrum it's like it peaks somewhere kind of closer to the red side and then it kind of goes down but it's like a full curve so you're getting every wavelength in between and you get some foreign thread too which you kind of like goes down at the IRA near infrared and then it comes back up in the foreign thread around 3,000 nanometers but you're basically getting all the wavelengths in between it in the devices we're getting kind of these targeted wavelengths so we have like 630 we have 660 or 670 we also have like closer to a thousand which would be like the near infrared some wavelengths in there and each of them are kind of gonna have a little bit of a different effect on my contra and I think that's why it's oh that's interesting yeah basically what you're saying is there a lot more different wavelengths that we have access to oh yeah so it would almost be the equivalent of taking vitamin D but there are so many different forms or you know metabolites yeah is that is that am I understanding that right yeah I actually posted a meme on my Instagram a couple of weeks ago that was like I don't know if you're seeing like the very intricately drawn part and then it goes to a definitely not see the figure head of a horse and that's like the vitamin D supplement and the beautifully drawn other side of the horse like the sunlight at it exposure but basically it's like a shant like a facsimile kind of got it it's not gonna be a perfect representation but the recent there was research of course conducted to understand like okay which wavelengths of light are interacting the most with cytokrimcy oxidase for example so 670 nanometer lights are really good one 630s also good those are like in the deep red part of the spectrum and actually there was a paper that came out I believe in January that showed that if you get about 15 minutes of this deep red light exposure 45 minutes before a meal well they didn't or a glucose tolerance test but you could kind of translate that to like a carbohydrate rich meal that your total glucose spike over you know the course of processing that carbohydrate input was about 30% less so that's just showing the power of when you support your mitochondria you're gonna be able to clear those nutrients from your system better because you're gonna have higher flux state or higher clearance rate of those nutrients within mitochondria so if you just take your meals outside if that's possible you don't have to buy a red light device you can just you know eat your lunch or breakfast or someone could or someone could even try it again this is kind of complicated because in order to figure out an exact reproducible steady state it would require you to have a consistent diet before but if someone wanted to try it they could try themselves you could eat watcher um blood sugar eat the same you know get on the same track for a week eat the same meal outside and I mean that would be awesome yeah I mean you could easily you could easily wear a continuous glucose monitor eat your meal inside under artificial lights on your device screen and then do the same meal the next day outside under the sun and see the difference you can see for yourself um I personally have done that and I know it works for me and there's research now showing that it also works for other people too so I would I would encourage people to try themselves too an individual who can't get outside can use artificial quote red light if they need it near infrared if you know um you carry devices you use devices what wavelength are you looking for or do you yes I'm looking for at least a couple red and a couple near infrared to have somewhat of a full it's like a broad spectrum not a full spectrum um so the device I brought on the plane I was eating steak at the airport before I came here with my red light on me and enjoying myself everybody probably thought it was crazy yeah definitely not how long would someone want to use a red light 20 minutes a day yeah so um the counter balance I guess what I'm asking is how do we create an environment where we can counter balance to give ourselves the best opportunity to get in this flow of proper light because we do have to talk about performance and weight management and sleep as it relates to light yes absolutely so I mean first of all you can get full spectrum bulbs that have red infrared in them that's probably your best option for the house everyone should get full spectrum bulbs yep so if you come to my house we have full spectrum bulbs inside but we also have red bulbs so if you come to my house around sunset everything is red every room is red there's no white light in my house we have we filter all of our screens our computers we use like this iris program called iris filters out flicker filters out blue light why do you care about flicker flicker is very active in its sympathetic nervous system it's also completely unnatural there's no flicker give me the flicker I'm gonna develop a flicker special oh yeah gonna be cracked out like me on coffee right now okay that's a great practical thing for someone to do is to just get full spectrum like is there a brand that you like do you get so chroma makes a sky portal which is cool because it's essentially clamps onto your desk and then it kind of comes up pretty high and angles down at you and it has a knob that you can turn depending on the time of day so you can have it on the full white that's also has red infrared and you can gradually turn it to being almost entirely red and infrared by the night time and it's also coming from the upper angle down which tends to be more stimulating to the central nervous system so if you need to focus more during the day in your office having that light that white light that's coming down at you from above is gonna be more supportive to your cognition and focus whether it be any negative to running a red light all day long so I would say from a therapeutic standpoint you would want to be in front of the right bright in front of the red light as if it's having it coming down or on the right yeah so for like the red light panels those are really meant to interface directly with your body and so you want to reduce your distance from them in order to get the biggest dose essentially for inches how yeah I would say within a foot do you do you remember who Charles Pollock when was yeah okay so Charles was a mentor of mine before he passed away and this was prior he was always talking about athletes he was talking about these Olympians that he was training and he was so excited when the red light first came out he would get these huge panels and put these athletes in this in this spot where they were surrounded by Beth I knew it was like Gary O. you won't believe this is it's almost too good to even share with the world anyhow anyone that knows Charles are new Charles he's a little wacky but brilliant and amazing in so many ways and now we're seeing a lot more of it yeah so I mean if you want to use red light therapeutically I would stand right in front of it but I also if I if I have to work in it you don't have to actually because the long wave length like compensator you're clothing you will get a higher dose if your skin is directly exposed and dose also decreases as you move farther away so you want to get closer and have more skin exposed if you need a higher dose for you know whatever you're dealing with you're trying to improve your skin quality or rehab an injury or reduce inflammation you probably want to maximize your dose and I would say maybe you could do a 20 minutes you could do it once or twice a day but just for increasing the red and infrared light and your ambient environment throughout the day I like to run my red and infrared light panel just in the background so it's kind of just in my sphere but it's not like directly in front of me or like right next to me because I don't necessarily want the therapeutic dose I really just want like the ambient light to be more balanced. I'm going to make sense. and the mechanism of that are that's a whole host I mean you named three light receptors is there more especially when it comes to mitochondria? Yeah I mean I'm sure there is I think this field is in its impenciant a little bit. So I think as I mean hopefully this conversation stimulates some bright minds out there to want to look into these things more I don't think there's red and infrared light receptors in our body like I mentioned earlier I think because the long wave length like compensator and we don't need to sense it on the outside we can just directly interface with it in our you know in our deeper parts of our body but I'm you know I would not be surprised whatsoever if there's other light receptors out there that are playing an important role in regulating our physiology and metabolism response to the light environment. Pomsy tell me about that you know because again what are practical things that people can think about leveraging so that they can be combed or and why. Yes so this is like one of my favorite parts of the story so Pomsy we talked about earlier it cleaves in a 10 different products three of those were alphabet and gamma MSH melanocytes stimulating hormone. Now outside of stimulating melanin alpha and beta MSH specifically the alpha we'll talk about first is one of the most tightly associated gene products with obesity. We know alpha MSH is dysregulated in obesity and as it turns out both alpha and beta MSH directly suppress appetite they work in the hypothalamus they suppress appetite and they increase energy expenditure. So imagine how powerful that is if let's say you know you're trying to the holy grail is being able to eat less and just burn more calories at rest which it's like the opposite of what happens if you're dieting and you're not leveraging the system. As you diet and restrict calories your basin metabolic rate goes down because your body's trying to be thrifty and hold on to what it has because it thinks it's going into like some sort of starvation mode. The leptin story also comes into this and we can come back to that. But just by exposing your skin and your eyes to UVB light specifically you're going to get activation and synthesis of this pomsy molecule and cleave in where is it where is the pomsy located. The pomsy is going to well it's made in a lot of different types of cells made in immune cells it's made in the skin. It's made in the brain different parts of the brain region different parts of the hypothalamus and basically that's going to influence your brain chemistry largely to not only help to suppress appetite and increase your basin metabolic rate there's also influences on lipolosis so being able to liberate more fatty acids from out of post tissue and also a link to your muscles ability to burn fat as well this pomsy cleavage these cleavage products also influence that ability to burn fat in my to conjure of muscle. Someone sees light they view light they get light exposure light exposure activates pomsy in various locations and then it cleaves to alpha and beta subunits of MSH that what you're saying is that can become dysregulated. Yeah absolutely if you're not exposing yourself to this light you're not going to so you can access pomsy in certain brain regions in response to leptin but you you will never produce pomsy in your skin unless you're exposed to UVB light and we're meant to in the ancestral environment and counter UVB light on our eyes and our skin simultaneously and together that's like a concerted force that's going to enhance the response on our bodies. So simply by leveraging that UVB light and getting more of it in your life you can dramatically you know suppress your appetite and especially if you're highly dysregulated and have leptin resistance that's a real problem because your body is not your fat isn't properly communicating with your brain about how much of it there is so you're kind of your brain's always kind of thinking is running on empty so it's constantly trying to fill up it's constantly trying to you know have you eat more because it can't sense how much fat is actually present. That's happening with data on that. Yeah so that's what Jeffrey Friedman's lab in New York I don't remember what universities I have a friend that was doing a postlock there but he discovered leptin back in the 90s and they are largely working on leptin resistance now and the mechanism for light for light so I'm curious about for obesity do we know that those that do better with light exposure are going to lose more weight and you do some more studies we haven't done that we haven't done them we haven't done them we know axiomatically that this is the cascade that happens anecdobly I mean I think a lot of people will test you if you're outside let's say you're on the beach all day you don't tend to feel hungry you kind of just feel fine and that one one hand that's because you're getting like maximal grounding effect you're getting electrons from the earth because salt water is basically like a soup of electrons and you're getting direct access with you know sand water salt that's kind of supercharging the grounding effect plus the sun it's like a perfect marriage of inputs so all those inputs are basically telling your system like we're good we don't need to eat food we have electrons coming from elsewhere and yeah I think ultimately my dream is to build a sunlight research lab so that I can answer these questions definitively that I already know to be true for myself I want to provide the evidence that's going to convince everybody in the field and in science that this is actually really important and that and I think it's also very hopeful too because it's not like we just can't use technology and we can't live modern lives we can just do it in a more thoughtful and thoughtful way that's going to be more coherent with our biology you know I think it has to be like world ending it's just going to be shifting the paradigm in which we're building new technology do you think that we could give people recommendations there would be a minimum amount of time that they should be outside would it be four hours yeah I love this question and this is why I love thinking about vitamin D as a biomarker because we know at minimum you need about 40 nanograms per mill of vitamin D in order to fully suppress parathyroid hormone which is the hormone that kind of kicks on a response to insufficient vitamin D so minimum 40 nanograms per mill from the sun if we're doing it from supplementation we're not going to be able to see how much we're actually making from the sun which is the most important thing because then we're going to be activating pumpsy cascade we're going to be activating vitamin D and all the other vitamin D like the pumpsy is not activated by vitamin D alone new both are activated and synthesize in response to UVB light that's what they share in common thank you to Apollo Nura for sponsoring this episode of the show I have been using the Apollo wearable for quite some time you might see me in my stories where a tiny little square device sometimes I wear it on my wrist sometimes I wear it on my ankle and here's why I love the Apollo number one it is a tiny little device that sends small vibrations throughout my body so I put on my wrist it almost is like a tiny little tapping and you can adjust the intensity and duration there are multiple different programs and here's why I think just you try it it helps regulate your nervous system there is a lot coming at us whether it's our phones or demands and the Apollo wearable allows me to almost I don't know reset my nervous system I think that there's a lot of great science behind it it is a safe effective non stimulant non medication way to manage your nervous system it helps with my heart rate variability it can help me with sleep it helps people with anxiety it was created by a psychiatrist with whom I trust Dave would love to have you on the show it's really amazing and if you are going to add one thing to your regimen that is non supplement I highly recommend that it's this go to Apollo Nero dot com that's Apollo Nero dot com use the code doctor lion for 15% off that's doctor lion for 15% off now back to the show so if we're using vitamin D as a biomarker for our sonic exposure then it becomes really easy to dose our unique requirements for sun so 40 nanograms for mill minimum but we know if you're leading a more outdoor lifestyle and also trying to optimize health that you're going to be closer to 60 nanograms for mill maybe even a little bit higher and so if you're able to do that track your vitamin D in response to sonic exposure that's going to be the best way for you to dose your individual sun needs and that's going to take into account how melanated your skin is because if you have more melanin your skin you need more sun if you have less you need less that would be interesting for people to do stop I listen I'm not your doctor for some of you I am but if you were to stop your vitamin D supplementation see where you're at give it how long would you give it three months how long for like a wash out yeah yeah I would say I'm probably at least six weeks maybe wash out and then I mean obviously don't avoid going out in the sun during that time but just stop maybe you know see sticking this up in my go outside get some of that midday sun we'll talk about strategies to prevent sun burning too because it's really important in order to like fully harness UVB light without the drawbacks and then you know track your vitamin D maybe check it again three months later after you've been in the sun the summers coming up and you're going to have access to high quality sun do we know how fast it changes I mean vitamin D yeah I don't know actually it's going to somewhat depend on probably polymorphisms in the genes that are responsible for making the enzymes and the kidneys and liver that actually make that conversion I know some individuals also if you maybe your kidney function or liver function is impaired in some way your body's not going to prioritize that conversion also nutrient deficiencies and things like boron and magnesium also affect that conversion efficiency so there will be some variability what we do know is that when you be light hit your skin that conversion to 70 hydro cholesterol assuming that that's present in the skin I think there's some evidence to suggest that if you're very if you're living like a city environment you have a lot of non-native EMFs in your environment that could be a non-version EMF so naturally EMFs would be like sunlight like the human resonance which is like the magnetic field of the earth 7.83 Hertz non-native EMFs would be things that are powered by the AC power grid essentially the alternating current power grid which was insepted at the you know world's fair in 1893 before that we did not have electricity indoors people didn't have light bulbs they were using fire if they wanted to have light a night but 1893 everything changed within you know 10 15 years the power grid was up and going and people were you know increasing their productivity they were working at times that they never worked before we had you know the industrialization happening factories and all of these things were happening that were pushing us away from our routes as a species and so I mean if you think about that it's only been you know less than 150 years that our species has made encountering this and AC power grid it runs on alternating current which is not congruent with the kind of power that our bodies use our bodies use a DC power direct current or mitochondria essentially our biobatteries they make energy through separating charge they separate protons from electrons then when those protons come back into the inner part of the mitochondria that powers ATP production so our mitochondria literally batteries that are creating DC power they're creating direct current power AC power grids that's not that's completely something different at you the EMFs that come from these things you know for plugging anything into a wall and going into the grid that's running on AC power it gives off EMFs also our things like Bluetooth WiFi 5G 4G 3G all these things that we're encountering in the past let's say like 20 years or so 30 years are novel they're running on frequencies that are part of the electromagnetic spectrum but they're not frequencies that we encounter here on earth because our atmosphere blocks almost all of them so the radio frequencies for example and would you say being outside helps mitigate some of these effects? absolutely it makes your biology so much more resilient also because melanin we talked about earlier melanin's really cool a conspelt water melanin also absorbs all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum including MFs so if you are building melanin on your surfaces on your skin that means you're going to be mitigating the exposure of your tissues to these frequencies because your melanin's able to actually absorb it instead would you say that people should be tending? yeah absolutely you just shouldn't be burning think that's the problem and maybe this is a good segue to talking about how to avoid burning yes and I just made a post on this yesterday I'm answering and people want to check it out so number one would be to not wear sunglasses because if we're not making the alpha beta and gamma MSH in our brains we're not going to be effectively stimulating melanin production or skin so we need to expose both our skin and our eyes to sign in order to effectively tan wait a second that means that if you're at the beach wearing sunglasses you're more likely to burn yeah if you weren't wearing sunglasses yes but what if your eyes were just closing you were sleeping that's fine you can close your eyes I mean you're still getting penetration of light through eyes obviously I'm the lid yeah through the lid not through the glasses well yes the glasses are blocking UV light specifically some blue light they're going to be blocking some red light as well if your you know your eyes are closed you're getting red light and then for a light but do you think that's fair to say that someone would if they had glasses on they would burn more yeah and honestly if you want to hear my really hot take I think the right you I'm putting Matt Matt is going to now sit outside with sunglasses let's just see if you burns Matt for the first time listeners my producer we're gonna work on getting him a camera and I'm my cassie's just hilarious my really hot take yeah that the rise in skin cancers is largely due to sunglasses contacts and prescription lenses being worn outside constantly we're never exposing our eyes to you what okay all right well we can't say that that is convincingly science but that is Dr. like somebody not to study eventually I'm like do well no we need you for muscle studies things okay how does someone not burn so don't work don't work glasses don't and you guys probably don't stare at this on don't stare at direct with yeah no my guys no you need to do that you can get just ambient light in your eyes no need to it's going to harm you right now if you do that so don't do this outside of that the foods we influence our our burning risk tell me more so in ancestral environment we were eating a ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 let's say 6 to 3 of about 1 to 1 to 3 to 1 ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 the modern day in sex what that is tell us omega 6 versus omega 3 where we're finding omega 6 versus omega 3 so omega 6 y was that ratio like that so largely the omega 6 ratio which is now 20 to 1 to omega 3 has increased because of the industrialization of food production so we're using a lot of processed oils we're using the corn so we're some flour you know all of these oils are very enriching omega 6 and just like kind of devoid in omega 3s any omega 3s that are in these oils like let's say flacks or chia seeds or something like that isn't the ALA form it's not in the form that our bodies actually use to support you know function and anti-inflammation we need the EPA and specifically we need the DHI which is the longest chain omega 3 in order to actually facilitate anti-inflammation and convey actually one of the major roles of DHAs in the eye and it's used to actually help penetrate light into our brains it is a conductor of electrons essentially and so DHIN EPA can only get from animal foods you can take like an algal oil but there's actually research to suggest that the vegan algal oil sources of these EPA and DHA omega 3s are less bio-available because they have their double bonds at the wrong position and that will probably go in line with the conversion of plant sources of ALA yeah exactly and well another problem of consuming your omega 3s in ALA form is that so let's say you're consuming only ALA you're only going to convert about 5 to 10% of that to EPA about 0 to 5% of that to DHI so very low conversion rate on top of that the machinery that's used to convert omega 6 um one of ALA and ALA which is alpha one of ALA, I said, or that for the listener, alpha one of ALA, gas it is the plant form of omega 3 the same machinery is used to elongate both of them and so if you're consuming a lot of omega 6s and not so much of omega 3s you're going to be out competing that machinery and you're going to be preferentially converting the the ALA they'll make a 6s into the longer chains and one of those longer chain fats is a rackadonic acid which is an inflammatory precursor um that our immune system uses to essentially incite inflammation um so if we're consuming a lot of omega 6s relative to omega 3s we're going to be more prone to an inflammatory response in general that's also true at the level of the skin um the skin barrier can be weakened the skin will be more prone to burning with the consumption of an unbalanced omega 6 to 3 ratio where in the blood work would you like to yeah so that's like the omega quant test will tell you the ratios between them I think that's a good way to go about checking and I would shoot personally for a more ancestral ratio of about a 4 to 1 max I would say that would be a good goal to have and if you're getting your omega 3s in I would try to get those from fatty fish or shellfish that's going to be the most bio available the most concentrated sources and of course if you can use a can supplement I don't need a ton of fish I just don't really like the way it tastes yeah so I end up supplementing what about other foods that are rich in beta-carotene for burning things of that nature or certain polyphenols yeah so as the Sam's and we'll probably be the most validated antioxidant to use to help prevent burning basically just helps to also absorb some of that light that melanin will also do so I don't think that's about approach at all I think that's a pretty good way to go about it with regards to burning I'm trying to think actually let me just check what my post said because I was very thorough here so we have okay Dr. Jack Cruise talks about building a solar callus which basically means you want to gradually increase your sun exposure you don't want to just go zero to 100 so that means midday sun maybe start with just 10 minutes see how your skin responds gradually increase over time if it's a summer months you know you may want to gradually increase even more slowly depending on how pale your skin is but you can make melanin even if you're super pale it is possible for you it's just going to take a little bit more time to adjust and by the way have you ever looked into any the peptides for example melanin yeah so yes but I personally subscribe to the notion that if possible we shouldn't exogenously take something that we can indulge in asely produce because it tends to decouple the system and like the regulation that's in place so obviously there's a place for like hormone replacement therapy things like this maybe even vitamin D supplementation if you're very deficient but if you or if you're my patient not just the thing but what you think makes a lot of sense yeah if you don't again if you can do it naturally then I would leverage that first because then your natural regulatory mechanisms will be in place to make sure that system is running as smoothly as it can we mentioned the sunglasses but that's also relevant for the contacts prescription lenses and sunscreen because all of those are going to be blocking UV light UV be light what about if someone is driving in front of a window what kind of light penetration do we have yeah so we're basically getting everything but the UV we're going we're going to get some about 40% of red light will be blocked and infrared a light will be blocked by the window so it is creating like this alien sunscreen before behind a window even if you're in your home you have good natural light it's not actually natural light unless you open up that window because the glass itself is going to be filtering the light and making it let's say unnatural or alien to our biology there is actually type of glass that will allow UV light to penetrate through it's called quartz glass which is very expensive not practical at this point but hey maybe this podcast will also inspire somebody to go make a glass company quartz glass windows not about idea what about body composition and sunlight and training outside and suns effect on skeletal muscle you and I have talked again my interest is in skeletal muscle about muscle clock jeans we certainly don't have to talk about that here but I am curious as to the interface between training outside and does that make muscle more efficient more effective does it allow us to increase power or strength maybe doesn't even work on those domains please yeah so I love this question I also think there's just a Darth of research in this area we need more research in Syria but having said that just on first principles like axiomatic pre-suffices to understanding this light interaction with biology we know red and in Fred light can penetrate into the body and support mitochondria so doesn't it just make perfect sense that if you're working outside you are demanding energy production from your muscles while what better way to support that than actually getting red and in Fred light on your skin penetrating into your body that's going to support that muscles energy production capabilities so I mean I personally have noticed that doing my workouts outside I'm virtually not sore at all and actually I had a gym membership that was frozen unfrozen like a month ago I went to the gym now thought it's fog now I went and I did my normal you know it wasn't anything crazy I was like crippled for four days after that workout and prior to that I had been almost exclusively working outside or if I was working at indoors I had my red and Fred light panels on why do you think that is yeah so I think it's you're putting more stress on your muscle and it's not in like an adaptive way necessarily either it's just in a way that like your muscles not able to to optimally respond to the signals that you're demanding from it through like sustained contraction or you know weight let whether it's weight lifting or cardiovascular size your muscles need to produce energy obviously if you're doing like very like a litigated exercise like you know let's say sprints are lifting there's less of a role for mitochondria but there is still a role for sure because even the most glycolytic muscles still has mitochondria it's just not as dense as some of the more red muscles and do you think that that definitely played a role in your recovery in soreness I personally feel that and I think it would be an easy enough question to ask scientifically we can easily do this so again something I would love to study personally what about behaviors and time frames of doing things training in the morning training late in the afternoon do you believe that there's a certain time frame to do various activities yeah so I would say based on my understanding of the current state of the research and and these biology interactions that probably a more intense workout is better to do let's say in the late afternoon I think if you're doing it too early in the morning it may compound the stress response that you just naturally get when you're waking up obviously for those of you don't know cortisol spikes in the morning actually in accordance with bright light so that's why it's really important to get ideally natural light into your eyes as soon as possible after waking up it helps to optimize that quarter of solar response which is actually really important for mobilizing fat and glucose so that your tissues and your brain have energy to be able to kind of turn on for the day and get you going for the day so we want to be able to optimize that quarter of the response but if we're also like mainlining caffeine and exercising first thing I think that creates an excess of stress that's not necessary like we could just simply if it's possible retime that exercise to be at a point in the day that's maybe more slow for us so typically in the like the mid to late afternoon people gonna get that slump part of that is because their light environments not optimized and their kind of their cognitions kind of declining because maybe you know the eta carb rich lunch and they're getting us sugarcrash whatever it is but part of that is also a natural rhythm of a biology kind of getting more co-assent during that time of day so if you want to work out during that time of day it could be a good idea because you can like kind of turn your system back on and combat that slump that some people will experience during that time. Have you looked at any data regarding female specific information, female fertility as it relates to some I know that that's a very odd question but we definitely see more rise and more rates of infertility we see more challenges with peri postmen of puzzle experiences for people where do you think light and some of this bioharminy plays role regarding environment? So something that a lot of people might not know is that leptin is actually responsible for initiating puberty and girls so that leptin system goes far beyond just you know a thermostat for how much body fat we have it's tightly regulated with the pituitary gland the interaction between the hypothermists and the pituitary gland we know there's like the HPT and HPA axes they're all communicating with each other and so the leptin story is very far reaching and it's implications with regards to fertility and hormone production and regulation of hormone production ready to infrared lighter actually they help to turn on sex hormone production and that's also why it's really cool. It's through the leptin melana-courtin pathway so leptin interacts with we talked about the alpha beta and gamma msh these are involved in the melana-courtin pathway as well these interactions between leptin and the brain is also very tightly tied in with this light story and again I think we need more targeted research on these questions too that are frankly very easy to answer which haven't been asking the right questions with regards to this topic but at the same time there's also some research suggests that UV light actually will turn down sex hormone production and that's not necessarily a bad thing it's just about a timing mechanism like there's certain times of day where you should be producing your sex hormones and largely that's going to be in the morning and in the evening which is when you encounter sunrise and sunset light that's red and infrared dominant and so I think those those are probably the rhythms that nature kind of intended for our hormone pulses to occur and we're not really encountering that written in Fred light in modern day modern lifestyles and I think we're paying in the price for that in a lot of different ways and one of them I think is the fertility problem obviously there's things like undercurrent disruptors and you know we'll talk about sleep because that has major implications with the hormonal system and brain function and neurochemistry and all these things as a really sister-cating biology but there's lots of inputs that are affecting these phenomena these you know these crises of infertility and hormone disturbances but I think light is certainly one of them where we first of all that's fascinating to think that light has any role in sex hormones and any role in relation to when puberty starts when it doesn't again these may not be direct relationships but certainly with the influence of left-in that's fascinating I have to say I don't know much about that but I'm sure we're going to start to hear more about it as we become increasingly aware of the environment and the environment's impact on us from a health and tyroidestiam point you mentioned sleep how important is light to sleep the most important you know it's funny you and I've known each other for years and I've watched you think about a lot of different aspects and you're always increasing the layers to the depth of your knowledge and it's fascinating that light has become such an interest because again your background is in human metabolism nutrition exercise and now you're getting involved in the more external environment which is is just fascinating it creates a much bigger picture we all know that sleep is important I could do a lot better job at it personally so I'm not telling you guys to do anything that I don't do because I don't sleep much unfortunately how wood one who wants to be able to get to sleep early feel energized leverage light so you can probably test this I used to be a night owl I know it's terrible I won't go up with the sun today this is just awful it's awful because unfortunately for me I seem to work close to around the clock now you are no longer available at 11 30 at night when I'm asking you a question about mortality and whatever it is terrible yeah well see this is the power because when I started delving into this I realized how much I was personally doing that was out of alignment with just biological constraints and I started seeing changes immediately so I'd always been a night owl I'd never really pay attention much to like blue light at night or light at night or like not watching TV and better whatever like that and as soon as I started learning all this stuff I was like I've got to change everything that I'm doing but it's also pretty small stuff it's not like life altering things it's pretty small changes so for example using red light at night if you can that's a really simple change that you can make that's not going to provide that blue light signal it's telling your body it's the middle of the day that's going to allow your system to naturally produce meltonin we know that red light red light pretty small time or this is suppression of blue light allows for the absence of blue light allows meltonin to come up we know that blue light specifically is what's called melanopic light it suppresses meltonin's secretion bad a quick question wouldn't it make more sense to just not have light because would the red light stimulate my no conjury yeah should we just be actually sitting in a dark room so ideally yeah but in some cases that's just not going to be possible whatever definitely not whatever responsibilities people have so there's kind of two features of light that are that could be disruptive to meltonin it's both blue light content and brightness so if you're going to use light ideally make it dim red light or like a dim amber light that's going to be the best case scenario outside of not having a light on it all that candle light yeah you can do candle light or that the color of it doesn't matter for from that perspective so I would say candle light is still going to be somewhat disruptive but it is pretty dim okay and it's more on the red side of the spectrum so it's going to be less far less disruptive than having a white LED or fluorescent bulb on those are highly suppressive to meltonin secretion and we need that rise of meltonin order to trigger sleepiness reduce sleep latency the you know enhance the ability of you to fall asleep quicker and also stay asleep and then naturally you know meltonin's going to start waning throughout the night and once it reaches like a nater then cortisol starts rising up and we naturally wake up and that's the cycle that our body requires and both cortisol and meltonin are circadian are circadian regulated I like to call them like circadian biosensors so they're both regulated in accordance with light I will also mention here that light and dark are equally important for human biology and I would argue for like my million biology in general light isn't itself the most important thing both light and dark are equal importance and we need both of them we need light bright light from the sun ideally and dark darkness daily at the right times in order to have a regulated physiology that's pretty profound it people might think well goodness that makes sense but how many of us really sleep in pitch black rooms and also wake up to the sun or bright right yes nobody yeah and I mean this is one of those things that like you don't think about until you see it and then it's like you can't unsee it I agree why did someone have to get up and get outside I'm just thinking from a practical standpoint my kids they get up and I try to get them ready for school I should probably get them up and we should all get ready outside for school how important is that time frame so it's important in the sense that if you're rising with the sun you're going to access that redness in the morning helps to regulate the hormonal milieu helps to turn on your mitochondrial function helps to regulate that cortisol response and then you're also encountering some of that morning UVA that's rising shortly after sunrise depending on your latitude that's going to also start to engage that circadian mechanism through the neuropson sensing option molecule and so yeah if you can you know what I like to say and what I personally do is like whatever I'm going to do inside I just try to do it outside if I can obviously you know whether permitting but what I've done a lot in my life is like I stopped spending my money on supplements and I started spending my money on making like a beautiful outdoor environment for myself that I can just enjoy being in have like a nice patio with an umbrella if I need to get some shade or if it's raining I can go under there still encountering natural light and just making a space that's enjoyable and that's going to be I mean in my opinion far money that's far better spent than on like some dubious supplements so we have no idea if it's working or not and it's like makes some bold claims but we know that light is so important that why you know let's spend our money in doing what we can to optimize that light environment and you'll see the benefits immediately like without and you and to be fair you live in New Jersey which it gets really cold in the winter how does one begin to think about balancing the light and the cold if you are inside more do you need more cold exposure if so how do we think about everything about cold plunge thinking about being outside and so framing up for us is to what someone would do and how they can think about it yeah so I would say the beautiful part about this is that you you don't have to be cold all day in the winter it's your body doesn't require that much of a dose to be functioning well um so what you can do is if you're using cold water immersion that's going to be the most effective way to actually get the adaptive responses to cold exposure because water has what's called a very high specific heat capacity which means it can hold a lot of heat which means that if you're doing cold water immersion that heat is whipped away from your body very quickly and then you get that adaptive might a conjugal activating response and the increase of brown fat activation and beige fat production that helps to produce metabolic heat in a short period of time versus going for a walk in like shorts and a t-shirt outside in the cold you will still get a benefit but it's like let's say you can do five minutes of cold water immersion or you can do like 45 minutes of a walk outside it's just a much more effective and efficient way to get that cold exposure adaptive response and how cold does it have to be so for the metabolic benefits the research was suggests between 15 and 55 degrees water would be optimal or ideal or sufficient let's say to get those metabolic adaptations um talk to Tom Seeger who's a professor in Arizona he talks about for the psychological benefits that it may be good to go colder because you actually need to a real challenge to kind of like develop grit and this may be particularly true for man I think women's physiology tends to be a bit more delicate with regards to the stressors that we experience we tend to get a bit more disregulated from intense stress and strain on the on our physiology but I think you know women can probably even benefit from this too if it's like one to three minutes three would be like a max like 37 degrees like that's cold that's like you know ice bath status and um but that's when you can really develop like more psychological resilience and response to cold so depending on your goals I think most people or a lot of people would just really want the metabolic benefits um so if you're leveraging the cold in that way you can do 55 degree water and get a lot of those benefits um you may need to go for a little bit longer as you get more adapted it depends on how robust your mitochondria responding how much brown fat and beige fat you have um as you become more adapted you kind of need to increase your time spent similar to the melanin story as you have more melanin you need more sun to get the benefit same with cold if you have more of that adaptive response already in place you need more cold um have you thought much about the interface between all of them the light and the cold particularly and how they work together yeah absolutely I mean I think um with regards to like doing cold exposure in the sun for example so yesterday we did exactly what I was thinking about yeah we did our cold plans and you opened up the garage and the sun was at the perfect angle that was just like beating down on your while you're in the cold and I was like by the way I was still very cold and we actually had it set again we will never hit the end of winter hell week it was set at 54 degrees but um I thought that was that's plenty cold it was good it was plenty cold um yeah so what is the interplay between light and cold I'd actually never thought about that prior to are having a discussion yeah so I mean if you think about what we talked about regards to their infrared and red light stimulating mitochondria we know we need a stimulant mitochondria in order to make metabolic heat so the metabolic heat is what's happening when our mitochondria responding to cold and so if you're stimulating your mitochondria with red and red light while simultaneously getting cold you're going to get a better more robust response to that cold exposure you're going to be able to tolerate you know potentially longer periods of time you're going to have a more adaptive response it's just going to be far more supportive and like health fortifying experience versus let's say doing a cold plunge being blasted with blue light for example which is not going to give you that same benefit I love that and again that's one of the reasons that we use plunge which um Ryan if you're listening to this Dr. Alexis Cowan she needs a plunge because it is my absolute favorite but we try to plunge you know in natural light it just seems to feel better um I'm also going to say anic data so this is anic doodle data my own data it feels less stressful quite frankly when I'm almost outside doing it versus in a contained environment yeah I mean if you think about that in nature we would encounter cold bodies of water in nature and pretty sure nobody in nature would willingly go into a cold plunge or a cold sure they did that bathing and rivers and things like that oh yeah I guess they would have to never thought about that yeah I actually never thought about that yeah I think there's even cold bodies of water near the equator too just you know from all the flow depending if it's coming up from down from a mountain think about it those that live in warm environments like my dad would never be exposed to cold water I think there's still some cold bodies of water if there's like you know rivers or streams coming down from a higher altitude could still be on the colder side maybe not in the 30s but it could be in the high 50s let's say um I mean we know the Pacific Ocean is like in the 50s right so it doesn't get very warm just due to like the way the the water currents are occurring in the like the ocean system um so I think it's safe to say that even if you're in more equatorial regions you still might encounter some cool water and that that would be natural to encounter in the presence of more intense sunlight as well and that they actually synergize very nicely let's talk about protein specifically first forms natural way protein formula one people ask me all the time what kind of protein powder I use what kind of protein powder I recommend formula one makes many different kinds of protein powders different flavors a natural one you pick it it mixes amazing it makes it extremely easy to get your protein in and really there it's a way protein isolate so you're getting the majority of your calories from protein in the shake tastes great super easy to travel with great breakfast dinner maybe even lunch whatever you need it's got you covered and it has all the amino acids necessary will help improve body composition muscle mass all the things that protein does and by the way when do you need protein well you need it every day and that's why I love first forms protein powder their formula one go to firstform dot com slash doctor lion that's first form dot com slash

back to the show so we do i think that that's all brilliant and i have to ask you our five questions which by the way they're different for everybody okay and your answer has to be yes or no okay and because you're talking about cold equator you know equatorial type environments i'm gonna choose some of those questions so skinny dipping yes or no yeah strength training inside yes or no this is a hard one i know so normally she would say yes a year ago you would have said yes or what of absolutely i mean okay i'll be pretty i'm gonna be providing sure I'm gonna be so doctor to the right genophrio okay said sure i asked them a question and he said sure diet soda no hello hello um sleeping with an i mask yeah so that was a sure yeah sure if you have no other option sure um wax earplugs because we actually didn't talk about sound stimulation but i'm just gonna leave it as wax earplugs sure i never thought about it either i mean obviously sound can wake you if you're sleeping um if you had to have control of your environment very well then yeah could be good for earplugs fasting for mitochondrial health uh this is a hard one Gabrielle i know uh generally speaking i'm gonna say no i would i would also say no so we've been talking about pomce beta msh of msh there are other downstream components but we're gonna say byproducts of pomce what are they yeah so among those ten cleavage products three of the other ones are alpha beta and gamut and dorken and these are huge you may have heard of endorphins in the context of like mood or even an exercise never heard it well yeah amazing okay tell me yeah so these molecules make us feel great not only that they reduce anxiety they improve our baseline feeling of well being they actually also increase our ability to think well and they enhance our baseline dopamine levels which is huge and if you think about this like so many people in modern society are going through life with really just burned out dopamine systems because they're constantly seeking for these quick hits because we're not getting that baseline elevation from UVB light exposure that facilitates in dorken production so if your so dopamine system is kind of shot because you're never getting that in elevation of baseline you're gonna constantly reach for the junk food for the junk media for the you know alcohol for the drugs whatever it is to get that hit because you're not operating from a place of fullness you're operating from a deficit you're always looking for your next quick fix to that problem and your sing sunlight would help balance that yeah because you're getting the production of the alpha beta and gamut and dorkens which release dopamine in the brain they help to just increase your your mood your felt sense of well being also your ability to critically think because if your dopamine system is shot you're also not going to be able to think in a way that's more curious and open-minded you're going to naturally be more dogmatic and myopic in your view of life also this ties into the blue light story too because blue light also pushes you into more sympathetic state in a sympathetic state you have blinders on you're like very focused on what's in front of you you're not able to see the bigger picture both literally and figuratively like it literally shuts off your peripheral vision but it also doesn't allow you to think in a more holistic connected way that's connecting disparate pieces together to actually critically think effectively so there's so many implications with the light environment as it relates to your ability to think properly which obviously has knock on effects to everything like your ability to have high quality relationships your ability to navigate challenge in your life your your reaching for vices like the urge to even do that is largely rooted in this operating from like a deficit that it it's a really good point these are the tips that you've given us that you continue to give us our clear and easy things that we can do to leverage our environment give me your top five give me three to five things that you wish you had known that you think everybody should implement daily great love this question so number one would be the sunlight specifically is I would say in it's an invaluable aspect of our environment that's regulating our bodies so the more that you can leverage the sun directly the better off you're going to be and the more you can be outside in natural environments the more synced up your biology is going to be with nature which means that it's just going to be a better fit for you your body's going to be able to be more adaptive to your specific environment so leveraging sunlight would be number one number two would be that figure out where your mitochondrial genes come from so this basically means find out where your mom side of the family came from because you inherit all your mitochondria from mom if your mom side of the family comes from more equatorial regions you know let's say they have darker skin you don't need to do your genetic testing you can just see their skin tone and see you know where about they might have come from they have darker skin they probably came from equatorial regions without a doubt what that means then is if they come from these regions you have a more coupled mitochondrial haplotype which means that your mitochondria are really good at making energy but they require a lot of sun year round because equatorial regions have an abundance of sunlight coming in year round they're not having a seasonality if on the other hand your mitochondria come from more northern regions so for example my mom side of the family from Scandinavia that means my mitochondria are Scandinavian and that means that they're exhibiting what's called an uncappled phenotype or haplotype the uncappled haplotype is really good at dissociating energy production from the flow of electrons which means that you're able to generate more heat from your mitochondria if you have an uncappled mitochondrial haplotype if you have an uncappled mitochondria that means that you're going to be really good at getting cold and you may lose some of that ability if you're never getting cold but you will adapt to it relatively quickly because you have this built-in mechanism in place already interestingly if you have an uncappled haplotype it's actually advantageous because if you even move to a more equatorial region your mitochondria can actually kind of shape shift into a more coupled haplotype and then if you go back to more northern region it has more let's say adaptability and I think this is also one reason why a lot of equatorial communities in the United States are suffering health wise like we see black people we see Latinos and Latina as we see cultures that come from more equatorial regions they're individuals here in this country have very poor health outcomes and part of that is certainly socioeconomic but part of it's also they're not getting sufficient sunlight for their specific mitochondrial genetic needs so I think understanding that aspect is huge when it comes to optimizing your health understand where your mitochondrial genes came from so that you can better optimize your lifestyle to suit them number three would be to definitely block or avoid blue light at night so that means either you know switching all your light bulbs to red or amber and if you can't do that at at least popping out of pair of blue blocking glasses that will block a hundred percent of blue light bond charge cells great ones I love theirs I use them I carry them when we all the time there's also daytime blue blocking glasses that block about sixty percent that you can use if you're gonna be under blue light like in excess during the day obviously we need some blue light during the day to tell our body it's the middle of the day but if we're getting an excess it can be very draining to our nervousness what do you mean excess how we're someone now if they are getting excess blue light so if you're under LED and fluorescent lights all day and you're also on screens all day that aren't being filtered of blue light you're gonna be in an excess that's a lot yeah unless you're actively balancing with a red and infrared light panel for example so that's one way could balance if you can't do that then where paired daytime blue blocking glasses take frequent as frequent as you can breaks to get some natural light outdoors that would be my tip there number four I would say the more electrons you can scavenge from the earth the better off so if you can ground you know even 15 minutes a day getting your bare feet on some natural surfaces concrete also works but grass is great too the optimal would be like a beach sand and salt water and sun simultaneously but getting some grounding in daily is a great way to support your mitochondria reduce inflammatory burden and overall just support your systems ability to make energy an effective way so I think those would be some of my top tips that maybe the last thing I would say is just not to fear UV light knowing that we need to work with it but that if we can harness the power of UV light from full spectrum sunlight we have immense potential to facilitate healing process facilitate our ability to critically think support our mood support our appetite regulation and and basal metabolic rate and then also of course the red light part of the story too supporting your mitochondria directly all of these things synergized together to help create a system that's more resilient and robust to its environment those are great tips thank you so much for coming on and you guys listening or watching Dr. Alex Alex is how and will be on frequently as she is and she typically brings due and innovative ideas thank you as always and we will link where to find you thank you so much thank you so much this was so fun you
