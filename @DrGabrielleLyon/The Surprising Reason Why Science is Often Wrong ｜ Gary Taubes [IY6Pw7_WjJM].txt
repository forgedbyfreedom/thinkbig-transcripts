And I was interviewing another Nobel laureate, a guy named Leon Letterman who ran the Ferming National Laboratory, and Leon told me that he liked to walk around the laboratory at night and talk to the graduate students because they hadn't learned how to lie at. And so this was a learning experience. And we ended up these researchers, they do the experiment, they gather the data, they interpret the data, they write a paper, the paper gets reviewed, they rewrite it, it gets published, and then we read the newspaper account, which makes it look like this sort of wider black thing, they discovered acts, or they didn't discover acts. And the truth is that even the people who discovered it, often can't decide among them whether or not they really discovered it. And the people who know the most about whether they might have discovered it, aren't the heads of the experiments. And the guys who in the Nobel Prizes, they're the technicians who actually built the equipment. And so it would say to me, like, my equipment can't do what they think it does. It's not good enough. Thank you to Timeline for sponsoring this episode of the show. Timeline nutrition is pioneering science. And in fact, they make one of my all-time favorite products. They make a product called MidoPear. And MidoPear is the first and only clinically tested uralithin''a. What is uralithin'a that you're asking? It is a post-biotic that our guts typically make. It's a metabolite. And actually 60 to 70% of people can't even make the appropriate amount of uralithin''a. Uralithin''a is important and works along some of the same pathways as exercise and calorie restriction. Essentially, it helps the MidoCondria turn over and induce my topology and improve the MidoCondria health. And why do you care about that? Because you care about your overall health and well-being and you care about muscle health.

Gary Tubs, you are an absolute legend and I'm so grateful that you are joining us and going to share your wisdom and your perspective. Certainly medical journalism and journalism in and of itself is an ancient art and one that is absolutely necessary. So thank you so much. Thank you for having me. Now you have a new book out. You've written many books. Yeah, the new book is Rethinking Diabetes and it's kind of, yeah, I have this problem and I write books which is I'm fascinated by how we came to believe what we believe and whether or not it's right. So I tend to take a historical perspective to go back and look at the evidence and then I get carried away and the result is a book like Rethinking Diabetes. Can't wait to hear what your next book is going to be on. The next book is just going to be a similar history of the obesity thinking and because the fundamental one, I mean if you were going to divide, say virtually everything we think about nutrition, all our concepts in nutrition are based on sort of three fundamental pillars. And the primary pillar is that we get fact as we eat too much and it seems intuitively obvious and it's kind of biologically naive and I've written about this in every one of my books. It's been at least a chapter if not a theme but it keeps getting ignored and it's back because to say that you don't get fact because you eat too much seems like too much to take on and I keep thinking if I write a book only about that and that history then reviewers and critics can't ignore it. They could ignore the book entirely which is a likely scenario but they can't ignore the arguments which is that when you go back and look at the history clearly obesity is caused by a sort of neural hormonal phenomena. Some people are predisposed to become obese, some people aren't and then the question is what triggers had predisposition but that'll be the next book and an ideal world is going to be about this concept of how we came to believe that obesity's caused by energy imbalance and the title I would love to give it is the biography of a very bad idea. My editors already rejected that but that's how I think of the title itself. You know you do have a very interesting history. Again medical journalism, health journalism is challenging in and of itself. Especially for an individual who is not professionally taught you are very from what I understand self taught in biochemistry and some of this literature is that is that true? Well when it comes to biochemistry I would say that I'm just not taught. Um, the my background, my background was in the hard sciences. I have a physics degree. That engineering degree from graduate school. I then decided I wanted to be a journalist. I got a journalism degree and became an investigative science reporter because As I started reporting about science I realized that there was a lot of bad science out there. Um, a lot of just like there's bad plumbers and bad doctors and bad lawyers and people you don't want to hire to do the job. They're supposed to do the world is full of bad science because science is so difficult. One way to think about is we've you you discover the easy stuff you always get the low hanging fruit and you're left with the hard stuff and hard stuff is hard because it's hard. So you need the exquisite skills and intellect and rigor and meticulous techniques and And like any profession most people don't have that level of talent and So a large proportion maybe even the great proportion of everything that's published is either irrelevant or wrong or misinterpreted or I mean Pick your problem. Um, so I Back in the mid-80s Trimble to think that I've been working that long but back in the mid-80s I had the opportunity to go off to Geneva Switzerland to the big physics lab called Surn So the biggest lab in the world and to follow what I had been told would be it The greatest breakthrough in physics in 40 years these people said that The guy who would win the Nobel Prize that year said I just had to turn on my accelerator get a little more data and now it down And I asked if I could Well today we would say be embedded with his collaboration You know I slept on a hot in a hostel on the laboratory I spent about 18 hours a day with the physics Physicists on the experiment and I watched them realize that they had screwed up and that there was no discovery And these very very very smart scientists had to deal with the fact that they had embarrassed themselves and not only have they embarrassed themselves They embarrassed themselves with the journalist present recording at all for post-airony So the book that I thought was going to be about a great breakthrough turned out to be about Sort of expose a about the politics and sociology of this very cutting edge high energy physics and I became obsessed with how hard it is to do science right and how easy it is to get the wrong answer And I've been doing that ever since it's just Physics has an advantage over Medicine and nutrition and public health and then you can actually Control your experiments. They experiment I was writing about costs I don't probably a couple hundred million dollars back then today the equivalent experiments cost Ten billion dollars to do when you have collaborations of five thousand Physicists and they're trying to figure out You know exactly what they're doing in these experiments and how I want to interpret them in medicine and public health We have none of that it's like dealing with people is Excruciating a difficult often it's unethical So you get these hypotheses and you can never really test them well and as a result Human nature sets in and people decide hypotheses are true anyway So it's like you have this idea like the very first big story I did a nutrition was it's about salt and blood pressure And this was the late 90s and like everyone else I thought if you ate a salt rich diet It would give you hypertension and so we're all eating low salt diets the food This bland beyond belief, but we choked it down and I Stumbled into the realization that there was actually very vitriolic controversy over whether or not Salt consumption sodium actually was the cause of hypertension and whether eating a low salt diet would do any good And I spent nine months doing an investigation for science on this one magazine article science was the journal The one of the two most prominent science journals in the world and um I interviewed 85 But before you tell us that I have to stop you because you didn't mention you did go to Harvard and then you went to Stanford and you studied physics No big deal But the switch to health How was that and why was it the switch out why from physics to then health was it that you were just simply sick of eating the bland food or There are moments The there was a moment so after I did this physics book so again I start off I moved to this laboratory I lived with these physicists for nine months I watched and realized how they had screwed up their interpretation of the experiment I learned a lot of lessons in the process like there are 150 physicists in this collaboration and then numerous technicians and And the collaboration I divided up into two groups the people who only interpreted the evidence that the equipment collected And the people would actually build the equipment and didn't trust it to do what the other group thought it could do And while I was doing that it's research I also traveled around the world to talk other physicists and I was interviewing That another Nobel laureate that got it in Leon Letterman who ran the Ferming National Laboratory And Leon told me that he liked to walk around the laboratory at night and talk to the graduate students because they hadn't learned how to lie at And so this was a learning experience and you know we again when we end up like these researchers They they they do the experiment they got the data they interpret the data they write a pipe or the paper gets reviewed They rewrite it it gets published and then we read the newspaper account Which makes it look like this sort of wider black thing they discovered Acts or they didn't discover acts and the truth is that even the people who discovered Often can't decide among them whether or not they really discovered it and The people who know the most about whether they might have discovered it aren't the heads of the experiments and the guys When they're Nobel prizes they're the technicians who actually built the equipment and Said would say to me like my equipment can't do what they think it does It's not good enough You know, so I became obsessed with this like I said after the book came out Okay, saw me young man. I'm the book and I'm just turning 30 years old the Living in New York it's a snowy day in February I Been told that the book is a right up on my book and page six of the New York post so New York post is the yellow journalism New York paper now. It's the very conservative slightly yellow journalism paper and page six was the gossip column And I've written a book about high energy physics and the headline is egghead swabble over Nobel prize And in the article this Nobel laureate I had actually gone to Stockholm with them when he won the Nobel prize read gotten fitted for Black tie and tails together something I'm sure he regrets to this day Anyway, he is quoted in the paper calling me an asshole I'm a 30 year journalist. I'm thinking I'm never gonna work in journalism again And what turns out is that is I go back to my job writing about other subjects and They tell people about this Nobel laureate and the physics fiasco I've written about May say oh well, if you think he's bad, you should write about something so And it turns out in every field of science every discipline has somebody who's gotten very far in the field by playing fast and loose with the facts You sort of got the mentality of a Hollywood movie producer and not a scientist And I started suddenly I had this career doing investigative science journalism And then when my second book was about this great scientific fiasco called cold fusion It was the fiasco of the sort of late 20th century Basically you put heavy water and a beaker with a platinum electrode and you turn it in and you plug it into the wall and you get fusion power and Complete ballocks is a British would say Anyway, that book was called bad science. I interviewed about 300 people for that one book I mean it was the great science right in the horse freedom of jutsom used to say that I had done more research for the stupidest scientific subject than anyone in history After I was done with that book I had a lot of fans in the physics community people who didn't like the no ballory at that I was exposing and my first book and They said if you are interested in bad science which was a title of the coke fusion book you should look at the shin Public health it's terrible and They had one particular subject in mind which was this idea that electromagnetic fields from power lines would cause Brain cancer leukemia now it's still kind of alive as the idea that you're self-untilled do it Put them you know in the wrong pocket you'll be sterile for life that kind of thing The listener wants to know is it true? No, I'm not as far as I could tell I mean The science is terrible and the physics Would say it's impossible if you believe physics which I tend to do good on the laws of physics So anyway, that was it. That was my shift. I wrote an article for the Atlantic about election magnetic fields in power lines And I had my first introduction to the field of observation or epidemiology So that's the field where you You know find people who are like people we'd a lot of meet for instance and you compare them to people who don't need a lot of meat You see who's got more disease and who dies earlier I was stunned at how sloppy the science was so from the first Seven years or so of studying bad science I had all these brilliant experimentalists really really smart talented Men and women teaching me about how meticulous and rigorous and critical and skeptic you have to be because otherwise you'll fool yourself And embarrass yourself and then I wanted to just feel it about epidemiology where they said oh well We don't we can't really It's just too much for luxury we can't be meticulous and we can't be rigorous so we're not going to be skeptical And we're just going to assume we're not fooling ourselves. I'm just kind of stunned By the scrambleations I wrote the an article for the journal science unhappened the analogy that that was Sort of infamous at the time. I was I didn't realize it but I was among For the 1990s I became the leading critic of this field of observation of epidemiology there had been another fellow in the 1980s Since 2000s John I in 80s it stand for it has been that person And then I stumbled into diet but by this point I was comfortable working with the tools of Nutritional science I knew what it took to it Cheve a reliable result in an experiment. I knew how carefully it had to be I've seen how easy it was to screw up effortless By this point I was used to talking to the graduate students Because I figured they wouldn't lie to me so if I would do a story about a Some quote discovery I would interview everyone not just the Investigator who's the last name on the paper the first name on the paper but all the people in between and if there were technicians who were Think I would try to get the technicians on the phone to see what they thought so this was just It was time consuming and but did and it gets you in trouble too That's the other you don't make friends You're probably less probably less in trouble now because what's so shocking as a as a physician who did clinical research and was in practice and is in practice We still rely so heavily on epidemiology as if it is somehow the Result you know that it's proving something rather than it potentially being just a hypothesis and really low quality data You must be shocked I am It's not so much fun. I'm shocked Thank you to thesis for sponsoring this episode of the show I will never recommend something that I don't use or take myself thesis is a Neutropic company and what's a Neutropic nitrobex are Compounds typically found in nature that really help Individuals with things like clarity mood energy This is exactly why I use thesis I use a whole bunch of different Formulas but clarity is the one that I am on to lately and in clarity It comes in one little packet there is lions main mushroom Alpha GPC caffeine Outfining all things that are clinically tested to help improve Clarity and cognition head over to take thesis dot com slash a doctor lion and there will be a quiz for you to take in which they will curate Your very own custom box that's take thesis dot com slash doctor lion They have compiled thousands and thousands of data points so that you will get your perfect match The it has there was a period of which I mean this is a field that is constantly challenged Consumely accused by influential researchers of being as you put not just low quality data But very low quality data and yet it is guaranteed to show up in the newspapers Whenever somebody does it I mean I was just reading an article today in the Wall Street Journal about the benefits of exercise for Maybe it was a pancreatic cancer story So you take people you get 6,000 people and you follow them for 10 years I think seven years and you look at see which ones get in better shape in which ones again were shape Over the seven years and then you see how that affects pancreatic cancer risk or colon cancer colon cancer And you find out that the people got better shape have a 35% lower risk of colon cancer Their mortality is the same and they died at the same rate and at the same times but they had less colon cancer So the report of roadered off this might have been in New York times is though this study showed that Exercise getting in better shape what we're doing to risk of colon cancer which is not what it showed What it showed is that people who get in better shape Have a lower risk of colon cancer but then you'd love for this idea that maybe the people who gotten better shape over those seven years were different Then the people who got in more shape So they might have been healthier to begin with That's they might have been more health conscious to begin There's a lot of reasons why people would get in better shape why they would work out and the reason you do randomized control trials Reason that's high quality evidence is because you take all those possible different reasons and you randomize them such that The people who you're now gonna tell to work out the people aren't gonna be told to work out you could assume are identical Without randomization you can't do it So this study that was written on the New York Times the Wall Street Journal whatever was is simply incorrect and it's interpretation And nobody pointed this out to the journalist and the journalist is very well accomplished had no A parent knowledge that people like me had ever been criticizing this kind of interpretation of the evidence So it's in some ways it's getting worse because the longer we go without the good clinical trials The good experiments the more people everyone involved is willing to accept this low quality data How do you think that this colors societies view on health and wellness? Most of what we believe is based on These epidemiologic surveys because as I'm always writing and my colleague me and a title says writing and others When you actually do the experiments we can never confirm these hypotheses But most of what we believe about a healthy diet about the need and again I'm like you I'm a physical activity not I go crazy if I don't get to work out every day It's I you know makes me feel better. I have no idea if it's gonna make me look longer Well, if you have muscle you might I would like to think so but I also have Yeah, I mean again, I was a football player when I was younger I had a brief ill-conceived amateur boxing career and so most of my physical ailments today are the results of physical exercise You could argue that they were the wrong physical activities to do or not physical activities. I'm letting my kids do But yeah, that was But it when you're 21 23 25 years old that's stuff for a man You don't care how long you're gonna live when you're that you know because you feel like you're immortal You don't care if you're gonna be able to remember your cat's name when you're 67 Because you don't have a cat when you're 23 it's sort of um that's right So these are there any recent studies or Developments in the field of nutrition that have really caught your eye lately and I do want to talk about your book because I really have to Commend you one of the things that I absolutely love about your work is it challenges everything and humans are funny If we hear something repeated over and over again we believe it as truth Even if it's not it's just the repetition somehow Makes it true to us and maybe it's the familiarity or that nobody questions the model You know it seems like every day there's a new Epidemiology study coming about how red meat is bad for us, etc. etc. These things always peak my interest and I'm curious if there's any recent studies or developments that have peaked your interest well You know obesity drugs, but that wasn't the My assumption In general is Let me give you the context so again when I was doing the work I was doing in the late 80s and through the 90s I had to learn A lot about science and the philosophy of science and the history of science to understand whether I was crazy or not Right because I'm so critical and skeptical what's being done from and When you start reading this sociology of science and history of science you realize that it like I said it the accepted wisdom is that the great bulk of everything that's done is meaningless and today It almost has to be meaningless because for instance you know we have tens of thousands of Medical journals Many of them have to pay people or people have to pay to submit articles on every Professor who's got graduate students who are going to become PhDs or MDs have to get papers published for those students so they can get their degrees The amount of noise generated is enormous Yeah, and so the question is and the problem is You know the way the news is works and I've written about this in the past newspaper reporters is supposed to report about the news and the news is what just happened So they're reporting the front edge of scientific research the sort of the noise is going up and down It's like if you've ever looked at the Wall Street Journal and they tell you that that day You know the stock market has gone up 0.32 percent and it's because and they always give you a reason if it's gone up it's because interest rates are down or they have really no idea Why it's gone up to them because it's just fluctuating but that's what they have to say every day and you see the same phenomenon on science So and one of my favorite quotes of this effect was an Australian former physicist turned philosopher of science named Zeman who said Physics the science in the textbooks is 95 percent wrong and the science there 90 percent is wrong and the science in the The textbooks the science in the journals is 90 percent wrong the science in the textbooks is 90 percent right and the job of the Sciences to find the right stuff that's being published and then figure out that it's really right and then Eventually it shows up in the textbooks maybe 10 or 20 years later but in the meantime It's been in the newspaper as a reporter over and over again. So in general I tend not to believe to take Pay much attention to anything and the recent news other than to be horrified by how it's being reported was such a certain day. The You know as you know I'm a proponent I have come through my research to be a strong proponent of carbohydrate restricted diets So and do you see more and more clinical trials every day Reporting on those and there's some very interesting findings that particularly the field of metabolic psychiatry which is brand new where there's you know anecdotal and small clinical trial evidence that ketogenic diets have been from markable efficacy for some pretty awful cognitive disorders like bipolar disease but I remain skeptical As is your nature? This is my nature. Yeah. As is your nature until it is true. And then, but until it's just hard to figure out why you should continue to remain skeptical But even with my skepticism I could say to people as I do in my books look Here's a guy who was living on the street one of the The funding in this field of metabolic psychiatry comes from the bazooki family in California because their son was by-polar and suffered from bipolar and schizophrenia and was homeless and in the now the prisons. I mean, this was a kid who was I think it was at Stanford when he dropped out and was so burdened by this disease that he couldn't function and then eventually he was on 20, 30 different drugs and eventually they got him home and transitioned him to a ketogenic diet and since then he's had a somewhat remarkable recovery. You can't swear that the diet did it. Maybe there's a coincidence maybe whatever covered anyway or if he had gone vegan I would have worked you don't know. But you can say to people look it worked for him. Let's work for Matt Bazooki. Maybe it will work for you. Give it a try. Is there anything that you feel as if you know and I say that cautiously because you're always challenging what you're thinking and what you're doing? I know you love exercise but you know you've been in journalism gosh for how many decades now at least. We'll keep it at least too many and I am curious is to are there a handful of things that you believe to be true or at least undeniable and has your thinking evolved since your earlier works. So you know you've had good calories bad calories why we get fat the case against sugar the case for keto and now rethinking diabetes. I'm just waiting for your case for muscle. I'm hoping that that's your next book but um is there something that's evolved since your earlier works or you consider a new research finding and debate in the field or something that has changed your personal perspective? Well okay so let's it's because before I did the research I was the follower of the conventional wisdom. Okay as many of us were so this was a 1990s I lived on a very low fat diet. I'm guessing it was probably less than 20% fat. Like God forbid I should have read the skin of a chicken. Um the uh I believe the conventional wisdom. I believe that we got fat because we took in more calories and we expand. I believe that heart disease was caused by eating too much saturated fat that if I read meat I'd get colon cancer my mother had told me them the 60s. So the more and more research I did all of that changed. Now the very first book I wrote good calories bad calories was 45 years of work. Four years of research and interspersed with two years of writing. Um it was in that research I delved into virtually every subject I've written about since then. So that was sort of the beginning of everything I was doing so there was there were no claims I mean it book is right with there or so I hit to admit it. My estimate is that in this 500 pages and another 150 pages of foot notes and bibliography there's probably 200 from very minor to some very embarrassing mistakes. Errors that I should not have made. Um and um. Very scary. I have to stop you. You know every writer feels that way. I would like to think so. An occasion every writer feels that way cringes when they read their book yeah including myself so. Well this is it if you were going to ask me which book I like. Well yeah. I'm asking you which book do you wait wait hold on you're not off the hook. Each book must have taken you how long did each book take you? Well good calories bad calories was five years but plus the two years previous in which I was doing the research on salt and dietary fat for science investigations. So arguably the better part of seven years um the why we get fat was written specifically as I say in the introduction to be a easily digestible aka readable version of good calories bad calories because so many people had written me saying this book had changed my life would you now please write one that like my husband could read or my father could read or my doctor could read. I had doctors writing me saying this book changed my life could please write one that's my patience could read because they're not going to get through this. So why we get fat was relatively easy um maybe a year of writing there wasn't a lot of new research on it. If the sugar book was um probably well again that was research that was done from sort of 2008 on word but maybe in total three years of work um the case for keto was a book I probably could have written without any research at all but that concept made me very nervous. I'm that I've been reviewing 120 odd physicians and another 20 or so dietitians and nutritions and chiropractors who had sort of shifted to my way of thinking so I could benefit from how they thought about it because they were doctors like you know they did treat patients and so they would have a different than in many ways of better perspective so that was probably a year and a half to two years total and then the diabetes book was another three years but again always built on as I say in the diabetes book I'm unpacking subjects that I might have touched on in a single paragraph and good calories bad calories but this or before dance or treatment. The cool thing about the diabetes book well all of this work you're the advantage I had of anyone who came so the people were challenging conventional wisdom before me were just died they were basically physicians who were trying to get their patients to lose weight and they weren't making any progress with the conventional wisdom and then stumbled on carbohydrate restriction or atkins or protein power sugar busters whatever you want to call and and realize that that worked for their patients and it worked usually for them so they wrote diet books um I was the first journalist to really delve into it and I came along at a time where the internet made it possible to find virtually all of the relevant literature so back between when I was doing good calories bad calories 2002 to 2007 I had um they she undergraduates that I had hired in New York and Boston and Los Angeles and their jobs were basically to get an email for me with 50 references I needed and then they would go to their local medical school and they'd have to you know get the pull the books and zero oxid and then they'd send me a box with however many of the 50 references they could get and I had filing cabinets and I kept filing new filing cabinets and um so I was able to do in five years what would have taken 30 or 40 years previously because it would have required me sitting in medical school libraries with my stack of quarters or my you know card I had bought and now I could get all of that in five years today you can download it all.

Well you found some things that I was very surprised at and I think is often difficult to find just diving into some of the content of your rethinking diabetes you talk a lot about the history the history of how diabetes was treated the first person that was given insulin this farmer and then just getting the historical perspective I think can be challenging but I would love for you you know to just help us understand a little bit of the history you talk also about um this letters to rollo and this idea of this animal based diet that was seen by patients and you know just things that are probably at that time very unusual so if you have a moment I would love a little quick history lesson that again people should certainly pick up your book and read it because it's extraordinarily well written but there's some interesting historical perspectives in here yeah so I mean the question one question why would you do this today 2024 why bother with the history and so I'm trying to answer I have a bias going into this right because already I'm pretty convinced that that ketogenic diets are can put type 2 diabetes into remission so that's a pretty remarkable observation that's not getting enough attention by the medical community so that that's my bias going in but simultaneously you want to understand like certain points in time when things happen so friends in 1971 the American nutrition the American diabetes association puts out their first dietary guidelines and they recommend that patients with diabetes get more than half of their calories from the one map or nutrient carbohydrates so they can metabolize safely without pharmaceutical health so they can need protein to some extent they can eat all the fat they want and they'll be fine but as soon as they take eat carbs they have to take drugs and I don't actually think the American diabetes association was trying to sell drug but I want to understand what their mentality was and so you have to look at the data they cite and then go back in time so you pull those references so I'll cite this study and that study and you pull those references and those references may or may not support with the ADA saying but those references also have references and they're so you just keep going back and back and time through these references and eventually you get to 1797 which is crazy which was a very first successful the very first time of physician successfully treated a case of diabetes so back in the 19th and much of the 20th century the 19th century in the 18th century when diabetes would only appear when people were very far along in the disease state so you know today we're going to diagnose it based on your hemoglobin A1C or your blood sugar level and you may have zero symptoms but they didn't do that prior to the 1970s so do you either get a diagnosed when you went to the doctor and they did a urine test and so you had sugar in your urine or you were manifesting the symptoms of the disease or hungrile the time your thirst you all the time you're losing weight you might be emaciated you might be you know weak and unable to actually walk and then you'd shop in the doctors and this British army colonel Meredith shows up to see this British army doctor John Rallow and Rallow decides that their sugar in the urine may be Meredith this is the only the second case of diabetes he's seen in 20 years the disease was that rare so it decides maybe Meredith can metabolize the carbohydrates in the diet he just thinks him is the plant food that he's eating so he puts him on a non-plan food diet they called it the animal diet back when Rallow did it was fatty rancid meat blood sugar I got it just disgusting disgusting but Meredith got better and as long as he stopped to the diet he stayed better so Rallow right up Meredith's case he also treats another a general who also gets better on the diet by that time he had dropped the rancid meat and was just gone through fatty meat so no starch is no brains no sugars very little alcohol basically a ketogenic diet although they're not calling it that and Rallow writes up his case study and he distributes to this pamphlet to physicians throughout the United Kingdom and nowadays thanks to Google books you can get the pamphlet you don't have to take anyone else's word for you could download it and read it and they did multiple additions because when he distributory said look this diet seems to do wonders for diabetes we never thought this was curable before can you try it on your patients it's like beta testing and tell me what happened right me back and let me know what happens and a couple dozen physicians from around the UK right and back and for the most part people stick to the diet the diabetes gets better or goes into remission and Rallow publishes subsequent additions that you can download from Google books reporting on what these doctors said and then through the 19th century this becomes what we would call today the standard of care so diabetes is still a very rare disease the physicians are kind of aware there's two different types there's a acute kind that tends to hit children what we would call type one today that kills quickly by the time their diagnosis that's pretty much a death sentence and then there's the chronic form that dissociates with age and obesity what we would call type two that could be put into remission by this animal diet and the type one could be slowed down it kids would still die pretty quickly but they would die slower if they did meet carbohydrates and when I say standard of care every major diabetes specialist in the US and Europe and again there's only a half dozen of them when they're writing about this this is a diet they're telling their patients to be honest you know like a British Frederick Pobby the leading British diabetes specialist says you know he gets his patients on these diets after a month or two they like eating this way better than they did anything else and they could healthy this Italian and Contani used a lock his patients up for three however long it took to make sure they didn't eat any you know fruits bread, grains, starches and only this fatty meat and green vegetables a Frenchman you know being French had a said look you could cook the green vegetables in butter and it makes everything much more palatable the Germans were by and and by the end of the 19th century because they're often dealing with patients with type one and not differentiating they got these kids coming in or amaciated you want to fatten them up right that was the assumption we want to put weight back on these people so that they'll have more strength and health so we should give them as much calories as possible and we can give them carbs and by 18, 60s they know that some 60% of the amino acids and protein gets converted to glucose so the body needs doesn't respond well to that with diabetes so let's give them as much fat as possible and now they're putting their patients on basically they're eating butter and heavy cream and it's you know it's atkins to the end of the gray and the patients are for the most part thriving not the type one patients but the type two and then skipping one period where they decide starvation is the best way to go thanks to a misconceived Harvard doctor and by the way the reason I don't mention my Harvard degree and my Stanford degree in the is because when you spend your whole life saying don't listen to authority figures yeah I don't want to try and convince anyone that I know what I'm talking about because I went to Harvard or Stanford right and sort of especially when I know what bad science they've done in both those. Can you? Is it putting you on the spot to mention that because with that people I mean I'm sure that you've spoken about it but quite frankly I'm often surprised by certain pieces of literature that come out of the Ivy League just absolutely floored. The Harvard School of Public Health and this is an issue we could get into because it's right in the meat versus plant the bait. The Harvard School of Public Health pioneered the field of nutritional epidemiology prior to the nurse's health study at Harvard which was started as a test of oral contraceptives and cancer and then was transitioned by this guy Walter Willard into an nutritional study nobody had written on that title. In his literature and I have seen him speak often. You know he's an interesting character. We are weirdly to his credit. We've co-authored articles together even though I had a front page New York Times magazine that covers story that criticized his works specifically but anyway the point is they sort of pioneered the science of nutritional epidemiology and you know you and I know that what these studies do is identify associations between foods and diseases but the associations are only can only generate hypotheses but the reason they do those studies is because they want to establish the cause so they want them to imply causeality and the longer the studies go and the more they built their career on this the more they feel confident because they've been telling people the same thing for decades so people have started to believe it they believe it's true and then they kind of in their whole career gets invested in this one type of experiment the non-experimental and non-experiment as opposed to taking the epidemiology, taking the hypothesis and testing it against a randomized control trial. Exactly and but the problem is when they've done that the randomized control trials very rarely support their hypothesis so then they have to decide it's you get trapped you can just as you can get trapped into belief system you can get trapped into a sort of experimental methodology or a scientific methodology then is that why not interrupt you but is that what you mean by pathological science pathological science so that term coined by another Nobel laureate chemist named Irving Langmere is the science of things that aren't so and one of the themes there always I mean it means that you're misinterpreting something you say so you're seeing something that has a mundane explanation and you're assuming and then disseminating the the idea that you've discovered something novel and interesting about the universe and it's always based on ultimately misinterpretation of what your scientific method technique can do I mean it's funny one and this is where my history comes and when I was writing about the high-end physics and living at Sarn the physics lab so they have this Adam smasher which is this huge ring that circulates in that case protons and anti-proteons and then smashes them together at certain points on the ring and at those points where they collide you build these they're called detectors but they're like mansion size cameras and so these particles collide and they throw out the shower of debris and these detectors capture the debris so what kind of particles came out how fast were they going what was their momentum in this direction in that direction ideally you see everything that's like you imagine smashing cars together and then having a box around the cars it's as well the part of a fender went off here and a part of the light went off there and the body part went this way and the body part weighed seven pounds and the fender weighed 2.3 pounds um you got to know if what you detect or is telling you is what's really happening so you have to be able to calibrate your equipment that's like rule number one that no bellory at I wrote about who was a brilliant guy even as he got so many things wrong you used to say you got to know if you said it at zero are you really seeing zero or are you it's like you get on a scale right in the morning and you're way four pounds more than you thought you did to the first thing you do is you you calibrate the scale you do get off the scale and you see if it reads zero when you're not standing on it and if it doesn't then you would just a little knob or whatever the electronic scales have and then you get back on and hope that your four pounds are going to go away but they're absolutely crucial thing is knowing that when you're not on it it's showing zero because if it's showing something in nutritional epidemiology the detectors are these cohorts of people so 130,000 nurses and the nurses health study 30,000 of them get diet surveys and every year or two years or four years you have them so out the surveys about what they're eating and then you get their medical reports about their disease states and then you're doing these associations but the idea is thank you to inside tracker for sponsoring this episode of the show blood work is important guys we can exercise eat right but you gotta know if you're being effective and this is why I love inside tracker inside tracker allows you to get data on a whole host of individual biomarkers from your blood it provides a personalized plan to improve your metabolism improve sleep it is also created by leading scientists in aging genetics biometrics it analyzes your blood DNA and fitness tracking data not too shabby if you ask me here is the thing again you're doing all the things right but you do need to take the time to get your blood worked on and analyze what is going on inside also inside tracker is offering inside tracker pro which enables coaches and health professionals to provide premium and personalized services by leveraging inside trackers analysis and recommendations with their clients so please go to inside tracker.com slash doctor lion that's inside tracker.com slash doctor lion for 20% off. How do you calibrate that detector so the nurses and the surveys and it's all this the equivalent of the physics detector looking at the collisions and how do you know if you said it is zero that it's really zero and they can't do that they've never been able to do it there's no way to do it that's why you do randomized control trials because then you could take all these other possible explanations for why when you step on the scale it shows or when you're not on the scale it shows a pound get rid of all that so anyway getting back to Harvard the Harvard people just that was their career that was they made them famous that's how wide water will it is the most highly cited scientist in nutrition it's why you become head of your department and you get awards and you speak everywhere and it's why we're so familiar with them but if it's built on a fundamental misconception about what is the detector can do he's what does he do about that knowledge you know how many of us can say you asked earlier if I change my opinion let's say I was definitively wrong and I could tell you about the thing I believe and I often he because I say I'll never change my mind on this people say well that proves how it's his bias and I would say proves how it's honest which is the most important thing because all of us are biased anyway the the you invest your whole life on this and then it turns out to be you were wrong not only we wrong everything you wrote it's meaningless that's the implication if that were the case then I'm just hoping an individual would course correct that you can build your career on something but there it seems as if to now begin to do randomized control trial say for example not right an Ivy League group believed that the plant based diet was going to move health and wellness forward then they would do a randomized control trial yes it would be very expensive but maybe we choose a handful of health markers that are meaningful and we execute on that and so then that way there would be proof of a hypothesis or at least even if the study isn't highly powered maybe it's a small study at least it begins to prove a concept or un-proved a concept and yeah that's what I argue and that's why I co-founded Lucy with my former buddy Peter Ritea but there is you know these people they're not clinical trialists so that's a different skill and there there are epidemiologists so that that's one problem they don't do these kind of studies they should certainly argue for them to be done but as I said never case where they have been done and when they did this in the past the studies failed to confirm they hypothesists generated by their associations so they were stuck in this position do we believe the studies or do we believe what we've been doing our whole lives and like most people they decided to believe that what they were doing their whole lives is right and so these studies can't be trusted and there are reasons always to distrust as I said in the beginning most of what was done in science is wrong so maybe these studies were wrong so it's just it's this terrible place to be and I feel for them my first book Bad Science about cold fusion and these two professors at the university of Utah who claim this remarkable discovery and they destroyed their lives and we're saying they could ever happen to them and then the rest of their lives they had to pretend that they believed it because there was only way they could save what they thought of as their dignity the reality is a scientist you should be able to say look I was wrong I admitted but when it's your whole life well I don't know so I don't know if you know this but my long time mentor is Dr. Donald Laman I don't know if you knew that but he's trained me okay so he's he of course knows you he trained me for 20 years my recent book is dedicated to him from all of the things that he has taught me and continues to teach me and he will always say that there has to be intellectual integrity to the the the best of an individual's capacity and there are many studies that he has done where he said well this just doesn't show what we were hoping it was going to show but that doesn't mean that it was ignored he's pretty strict on that and you know just looking at the history of your your book it seems as if there's been so many ups and downs where there was a lot of evidence for what looks like a carbohydrate restricted diet but that was often ignored you know I would love to ask you is there a turning point in history that from writing this book from this historical perspective that you think perhaps we could have gone a different short a different way maybe it was the the next iteration of the dietary guidelines is was there a turning point that you you feel like because of the injection of either researchers or funding or politics that we went the wrong way well there were a lot of turning points I used to joke that could never write this but for instance it the obesity epidemic was caused by Hitler because the German Austrian research community had come to believe that obesity was not an energy balance problem it was a constitutional sort of neural hormonal disorder so people are born pre-disposed to come obese and they don't get that way just by eating too much or exercise into little and then in 1930 this American guy named Louis Newbar from the University of Michigan came along it said oh no no I proved it's all about eating too much here is my six studies and he said it definitively and dogmaticly and by that time the German and Austrian community was already beginning to evaporate under the emergence of the Nazi party and with the second world war that evaporated completely and the German language medical literature which had been German had been the lingua franca of medical science until World War II if you wanted to do cutting-edge medical science you had to be able to read German and ideally you spoke German and you had gone to Germany or Austria to work with these great scientists and their institutions which we had none of those in the United States oh a couple of them anyway so this whole idea of obesity is a constitutional disorder and people are pre-ordained to put just like an elephant is pre-ordained to be fatter than a giraffe some humans are pre-ordained to put on excess body fat and there may be very little they can do about it but if you believe that obesity is caused by eating too much you tell them to eat less and exercise or you say that diet that works is the one that gets them to eat less and then you give them the wrong advice and you go from there so it's sort of that if that had never happened World War II had never happened if the Nazis had not emerged then many of these researchers were Jewish so they were you know either had to stop researching or they came to the US where they got like minor positions because nobody wanted to deal with these Jewish academics unless they were physicists and could help them build a bomb if that hadn't happened that's the first place it goes around the second place and wait before before you continue I want to read a passage from your book because I really loved what you said and basically what he had said was all obesity is simple obesity and he talks about how I just had it here it was so good it was basically something like emotional intolerance perverted appetite he called it and so not by a constitutional or endocrine disorder there is no specific metabolic abnormality in obesity yeah no it's um I mean that's what people wanted here basically we all had this we had a preconception of what makes people fat doctors had it researchers had it's like all it takes is to see one character like Shakespeare's fall staff sitting in a restaurant eating a lot of food and you know that he got fat because he ate so much food and we don't tend to think our brains don't tend to reverse causality very easily we don't think well maybe he's eating that much and he's that hungry because his body is trying to get fat we just see the the obvious so and yeah this one guy knew Burke basically and what's fascinating and this is going to be in the next book and it's probably going to bore people senseless but um as you watch the 20s and 30s is it progresses and like you say now if you get virtually every study published from both German and English and I could use chat GPT God love it to translate the German I mean it's crazy what we have access to now in 2024 and you could see how people were influenced not just by new works work but by their misinterpretation of earlier work or the for instance the addition they cited of a particular textbooks and one of the most influential people in this field was a German pediatrician named held a brock who did these studies of obese kids in their families famous studies and she interpreted what she saw as these kids getting fat because their parents are overfeeding their mothers are overprotective and overfeeding them and she knew there was an alternative way to think about it the kids are pre-ordained to get fat and that it screwed up the mothers couldn't stop it so that screwed up their relationship and how the mothers treated the children and she wrote about that but then she cited these papers his textbook chapter saying that obesity's caused by eating too much and that was at 1926 German textbooks she probably brought it with her when she fled Germany in 1933 and moved first to Boston and then to New York but there was a new addition of the textbook might have been available only in Germany that had completely switched from eating too much to constitutional hormonal disorder who had that newer addition which was already eight years old she interprets her data differently she interprets her data differently everyone who comes after interprets their data differently it was all based on her and this guy Newberg and then the first guy to write about these animal experiments it was like crazy so this kind of brings me sorry sorry to interruptors a little bit of the delay it it makes me wonder clearly there is dynamic personalities and historically dynamic personalities that make bold claims that then generate whether it's standard of care or lack of standard of care what challenges I guess this is a two part to the question what challenges are barriers do you anticipate and reshaping the narrative around this diabetic parameda or narrative because clearly from your book you believe and there is evidence for carbohydrate restriction so number one what barriers do you think we're up against and number two for the healthcare providers for the professionals for the individuals who are just lay public listening to this how can they contribute to this paradigm shift I think I'm buying my book and give it to their doctors not that they shouldn't read it themselves but it's like I said it's more a medical history than it is certainly not a self-help book the um okay so let me give you go mad it's a bad habit I am gonna give it a little bit of history again just there two ways so until 1921 with the discovery of insulin the only lever that physicians could pull with their patients to control their blood sugar with dietary you want to key and they didn't measure blood sugar but you want to keep them healthy tell them look you can't metabolize these foods don't eat them and if you don't eat them you will manifest symptoms of the disease and you'll be relatively fine and then you get a drug therapy insulin it's as extraordinarily powerful drug it's so powerful the lowers blood sugar so easily that now you have to tell people to start eating carbohydrates to protect them from the drug therapy which will kill them otherwise so they call it insulin shock or insulin overdose which was basically hypoglycemic episodes low blood sugar that could kill people so beginning in 1921 you start you take the one food that they you would tell people not to eat and now you tell them they have to eat it and doctors find out that the more and more they eat it the more they could give them more and more insulin and they'll be kind of happy or and I have no idea the long term risk of benefits but in the short term particularly with kids if you let them eat whatever they want give them the drug so since 1922 that's basically been our philosophy use drug therapy to control the disease symptoms and pay lip service to diet and the alternative has always been look this is a disorder where you cannot metabolize carbohydrates that you're consuming without drug therapy if you don't eat the carbs you don't need the drug therapy okay pretty simple concept the way was phrased to me I was in capsid it was interviewing myself this chef turned journalist um in transcaced he interviewed me first about my sugar book and then he said by the way type one diabetes myself and I said oh well I'm doing a book on diabetes I would like to interview you for that so I did yeah so he described he's when he was diagnosed in 2017 he was 36 years old and when you diagnose particularly with type one diabetes suddenly you're like thrust into disease land like you may never have thought about this is easing your life and less some relative or friend had it now you've got to learn everything about it as fast as you can and you have no preconceptions so his doctor explains whom look you know you don't make enough insulin your pink race is going to run out of insulin and you need the insulin to metabolize these carbohydrates without him your blood sugar will be too high and you have all these chronic complications so we wanted to continue eating the carbohydrates but you can eat you know and measure the amount that every meal and snack and then we can dose the insulin to that and yeah and then we're going to get a diabetes educator teach you all about this and he says to the doctor wait a minute what you're telling me is that because of this disease carbohydrates are not toxic to me and in someone as he antidote and you want me to eat the toxin and take the antidote why don't I just not eat the toxin and the doctor is like stunned by this he's never thought about that and then he starts giving all kinds of morale that's really hard to do you're never going to be able to keep it up nobody complies but that's always been this sort of alternative therapy this is a disorder that only manifests itself in response to the carbohydrates in the diet we don't need the carbohydrates we know from the last 20 years a clinical trials and not eating them is safe it's not the healthiest way to eat depending on how you want to interpret those trials and we now know that if patients with type 2 diabetes don't eat the carbohydrates they will most of them will go into remission and not need drugs so why don't we at least tell patients that that's a viable option and in order to do that we need the doctor's to understand that so that's gets back to your question the challenge and the reason I wrote this book is to get the physicians and the diabetes educators and the diabetes associations to rethink the type of rethinking diabetes they look a lot of people are just going to want drugs we all love a good drug you know but if given the choice between being on you think okay I'm going to start with one drug with the other message you get is this is a chronic progressive disease it's going to get worse so people start with one drug which used to be called monotherapy and 10 years are going to be on two or three drugs if their blood pressure goes up they're going to be on blood pressure lowering drugs if their LDL goes up or even if it doesn't they're going to be on statins they've gained weight they're going to be NGOP1 and Hagenus they're a lot of people and they all these drugs have side effects and complications you know so maybe some people just want to do the naughty the carbohydrate thing which means they're basically on a ketogenic diet or a carnivore diet or you know you can do it as a vegan diet a difficult and being healthy is a better option than slowing the progression of the disease and if I can get the physician community to understand that then they have to do their homework they have to go down the rabbit hole and understand these diets and now there's you know a gazillion books people are written them that'll help them understand that and then when they're next patient is diagnosed they could say we have these two options it conventional way the ADA way is well hopefully the ADA we say you know we're going to give you this drug and we're going to ask you to control your carbon take and this other option is you're going to do this keto thing not eat the carbs and you're probably lose 50 pounds and be feel better and we won't ever have we may never have to go to drug therapy and then let the patients decide but the doctors have to be able to give them informed advice I'd like to take a moment and thank one of the sponsors of the show first form if you are not eating your fruits and vegetables then you should definitely try opti greens 50 opti greens 50 is packed with 50 hand chosen ingredients to help support gut health it is a blend of natural fruits and vegetables and grasses to maximize the nutrients you get in every scoop some people don't like to eat a bunch of fruits and vegetables even though there is a lot of data out there that having fruits and vegetables in your diet can be very beneficial opti greens 50 includes a low temperature process 100% organic grasses non GMO non synthetic botanical superfoods I hate to use that term but it's as close as you're going to get if I don't nutrients digestive enzymes post biotic probiotic opti greens 50 blend is amazing you can get yours please go to first form dot com slash doctor lion that's first form dot com slash doctor lion and that's tough because again just the nature of medical care is not I say it's not treatment based but it's not it's not root cause based I guess it's a it's a better way to put it it's there's an issue what's a fastest way to treatment in an ideal world what you would like to see is and I'm just putting words in your mouth is that you would see a carbohydrate restricted diet and you said there's many ways to make it work whether it's keto carnivore vegan if they could do it with low carbohydrate which seems pretty challenging but in an ideal world this would be an option is basically what I'm hearing you say and that we need to get healthcare providers we need to get wise consumers and individuals that because 100% of people eat and getting it done in that yeah and that's I mean none of this every time is in a drug it makes it harder to get this message across but the drugs are always treating symptoms we have non-vented the drug yet that cures this disease or cures obesity um yeah it's just we and it kind of be tested by the way I mean Verta health and San Francisco let's go and look at it what I think is a pretty compelling trial showing that this diet can put diabetes and formation it didn't show whether it was better than any other diet but it did show that this one works and works in a way that nobody actually ever thought was possible so yeah that's that's the challenge now is and that's what the book was written to try and to help not belong because I recognize I'm not going to get rid of skepticism even the one percent or zero point one percent of physicians who would make the effort to read a book like mine when they're done are not going it's not going to remove their skepticism but hopefully they will say to themselves this is interesting like let me try it I think I remember giving a talk to a Cleveland clinic conference so I was at their Las Vegas base and um I was talking right after lunch and I ate before my talk and then I got to watch all the cardiologists at the meeting walk up to get the very nice lunch that was all you know salmon and skinless chicken breasts and vegetables and and I was watching them walk out and they definitely looked like the sort of typical distribution of overweight no obesity among the public has significant amount of them or struggling and try it yourself learn what you can about it understand that enough that you could communicate I mean the problem is if you're seeing a page for 15 minutes it's easier to write a prescription take this drug I'll see you in a month move on to the next patient that's always going to be a problem but then we have diabetes educators um the nutritionists and dietitians um I mean it's crazy because this way of eating is now had more clinical trials testing it than any diet and history and even the American diabetes association agrees it's better tested and more effective than any other diet that they promote so they they're coming around as slowly as humanly possible because not especially a health association doesn't want to say oh by the way we made a mistake or phrase anything in such a way that somebody else might go away to them and it's entirely different from what you were saying thin years ago um but uh I mean we'll see what happens you know well you've done a lot of great work in the world and and I have to say one of the things that I'm most grateful for is you're willing to step up and challenge I'm sure that that always that that may not be easy and you certainly have to get extremely thick skin but you're willing to do it for a greater purpose well thank you it um it's just way why do all this work I mean this is what everybody does this right you do the work and you come up with the idea and then you get the appointment and nobody's listening to me so then you go out there and try to get them to listen I was lucky because I did have very um powerful soap boxes in the beginning of my career so when I wrote something or spoke it you know people paid attention but um it's important that's the other thing it's like it would be great if all we cared about was keeping you know 30 40 year old athletes healthy as long as humanly possible but I it's not really what my interest is my interest is in helping all these people who are not healthy become healthy and that's a different you know there we have all these obstacles on our way which include unfortunately the health of those stations yeah which is wild what would be your advice to individuals who just trying to find a way of eating so they're certainly going to read your book but what other advice would you give them are their red flags that they should look out for in the general health landscape or providers well I think here's where context is so important so I mean if you're young and healthy and I am assuming for instance if I never went on this crazy low-fat diet on in the 90s when I was also getting a significant proportion of my calories from sugar because of either fruit or fruit juice or smoothies all of which I thought were benign and there was a parent in my life when I thought wouldn't be a great idea to open a job but juice you know franchise in New York I had been living at job and then you realize later that these things are all different ways of sort of maximizing your sugar content of your diet but I think if young men and women you know the generic conception of what a healthy diet is isn't bad and will keep many people healthy you know they they can tolerate it so the cold fruits vegetables whole grains I don't go for the low-fat part of it but other than that you know legumes if that's your thing then and it's working keep doing it then if it if it starts to go right if you start developing metabolic disorders then the hope is you fix your diet which means going more you know lower and lower and carbohydrates and the carbohydrates you do consume have to be slower and slower using Tim Ferriss's term you know and if it's becomes a real problem then it's they basically keto minimizing insulin is the way to solve it so it's um but it's all context dependent for me to tell a 25-year-old marathon or that you should eat ketogenic diet I mean I could do it but why why should it right but if that you know the world is full of people who ate these healthy diets unlike Peter or Teo was one and Sammy Incan and the founder murderer other who were like fanatic or athletes in extraordinary shape who became you know Peter famously gained 30 pounds on this diet and Sammy Incan and became pre-diabetic despite working out hours and hours and hours a day so at some point when it gets there food is a level you're going to have to pull more exercises going to solve a different exercise going to solve but I do see the benefit of you know um working out like I said and building muscle and having muscle and staying active but at some point I think you know we all like I worked out you know it was in Sammy Peter level but I worked out an hour and day it was a writer that was my social life right when you live in Los Angeles you go to the gym where you run on the beach you know those are your options there's no literary life the partake of so it's not like we're strolling down boulevard as you wouldn't pair us so but it didn't stop and I was eating what I thought was a very healthy diet and it didn't stop me from gaining weight and I'm sure I was probably pre-diabetic or some such I didn't never checked up so well very very impressive repertoire of writing thank you so much for spending time chatting and your new book you have many books rethinking diabetes we will link it here I'm really grateful for the work you do and I'm grateful that you challenged the way conventional thinking is done and hopefully conventional practice thank you again for having me
