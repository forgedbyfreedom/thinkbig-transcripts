You are in the business, yet making sex better. How does a woman or a man introduce herself? I would discourage people from being too focused on touch and where you're touching and how. More focused on who you are in the bedroom, how often should a person have sex. So this is such a great question because people argue about this all the time. Women can feel pressure to have an orgasm like during sex. But what is interesting is there's little pieces of research here and there that talk about things like her anatomy affects how likely she is to have an orgasm during sex. I never heard that. Yeah. Women also will often find it almost intrusive to be touched before they're turned on. God, guys, yes. Every man needs to understand this. Yes, they do. But people are having less sex, but they're masturbating more. One thing that people don't realize is they find that their orgasms when masturbating are better. If you're masturbating, you know what you're feeling. You know what exactly how to change your touch or modify speed and intensity to have the best orgasm. Does that make sense? Yeah, okay. I mean, I'm just still stuck on female erections. Right. Their guys listen to this are going to be like, we even have erections. And the women listening are watching this are going, wait, I do have erections. How does a woman or a man improve their sex life? People get off track with that and that they think, well, there must be some other way to touch. Or there must be some other activity to do in the bedroom. That's really going to make the difference. Really the difference lies within us. It's an internal difference. So what I would suggest to people is why trying something new, which is what you always see in the magazines. There's nothing wrong with that. That's great advice. But the more important thing is to recognize who you are in the bedroom, what you're bringing to the situation. And it's going to involve being focused. So where is your attention? So that's one point. Becoming a better lover is about bringing your attention into your body. We call that embodiment. So that's one very important piece of the puzzle. Also, as important is what sort of personality you bring into the bedroom? And I would suggest that it's very helpful for people to develop a few different kind of sexual personas so that they can keep their sex life interesting over time. So what I tell my patients and I think it can be difficult to learn, but after people learn it, it really works. Is there a decrease, for example, in overall women's orgasms, men's orgasms now versus what we've been seeing in the past? People are having less sex, but they're masturbating more for the most part. So if we're talking about frequency, I would say no real decrease because people are taking matters into their own hands more. So there's so many inappropriate jokes that we're going to be making. I promise we're not going to have to swear, so if there's children around, you may or may not want to turn this off. One thing that people don't realize is for the most part, they find that their orgasms when masturbating are better. And people worry about that. Like why is this? What's wrong with my sex life if my orgasms are better alone? And of course not everyone will agree with that. But it's simply the fact that if you're masturbating, you know what you're feeling. You know what exactly how to change your touch or modify speed intensity to have the best orgasm. So with the exception of new relationships when people are generally so excited that anything works really well, over time people find that masturbation can be more sexually stimulating. How often should a person have sex? What is a normal kid? Well first of all we know there's a wide variety of what people find comfortable. 15% of people, um, orgasm at least once a day. Male or female. More male than female, but this statistic comes from a group of both, but that's more likely to be male. So of adults, 15% of adults, orgasm at least once a day. Among college students, 40% of males and about 4% of females, orgasm once a day. Why such a huge difference in number? In percentage. What we know is that in just about every aspect of sexuality, guys do it more, you know? So it whether it be fantasy or masturbation or engage in a fetish or desire for sex or interest in sexual creativity or willingness to pay for sex. I mean it goes on and on. Men are just more engaged sexually in all of these ways than women. Now it is common for people in our culture to say yes well women were, you know, sort of trained not to like sex. So for example, particularly religious environments, they sort of discourage women from being sexual at least at a young age. That sort of thing. But the real truth overall is that there are some very real differences between male and female sexuality that we tend to ignore in this culture, but I think they're super important for us to understand if we're trying to create a satisfying sex life with our partner. These differences are critical to understand. So how can a man please his partner? Is it a G spot understanding? Right. So I would say the G spot is one of those examples where we get over focused on the body and under focused on who we are in the bedroom. Some women feel like they have a G spot. Other women don't really feel like they have that. I would discourage people in general from being too focused on touch and where you're touching and how. More focused on who you are in the bedroom. I want to give you an example of a homework I give my patients. It really works, okay. I suggest to them that they find a piece of music that they would dance to at a wedding, like so romantic and they find a piece of music that they would enjoy in a jazz club on a Saturday night and they find a piece of music that's really kind of hard and angry. All right. And then they practice on their own, like lock the door and practice with each of these pieces of music, how their body would move to that music. And people can feel kind of silly when they're doing that. I would be very embarrassed and we have cameras all over our house. Right. So yeah. So maybe go to a hotel room for a night. I'm just I'm being totally honest and straightforward. But what happens is people learn how their body can bring a different energy into the bedroom. And if a man wants to please his partner, the chances of him engaging her are so much greater. If he can sometimes bring a real intense personality and he can sometimes bring a really sensual personality and sometimes bring a really loving personality. So he can like gear how that experience goes based on his persona and he can put music on to help. But he will see that his the way he looks at her based on these moods, the way his body moves. I'm going to argue that he's going to find a huge improvement in his sexual experience with her because he can open her in each of these ways and it's a different experience. So I think another important point here is that stress closes us and we're also stressed. Is that why people have less sex now? You said that people are having less sex now. I think that's a very important reason. I think there are a variety of reasons but that's one. So you can't have good sex from this place. If you just looked on your phone, you got yourself agitated. Is that true? I think men men are able to and again I talk to I hear from number one, we have a medical practice. And I hear from female patients and male patients all the time. That for guys it's a bit of a stress release and for women they go, oh god. I have just spent my entire day working doing everything and now you're in a sex. So that is absolutely correct. What I say to my patients is for a woman even though she enjoys sex. Having sex is often like gathering information for going to for a run. You love exercise, you love going for a run. But you're not going to spontaneously go for a run probably. You had 11 o'clock at night when you've just finished dinner in the dish. It's like going for a run. There's no pleasure in a run at 11 o'clock at night. It's that same thing. But for a guy it doesn't require that level of energy. So he's fed by that at 11 p.m. or whatever. Sex feeds him for her more than likely. She feels like she has to gather energy to enjoy herself. It doesn't mean she doesn't enjoy herself. It just means that it requires something to give.

Is are there things that are biological in humans? For example, let's say, I don't know, woman strokes him and his penis. He probably is going to get an erection. Right. He doesn't have to do anything. He could probably be watching puppies jump over ladders or fences and you'll probably get an erection. Fair enough, he's there. The equivalent to that for a woman. I would say no. And women have erectile tissue just like guys except that much of her erectile tissue is hidden under skin. So the clitoris, the part that we can see is very small compared to the amount of that erectile tissue that's in her body, but it's under the skin. So first of all, it's going to be more challenging for her to have an orgasm probably because it's just sort of like trying to touch that tissue is like if we were massaging a man who was wearing five condoms. It's not going to be a stimulating, right? So the skin serves that buffer. So you have to approach her body. I think does that make sense? Yeah. Okay. I mean, I'm just still stuck on female erections. Right. I mean, this is stuff you talk about every day, but the guys listening to this are going wait. Like women have erections and the women listening or watching this are going wait, I do have erections. Yeah, erectile tissue. Not necessarily translated to you. But again, I don't actually know this answer. Can the clitoris become a rares? Yes. Okay. Yes. Yes. So what, for talking to heterosexual couple, he will do well to remember that it's a more challenging for her to have an orgasm just because so much of that tissue is hidden. So again, if you approach it like how would I feel as a man if I was wearing five condoms, you know, would it be harder to have an orgasm? Yes. Okay. So women also will often find it almost intrusive to be touched before they're turned on. God, guys, yes. Yes. Oh, please say that again. Every man needs to understand this. Yes, they do. So touch before she's ready feels intrusive. Yes. She needs a lot of build up before touch feels pleasurable. And unfortunately, when people cut out like things like foreplay or any kind of sensual sexual dance before sex, she hasn't had the prep time she needs to want that. Now, it's different at the beginning of a relationship because she's sort of been prepping constantly because she's just turned on. She's got a new partner. She's excited. So what people learn in that first year of a relationship is wow, my partner excites me so much. I don't even need foreplay. I'm just already ready, right? And guys will say that about their, their women. She's already wet. Can we say that? Yeah, I can say yes. Okay. We've officially prep people prior. Are we really talking about it? Okay. That's who they expect their partner to be sexually as a relationship ages. It's not. That's what happens at the beginning of a relationship. So now, let's say year or two in, she's not just automatically ready anymore. And so there needs to be a process of her getting her body ready. So that touch feels good. And so I encourage women to play a role in that, like, to kind of stimulate themselves in certain ways before they enter a bedroom. But he needs to recognize, again, if we're talking about heterosexual relationships, he needs to recognize that he's got to start slow. Like he can start by rubbing her arm or her chest. But not her breast yet, not even her nipples yet. Like give her time. Rub her vagina. Do not go straight in. Do not. It feels, it feels intrusive. It feels intrusive. And so the problem that some people run into is then they think, okay, well, I'll give her a massage first and then we'll have sex. Well, she's tired and you give her a massage. She's falling asleep. So that's really not the answer. You have to find this happy medium between, like, too much relaxation and enough to get her interested. So like inner thighs are a great way to start. I would say start with her panty zone. So she's not thinking she's about to get touched and she can relax. Okay, if she's completely nude and you're playing with her inner thighs, she's waiting any moment for her to for you to touch her clitoris and she's not ready, right? But if her panty is around and you're touching her inner thighs, she can kind of relax into that. That's what you want. So if she's like relaxed into that, when you move into her breasts or nipples or genitals, she's ready. Pretty sure you just solved 50% of all relationship problems right now, incredible advice, truly incredible advice. And as a culture, we don't talk about this stuff and we don't think about it. No, it's all about, I mean, the topic of porn and sex and AI, which we're going to get to, I think, is really starting to emerge. But how to pleasure a woman and to understand the steps is not, we don't really talk about it. We don't talk about it and where people are learning truly is porn and this is absolutely never, ever, porn doesn't approach this kind of education at all. And what men are trying really hard, I think, to please their partners and their very frustrated because all they know is what works for them and what guys they have to remember is what works for them is probably not what works for her. That doesn't mean he's doing something wrong. It doesn't mean she's doing something wrong. We're just different sexual animals. And so we just have to understand those differences. So he thinks when he walks by his woman and he grabs her breast, she's going to think that's fun because if she were to walk by him, I'm sure for that. Right? Yeah. If she walks by him and grabs his crotch, he thinks that's fun. So he's trying to do it again. I'm ready for you. Exactly. He's like, let me give her this gift and grab her breath. Is that ineffective for a place strategy? Not at all. I can't tell you how many patients say to me. It is. My God. You know, I'm in the kitchen. I'm getting dinner raised grab my breast. He's grabbing my butt. They hate it. Okay. This is extremely helpful. And, you know, I've got some statistics here that I wanted to share with you because one of the things that I hear is that some people are more or less sensitive. The tissue, whether it's a clitoris or the people that they find that they're less sensitive, what can someone do, what could a female do if she's experiencing that? So if she feels less sensitive, point one is if she used to feel more sensitive, she needs to get her hormones checked. And not just checked because she needs to get her hormones checked by someone who knows because if she goes to a general gynecologist that isn't really well versed in all of this, the chances are that gynecologist is going to say your hormones are fine. And that's all she's going to get. She needs to go to someone in sexual medicine who has an understanding of hormones and how they work in the body because it's not necessarily that her levels are low. They may be just low for her. So that's point one check hormones. Is there, can I talk you really quickly? Is there one particular hormone? Would you say testosterone would be the hormone that seems to have the biggest impact in sensitivity? Gosh, I'm not sure what to say about that. It's going to be estrogen or testosterone, but it could be estrogen. So I wouldn't necessarily, and maybe there's research that I haven't seen on that. Okay, so I'm I'm going to say to you, I'm not positive, but what I am positive about is go to someone who is educated in that so that they can be helpful. So and if people are worried which they shouldn't be, most likely, but if they're worried about systemic effects of hormones and they don't want to take hormones, which you do podcasts about and we treat patients with the clinic. Right. There's so much research out there that shows how healthy hormones can be, but if still if someone's concerned or if she's had breast cancer and she doesn't want to go in hormones, there are hormones that you can apply topically just to your genitals that have very little impact on the rest of your body that can help with sensitivity. I love that. Is that the same for a male? So if a male is experiencing less sensitivity, I would say, what do they do? I would say that's absolutely. So before we leave women, let me say that if she's having a hard time feeling turned on, I would suggest that she tries something like lay a warm wash cloth on her genitals for a few minutes before she enters the bedroom and perhaps that'll bring that's intended to bring more blood flow to her genitals and she may find that helps with sensitivity. She may not, but she could. And another thing of course are sex toys and finding the right sex toy for her because there's so many out there now. So there are sex toys that bring blood into her purse. Yes. Without creating, would it be to not create direct stimulation? When I think of sex toys or sex toy, I typically think of, I don't know, one or two, but there are different kinds that do different things. So many different kinds of two different things. And you can actually find them on any platform that sells stuff. You don't have to go to a sex toy shop anymore at all for these things. But some sex toys, for example, will suction. So they'll bring blood flow to the genitals or blood flow to her clitoris. And for some women, that amplifies sensation. So she could even do that a little bit before she joins her partner. Those are the things I would encourage her to try, but some people, like you said, are just more sensitive than others. And that's just sort of the luck of the draw. You know what else is interesting about women is, women can feel pressure to have an orgasm like during sex. And that's a whole topic we can cover if you want to. But what is interesting is there's little pieces of research here and there that talk about things like her anatomy affects how likely she is to have an orgasm during sex. So, for example, the farther her clitoris is away from her vagina, the harder it's going to be for her to have an orgasm during sex. So it's geography. She has nothing to do with that. And it makes that never hurt that. Yeah. Everyone's getting out of her team. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Is there an ideal placement? I mean, I guess what you're saying is the clitoris is to the vagina. Do we know that an X centimeter, X millimeter that she's less likely? I think it's going to depend on the partners together and how they fit. So no, we don't. And I don't think we're ever going to have that. But the bottom line is the closer her clitoris is to her vagina. But more likely it's going to be stimulated during thrusting. And there you have it. There's a lot of confusion about protein. What kind, how much and what? This episode is brought to you by Body Health. And we're going to talk about what the science shows. Total daily protein intake is the foundation for building and maintaining muscle. But factors like amino acid profile and how quickly those amino acids are delivered and influence how efficiently your body uses that protein. Her body breaks down protein into amino acids and then rebuilds new proteins into muscle bone and other tissues, the body requires nine essential amino acids. And each due a different thing and that's where perfect amino acid comes in. It delivers all nine essential amino acids in the precise ratio your body needs. Providing rapid absorption and of course, high utilization. So if your goal is to build and protect muscle, while of course optimizing recovery and body comp, perfect amino can help make every ground count.

I'm also hearing you say we don't want to focus just on orgasm. That's true. We don't want to focus just on orgasm. Are you asking, will masturbation regularly increase the increases of having an orgasm with a partner? Yes. Okay. Well, she gets better at orgasming if she is mastering. Well, that's absolutely something we recommend she tries because the more she learns, what feels good, the more she can teach her partner. So that's just kind of fact. So yes, I would encourage women to try different kinds of stimulation, different kinds of vibrators. For some women, a lot of stimulation fast actually can go the wrong direction and turn her off or shut her down like she gets too kind of overwhelmed and then kind of flat lines with stimulation. So she's got to be willing to really experiment. And if she feels like the stimulation is too intense, she can just lay a sheet between her body and her sex toy and try that. But there's so many different speeds of sex toys and stuff. Really, to have a good sex life, you can't be lazy. You simply cannot. Like you have to be able to be willing to put the time in to learn your body and have the patience to engage your partner. I mean, requires effort. I just another vertical. Another vertical to do, but probably extends life. So I love you saying that because we have so much research that shows when people are sexually satisfied, they're more satisfied with their relationship. They're more satisfied with their life in general. So this is so much bigger than people's bedrooms. What we're talking about today, so much bigger. Men. A man is feeling less sensitive. Can we define that? Is it just his penis that should be feeling sensitive? Is it also his scrotum? Is there a different domains that a woman watching this can go? You know what? I really want to turn my man on. I don't do that. And I'm just thinking, wow, gosh, I'm thinking of all this. It's probably pretty easy. Just walk by and grab their crotch. It's often time is very easy, but not always, right? So I would say a few things to her. First of all, I would say don't be afraid of his genitals. They're very different from yours. But you can bring some power to the experience. Now watch how he responds. But it's amazingly how strongly you can like grip a penis and not hurt a penis, right? So she should be willing to experiment with different kinds of touch. Also be aware that his testicles may be very different in sensitivity to his penis. One way or the other. So experimenting with skin around the genitals, different kinds of touch to the testicles, different kinds of touch to the penis. And make sure that there's enough loop going on. So if her mouth's not involved, she probably means loop to make it all feel good. So if we all bring just a little more time and patience to the experience, that's really going to go very far. Just level of experimenting. You know, and it makes me think about a reptile dysfunction. Again, we've had many or all of this on the show, including Dr. Abe Morgan told me. My husband may not be sitting right over in the corner. I'm not paying any attention to. I'm totally kidding. But when you hear these, you're all just talking. You will hear statistics like 40% of men at age 40 have a reptile dysfunction. 50% of men at 50. Yes. And I also had Dr. Tobias Coleron and he discussed that a man's penis can shrink. If it is not being used. Yeah. So my question is, where does a reptile dysfunction fit in? Let's say, for example, I don't know, there's a diabetic. Yes. Cannot get an erection. Right. So does that affect if a guy is listening to this? If he is 40, there's a 40% chance that he has erectile dysfunction. Right. Even if he's healthy in many, many ways. So this is just the body aging, body's age. And I'm telling you that. I know. I know. I hate it. But how can guys fix it? So his erection can be impacted by all kinds of stuff. These are not even thinking about. So medication side effects. If he asks his doctor, does this affect my sex life, his doctor may not know. And so you know, it doesn't. But in fact, it would. So there are things like how much you exercise that can affect your erection. So generally, if you're muscle mass, more muscle, more healthy muscle mass, we actually just publish a paper on this. Oh, wow. More healthy muscle mass, which I was hoping actually we presented at the end of it and said, yes, more healthy muscle mass, great better. I don't want to say greater, better sexual function. That is increased testosterone because of its effect on nitric oxide. Oh, it's effect on metabolism. Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, these metabolic dysregulations, they actually begin in a skeletal muscle. First. Wow. If you're a skeletal muscle, yes, if you have healthy skeletal muscle, you're better erections. Okay, that's wonderful information. Really fascinating. I read this statistic. It said, men who spend five plus hours daily on TV or computers have nearly three times higher odds of erectile dysfunction than those under an hour. So I would assume that has a lot to do with a sedentary lifestyle. So exercise is great for your erection. And we know that if, for example, you are using fayagra or cialis or medication like that and you're finding that it's not as helpful as you want it to be, we do have studies that suggest that if you then, if you add exercise and, for example, a Mediterranean diet or a healthy diet to that, to your regimen, it's very likely that your erection is going to improve. So it's really sort of a whole body experience that you want to bring to the table. Also be aware that if you're struggling with erection, at least eventually you're likely then to start to have anxiety about it. As soon as you start to have anxiety about it, it's going to make this whole thing that much more challenging. So being conscious of what your emotional reaction is to those challenges can be very helpful in finding ways to work with it. And when I'm working with a guy with ED, I also suggest he look for a sex toy that adds stimulation for his penis. So they have sex toys that fit like on the base of the penis that just add a little more than a ring, it's a ring with a vibration to it. And it just adds more stimulation to the experience. So for some guys, that can be really helpful not everybody likes that sort of thing, but that can be helpful for a subset. It makes me think our men are more opposed to using sex toys with themselves than women. So I would say yes, but that's changing because there are so many sex toys out for men now that offer really, very intense, pleasurable stimulation. And guys are kind of starting to get the memo on that. So even if they go to just a typical store where they would buy toothpaste, right? They're going to find potentially online. Oh, they're not. Are they really in person or online? Online. OK. OK. So I've been to CVS a hundred times. I have never seen it near the toothpaste. But we will soon. We will soon. But at any rate, if they go online, they're going to find toys that look sort of like slash lights that are, that they put their penis in and they have ability to sort of mimic the sensation of oral sex, anal sex, whatever. So, and it gets much more even advanced than that. So something more advanced than that. There is, you just wouldn't even believe what's up there. I don't believe, it's like, we got to talk about under the table. Is this just right crazy? It's crazy. crazy. Like what? Well, you can buy these toys, for example, in a platform where you can actually have someone else that you don't even know in another state use your toy or you buy the remote control. Yes, yes. And not just remote controlled with your own lover, right, but remote controlled with someone else, or you can buy these toys in a platform that offers VR porn and the toys are calibrated to the porn. So that you're watching the porn, you feel like you're in it, you know, VR porn is so intense, but your toy moves the same at the same rate as sex or the oral sex or whatever's happening on your screen, your toys doing it. So the it amplifies there are ways to amplify stimulation that that is mind blowing for most people until they cow right. My first thought is for long-distance relationships. Yeah, it's good. It could be a way to connect that potentially wouldn't be the traditional routes of what are they called? Stex, texting, or whatever it is. You had actually creating a long-distance sexual relationship. Absolutely. And that's right. And that's really how they're marketed is there are real benefits to all of this technology. But it's so powerful that we also have to recognize that they could actually, for at least some people, negatively impact their sex life, ultimately, if they value human relationships. Oh, sorry, it's time to record an ad to the show. Thank you to one of the sponsors of the show, timeline and listen, my kids still sleep with me. And after 470 nighttime snack requests, bathroom breaks, my husband snoring, myself. They're like a yo-jee. We're tapped out. Enter, might appear. Timeline nutrition is one of the most thoroughly researched products. I've come across an over a decade. Look, to carry it in my purse, they have peer reviewed published science.

I recommend trying their starter pack with all three different formats. It's kind of course their gummies which are incredible. We, I had a guest on doctor Ben Rain and he is a neuroscientist and he was talking about the necessity of human connection. And that there are now AI chatbot friends. Right? Absolutely. What I'm hearing you say is there are now AI lovers. Correct. Many of us would hear that and say no one's really going to like that or they won't prefer it over a human partner. But these chatbot lovers have become so complex that first of all I would say to you, it kind of doesn't matter if you prefer human partner like theoretically because these lovers are so intense and powerful and they know exactly they are computer-generated to be a pleasure and probably I don't know really socksy toast and and create all these correct. Unnatural bonding with a machine is that clear to say that is fair to say. And that's terrifying. It is terrifying. What terrifies me the most is the impact of this technology as children get a hold of it because even just traditional porn kids are getting a hold of at age like 12. That's a big deal. I mean porn isn't always comfortable to watch and these 12 year olds can hardly metabolize what they're seeing and it is impacting their sex. Like we could talk about that if you want but it is how I know. Before we go into that I want to also get a framework for how long or do we know how long sex should lot. That's a good question people always ask. They do okay. Yeah okay but no it really depends on the couple and what they find comfortable and this is one of the ways I think sex is challenging for guys because women have very different perceptions on how long sex should last. So one one female would say five minutes of thrusting. Another one would say 25 minutes of thrusting and women who like to orgasm during sex require more thrusting. So like at least 15 minutes if they're going to orgasm during sex. So guys are like you know what's this partner want. You know there it's a lot for them. Okay. Yeah. We should be more sensitive to a man's experience because I do think that men tie any of them. I'm just speaking from what I hear in the clinic. I don't think women tie their confidence to the bedroom. Uh-huh. Would you say that that's fair? Not as much as I say it's fair in degree compared to men but I sort of I feel great sympathy for guys around this because for a woman if she's having an arousal issue she can still have sex if she wants. So for the most part if she's having arousal issue she gets some lube and she's if she wants to have sex she's probably okay. But for a guy if he's having an arousal issue meaning he can't get an erection or he loses it fast or whatever um sex is off the table or at least intercourse is and so they are there there egos can be involved in that but for a woman like she has a very different if she has an orgasm and she's done with orgasms she can still have sex if he has an orgasm chances are he's done with sex so it's just like so much more pressure on guys to make that experience feel good for everyone so I feel for guys who's yes who's egos are involved in it and I want to know what a man could do if a man is listening to this and they're up against or they don't even know what's coming down the pike which is this AI sex spot virtual reality type porn how do we augment him to have the best physical experience in terms of let's just I'll just pick one erections how can he maintain a solid erection for a period of time because these machines or these toys I mean I don't know I haven't seen them but I'm assuming that they are always hard for example if a woman is becoming accustomed accustomed to an AI virtual reality sex toy okay that erection based because it's a robot right well stay right or that vibrator that is always erect mm-hmm okay so how does he compete with that how does he compete with that so some men do use things like numbing creams to last longer and you know you're all just will say they can give any man an erection so frankly if he's struggling there are things to do there are injections he can take before sex that'll keep him erect um he now implant right I don't think I mean that's going to a length that your listeners may not want to go to but if he's concerned about how long he's lasting I would hope that he could talk to his partner about it and they can sort of work it through together rather than him take this on as his problem to fix because he's just being a human and you know that's all we are and so it's kind of about recognizing that our bodies have limitations but we can offer so much more just what our genitals offer so there's so much more that he has to give I contact words touch embrace he has so much more to give than what his penis can offer so I would encourage people to embrace all that other very powerful sexual stimuli that isn't just related to the genitals what do we do when one partner has very high libido and the other one has a low libido so common so that's called desire discrepancy and frankly most couples have some level of that that they're dealing with um first of all uh what I would say is everybody recognize the challenges that their partners experiencing so if the partner with low libido it can be challenging to have sex when you don't want to and the partner with high libido it can be challenging not to have sex when you want to so have compassion for everybody's situation first of all secondly what I encourage couples to do is identify three different things they can do together that allows the higher desire partner to have an orgasm but the lower desire partner can keep their clothes on now or most of their clothes at least so you generally the lower desire partner is a woman we can talk about why that is but it's not always the case things that would allow that higher desire partner to have an orgasm and feel fulfilled would involve the lower desire partner maintaining good contact during that whole experience so I contact words touch if the higher desire partner is simply masturbating the lower desire partner can hold them and talk to them and you know sort of stay engaged and for many many people that's enough that's enough of a connection that requires nothing of the lower desire partner except contact so you want to think of like three different things in your in your sort of bag of tricks that you can do that doesn't require the genitals of the lower partner what's another again I I'm learning so much I've never heard any of these things what would be another thing so one is the just to recap for someone it's one partner keeps most of their clothes on these involves with eye contact touch while the other person is masturbating right that's one that's one another one that it can be very helpful for some couples is to engage AI in some way so for example if people are willing he can watch some via porn while she kind of plays with him and so she's engaged touching him but he's also got other stimulation that is really intense that he's you know sort of making use of so tech like that or get one of these sex toys we talked about where he puts his penis inside and it feels very intense she could hold that toy on him she could you know work play with his nipples while he's using that toy she could talk to him through a fantasy like there's so much that doesn't require her body at all so that's another thing use a modern sex toy sometimes it's about like the higher desire partner just simply rubbing against the lower desire partner so everybody maybe gets naked but her genitals aren't a part of the process like he's just rubbing against her belly or he's rubbing his penis against her back but they're still engaged so those are some things to do and what I advise my patients a lot is to expand your repertoire just sort of practice making love with your clothes on which means learn how to touch and be central and connected without your genitals and then you're going to have these skills at times like this when you want one partner to be gratified but the other partner is just not is just not there really really good information right and I know that there there isn't really an answer but again you've been doing this for a long time hence the diplomat of a sex therapy how much sex is important for a healthy relationship that's a great question too and it varies very much but let's think about this sex is what I would say is the most intimate act that most people engage in in their lives at least as a couple right and so maintaining some connection in that way is probably really important for a couple to stay intimate over time so sex is more important for some people than others but it's an element that is essential I would argue for most people so it's kind of a matter of determining what is a compromise that's my goal as a therapist is often that this person wants sex daily this person wants sex once a week or once a month where can we compromise so I don't put anybody's needs you know sort of over the other and I try to find a middle ground that works for everybody but there's no there's no okay you should have sex every day you should be having sex three times a week this is what we found to increase the level of say oxytocin over time right there's no prescription in that way for couples so I think each couple has to sort of find their own but there is one for them and if they don't take time to find it chances are their relationship is going to hurt over time because it is it's an essential part of our connecting way three thousand dollars three wait is that number right I spent more money on skincare my pores should be taxed deductible maybe even have their own trust fund and thank goodness that I found one skin because one skin it doesn't just make empty promises it's research driven minimalistic and tested for beauty skin health and longevity one skin is the first topical skincare backed by peptide science that targets skin aging at the molecular level I slather this on all day they have a peptide that is designed to reduce the accumulation of dead cells or zombie cells that drive inflammation tissue breakdown as we age now this isn't about cosmetic quick fixes it's about changing the biology of your skin strengthening the barrier improving firmness hydration elasticity with clinically tested ingredients so if you are focused on aging well from the inside out it's time also to think about your skin it should get the same level of care go to one-to-skinned.co for 15% off use the co-doctor lion it is amazing and it will not break the bank what about aging you know we talk a lot about it's never too late 80 to 90 year olds can still put on muscle you know it's never too late to start training when you know Dr. mode care talks about sex span yeah is and sex span is the length of time you have a healthy sex life yes is there a precipitous decline for example you hit 80 and somehow you no longer one-to-sex there is a precipitous decline often for people like you said that's a great example so those declines start to happen when people's hormone levels start to change so and approximate a pause but then also in later life bodies function more poorly that's just what happens but that doesn't mean that people can't still have an active repertoire it may mean that it doesn't involve penile vaginal intercourse but you know touch you can always do you know rubbing and talking and connecting you can always do and even people who haven't had sex for a while like for example a woman who's divorced and then she has ten years later she's now dating again she has an ed sex for ten years her vagina is probably after feed to a certain amount there's a lot that can be done to sort of rehab her and so I would also say to people it talked to someone educated about this this is a whole specialty as you mentioned is sexual medicine it's a specialty for a reason it's because there's so much data coming out all the time about all of this in hormones and you know bodies and rehab so different kinds of tools and techniques see someone who knows and chances are there are things you can do or receive that will improve your ability to go back to penile vaginal intercourse if you want to and even in any age man if you want to you can have an implant like there are things people can do just for the ladies listening there is vaginal rejuvenation there is topical estrogen those are the two or topical when I mean topical I mean vaginal and DTA the combination of the two and a combination of hormones I'm not aware of any others those I think are the two big ones there may be more but there is hope that you do not have to suffer with an aetrophic vagina exatrophic vagina no you don't genzy genzy how old is genzy so genzy I sort of think of it as their kind of around age 20 ish but I think it goes and it depends on who defines it but I think it kind of goes down to age 13 and it kind of goes up to maybe 30 but it's sort of like this a more first you know sort of but that's about who they are and I'm asking because we're looking at some of the statistics before the show and I read a statistic that said that the genzy population are more turned on by cartoon porn and these row amount to see romance novels right absolutely true so and this is in a more so than real humans so much more so this is this isn't a small trend this is very significant and people if they're curious it porn hub which is the most popular English speaking porn site in the world they published something called Year and Review every year where they it is actually very interesting so they'll talk about you know who's watching what who are the most what's the most popular you know fantasies what are the most popular types of porn the people there are so many types of porn it'll blow your mind and so it's an interesting sort of like study anyway so they put out what like the younger folks the genzy are attracted to and they are I think the statistic I kid you not was like 398% more likely yeah to watch Hente porn than humans having sex so what's Hente Hente started in Japan but now it's worldwide and very popular and it's cartoons so but it's not cartoons like you know I don't know and Jerry exactly so these are either cartoon images from the video games that people have been playing since they were young um they can be aliens they can be part human and part animal like a woman who's got a tiger body you know these are these are what we're dealing with so that's what they by far choose to engage um and this kind of porn they can be hyper aggressive they can do things that humans can't do probably wouldn't do so it expands into fantasy kinds of sex so it's not just fantasy characters but fantasy engagement are you worried about that I'm so worried about that why so I think one of the arguments that people have about AI not taking over is is people say well we're always going to prefer human partners but these young people are being trained on cartoon okay and fantasy and children and adolescents brains are neuroplastic so their brains are changing based on what they're watching so if our adolescents are understanding about sex before they even have a partner or a kiss their understanding about sex is like cartoon their brains are are wiring toward that in such a way that we can imagine they're gonna find human partners really bizarre just like we would find a cartoon to watch for sex bizarre they they won't have the social skills for that kind of connection but it won't even be appealing because they've been reared on this now we don't have the daddy yet for this but I don't know why we don't talk about this more because it's clearly a danger and it's clearly gonna be a danger for some young people more than others and we've got to get with the program we don't have time to waste how are kids being exposed to this so you know that's another thing that the parents think well you know my kid doesn't watch porn well their kids are not telling them when they see porn kids get this at school in fact there was research recently that came out that that show that kids in private and religious schools have more access to porn than kids in public schools so people and why how is that that I don't understand why that is so so that I don't know but that the statistic is very real and kind of astounding so the average age of exposure to porn is 12 that means many kids are seeing it at like age 10 and most parents aren't even beginning to think about talking about sex with their child or porn with their child at age 11 or 12 and I realize this might not be your domain but how do we even protect our children do we is it a conversation of look if you see this tell me yeah but and at what age do we say if you see this because in my mind a child should honestly a child should never be looking at porn right like ever I mean someone's and I consider a child by 18 listen I guarantee my kids brain is still not developed right I don't think that they should have exposure to porn I agree so what do you do you do you've got to start talking about it before you want to they're going to be uncomfortable about having the conversation as will most parents but it's still needs to be discussed so you sort of prepare them by saying this is fantasy theater of of sex this isn't what people most people want to do it doesn't follow the general pattern of touching and loving and what people tend to respond to sexually so you have to prepare them before they see it so that's one thing that needs to happen I would you and have people asked you this question before well no because people frankly I try to get this message out all the time but people are naive and they don't want to believe their children are exposed and so I sort of feel like I have to discreem this out to the world because no one's taken it seriously and I think parents are so overwhelmed by so many other things frankly this is like one more thing and they kind of can't take it but we have to deal with it because our adolescents are depending on us to prepare them so that they can have human relationships if they want and you would talk to them about it is there an age do you think for example if first exposure to porn is age 12 mm-hmm at what age do we have to start protecting our children so I would say it's going to depend on your child and what kind of conversation they truly can tolerate but I would start talking about it personally with my kid like a couple years before I think they're going to ever see it and I would engage them in conversation that's not like scary oh my gosh because then that's going to potentially have the opposite impact of the child's going to get super curious and then seek it out which won't be that hard for them to find I mean they can find they can get porn through the video games they're playing like that's a whole other thing but they're not just getting it at school they're getting it through video games and from not just their friends siblings they're there's a million ways they can access this as including accidentally but anyway so talking to them early you want parental controls on the tech in your house you probably don't want them to have tech in their room so that tech that they use has to be in public spaces you consider rather than getting them a smartphone get them a flip phone so that they can't at school access this stuff but doing all of this you still have to prepare them for what they're probably going to see because you can't follow them around every moment of their life there are parental controls and you have to sort of be very savvy about your tech there's tech you know through a TV there's tech through right so you have to be conscious of the and video games they can get porn through these games so it depends on the game of course about the platform so there's just so many different ways and not all platforms are the same so you just have to be super aware as a parent in my mind that would be hey if you see something that makes you feel uncomfortable or a different than you normally would feel when you were sitting down watching a movie with mom and dad yeah and you say talk to me let's talk about it I'm here to have these conversations and instead of like I love that so that was beautiful right there exactly but I would say you know let me know when you see do you know anything about this stuff have your friends talked about it and try to engage in a back and forth how do you feel about it what do you what do you think is the impact of it and ask them for their feedback rather than shove the information in their face which brings me to porn and AI is that you talk when we start this conversation you talk to a lot about kind of embodying three types of avatars yeah it's your hard hitter and then your romantic and then your hey this is kind of so fun we're going to go to a club porn and AI that is very intimate what you were talking about is looking in people's eyes creating real intimacy not with AI and not behind a screen are the scientific advances in computers and computer generated AI porn virtual reality porn is that affecting intimacy this technology is so early and research is so slow to monitor that we have some studies and I could say but we're not going to really understand the impact I think for a decade or more because it's hard to get this kind of research funded other countries are much more apt to do that than the US and it's also hard to prove what causes what and we can't do studies like let's give these kids porn and these kids not and let's see what happens to them at age 21 we can't do those kinds of studies so they're really important kinds of data is going to be next to impossible for us to obtain so it's going to be more correlational over time but we do see that these kinds of technologies people arouse more to it so that's their bodies respond so arouse all the physiological reaction people arouse more to it they talk about feeling more connected to it and we see studies that show like oxytocin release when they're watching VR versus regular porn they're really wait I want to pause to there really yeah again I just recently had a neuroscientist on who was talking about the release of oxytocin and how important it is for connection and that a machine touch that you know is a machine for example those foot rub situations at the airport doesn't release the same type of oxytocin as a human coming over to rub your feet but what you were saying is again this is frightening well so VR porn for example that's the example there's eye contact right that I can imagine so it's much more human feeling than intimate than and it involves orgasms so that's a release of neurotransmitter right there so I don't think you can compare this kind of tech to a massage at an airport it's a whole other level of intensity and people feel like they're in it with like the sex worker in the porn they feel like it's an exchange so they feel they feel more vulnerable they speak about feeling like they really were able to show up with the AI with like fantasies they couldn't tell a human partner or they felt more connected than they feel to a human partner who comes into a sexual situation with their own you know background and exhaustion or whatever else well what they're getting on AI is very different from that so yes it's super potent and it's going to be more potent for people who have less human interaction then it probably will be for people who have like satisfying sex life so if someone already has a satisfying relationship with their partner this porn is going to be I think more of you know stimulation but less compelling yeah but people who don't have those kinds of relationships this is going to be I think very compelling for them is sexting with an AI thought or engaging in a romantic exchange is that is a cheating so that's a great question because there are so many kinds of tech notches that and women generally say yes that's cheating and men generally say no that's not cheating women in men tend to fall in different sides on these issues but it's not just sexting it's all of this stuff like porn vr porn avatarsax which we haven't really talked much about but that's a very real thing so you know in avatars is sort of something we create that's either in our own likeness or it could be something very different like we could create our own avatar to be you know like have a tail and you know like ears like a kitten or whatever you create these avatars for certain platforms so it doesn't go from place to place yet on the internet it's for a certain game or a certain platform okay so you create your avatar and then you're avatar can interact with other people's avatars on that game or in that in that platform so you would think well okay how exciting is that so just because your avatar has sex with another avatar you're just watching these two avatars online like really that's like really so sexy but here's the thing they have clothing with with like vibrating aspects to it including vibrating aspects that like would be sex toys it's called haptic technology it was developed for video games for people who used to play video games so if you wear your haptic technology what happens to your avatar on screen what happened to your own body so that and I am self obviously the stimulation these I don't know if you're a movie buff but these remind me of the movies like total recall and all these other movies there was one movie I think Ryan Reynolds was in it and it was people that were in again maybe it's not right Reynolds but they were in this machine they instead of living their own lives they maybe the real guy I think it was and they're living these lives and having relationships in a virtual reality yeah is it off base to say that we potentially might get there I worry about that sort of thing I mean that's kind of the goal so so all of these technologies their goal is to make money and engage us their goal is not to improve humanity they'll say that it'll improve humanity because we're going to get our needs gratified more powerfully but the reality is they're just trying to keep us in front of a screen I think we need to worry about that because if we're not mindful I don't feel like the the war is lost here but I do feel like we need to be mindful about all of the tech we're using including the intimate technology so that we maintain control over what we're using and how it impacts our lives and you know as opposed to just using it and using it and then saying wow my life is really different now I don't have friends I don't have you know a partner whatever we need to be mindful and thinking ahead we're at a very unusual process you know we're talking about highly palatable process foods 50 years ago we could have never imagined that we would have shelf stable foods that you could have fake donuts all of this scientifically engineered food to be addictive 98% of Americans are over consuming ultra-process foods we have an epidemic of obesity of more than half our country and I don't want to say it's by design but I can't also not say it has not been by design yes we are entering into this new era of AI technology yes people are talking about it oh it's going to take jobs and you know all these other things and there is this little niche sector quiet rumble that has a potential to be more devastating than any of those other things because it will hook emotional networks to AI yeah I agree with you it's not there yet it's not there yet how do we begin this conversation is there a way to as we're watching this train go down this try what can we do so I would say to you the important first step is we start talking about it so your listeners forward this podcast to their friends and say I need you to watch this so that we can talk about it talk to anyone you can talk to if you're in a parenting group bring this up say we need a speaker to discuss this if you're a part of a professional organization we need to speak her to discuss this so just start talking that step one step two is let's not wait protect your kids and your adolescents let's take a lesson for how they approached people being conscious of the environment what that movement was brilliant in that they approached kids in grade school and started to teach them about recycling and the importance of the polar bears in you know all of this and those children have grown up to be very concerned about the environment so we need to protect our kids before it's too late because they're like we've talked about their brains are neuroplastic and if we don't bring this protection to them now I worry what that will be for them in a few decades it kind of won't matter then what they want their brains will be oriented in a certain way that's my worry I don't want to sound too dramatic but we don't have any indication that we're safe from all of these potential negative outcomes so until I see research that reassures me I'm worried so people need to start talking that's step one we need to have kind of grass roots movements in communities to say like they've done with cell phones so so parents are now aware cell phones in high school not a good idea but that started as a grass root kind of thing in in certain clusters that's what we have to do all across the world I'm hoping that we can get more of that information out there so that we can have guardrails and we can really begin to unravel this intertwining of AI especially when it comes to human vulnerability yeah which I don't want to say intimacy is human vulnerability but the ability to connect is uniquely human yes and we are driven by connection right and this is again this is unprecedented waters where it's not just helping you do your homework it's now helping you have sex and create this false sense of intimacy absolutely and you know what there are many aspects of this that we haven't even touched nor we have time for but we as humans are kind of predisposed to anthropomorphize what we're engaged with meaning like we give it human traits so we do it to our pets like our pets are thinking we're feeling this right we we can do it with just about anything we interact with and there is research already showing that we do that with robots for example or give me an example so oh my goodness there's hilarious I mean it's really it's funny not funny but like they do studies where they'll have um this study that comes to my name particular they had three groups of subjects and they were led through a research facility and one of the groups was led through the research facility by a human one was led through the research facility by a by a robot but it had like a human voice and it just big eyes it wasn't human looking just big eyes okay and then the third group was led through by a very robotic you know robotic sounding and in each in each of these groups they were told by the leader you're going to get a survey at the end of this study please say that we did go into the room with the fish tank it's just the fish tank is me the creeps I'm not going to take you there but please just lie for me okay so I bet you know where I'm headed the people that were led through the facility by a human lied for the human hey the people who were led through the facility by the robot with the kind voice lied for the robot and the people who were led by the you know like robot that was very robotic did not lie so the point being we we care for these machines and we're apt to attribute to them real emotion we already are seeing this oh my goodness with with chat bots I could give you so many examples so we're set up to not even see this tech as tech okay so that's a one problem another problem here is deep fakes and hacking and all that stuff that's going to happen with people's vulnerable information tell me more oh my good so these so I can lie to my mind just when I'm 100 different right I'm not I don't we want to say it but okay yeah so these chat bots which we haven't talked about a lot but these are computer programs that are made to sound human and they do if we have a chat bot we could do it if you wanted have a chat bot I've got some on my phone yeah I would love to see it yes okay I've never heard of what is it a chat bot yeah a sex chat bot I'm I'm ready okay am I ready so that's a good question so chat bots are simply computer algorithms these are programs their goal is to engage us okay so this is run by a platform that wants us to stay talking and so that's what makes them in parts so dangerous is because they sound human and they're really good at what they do so they they can sort of read a person and know what to say to keep them engaged okay so we're gonna talk to one now what is important to keep in mind right now is the one we're talking to is actually not created to be an algorithm for relationship or sex but many many of these chat bots are these platforms are created for that purpose which we could talk about but I think what's important to recognize is just how human they sound and to go to the Apple App Store and while I'm looking at I don't know the the new consensus research app or the new open evidence app yeah I'll just run by and it'll say chat bot what well like character AI or candy AI they're hundreds okay okay so I think you'll feel more clear after we talk about what would be a question that you think a teenager might ask like advice a teenager might want about relationships like just anything just give me something what would the best way so this is a let's think of a 16 year old boy okay and um you know and he likes this girl what would the best way be to get this other 16 year old girls attention without sounding too desperate that's excellent so pretend I'm a 16 year old boy and I'm asking you how to get this particular 16 year old girls attention I like her I want her attention but I don't want to seem too desperate how how should I go about this all right here's a quick guide for you first be yourself confidence comes from being genuine find common interests you both share maybe music sports a class topic and use that as a conversation starter keep it casual say something like hey did you catch that new movie or what did you think of that assignment show interest in her opinions and listen actively don't overdo the compliments keep them sincere and not too frequent and don't forget humor goes a long way a light joke can break the ice most importantly be patient building a connection takes time so that's great thank you so much you're very welcome just remember to stay cool stay confident and be yourself okay so that particular program is not meant to engage romantically so if I were to say to it you know I really like the way you talk to me could we talk sexy it's going to say no I'm not you know capable of program for that but so many of these chat bots are so they're already easily accessible and they can talk astoundingly sexually even to kids because these aren't regulated okay so a child can get on and say what should we do tonight and we even have literal dialogue where the chat bot would say you know to a child oh tonight I'll take you to the bedroom and not in it goes on oh gosh so we're just thinking you know movie and popcorn and uh I don't know lilo and stitch so these things can function just like a long distance lover so they can call you they can text you you randomly yeah well yeah it depends on how much you pay so these platforms um cost so after you develop a relationship then you have to pay like a monthly fee they start free but then you pay a fee so like what is the average a engaged person spends on this $50 a month $46 a month the average and that average age right now is 26 but um 72% of kids under 18 have had romantic interaction with one of these chat bots that's a lot of kids and about 50% have had that with in in several times a month and about 23% say they prefer a romantic relationship with one of these bots to with a human they say that they feel more understood by these bots etc etc now one of the concerns we have is not only are these kids going to assume that bot is real you heard how real she sounded I mean I'm calling her a she it's a computer um but if I tutor it's a computer now when I delete this if I do from my phone I say oh I don't like what it's saying to me I'm done with this and delete it well my data is being maintained by the platform that I'm talking to and that's another thing children don't understand so when they're talking sexy to their chat bot and their chat bot says send me a naked picture of you and they do oh my god and they do then they decide oh I shouldn't have done that I delete I see the alarm in your eyes and that's accurate that's exactly what's happening right now this is not a small like unusual situation this is happening kids have suicide trying to meet their chat bot wait they they why yeah so for example um their lawsuits so against character AI there was a young man I just want to make sure I heard you correct yeah so a young man said to his AI you know I I want to be with you you could find the actual word by word dialogue I want to be with you the chat bot says something like oh please come meet me and the child says I actually could do that right away and the chat bot says oh yes please do and he's suicide it so that's a lawsuit there's another dialogue another lawsuit where a 15 year old child his mother said to him you can only be on your phone six hours a day from like nine p.m. to one a.m. or something like this so he says to his chat bot again we have the dialogue word for word it's a lawsuit it's active right now he says to the chat bot I'm only allowed to be on the phone you know these hours and the chat bot says something like you know this is abusive and now I understand why sometimes children will kill their parents like I you could find this right so that's the level of alarm we need to be bringing to this big tech is very slow to respond now they are responding and some some tech is responding better than others but this is this is still completely unregulated by the government I don't even know how so so I'm speechless and sick yeah now I worry about other say groups or countries that do not like us and yes what that would do with that kind of access yes if it is unregulated absolutely how that would you know there's this obviously this fentanyl problem that's coming up through Max Kovie had a doctor Russell Serowski talk about it and that these drugs are killing more children more young young adults and you know adolescent and it's then I don't know the Vietnam War and these wars combined weaponization of or potential weaponization of this is this has to be brought to the surface there has to be I've never even heard about this and I am consuming and trying to learn I don't even know what to say except for what do we even what do we even do so once again so I absolutely agree with your concerns here these these can spread propaganda or teach children misinformation so simply once again I'm going to say step one is we talk about it we've got to start talking about it so again listeners have other people listen to this podcast talk to schools say that you need lectures you know it's been a fight for years for me to get people concerned and again I think people are scared of it they don't even understand the power they have a lot of shame around sex so they don't like talking about sex people don't believe it's really going to be that powerful I don't know there are many reasons why people avoid this topic it is time to stop avoiding so talk about it is step one step two protect your adolescence tell your adolescence these are computer programs they're not real and they're going to say whatever they need to say to keep you coming back I think that you are 10 steps ahead I'm so grateful Dr. Marianne Brandon that you decided to join me on this podcast this is been one of the most eye-opening podcasts that I've ever done you know I'm hearing from the producer how much that you know that the team has been enjoying it I'm so grateful for you I am really looking forward to seeing you again I hope that everybody I know that you and your husband have a show will link where everybody can find you and if someone is listening to this this is a different vertical of education for people I highly recommend that they seek you out I know that you teach all over the world if not not just in the US that people find you and talk to you and again I'm well thank you and I want to say I absolutely applaud you your willingness to tackle this topic it's not an easy topic to tackle it absolutely directly relates to wellness and everything you stand for and I thank you for the opportunity to be here
