One of our biggest myths is that when we're had hits the pillow, our brain just kind of checks out for the night. If you're falling asleep right away, you're probably starved for sleep. Do you have tips or tricks? I mean, I want to share mine, but I think we'll solve everybody's sleep problems. Number one, sleep is just the ultimate accelerator of good health. The quality and quantity of our sleep is one of the strongest predictors of our longevity. You have talked a lot in the past about cognitive health, Alzheimer's, mortality. Are there sleep biomarkers? The truth is, sleep is not going to be perfect every night, but the key is getting back on track towards those four components. Sleep is a product of two processes. The first is called the homeostatic sleep drive. For the risks of circadian decincerny, the difficulties for our bodies to really repair and get good sleep. Shiftwork has been named of a propulcarsenogen. Do you have a position on sleep medications? The research that pits those two treatments had to had pharmacological intervention and behavior change, those two patients sufferers of insomnia and we compare them over time. The behavioral treatment wins out. Why should we sleep? Well, sleep is one of the most important parts of a typical 24-hour day, but unfortunately so many of us, whether we choose on our own volition to curtail sleep, whether it's watching Netflix, staying up for another hour to do another report or something a professional obligation, a personal obligation, or out of necessity if you're working multiple jobs your time to sleep is going to be crunch. But sleep is one of the most vitally important parts of our typical 24-hour day. Over the course of our sleep at night, our blood pressure drops to a slowest point in the 24-hour day is just one example and not natural dipping of blood pressure is vitally important for us to wake up and maintain a healthy blood pressure. Our emotional regulation gets out of sync. Our ability to maintain a healthy appetite is thrown off when we're not getting enough sleep. But when we can reverse that, when we can put sleep at the forefront and higher on our to-do-list, higher on our priority list, so many positive things fall in line. Our motions are our relationships, our productivity, so often I laugh people say, you know, what's the best productivity hack in the afternoon when I'm sleepy? I'm like, just take a nap. It's so interesting that we push back so hard against the idea of a good night's rest. But couple that with a fact that in at least the United States, we really don't have proper education about sleep. We're really not informed about evidence-based principles when it comes to sleep. For instance, I don't know if your mother ever told you that's growing up, we love your mother. But my mom would always say if you're struggling to sleep at night, stay in bed. You'll get some sleep, stay in bed. But wrong. If you're experiencing insomnia, we want you out of bed. We want you to reset to go do something relaxing and build up what we call sleep pressure and get back into bed when you're ready and give it a shot again. It should take you about 15 minutes to fall asleep and much longer than that. We want to break the cycle. We want to get you out and then try again when you're ready. We do hear a lot about sleep now, probably more than we ever have. How long of you been in sleep science? I admittedly was interested in other areas of medicine earlier on in my career exercise physiology, nutrition, nutritional sciences, or rather broadly really interested in health behaviors and how to promote health behaviors in a Western society where we are taught to treat diseases. That really was a big driver of my going to graduate school. I just became amazed by the research in sleep. I took a class by Dr. James Moss. We tragically just lost him. He was older and has had an amazing career but he was larger than life at Cornell where I went to undergrad and he was known as the sleep professor and he coined the term power naps in the 1980s in response to the power breakfast and power lunches. He said take a power nap in the afternoon to boost your productivity and he was just an incredible guy. He taught psycho-01 and promoted awareness about sleep in the context of this course. Definitely when I was in my fellowship training and when I was in my residency training we don't talk about sleep. You're tired, too bad you're in a work of the night shift. Sorry for you. I was there. I did it for five years. No it's your turn. There seems to have been a turning point in our understanding about sleep, brain function, sleep, metabolism that at least for the general population as well as medical providers. There's been a turning point and I'm curious if you've seen that from before to now and if you see us still moving forward. Sleep medicine is a really exciting field. It seems as though we're advancing our understanding of what happens in the body and in the brain almost every week. There are fascinating exciting new discoveries and it's a really exciting field to be. It hasn't always been as hot admittedly as it is now. I think only recently if we really collectively woken up to the importance of sleep. And sleep is also a relatively new field compared to other areas of medicine. Some of our seminal discoveries were in the late 70s. 40, 45 years ago we didn't know what contributed to our circadian rhythms. We didn't know the importance of blue spectrum light as the strongest input to our circadian rhythms. We thought it was behavioral patterns and that helped us align our sleep and wake cycles in a typical 24-hour day. A lot of our discoveries have only recently taken place and it seems as though we're uncovering new and fascinating insights. Virtually every week almost our new exciting findings coming out about the connection between sleep and any number of areas of our waking lives. Curious as to how much we actually should sleep because there seems to be a wide range. I also have heard that there is a genetic mutation that some people need lessly have heard this and they of course added so fun because it always seems to be someone who's not, it's not you personally or you know someone you know often it's this person who's a friend of a friend and they did you know that they can sleep for four or five hours but I really are community, the military community. Oh yes, the operators. They seem to function. I know it's not great but they it's almost as if there is a natural pattern maybe four to five hours to sleep. There are so many aspects of active duty that makes sleep difficult you know of course you're sleeping in an uncertain environment with threats around you and those are two of the biggest culprits of sleep difficulties. When you're in an environment or you're kind of your nervous, you're on edge if you think about maybe before a big deadline for any of us you get stressed and worried there are so many profound and very real barriers to sleep in the military population. If you think about active duty and all the number of stressors that are so real and so profound they of course take an enormous toll on sleep and then sometimes there are patrols that you have to go on in the middle of the night and so in many ways you might be on kind of a shiftwork like schedule which can dramatically disrupt your circadian rhythm because sleep at the end of the day is all about feeling at peace, about feeling you know at peace with your surroundings safe and comfortable and when those pieces aren't there it's very difficult to calm your mind and be able to drift off into sleep. If you were to convince me that I need to sleep, what is the average American sleep? Adults need somewhere between seven and nine hours for optimal health alertness while being and not you know well being today tomorrow and into the future. The quality and quantity of our sleep is one of the strongest predictors of our longevity. Not only how long we're going to live but the quality of those years and that's sweet spot for sleep for adults is somewhere between seven and nine hours and now it's arranged because you might have it's in large part genetically determined. If you've had two parents that are shorter sleepers and I say shorter meaning about seven hours, you might be lucky and be fine on seven hours of sleep but there are many people who have a little bit of a longer sleep need physiological hard-wired sleep need and need to meet that night and a night out and if that's nine hours and again if you had two parents who are longer sleepers you might be on that longer end of the spectrum. Now we recommend a range and finding where you are in that range is vitally important and if you're listening you might be far from that range and so think about where you are right now if you're really getting five or six hours of sleep. We don't want to move in sweeping changes towards a new sleep duration because our sleep is all about routine. Sleep is a product of two processes. The first is called the homeostatic sleep drive. Now if you imagine having a backpack on and you wake up in the morning and each additional hour I put another brick in that backpack such that by the end of the day you are dragging. That's the idea of homeostatic sleep pressure. It's the feeling of sleepiness but that's not all and anyone who's traveled internationally to a new time zone you could have been traveling for 12, 14, 24 hours be physically exhausted but not be able to sleep and that's because the second opposing or synergistic process is the circadian rhythm. Now humans have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years of life on Earth to an approximately 24 hour day. Other planets have different durations. But on Earth we have evolved to operating around on a 24 hour cycle. Now it serves us from an evolutionary standpoint to match our surroundings. Have periods of time where we are off our cells are repairing, our bodies are pairing and regenerating itself over the course of our sleep at night and then when we're awake and our ancestors were looking for food or defending the village from predators. So it serves us to not simply kind of operate in a linear fashion or performance increasing with each additional hour awake but instead there's a real rhythm to our lives and we refer to this as our circadian rhythm because virtually every cell in the body operates in this circadian fashion. Circadian is Latin for about a day referring to processes that have been flow around an approximate 24 hour day. Our sleep is one such circadian rhythm and the hormones underlying our fundamental ability to be awake or be asleep also oscillate around that 24 hour cycle and the best thing for that cycle is routine. So falling asleep at the same time eating your meals at the same time, exercising around the same time every day and then having a time where you enter a cold dark room ideally and you fall asleep and the hormone melatonin plays a large role in that and that hormone melatonin is secreted in the brain when we approach our habitual bedtime, the sun sets in our environment and we slip into our bedroom and we fall asleep and we wake up and the melatonin stops in the morning and then we're able to go about our day but those two processes interact and result in our fundamental ability to sleep. Wait a $3,000 wait is that number right? I spent more money on skincare. My pores should be taxed deductible maybe even have their own trust fund and thank goodness that I found one skin because one skin it doesn't just make empty promises it's research driven minimalistic and tested for beauty skin health and longevity. One skin is the first topical skincare backed by peptide science that targets skin aging at the molecular level. I slather this on all day. They have a peptide that is designed to reduce the accumulation of dead cells or zombie cells that drive inflammation tissue breakdown as we age. Now this isn't about cosmetic quick fixes. It's about changing the biology of your skin strengthening the barrier improving firmness, hydration elasticity with clinically tested ingredients. So if you are focused on aging well from the inside out it's time also to think about your skin it should get the same level of care. Go to 1skin.co for 15% off use the co-doctor lion it is amazing and it will not break the bank. We are very much either in alignment or out of alignment with that circadian rhythm. When we think about rhythm in my mind it sounds very delicate. Is this circadian rhythm disruption delicate or does it take a lot for us to be able to get off track from a rhythm standpoint then affecting sleep? It really is a sensitive system and if we for instance one of the most common mistakes a lot of people make is sleeping in on the weekends and I think we are kind of enamored with this as a society actually the idea of sleeping in or the British you know all lion. I think this you know it's interesting almost every society has a term for this and it's always casting a very positive light. So what that does unfortunately from a circadian rhythm standpoint is delaying your rising time by more than an hour will start to give your circadian system information that you have hopped in a airplane and you flown to a new timezone and that your so your body is then going to be working actively against you the next night because it thinks that you're shifting to a later timezone. Your regular bedtime is going to roll around and that makes sense. And you're going to stay awake and you're going to watch that movie because you have this person. So many people in our society fall victim of this because they you're going to think sleeping in as a good thing you know I'm going to do that I'm going to catch up on law sleep and up until a point if you maybe want to add 30 or 45 minutes to your wake up time that's fine but really much longer than that does put you in the kind of in the risk area for what we refer to as social jet lag where we self impose jet lag like symptoms because we've in essence given our body or physiological cues that we're trying to adjust and we're kind of experiencing then jet lag symptoms often for social reasons because we often are staying up late to go out to a movie to you know it's been time with our loved ones which are all wonderful things but then resulting we'll wake up later in the next day and then maybe suffer from some insomnia symptoms the next night. What about this idea that I'll take my husband as an example he's a third year year old you resident. Wasn't I call last night but he finished at one o'clock all the surgeries got pushed later in the day he was exhausted but he still had to get up at five thirty this morning he'll go he'll do that now for the next five days. At some point as we just think about our lives is there a way to repay that sleep debt and if so how does someone do not? Medical residents are some of the most sleep deprived in our society but they are being trained to go out into the medical field and save our lives. In the case of your husband or surgeons are you know do life-saving treatments but so often our medical professionals are trained these environments that are fraught with sleep deprivation and if you're a general health care provider and you've come of age in the system you know you're probably struggling with sleep yourself if you were on a series of rotating night shifts and that is a huge risk factor for insomnia. In many cases we find patients who are struggling with sleep difficulties they go speak to their doctor and their doctors are prescribing sleep medications because they might be on them themselves or they're struggling and there is a time and place for sleep medication but the front line for sleep difficulties is according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine behavior change. So for example he wants to sleep he wants to sleep in after that after having four or five hours of sleep a night would he then be able to recoup that? Your husband is doing something that is really challenging. It sounds like it's rotating shift work which is the case for many medical residents and it's part of the fabric of our medical education that but my team is published research and then New England Medical Journal to show that those types of schedules and sleep disruptions for medical residents are a significant predictor of medical errors and so we really have to ask ourselves how can we set our young people up or the people who are getting their training especially in the medical field to force success not only for their health and they're well-being but the health of their patients also and so what he's doing right now is rotating shift work which is the most difficult type of shift work because your circadian rhythm can't align itself with any pattern of normalcy and a typical week so in the case of your husband it is going to be making up for loss sleep whenever and wherever he can. Yes please fully endorse this sleeping in and also making up for loss sleep with naps. They're shorter naps if he's you know he got a little bit of sleep the night before he's not you know too much in the dangerous zone of you know really falling asleep being just absolutely exhausted and if he has time for a longer nap then a 90 minute nap is wonderful in the afternoon say on a weekend if he's off to to make up for loss sleep. It's interesting in the way that on one hand you want a consistent sleep wake cycle is what I'm hearing you say and that is almost separate if you cannot have that. If you are someone who does not have a consistent sleep wake cycle you want to sleep that would be an indication too sleep in or an indication too sleep when you can totally and we work with a lot of shift worker populations whether it's truck drivers or medical professionals and in those situations the best recommendation is to try to find to look at periods where you're maybe on a rotating shift schedule is a shorter term situation and moving into at least patterns of shifts that are predictable. That is the best case scenario because our society is really powered by individuals on shift schedules outside the traditional nine to five it's how we have 24 seven access to food or customer service hotlines or medical help and attention and so we owe our shift workers a debt of gratitude in our society but they're sleep-really suffers and unfortunately we have determined that for the risks of circadian decincerity the difficulties for our bodies to really repair and get good sleep shift work has been named a probable carcinogen so moving off these schedules is quickly as possible and into a schedule at least of consistent shifts or ideally shifts that emulate the pattern of light and darkness around us where possible. I would love to hear what happens to the brain when we sleep. One of our biggest myths is that when we're had hits the pillow our brain just kind of checks out for the night and our body and we're in this monolithic state of sleep wrong there's so much rich and diverse activity in the body and the brain and it changes over the course of our sleep at night sleep is characterized by patterns of electro physiological activity and each of those are nuanced across sleep stages we distinguish over the course of a typical episode of sleep at night between rapid eye movement sleep and non-rhabit eye movement sleep. Rapid eye movement sleep is where as the name suggests our eyes are darting back and forth back and forth and there's a tremendous amount of activity in the brain as much if not more so than when we're awake it's fascinating we glow and we call it paradoxically because there's so much activity happening in the brain and very little activity happening in the body or essentially in mobile during rapid eye movement sleep. Other health behaviors you have to get on a treadmill you have to buy healthy food but sleep can be free and start tonight. There are sleep disorders there are more than 80 differentially diagnosable sleep disorders that are limiting many millions of Americans from getting good quality sleep but once we can remove barriers occupational barriers personal barriers cultivate healthy sleep habits we're able to make significant gains not only in sleep but in daytime success which is what we're all about if we were to welcome you into our laboratory in Boston we would hook you up with electrodes and the gold standard of sleep measurement is what we call poly some nography so we would be able to measure your brain waves your respiratory effort and a number of other things bodily movements etc and what we would see is your brain starts to slowly enter some of the lighter stages of sleep you're drifting off into sleep is the depends of the electrode start to slow and the amplitude of your brain wave starts to increase the amplitudes being the space between a peak and a trough of a brain wave start to lengthen indicating that you're starting to slow down the brain activity and then the frequency slows and then in stage one sleep is kind of a way station between the awake and the asleep state and then as you slowly drift into stage two sleep and then stage three is the deepest sleep of the night I think it's what we think of stereotypically when we think of sleep very long spaces between the peak and trough of a brain wave so very slow very high amplitude brain waves sh sh sh sh sh sh really looking and sounding like your asleep now during stage three deep sleep is where we get a lot of the benefits from the standpoint of muscular regeneration then something fascinating happens after about 20 minutes and a healthy sleeper I will start to see signs of rapid eye movements sleep as the names suggest your eyes are darting back and forth under your eyelids and that movement in your eyes is indicating a rich amount of activity in your brain your brain during rapid eye movement sleep is as active if not more so than the waking brain which is fascinating and then we cycle in and out of those different stages several times over the course of the night with two kind of high level differences and the first half of the night and a healthy sleeper we'll see that period of time rich and deep sleep and then the second half of the night we see rich and rapid eye movement sleep so when people come to us and say oh you know I'm getting three or four hours of sleep at night or five and I you know I feel okay but you know I think I'm doing all right and you might feel okay but you're virtually rubbing yourself of your potential because rapid eye movements sleep is where we get so many benefits cognitively from our sleep memory consolidation etc and that period is predominating right before we wake up if we're getting seven to nine hours they REM sleep is the consolidation of memory these software updates however you want to call it software hardware updates of the brain do they happen in other stages is it as I've indicated as it sounds well if you think about it that's kind of a difficult study to do to really isolate each unique stage but we do see the more rapid eye movements sleep you get the more likely you are to achieve insights if I teach you something before you fall asleep and then quiz you on at the next day the more rapid eye movement sleep you get the stronger those connections and the better your performance the next day on cognitive tests the gold standard of measurement of sleep is polysumnography but I do think that there's an important qualitative piece to sleep that sometimes we forget and now the development of sleep trackers gives us such an amazing insight into the quantitative component of our sleep how long did you sleep how long did it take you to fall asleep did you wake up did you spend much time in deep sleep or rapid eye movement sleep this is amazing information that a typical consumer didn't have access to you know five you know ten years ago but I think that the quantitative piece is ideally coupled with a qualitative evaluation of our sleep quite simply asking yourself how do I feel in the morning tired and we just do a little restores and then if that's the answer you know truly you know we need to add a little bit more time and I hope that you call me after and you're like Rebecca we did it I got more sleep I feel great how much sleep do children need so our sleep duration need does Evan flow across the lifespan very little babies need virtually to be sleeping almost all day long as you remember and then as children age they need a little bit less and up until the kind of school age period or time of a child's life they need somewhere between six and twelve hours of sleep but there are a lot of individual differences some kids will do well on that lower end of the spectrum and other kids will do well on the higher end and this is where I love to think about and of one experiments what works for you for your kid after a night of eight hours of sleep do you find that they are bright eye to the shithead as the saying goes when they wake up or do you find that they're dragging and maybe in the car in the afternoon do they fall asleep those would be signs that they're just not getting quite enough and then maybe start that next night and try to start the bedtime process a little bit earlier and the bedtime routine a little bit earlier do you think there is a time that is universally good for kids and what do I mean by this meaning we talked a little bit about this circadian rhythm just this 24 hour cycle here in Texas the sun goes down let's say six o'clock let's say the sun goes down in Boston or New York or just made this up at eight o'clock does the location dictate the time we should begin to think about putting our children to sleep because listen mind didn't come with a manual I'll be so pretty easy I wasn't so much easy but perhaps if at six p.m. when the sun is going down even though it's not convenient maybe that's the time that we begin to wind them down you know what I'm saying in terms of like what if we're kind of doing it wrong it's not our children they can't regulate they are my kid she'll want to stay up and read princess books and literally one thought like one eye is falling asleep you know well I love that I love it sounds like a great bedtime routine but young kids are very susceptible to light is one thing to keep in mind so make sure and this does not have to be expensive for everyone listening you can get great black outchades at target for very little but do make sure your children have sleep proofed environment and an environment you just showed me your daughter's bedroom it's so amazing and so cozy and so fabulous you want children just like all of us to walk in and feel suits have elements that comfort them their favorite stuff either favorite lovey and the book that helps them also feel you know at peace and safe and that's going to change as they grow of course but I think this is where kind of back to the end of one experiment thinking about workshopping your kid's sleep until you find the sweet spot and whether that's a 6 p.m. fall asleep time out or if that's a 9 p.m. fall asleep time and one of the key things is your children are young but what might be happening is all of us have in large part genetically predetermined preferences for chronotypes now this is a term that refers to each of our personal preference for being alert or asleep within a 24 hour day what is your I am a very severe morning type how about you say I was at the gym I love it so that is a kind of part of this equation also and your children those types might be presenting themselves what are the other types there is a morning person we generally model it on a spectrum from what we call morningness to eveningness and the biggest question the best question for figuring out where you are within that spectrum is when do you do your best work and if you would probably tell me first thing in the morning right would you say or say how would you like that question that in a month I can tell you that okay because I don't sleep well I have the two little kids you know whether my husband is on call or not but I'm hoping one amazing finish this episode I can call you and I'm going to implement same sleep, wake cycle, black out shades I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing with my kids but then I'm going to call you and tell you I can't wait me and let's text along the way into you get there because all of this is really all about workshopping and finding the sweet spot for you for your kids for your partner and factoring and also your professional obligations your personal obligations and maybe also unwinding you know yourself is a mom because we do stuff for everyone around us you know all day long is moms the fascinating thing that you said is there is a genetic predetermination for a mount and chronotype how much movement can we make when people have disregulated sleep from a nutritional science standpoint again we see people all time in our clinic that have abnormal lipids abnormal blood pressure glucose partially because they're either doing shift work or it's so interesting how this virus and blood work yes oh what's that oh that's my heart how many of you miss that over caffeinated feeling of your heart pounding out of your chest or you maybe you're on another caffeine detox maybe you've just feeling really tired I'm so grateful to mud water one of the sponsors of the show and I have two little kids therefore I don't have a perfectly structured morning routine sometimes I need something that supports focus clarity and energy without wrecking my nervous system that's where mud water comes in it's not coffee it is something different and it makes me feel right throughout the day I use it in the afternoon so I get good sleep mud water is made from functional mushrooms no not that kind a dab to genic and organic ingredients like cow and tumouric no sugar no artificial junk just clean focus energy it gives me that mental lift without the crash I love that it supports my mood and immunity and focus but what I really appreciate is that I'm not is that my pulse at 200 almost everyone has experienced too much caffeine go to mudwater.com if only you are interested in cutting back your caffeine and want something that works and use the code doctor line to get up to you guess it 43% off your starter kit mudwater.com code doctor line you'll feel the difference when do we consider jet lag is it a two hour time difference three hours would there be a time that we say okay this is jet lag when you're traveling one of the big questions how long is the trip going to be if you're going to lendon for a 24 hour trip and coming back I don't know that you have to adjust I'd say just rip off the band day do your best okay but if it's a longer period of time and you want to really align then the best thing to do is in the week before you travel and it's really more than three maybe three time zones away but look New York tug to California can be difficult to get it and if you have a big important meeting I'd say I'd say consider these protocols and the way you do that is in the week leading up to your trip you think about where you're traveling and you start to move your fall asleep and wake up times in the direction of that new time zone just 15 minutes so if you're going to lendon push your bedtime you know just 15 minutes later the first night in the week before and then another 15 and then another 15 so look at you just a year to California you are flying back you're going to go there you're going to be there for a week would you move up bed time from 8 to 815 or you move at the opposite 745 well when you're moving to the you know backward to California New York to California you're going to try to push your schedules to be a little bit later so I'd wear sunglasses in the morning if you live in New York setting you're going for a big work trip to California and the week beforehand you're trying to move small increments 15 minutes in the direction of your new time zone and that's sleep times and wake times but it's also meals so maybe try to push your dinner to be a little bit later if you're taking a red eye for instance from New York to London they're going to be serving you red eye I try to avoid them but there are situations where every time I pass out how about you red eye I think of you I'm just like oh I know this isn't good if you have the luxury or the ability to to choose flying during the day is ideal and then getting to your new destination and when you're there do you know again live eat and sleep on your new destination time zone and realize that sleep is not going to be perfect I don't have a cure for jet lag I wouldn't be a professor if I had a cure for jet lag but so you might experience some sleep difficulties so when you're on your new destination you land and maybe you experience some in in Somnia you wake up at two three o'clock in the morning the protocol is the same with we experience that in the US in our home time zone take an ins drive try not to beat yourself up it's so easy to look at the alarm clock and just like no I'm up but try to have I think self-talk is actually really important here you know no big deal I'm up but it's okay of course I'm up it makes sense do something that will hopefully make you sleepy reading a book, a gentle yoga poses the best use case for melatonin is travel and combating jet lag so we do recommend melatonin for that specific use case and taking it as you prepare for your trip could be a good idea to facilitate the transition of melatonin in the direction of your new time zone and when you land at your new destination do keep a couple things in mind as it comes to melatonin number one if you can find it pharmaceutical grade melatonin is critical there've been research studies that decompose melatonin tablets that you can find that are not regulated in the neutralsutical category in drug stores and they found what's stated on the level varies up to 300% than what's actually in the supplement so keep in mind the purity varies widely so pharmaceutical grade will allow you to be confident that what you're getting is pure and it is not more the better so look for something awesome 500 micrograms you're doing a stock balance color which is a connolly something so 500 micrograms or one to two milligrams but not much more and lastly taken before bedtime in advance it's not right before bedtime but it's kind of one sun is setting in your new environment is when you should be taking melatonin a couple hours before you want to be falling asleep I didn't realize it was a few hours before what you're saying is you don't take melatonin right before you okay I'm a popping melatonin and go to sleep you want to plan in advance and facilitate that internal secretion of melatonin and adjustment to your new time zone I am only aware of one thing that suppresses melatonin and that would be light is there something else does cortisol suppress melatonin are there other do we know the two things that have the biggest impact on our circadian rhythm are number one blue light blue daylight spectrum light and that is the strongest what we call lifegiver giver or zeitgamer to our circadian system so light comes in through the eyeballs and it travels along the optic chiasm to a tiny region of the brain called the superchiasmatic nucleus and that's the circadian rhythm home in the brain and then that's kind of fires the secretion of melatonin if the eyes detect absence of blue daylight spectrum light but if bedtime approaches and you open up a computer screen that has full brightness you're going to be giving yourself a physiological cue to become alert and awake because the eyeballs will receive blue daylight spectrum light from that screen and think it's time to become alert and awake and so we're virtually shooting ourselves in the foot when we use blue light emitting devices before bedtime there's a free software called flux f dot l ux and it's free widely available I'm not affiliated with them but I personally use the technology you're doing amazing and what that will do is it will take away the blue from a computer screen so if you must be working before bedtime do consider flux and what's nice is you can set it up so that it just goes on automatically and as the sun sets in your time on your laptop or your tablet then the screen will become warmer so blue daylight spectrum light is the strongest input to our circadian system and exposure to blue light at inappropriate times will disrupt the flow of melatonin the second is meal timing a meal consumed to light will disrupt the circadian system and could make it difficult to fall asleep that night and experience consolidated for a story to sleep now we make a lot of sense and we do see a lot of disregulated eating in general I think not only do we have a ton of external light exposure I don't know is fluorescent also blue I mean there's light pollution everywhere everywhere and it takes a lot of effort and there I think there's also a lot of confusion because there are a lot of devices that say there are circadian lights or there are you know sleep promoting lights which you know also are quite bright and then maybe someone's using that before bedtime so the best thing for your bedroom is to go to a department store or a drug store and buy a sleep friendly light bulb and put that into your light light almost a red light stand yes it's a red spectrum red colors are measured in temperature so it's a warm light it's reds it's maybe oranges those are kind of sleep inducing colors and use that in your bedroom if you're reading before bedtime and then if when you wake up in the morning do you need one of these circadian lights I don't know but I think that you know generally is if you have one in love it amazing but getting outside into the natural blue daylight spectrum light kind of as soon as possible is great for helping our helping a line our internal circadian rhythms I do know with the kids every day I don't know if you think about do you do that too with your kids right now I can yeah okay all right guys let's go I'll just go in the amount of the house and sometimes the best light we do we know the impact of exercise and the types of exercise on sleep quality this is a great question for so long in sleep we would discourage exercise at night now I think the research is still emerging but what we've found is that generally if you're getting exercise that's the most important predictor of good sleep quality we we really care less when you get it there have been a couple studies one in vigorous activity for instance doing a very vigorous you know high intensity workout before bedtime is ill advised that does you know have some negative impact on sleep but by and large just making time for exercise and really not worried about when you do it as long as you get it in and this question is related to our circadian rhythm preference our chronotype because if you're a true morning person one of the other questions I'd like to ask it's a great predictor of where you are on the spectrum from morningness to eveningness is when you do your best work and when you want to work out a true morning person will say oh you know the morning or an evening person will say I love to get a workout enough to work I don't think I've had a handful of times have you ever worked out after work oh my god I it's very hard I need a lot of motivation or you know it's not gonna happen I'm exhausted I'd rather get a bit for to train than I would rather train at 5pm I also think you know or poor evening people in our society I feel like I want to advocate for even true evening types because there's so many things in society that privilege a morning person even you know our figures of speech that early bird gets the worm and there's so many people the true evening types the idea of a 9 a.m. wake up is very stressful and then think about a commute to get to a 9 to 5 office job for a young professional who's a true evening type it's really hard I dream of a workplace where the quality of our work will be the biggest predictor of schedules you know if you're doing enough I don't really care where you are or you know when you're doing it as long as you're able to get the sleep that you need and that's the the biggest most important question employer should be asking how can we set our employees up for success think there's such a focus on you know being at the office but you know the hours aren't ideal for many many millions of Americans do you think that the environment matters in the way that if we are exposed all the time to blue light under fluorescent light do we wear we use flux in the evening do we wear red light glasses blue light blocking glasses should we be spending four hours or more of our time outside to to combat this light this is a great question I think sometimes we can get to in our head about things and I think the bottom line is more fresh air the better and natural fresh air what comes with that often during the daytime at least is exposure to blue daylight spectrum light getting more fresh air more sunlight exposure over the course of the day the better so think about ways to build that into your daily routine so you can kind of it to behavioral economics can you know fall into place and you can just reap the benefits if that means you know if you're like look I work in an office building I don't have a lot of opportunity to get outside one simple way to get a little bit more fresh air is to if you're live in a city walk one extra subway stop or park your car far away from the entrance and walk for five minutes take a call that you can off video and go outside so I'm really the more the better and in the morning is terrific but sunlight explosion the afternoon is also great so many people are reaching for a coffee or you know a sugary sweetened beverage in the afternoon and I get it we all experience a little bit of dip and alertness but if we combated that with either a power nap if you're really tired or simply going outside and walking around the block and getting exposure to sunlight can have the energizing benefits of caffeine without the cheddar's or the adverse implications for your sleep that night hydration isn't just about drinking coxero or other sugar free swing beverages like breadball now I'm saying this for a friend or it's not even about drinking more water it's about keeping the right balance of electrolytes and fluids during life's most demanding season like I don't know parenting maybe pregnancy or postpartum your body is going through massive changes blood volume increases hormones shift breastfeeding demands you know all those things all of these life transitions you probably need more and better hydration and you need electrolytes like sodium magnesium and potassium element is formulated to replenish what you actually lose without sugar fillers and junk that you don't need it's a clean effective way to stay hydrated and for men again it's not just about hydration it's also about performance recovery mental clarity and yes even energy whether you're hitting the gym chasing kids or grinding through your workday maybe even your teeth dehydration can quietly sabotage your focus and endurance element helps you stay sharp strong and ready we use element because it works taste amazing and it's no nonsense just science back hydration that actually makes a difference and right now element is offering a free sample pack with any purchase that's eight flavors to try on the house go to drink lmnt.com slash doctor lion to claim yours that's drink lmnt.com slash doctor lion stay hydrated stay strong and as goggins would say stay hard the power nap is interesting does it have to be 20 minutes if you're tired enough could you fall asleep for 10 mm what's so interesting about naps is maybe even less is is is is beneficial and in a little bit of a different way research from MIT just revealed that brief naps i'm talking seconds moments of sleep over the course of the day allow you a tiny bit of what we call hypnagogia sleep it's that way station from sleep to wake fullness or the other way it's that way station between wakefulness and sleep and we're finding the research is showing that moments seconds in hypnagogia sleep is associated with bursts and creativity and the ability to come up with solutions to complex problems and what i love about that research is it really lowers the stakes so many people say oh I can't nap I've seen the research I wish I could but I can't and what that says is don't worry if you can get a couple minutes you are in great shape to you know crush the rest of your day and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter when you do it the ideal time for a nap is in the dip in our circadian rhythm in the afternoon which we all experience whether you're a true evening person or a true morning person we all simply experience a dip in our alertness in the afternoon why because we've been up for you know so many hours so far in the day we've consumed a lot of information there's a small drop in our core body temperature in the afternoon so it's kind of the perfect storm for a nap and that's also a really good litmus test for whether you're getting enough sleep how do you feel in the afternoon are you exhausted are you like listen I need something to get me through that's a really good brahmeter for whether you're getting enough sleep at night 20 minutes is considered a power nap so moments are haven't been shown to be beneficial and then what we call a power nap what is it just going under the bed can you imagine all right guys just give me a second and my husband do I he could fall asleep right here for two minutes I love it I love it but he he needs a lot more sleep he will get it once he's done with his residency yes he's doing such an amazing job and remember these periods of life are fortunately fortunately short-lived for many of us the reality is most of us are not getting enough sleep and I don't want anyone to feel bad is there listening to this going oh I wish I get more sleep is there a way to recover and I don't just mean in the short term the rain function the executive function you know from years of lack of sleep of doing all of the things I'm not from being in high school all of the research is showing that sleep the quantity and quality of our sleep at night is a significant predictor of our health are well-being today tomorrow and well into the future but importantly sleep is not going to be perfect every night and that's because sleep is part of the fabric of the human condition and stress is all around us I think now more than ever and if you've been experiencing stress you're you could have done everything else right but you go into your bedroom and you slip into in between the sheets and you toss and turn and it could be because of something a co-worker said or maybe stress that you weren't managing over the course of the day or some negative experiences you approach bedtime you know scaring that flicks show the list goes on but yeah those definitely don't watch this you know sometimes there are things that are out of our control do you have tips or tricks I mean I want to share mine because I have a handful that I think will solve everybody's sleep problems it doesn't include alcohol number one sheets I know that sounds ridiculous but the sheets have to be cool and they have to be really silky again maybe it's a personal preference it just makes if you are physically so comfortable that's incredible I couldn't agree more and you want your bedroom to be the place that you look forward to I can tell that you love your sheets and what a beautiful hack like that's one thing that's easy to change sometimes it's hard for all of us to go out and get a new mattress but by the way we should be sleeping on a mattress for maybe seven maybe eight maybe nine years but not much longer than that but read it some research recently and we found that one in three Americans have had their mattress for far too long but a mattress is expensive and I think some of the other elements of your bedroom environment your pillows your sheets you can upgrade and they don't have to be expensive but I do encourage go to whatever store find sheets that you love just like you love yours and you want to look at your bed and want so badly to get a look forward to sleep does it matter the kind of mattress doesn't matter if it's firm or not firm is there any data that would support people sleep better with x or at a 5% in-cline on a pillow we are actually doing some of these studies right now to look at the best sleep surfaces and the components of an ideal mattress springs you know what is the top or those types of questions that stay tuned but in line there is a lot of individual preference however if you're talking about a really plush surface versus a you know a really firm surface there is a lot of individual difference and some people you know really look forward to a plush you know would love a plush experience meaning something very soft others much prefer a firm surface and I do think the your sleep position matters so if you're a side sleeper imagine your body on its side on the mattress do you want a side sleeper I am a stomach sleeper you amazing you're part of the the minority there aren't a lot of stomach sleepers you know how that is possible now I think it's quite I think it's fascinating that we all have these preferences that we just moved into I'm a side sleeper and specifically I kind of curl into a the fetal position covered by pillows my husband gives me such a hard time for he's a bit of wine and I have like 16 on my side we they're more about the kisser than what position is this that is it's so funny there's actually a scientific research on this one of my favorite studies looked at different sleeper positions and had all these cute names for all the different types and that is called the starfish pose I kids are 100% starfish no no my husband doesn't move he's a boxley bar okay interesting you both you have two starfish that's so interesting and this research was it was interesting they delivered the big five personality assessment and then asked questions about your sleeper position they found that extra vines were associated the starfish pose was you're more likely to be an extra word if you slept as a starfish so there you go you have two extra birds maybe on your hand and then what about the rest the I have to go back to the paper for all the other I think you're more introverted if you're if you sleep like I do actually which is which is true I think I'm an extraverted introverted side but um the fetal position you're a little bit more introverted no I'm spaced down nobody touched me I'm just in my silky she's I love I'm not sure in I'm not sure in I'm not sure I love I love I love all my wax earplugs when she needs I love that so much because that is your routine and what you've actually done is you've classically conditioned yourself to put in your earplugs put on your eye mask slip into your sheets a swim your position and go to sleep and these little things makes such a difference and what I also love about that routine is you can take it with you on the road I do I told you there we go it's days packed it's beautiful and then you can have some protection because you never can guarantee a quiet bedroom when you're traveling the light environments so many even clean nice hotels often have that sliver of light what about their quality we do see a strong association between the quality of our environment and our sleep so if there's poor air quality if it's stuffy if there are allergens we do see that that does interrupt our sleep so buying an air purifier that can promote good air air flow and air quality can be useful do you usually use air filter I do like a not the part of my sleep routine I also do earplugs in my mask every night I've brands that I love and I know that I can there might go to things and I take those with me when I travel I also do like a little bit of background noise and so that is one nice thing that an air purifier provides is a little bit of background noise to attenuate any interruptions you know a siren even a town over you can sometimes hear you know in the country or if you're in an urban environment there are definitely going to be noises is there any data that would support an enhances sleep or does something to the brain while the brain is going through its cognitive processes or contamination research to show that pink noise which are generally kind of natural sounds can be associated with memory consolidation. What's the difference between pink and white noise? Basically a different frequency of sound white noise tends to be a little bit more of a static or mechanic noise where pink noise is typically a natural sound it doesn't make sense because white noise is a little jarring yes so one of the biggest differences is that pink noise has more power at lower frequencies it's typically natural sounds rain or a babbling brok and research has shown associations between the use of pink noise and memory consolidation believe it or not. You have talked a lot in the past about cognitive health Alzheimer's sleep mortality are there sleep biomarkers that we would be able to look for? Sleep is a really rich process and I think we often kind of hyper focus on duration getting enough duration is a really important part of the equation for the vast majority of adults that's between seven and nine hours and finding where you are on that spectrum and ideally meeting it is many nights of the week as possible realizing not every night is going to be perfect but doing your best. Now in addition to getting enough sleep is consistently that is another vitally important thumbprint of what constitutes good sleep health consistently meaning falling asleep at the same time and waking up at the same time as many nights of the week as possible and keeping those times as close together as possible varying by maybe 15 minutes here 30 minutes there an hour but really not no longer than that. Now in addition I want you to wake up and I want you to feel good from sleep I want you to tell me that you feel restorative. Now in addition to duration to the consistency of our sleep to being satisfied with our sleep consolidated sleep is also vitally important sleeping as much as possible in one consolidated period of sleep that's not interrupted by multiple prolonged awakenings waking up from time to time is not a problem as long as you keep the lights low it's typically to use the bathroom and come back to bed as soon as you can. Those are the four markers of what we call a good night's sleep and doing your best to meet those is many nights of the week as possible but I think one of the things that we do is we kind of will hyper focus on duration and we'll talk about all of the the dangerous and scary things that happen if you don't meet those things but the truth is sleep is not going to be perfect every night but the key is getting back on track is quickly as possible towards those four components. Now those are kind of the manifestations of a good night's sleep but the interesting thing about sleep is health behavior is it's also intimately related to a constellation of other things. I mean I like to say that good sleep really starts when you wake up and getting plenty of blue light natural sunlight exposure over the course of the day the timing of your meals this is your work the composition of your meals managing your stress over the course of the day I think one of the most powerful tools there's really not widely understood is meditation and mindfulness and those tools allow you to find peace in a moment. Do you meditate before sleep? I do. I have to very regimented. What's your pre-sleep routine? I do. Well after the kids are asleep I do the whole wash my face I use this essential oil yes I do. I like that. Sometimes I use the wax your plugs sometimes I don't I only see where my husband is home does he store is that way? Yeah we love him. No he actually is so bad man. Really? Yes. Okay yes. Oh that's a whole other. It is a whole I mean he has I know it's next like 18 inches but I see pop we have yes he does. I mean like I'm from you which way it's very romantic. Oh yeah like the sleep that's like that's what I'm asking. But I love that that's right. Yeah the other aspect is I'll put on a meditation before you're going to sleep. I love that 15 20 minutes. The same one do you know I'll switch it up or that or some kind of noise not white noise but some kind of. What's so beautiful about that is that it's your routine and you've classically conditioned yourself to wash your face to start your meditation to put on your eye mask and then your brain starts to understand that what follows is sleep and I think sometimes we're I can look we have busy days now more than ever filled with information and all of this stuff and that our day comes to a screeching halt at night and I think that whole bedtime procrastination trend emerged because especially younger generations who are being told to do things all day long and then they finally have some agency at night and they kind of push back on the idea of needing to sleep or needing to keep a bedtime but a good night's rest is the strongest predictor of so many aspects of our waking success. Better productivity, better mental health, better mood, better exercise when you exercise you're going to get more out of your sleep if you're well rested. So many positive things when you can put sleep first but our days are busy and then they come to a screeching halt and I think that the time between you send the last email and for us as bombs putting our kids to bed it's so easy to think you know I'd love to have a watch a show or you know but then unfortunately what can happen is a lot of times that the next show will start and suddenly there's not a lot of awareness about your bedtime for many people and watchers for that reason it's so dangerous it's a risky game right because then you want to know what happens next if it's a show I'm at no I love that and finding ways to relax and kind of fuel your soul and prepare you for sleep so that you can get the the rest that your body needs. If an individual is sleeping is there a way to see if there's an improvement in brain function with that beyond the EEG again that's probably outside of what would happen at sleep but assuming that you can see the health of the brain while it's sleeping is that this is a good Now of course we need to be measuring brain activity to really know without a shadow of a doubt where you are in terms of light sleep, sleep, sleep, drop and I move, sleep. Now as it relates to brain health and function and structure what I think the response I'd make is kind of twofold first if you take someone who has maybe what we call yo-yo sleep schedules which are you know keeping one bedtime one night you know falling asleep at 10 p.m. one night two a.m. the next night waking up at 10 a.m. one morning you know six a.m. the next morning so all over the map which is quite common so an irregular sleep schedule or maybe not getting enough sleep so if you take someone who is maintaining a schedule like that can sleep and wake time all over the map, sleep duration all over the map and you move them into a regimented sleep schedule during sleep what's going to change is the structure is going to improve so that we're going to see a healthy cycling in and out of all the stages at the times that we would expect to see those stages again deep sleep predominating in the first half of the night and wrap and I move mentally up in the second half of the night so the structure of your brain activity over the course of the night will become more regulated and you'll go and get more out of your sleep also if you move someone from even someone getting enough sleep but keeping that what we call yo-yo sleep schedule falling asleep at different times all over the week waking up at different times all over the week we take someone like that who's getting enough sleep but we look at the structure of their sleep it's going to be all over the map and if we move that person even to a slightly shorter sleep schedule but a consistent one so many things improve and their brains start to understand oh this is what I'm going to fall asleep and then it can align itself within that period in a much more efficient way so that sleeper is going to move even if they're getting a little less sleep into a schedule that's more consistent and more regulated and wake up and probably have more energy than the person who is maybe even getting more sleep but sleeping all over the map is there any data and this might be very hard to study but the that glimphatic system cleanage the cellular turnover do we know if it's more effective that mirrors that regular consistently what we do know is in lab studies and these have been done in rodents because we can inject the brains of rodents on the doctor's mind so not quite know but what those and what's so interesting is these findings were developed by neuroscientists who wasn't necessarily a sleep scientist but had this amazing finding and in rodents they found that the brains of of these rodents in their studies that were sleep deprived compared to well rested there was an accelerated clearance of toxic particles which are observed of course in greater deposition in humans with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia as compared to healthy controls so there's this increased clearance of these neural toxins in the rodents that were allowed to sleep to the tune of 60 percent greater clearance in the well rested rodents is compared to the sleep deprived isn't that fascinating and mechanistically what's happening there is there's this fluid I like to think of it as like drain out it's washing through the networks of our brain and the glial cells expand when we're sleeping allowing for accelerated clearance of those toxic particles and that accelerated removal then results in better brain health over time and we've looked at this in humans and we found that in cohorts of older adults we've published several papers on this where individuals enter the cohort at age 65 and we monitor them over time and those individuals that are maintaining poor sleep schedules they're struggling to get good sleep maintaining in consistency schedules there at a market increase risk for dementia as compared to the individuals we're getting consistent and regular healthy sleep I'd like to acknowledge one of the sponsors and that's our place I'd also like to

a position on sleep medications things like ambian lunasta i understand it certain people translate on i know that people need them but as a sleep scientist do you have concerns about their utility this is a great question and there are many millions of americans were using sleep medications and there is a time and a place for medication and for some patients it is a lifeline if someone is really struggling with sleep and has been for many years so the first answer is talk to your health care provider and create a plan that works for you some of the research shows in the longer term it is advantageous to move onto a behavioral change regime but what is interesting in individuals who have the option and think they might be open to behavioral intervention or medication the research that pits those two treatments had to had pharmacological intervention and behavior change specifically cognitive behavioral change for better sleep we refer to this as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or cbti when we take that treatment and we compare it to pharmacological intervention those two patients suffers of insomnia and we compare them over time the behavioral treatment wins out in the short and especially in the longer term the unfortunate thing is we have a death of sleep providers that can provide this treatment so that's one of the interesting and exciting applications of artificial intelligence for the future to think about providing some of these behavioral treatments I was going to ask you what is your very involved in sleep sleep nationally sleep globally where do you think that the future is going in terms of tracking improving outcomes testing what is on the forefront of sleep I am really excited about the intersection of some of the new technologies we're seeing and sleep and specifically in my work which is behavioral interventions I one of my areas of expertise is designing interventions to nudge and navigate patients and populations towards better sleep and I am so excited at the idea of developing an avatar that could deliver tailored personalized recommendations it could help you you know make sense and act on your information from your wearable device we know how exciting to take you know this the problem which is a death of sleep providers and think about sleep interventions at scale I also think the trend towards sleep tracking is incredibly exciting these devices are increasingly relied upon by many millions of Americans we published data in 2019 to show that one and three Americans were tracking their sleep with some sort of wearable technology and I think that that number has only increased since that time and so ensuring that these devices are increasingly accurate increasingly small increasingly scalable and soon I hope also able to detect signs and signals for sleep disorders that people might not even be aware they have and might be limiting their sleep quality what would be one of those disorders there are more than 80 differentially diagnosable sleep disorders but a couple of the big ones are in Somnia number one it impacts anywhere between 30 and 40 percent of the population depending on how we're measuring it and studying it and in what population but it's a condition that is depilitating for many it is characterized by a chronic experience of difficulty falling asleep so taking longer than 30 45 minutes night in and night out difficulty maintaining sleep so maybe being able to fall asleep but then waking up and fighting struggling to get back to sleep waking up too early in the morning and not being able to fall back asleep and those are typically also accompanied with feelings of exhaustion during the day individuals who suffer from insomnia will tell us that they are absolutely exhausted and the frontline treatment for sleep for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when available or a pharmacological intervention and then kind of titrating to get onto a behavioral regime often with insomnia we're trying to do away with maladaptive cognitions about sleep someone within insomnia will walk into their bedroom and their cortisol will spike which we know interrupts irritability to relax and prepare for sleep the second most concerning sleep disorder is obstructive sleep apnea and that is you know as a condition marked by often loud snoring loud raucous snoring but also interruptions or pauses and breath somewhere is scary yes yes is a spouse and so if those symptoms sound familiar to anyone listening there are treatments it's imminently treatable which is the good news and there are a range of options but do find a sleep professional to coach you on the available options for your personal needs and treatment is a significant predictor of better quality of life better sleep of course better heart health often in patients with untreated sleep apnea blood pressure can become uncontrolled many issues start to snowball when you're not getting proper treatment for obstructive sleep apnea that's absolutely true blood pressure human globin hematocrit people they just don't feel well low testosterone you know the good news is there are a lot of you know very easy to deliver questionnaires that are very sensitive for your risk for these things so you don't often even have to go into a sleep lab just to get a sense of if you're at risk for some for some of these conditions the aporus sleepiness scale the insomnia severity index for any providers or clinicians listening the Berlin questionnaire the stop bang questionnaire or all widely used validated questionnaires that can give you a difference to see if your primary care provider could give you a really good sense of whether a patient you're seeing as at risk for any of these disorders I want to close out this podcast with some common sleep myths what is your top three myths that you hear number one is this belief that there's some people out there somewhere somehow that do well on less than seven hours and there might be they're very poorly studied if they are out there people who truly truly need less than seven hours and they have a kind of appropriate health profile but we do find there's several notable figures Thomas Edison was born in there been others in across across history that people who brag about not cutting enough sleep but Thomas Edison yes he probably slept around four hours at night but he had a cut in his office and he was known for taking protracted naps so it is not in fact true that he was only sleeping for four hours a day he simply wore that on his shoulder as a valour of honors somehow despite all of the health concerns but was in fact likely sleeping closer to sign so really duration we can't there's no cure there's no silver bullet we do need to spend the time sleeping but the secret is if you can combine a healthy duration of sleep with consistent sleep you start to maybe need a little bit less sleep overall because your sleep will become so consolidated and so efficient within the time that we're provided the idea of bedtime routines and the time before sleep we don't often factor that in but it is a vitally important part of a sleep routine we're really not made to fall asleep immediately quickly right away but we need to set ourselves up for success and just knowing that can be helpful and then creating a relaxing bedtime ritual whether that's doing a couple breathing exercises reading a couple pages in a book one simple thing that I love to talk about is just one good thing from your day think sometimes at night time all the bad stuff can snowball but if you close your eyes and breathe and focus on one person that touched you in some way you know touched your heart was kind to you was thoughtful one nice thing that you did can also sometimes make us feel good ourselves that can just put you in the right headspace to drift off to sleep and then number two I'd say is this myth that falling asleep quickly is a sign of good sleep so often people say oh you know I'm such a bad sleeper it takes me 15 20 minutes I'm like you know it takes a healthy sleeper 15 to 20 minutes to fall asleep but I think that that some people think of that is you know what's wrong with me so falling asleep quickly just as if you were underfed and you were presented with a buffet and you helped yourself to a ton you know a ton of food right away and you're you're starved for food so similarly if you're falling asleep right away you're probably starved for sleep and the third myth is snoozing so many people at dinner parties or you know wherever we'll open their phone and show me a dozen snooze alarms and they're like look at me I get all this extra sleep and that is another myth that hitting the snooze alarm will give you more sleep what the vast majority of us are doing if we're using this snooze alarm is you're looking at your schedule so you have to get up at 7 o'clock for work and that's a non-agosable to commute to get ready to all do you all of your things so what people are typically doing is setting their first alarm for 630 and then for 640 and then 640 and I'm like guys let's just set it for 7 and find the latest possible time set your alarm and then it's gonna be tough you've got to get your butt out of bed but just commit say you know I'm gonna maximize my sleep and maybe put my phone on the other side of the room so I'm not tired of this mess again it's genius we're all inspired to sleep more and you know what you don't make it some people and that means so much to me it's just important you're really on this mission to improve cognition through sleep and just better life and if we can get ahead of it then we can get ahead of it for our children absolutely set them up for a more resilient life if we can do that it's the biggest gift as parents yeah I think I'm a good sleep think about it when they are disregulated it's oftentimes when they're tired 100% doctor Rebecca Robbins you're just a joy and like why it's so fun to be able to sit down with my friends and people that I just respect and admire the work that they're doing the world so to this I would say good day but I'm gonna say good night and can we add sweet rums
