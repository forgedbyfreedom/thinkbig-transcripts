Some of these guys that have to make wait for classic and the things that they're asked to do and it's not that their coach wants to do it. It's just that what they realistically have to do to make wait from not eating for two to three days, who excessive diuretic and water use water loss from diuretics. And he's right, it's not safe. And I think that I've been saying this for a couple years now that the next major injury that our sports going to come from a classic guy trying to make wait. I honestly, I probably only have two clients at FTAF to be sure. Two clients that are over two million today. So many people are responding to the vast majority of people to the low dose. 100 milligrams of training a week or 500 deck of now we got a conversation. But in my mind, milligrams of milligrams, I think, I'm trying to probably the most advantageous drug to put on muscle to keep muscle while in a deficit on all scenarios. Yeah. Hate safe. Yep.

I'm hanging here with coaches, skip Hill, Andrew Barry. I think between the three of us, we might have like a hundred. I might be exaggerating by a few years. I was gonna say a hundred years of coaching experience. Can I? I probably do have at least 20. We do have 60, 70 somewhere. It'd be closer to 60 than 70 I think. Right? But that's a lot of coaching experience. Skip has been coaching longer than any of us like 20 years in the world. I think. Seeing people try to get their thoughts up in a lot. Before the depression. Yeah. I've got stories. And we're here today to share our experience with you guys. And you know, I'm not gonna say that there is only one way to do things. In fact, if you ever listen to a podcast and people say there's one way to do things I would had the other direction. But we will give you our experiences. So, call me how work with you. There's a guy on the bottom of the list. He's only one way. It's not his way. All right. So we got a bunch of stuff though. And like I said, we have got questions in the feed. You guys have left us a ton of questions. But just to kick us off, I wanted to go to a story that's, I guess, breaking news in the bodybuilding world. Did you guys see this? I guess that yours is not going to be doing classic anymore. He is not going to be doing two, twelve either. He's just jumping straight to open bodybuilding. He made a post today. And basically he said, I decided to switch to the open class of bodybuilding and wanting to inform everybody on his thought process behind the decision. The struggle to cut weight for classic has become increasingly difficult to the point that I either had to sacrifice my health tremendously or my best possible physique. So I mean, that's a big part of it there. And I do think that as we continue to grow, you know, a lot of times we end up growing out of classes. But I wanted to get your guys as opinions on this as coaches, you know. And about him as a bodybuilder, where what kind of chance do you guys think he'll have and how long is it going to take him to be competitive in the open ranks? First of all, I just want to throw in there that I don't know if anybody else feels the same way. I just think he's being a pussy. I think at the end of the day, this is not about health. So you know, put it all on a lot now. I'm kidding. I'm. Yeah. I mean, I think it's a pretty, you know, I mean, I don't know what decision I'd make it that level because I've never been that level. But I can certainly see where the health looks. I can appreciate it. I guess I can believe it at that. What do you guys think? Well, let me first say that when I was at the New York Pro this year, I turned around. And there was someone standing facing away from me wearing a hoodie. Yeah. What a sworn it was Marcus Rull. Yeah. And when he turned around, it was yours. Okay. That's how big he looked. You guys remember how big Marcus Rull was. He had, he had to have been 275, 280 thick muscular, you know, kind of like, actually, there's Marcus Rull right there. Right there. Well, that's a good pole right there. Maybe they were related on some level. But all right. So a couple of things. First thing that comes in my mind is some of these guys that have to make wait for classic and the things that they're asked to do. And it's not that their coach wants to do it. It's just that what they realistically have to do to make wait from not eating for two to three days, right? You excessive diuretic and water use water loss through diuretics. And he's right. It's not safe. And I think that I've been saying this for a couple of years now that the next major injury or death in our sports going to come from a classic guy trying to make wait. And it brings to my next point that to me, classic is a look. It's not a heightened wait. Class definition. And I think the IFBB should really look at this and decide if they want some of their best athletes in classic to be able to compete in classic and look at increasing the way caps again. At least on the pro-prodivision. You know? Because a lot of guys will turn pro-arty at cap. And then you get four to six pounds depending. And the weirdest thing is you get more wait the lighter you are. And like the the the taller you are, there's less of a cap increase, which is really weird. So now okay you you have two or three years you're putting on more size your body building your growing, but now you're capped out again. And you're playing the game all over again that you're playing at nationals or USA's doing some excessive stuff just to make wait. And we don't want to see guys running their kidneys. We don't want to see guys having events backstage or not even making it to the stage. So I do think the IFBB needs to look at this if they want to have their best athletes. Now with that said, I was at the Texas the other day last week. And one of my buddies Ben Hodge was he was there to do classic and they had changed the height on him. So he had heighted in it one height and his previous pro shows and his pro qualifier. And then at this one they they heighted him in I believe a half inch shorter than than what he was at that previous date. And which means he needed to drop seven pounds in the next three hours somehow. Now some can do it maybe but he's already you know we're tired to make that what that wait cap that he was already at. And think about it you spent the money to all all the preparation fly out there. You've got your hotel like you invested a lot to get into the I think it sucks that they make you height in every show. I feel like there should be a recorded yearly you don't have sand. That's the thing is that you can they take the average of your three. Okay. And then I guess that's only going to last for that year though. But so what classic pros are competing three times a year and then going to another you know maybe the Olympia it's rare that there's some guys that are competing that often but it's pretty rare so I don't think the I think once you hit a certain height taken never taken away from you I feel like if it's been a certified height check at an IFBB or NPC national show that's the height you get to bring with you in my I could go with that difficult is it to get the height correct. I mean well I mean there's a lot of factors though like for instance all of my classic guys that are very close they're going to the chiropractic the day of wins they're doing they're hanging from like a pull-up bar or they're doing like an like I've got a inversion table for my deck here they're doing it on table oh yeah I'm looking right out it through the window they're doing the inversion tables that day they're doing everything they can to stay as tall as it can because you are gonna you can get like a quarter a half of an inch and how you when you're separating your discs like that but when you're you know what I mean and that's your your dead center you're dead right on that but let me give you back to what I was saying about Texas and Ben yeah so like you said he flew all the way out there's been all that money now this show also had open so they you know that he just switched his entry to the open okay being a really good athlete at 240 tiny waste great lines in the classic doesn't necessarily translate to the open because he ended up you know he finished in the last call out now he looked great it's just the size and density of the guys in the open are that it's that much of a difference right and I'm not saying Earth's can't do that but I just I think it's gonna be another two or three years before he's able to capture that that muscular church to stand next to guys that are you know four inches shorter than him three to four inches shorter than him but equal and wait let me throw something into you guys and I understand you guys or even some of the viewers would be like that's just insane but why have the wake cap why not just judge it based on the classic look anything to do with you yeah just don't place his eye the only thing that I can think think of is it does for the competitor well arguably for the crowd too but it could make it a little bit a bit more subjective to where you can't figure out like well why did my guy not do and as a competitor well why did I know that I was but these judges I mean you just judge it and then you take the health component out of it so if we as a as an industry not just the competitors but also the the audience and the people who support the competitors could appreciate the judging component and respect it then we would arguably just eliminate that being an issue so I see what they're doing but how funny or oddly ironic that they're trying to keep the drugs under control by keeping it in why do we control drugs because we want it to be healthier we don't want and then we're causing more problems right with the parameters that we're putting in place it's just it's an odd dichotomy it doesn't work it doesn't work it's not it reminds me a little bit of government when you think about it but that's another rabbit hole it arguably is put you in worse health because no one's hurting themselves with one individual pd shot right but you can certainly hurt yourself over the last two three days of a contest prep by over dioratic yourself you can end your life in a matter of hours if you are not taking the right elector lights have too much of the wrong elector lights and stacking multiple dioratic and need to drop another seven pounds more in three hours than you didn't before when you have everything on the line and you're three hours from the finish line yeah who's not gonna gamble at that point he didn't I was arguably I respected but he probably knew I've already taken enough right to get underneath this I can't my body can't take anymore this or I'm gonna end up in the hospital yeah I had to agree and you not only the health but also the look like the gamble on your look because you might not be able to bring it back you know we were just talking on it's just body building about Paul Demail and the health issues that he ended up with no I'm excuse me Mike Mazurado that's who it was and the health issues that he ended up with yeah yeah around Mike what's up are of all the pride written over 350 articles for lead up to us and the one that still will get nasty vicious comments coming at me was the one the article that I wrote about Mike Madarazo that and I'm paraphrasing it basically said the title was I'm not sad for Mike Madarazo so people I think read the title and then read the article to fit their narrative because they were already pissed the the just of the article was I respect that Mike made the decisions that he made followed his passion knew what the consequences were because anybody who says they didn't know that's bullshit he knew what the consequences were that was his passion that's how he lived is like any lived is like the way he wanted to it's no different than jumping out of planes or earn art racing around the track and any dies in a car yeah but we're the point being that like back then all the loop diuretics that we're being used and wrong pointed out that like because I mentioned I was like man when it worked it really worked wow and they were so yeah and when it didn't you were way yeah it was better way we need to be often 20 minutes yeah had a lot of experience with with LASIX and it would it would mix things real quick yeah 20 minutes later be it could be oh crap especially how shows are run today like where they say it's a 9 a.m. start well that might end to be on stage of 10 20 right your best look was an hour and a half ago and now you're just sitting there looking at the guys that didn't use diuretics same man why did I take it why did I like you wanted to use LASIX basically while you were staged yeah ready to go on because then you knew you had about 20 minutes yeah yeah so I'm gonna roll the dice dude in the national shows which you know even worse man you want to clock two o'clock three o'clock you know yeah like right now all right yeah I thought it was worse bringing up though I thought that this was an interesting topic I'm gonna be curious to see what he does man I mean I I love yeah as a like a meathead you know as somebody who loves to see dudes that are just embracing body building like I'm curious to see now like what's gonna happen to him what's this physique gonna look like taking the governor off and getting his big as he can yeah if there's anybody I feel like in the sport that has just this great attitude like he always has smiling yeah he really doesn't seems like you in any situation getting third place that the limpia training with Chris Bumster in the videos he just seems like a guy that he's gonna give you energy you know like he's gonna pick you up especially if you're having hard days during prep you know he's suffering too but he looks like he doesn't even feel it you know yeah and I'll say I first hand experience with a psych Rebecca stage because I competed with them in 2021 you did yeah this is his breakout you're when he he won the Tampa okay and smoked everybody I mean the Neil Curry was in second place and looked good RAP okay but no his energy backstage that same goofy smile like hey how do I look you know and like and just hitting like weird poses and like you know just that camaraderie or that there was a familiarity that had like I don't know you but he just comes up and like puts his hand behind you like how you doing you know like like one of those types of things so very friendly competitor probably you know the life of the party in any situation he's in so I'm a big fan of his I hope he does really well that's cool I saw him with Steve vigorous Steve and Victoria and I were all heading into the cheesecake factory in Vegas and he was sitting outside of the cheesecake factory I think he maybe I don't know if he was just hanging out or he just ate there but he stopped Steve and he was like hey I watched this video of yours particular topic he was like that was a really good man and you know a chatted it up for for just a minute so he and he seemed like a cool guy there so I'll be curious man maybe anyway we got a bunch of stuff though and I do want to mention I should probably bring this up straight away Andrew dude we got freaking thrashed on the last episode especially after I put that short out the YouTube short which was also the Instagram reel about John Meadows and I wore my shirt today in honor of John if you could read that it says pancakes are my protocol is my favorite shirt of John's and there was a day I remember wearing this on the podcast and he commented on Mr. Eum say and hey I like your shirt man John's on my shirt you know but we so we we had a clip where you said John was on once he see a test year round and then he'd do like you know I think it was 50 anodraw a day for a couple weeks two three weeks before the Arnold he blew up for that and you know then look good and I knew you meant the expo and and he would hold that look for a good four to six weeks after and we had people saying BS there's no way that he was on TRT year round BS there's no way that he took 50 milligrams of anodraw before the Arnold and I was like I kind of see where they're going with this you know maybe I should have specified to not as a participant in the Arnold classic I'm saying as he would say to me you know oh yeah I'm on a CC a test year round and then 10 days before an event like the Arnold or the Olympia I just throw in 50 to 100 milligrams of anodraw and I look like I've been cycling for for two three months and that's the gods on a truth because he did look like he'd been cycling hard on stuff that the majority of us would be using and wouldn't look at 10th of his good as he did so I know but look he was probably gods on his truth the lowest dose good pro and I say good pro because he placed top five at several two twelve shows in that one year that I've ever seen I mean when I say he what he did only use one CC 250 milligrams of testosterone year round for prep included and then he would add in a little bit of master on he I know that for he used trying a little bit but he stopped using it towards the end of his shows because it just wasn't working for him he didn't like how he felt on it and I say a little bit of master on I'm talking like 300 milligrams of guys I'm not talking 800 milligrams and thousand talking 300 you think he took more earlier on you know again like when he was building the muscle because he yes I mean I know that he was a hard trainer there's so many crazy stories that I've heard from him in the past and then now still from like Dave Tate of like crazy leg days and stuff I imagine he was gearing up harder back in the day yes like you know we've all seen the videos of him squatting like 650 700 pounds for like a set of eight or whatnot it's actually a video recording of a video recording yeah I don't know if you guys know yeah someone held a cell phone up to a VHS that was playing it because that's how long ago it was recorded right yeah yeah I mean he did the same stuff that all of us did but and I think I mean I'm experiencing now being able to get by with using very little and while I don't look like I'm yoke anymore maintaining a pretty solid look in strength levels being pretty close to where they were on certain exercises on 20 milligrams of testosterone a day so for people to say it's unbelievable that he would be such a low dose competitor in his later years they just don't know you know I mean I've been there with him in his house when he's preparing his job before bed there's not a lot of cc's in that syringe guys it's like some of you I'm not gonna take a video of it and you know posted on internet when when he did it but I have first hand knowledge there was not a lot of stuff in that syringe I just want to say that misery loves companies so to see you get trashed in the comments section I just sat back and kind of smiled because usually it's me you know well technically it's kind of all of us yeah we reflect on each other so when you get trashed I get trashed when it gets just trashed yeah yeah yeah I mean I think sometimes people just can't believe that some guys can use less gear than what they've been programmable and they don't want them yeah they don't yeah I don't want to believe it the fact is it's in front of our our faces you know when I knew what Phil was doing I remember thinking how many years do I have on this guy and this is his second show and I can't touch him I'm a competitor against him in Colorado with the Colorado state and it was very clear that he was if he wanted to that he was just going to blast through the ranks and at no one outside of Colorado really really believed that but in Colorado we saw it firsthand and sure shit that's what that's what happened and he was very very low dose that's back in the message board days when I mean I I would just go at it with people veterans people who would just be like oh he's on ins and you don't know you don't have any idea what he's doing I know because he tells me he's a friend of mine we've had conversations I could tell you that he didn't know what an AI was when I you know tell you what I could see with John I could see him maintaining like when you said that like my thought was like okay so this isn't his years where he's now doing YouTube and stuff and you know he's gonna like still go to the expo and look good there yeah I kind of I doesn't doesn't shock me because I do think that maintaining your muscle isn't as hard as building it you know I I think that like for him to get the legs he had he ran the gear a lot higher than that you know I don't think you were ever saying he didn't well though so let me just apologize if there's any misconception that that's what I was trying to convey because that's not what I was trying to convey I was trying to convey as Scott is pointing out we'll say the YouTube era of John's you know he'd already had his brokard and he was now making a living off of YouTube and running his website and selling his programs and he was still competing for a couple of those years and I'll say this yeah when he was competing it was a 10 week cycle to get shape because I say this a lot and I'll say it again when John started a prep he was in the kind of condition that most of our listeners and most of us dream about getting into for the show yeah I started he started a prep job thing okay and this is he ate super healthy but he would eat three to four meals a day in the off season okay like and that maintained a body weight about 230 yeah still super strong and then he actually added food into his prep until about four or five weeks out then he had to start cascading back down to really get lean when you know your body and you're controlling all the variables and you have low stress and that's a big thing is having solid family church you know a lifestyle that works for you stress was really low it wasn't that hard for him his cheeks were pretty uh pretty minimal too I think people would see him with a donut think that he threw back six donuts no he would eat one and be like oh I'm full I feel like oh guys I could tell you so many stories of time to go with the eat and I'm on paying right so we'll get you know and I remember one time I was dieting I was like eight weeks out from a show and I took him out to a sushi place and he's like oh I got such an appetite we train hard today on like yeah I wrote a chicken and some salad or something like that I get him five or six rolls of sushi right he takes a bite of each one and he was talking aw many so much he takes a bite of each one and then he just sits back like that that's me it's me and I'm like you guys be kidding me right and he's like he's like oh do I just so stuffed already I don't know I don't know to do I'm like you better eat at least another roll because I'm paying for all shit and I know I can't eat it so when you're pocket take them home when you give them to you yeah we know sushi's one of those things where it's like unless you're gonna eat it two to three hours later so yeah it's nice oh yeah I remember asking him on a podcast it was after he had hit retired and I was like so John what's and I remember we're just talking about stuff talking about he's building it's like what's your meal one look like now John he's like you know you're not gonna be impressed by it you know it's like well just late on us man he was like well I two eggs and then started with like I two eggs and like that was his protein for the meal yeah I've seen it first thing like well we had this crazy like day at Bayshore fitness in New Hampshire we were on the road together for granite softaments and my buddy Justin Randall joined us and okay we're at the hotel having breakfast downstairs and this was actually one of those hotels that could cook omelets or they had like you know nice stuff and he goes and he grabs two hard boiled eggs and then he had just like two of those little mini muffins and maybe he knew something I didn't about what he was gonna make us do on the leg day that day because or we messed up after that because I you know I'm eating my normal 60 grams of protein from egg whites and whatnot and a couple whole eggs and I'm eating 80 or 90 grams of carbs from oatmeal and fruit and stuff and you know I need like two or three hours to digest that but I don't know we go right to the gym and it's it's time to warm up and we're getting going up than 45 to 60 minutes I'm like I'm good as I feel good and good guy well I hope that that puts things at rest and if not it is what it is you know what I'm saying you can't we can't make people I mean anything they're not gonna think so there's that I've got a classic pro right now he competed this year his overall PD load was under 700 milligrams and I know people be like all bullshit and no GH I believe it okay two two guys that had said you know I don't want to mess around with trend I haven't tried it you know guys I don't want to mess around with trend until after I get my pro card yeah my go okay and we didn't need guess what we didn't need to we all know that creatin is great for muscle building but were you aware of its benefits for brain health I think it's problems creatin now it's definitely pronounced creatin it's definitely creatin impossible yeah that's pretty much what I said creatin well regardless of what you want to call it creatin plays an important role in brain health research demonstration your brain needs a significant amount of ATP to perform difficult tasks supplementing with creatin will improve phosphocreatin stores helping your brain produce more ATP so if you're not on creatin now give it a try check out true nutrition dot com use our code think over there they got all your basic health supplements like creatin protein powder everything else you can think of use our code think to help support our programming get some additional savings and get a great supplement yeah this is definitely creatin all right let's get into some questions we've got we'll go straight into this is gonna be a YouTube hot topic I think we've got one up here that was what's gonna build more muscle 500 DACA or 500 trend that was in the chat here it is let's show it on the stream yeah which promotes more muscle tissue you I'm taking the trainee 100 out of 100 and I'm not even a trainee fan trainee in trend hacks they might know but if you give me those two I'm probably you know that I'll take trend powder early through my mouth or 500 grams of of DACA and I will still put on more muscle the trend powder okay let me ask you this what if you get terrible side effects from trend like a blood pressure gets through the roof all of a sudden you're a rack and you can't sleep you're constantly thinking the guy behind you is tailgating you want you to really not you know and I'm saying all that kind of stuff would which you you'd still you think you would still make better gains with all that negative stuff go and all that negative energy you're still gonna grow better than with the 500 DACA I mean if you were to if you were to phrase it like 100 milligrams of trendy per week or 500 DACA now we got a conversation right yeah but in my mind middlegram for middlegram I think trend is probably the most advantageous drug you can take to put on muscle to keep muscle while in a deficit all scenarios yeah hey see it but yep yeah I can't argue with that whatsoever do you guys ever use I think we've talked about this before but do you ever use trend E in an off season through like like hey weeks one through 12 trend E yes yeah yeah but I don't like it yeah well okay well let's say let's look at it everywhere could you would you use say like 20 milligrams of a trend A instead or like 30 milligrams of trend A per day instead of a trend E skip I would you know heartbeats yeah yeah so so I guess the quite real question your asking Scott do we use trend for appreciable cycle lengths in the season yeah and answers yes now I haven't recently to be transparent because over with say the last three years I've had cut cycles that are yearly that I know that I want to kind of keep the trend in the cut cycle instead of run it you know twice a year but I have longer cycles than most I've got an example of where I told the guy let's hold off on it in an off season guys in incredible shape right like good aves in fact I told him at his check-in yesterday I was like listen if we had to do a show in six weeks we could like turn this around and in conservatively have him writing in three you know what I mean he's one of those dudes that just stays peeled older guy right no trains from he's got a great home gym set up you know just perfect life set up for bodybuilding and we started a cycle and everything is just at a point now where it's like all peaking you know like everything's like all you know at that high level he's telling me each week that strength is getting better the weight is coming up just a little bit now we're at that point where it came up some and now we're just kind of ticking up half pound to two pounds every week you know but all ended it all looks good and you know little bit of more water in the low back but that's where that six weeks would be like everything else looks ready you know what I mean so anyway he was like hey what do you think you know I throw in 150 treenace now so we're like six weeks into the plan and they told him I was like you know for strength and now he's telling me right now every week he's getting stronger right yeah already we're not that far into a cycle we already have a pretty decent cycle built out with EQ a little bit of mass a little bit of test I think decent amount of test decent amount of mass and some EQ I don't want to under exaggerate that but I thought to myself like if we add that in now my question to him was well like okay well where are we gonna go next you know you know eight weeks down the road what are we gonna do from there you know at that point we might just have to call it good where if we can get another good chunk of time and keep getting stronger with this for another six eight weeks and then maybe run that for another six weeks at the end we'll get like a punch up you know what I mean versus you like your once once we added as I don't want to take it back out and then have like a lull for the last month you know you're talking about saving cards to play for later exactly when progress stops and I think that's a brilliant strategy if if you're I think in bodybuilding sometimes we get too greedy you know when guys are on a roll and things are going good like what else can I do that's gonna speed this up even more like it's a snowball wrong when down a hill you know we're really well I mean right like yeah that's the expectation but it's like really hey let's take what we've been getting and let's be satisfied with that and then when the progress stops then we can always make some changes but yeah one other thing I want to ask you guys because how old is this guy would you say Scott or just give me a range about 50 about 50 okay what do you guys think and skip you the only one I believe in this chat that's 50 plus what do you think about guys well I mean I want your opinion about continuing to try to push strength up like if you let's just let me phrase it if you got a guy who's like hey he's 53 54 I'm hitting strength numbers on par or better than what I was hitting in my 30s when I was kind of taking bodybuilding seriously does that scare you at all or you like yell let's keep going it makes me a little nervous yeah I think if you have a good amount of strength you have a decent strength base then it just should be my recommendation and somebody else may disagree but then just focus on the intensity main try to maintain those that strength mechanical tension you know obviously very important but the intensity I don't I think if you have a weakness where you're just not that strong and you have movements that you're good then that's different but there it is it's comes like an elephant in the room but you have these older guys who just can't stand giving up any amount of strength or admitting this probably isn't the best approach and I've said forever I'll say again that progressive overload in the sense of continuing to to increase strength does create hypertrophy or hypertrophy depends on if you're frustrated or if you're frustrated or if you're taking creatin or creatine but anyway I digress get away as you get older get away from that mindset of I need to push more weight because that doesn't have to happen and it's a dangerous game I got a solution so this guy like when I say he's pushing strength is that we took all his exercises and we retooled everything to slow it all down and make everything a lot harder so it ended up making him initially like quote unquote weaker meaning like he had to use less weight to do the same things and and now he's getting stronger within that so I think that if you like doing that I feel comfortable with him continuing to get stronger because it's like you're not going to hurt yourself no matter what you do with the speed of these negatives you know what I mean 100% yeah that that's just I thought that you know comes across my mind when guys are even my age are older and they're talking about reaching new strength levels and it's like man I would just hate to see you tear quad right hate to see you tear a pack or something at this age right because yeah when you're younger you repair it like in some cases like like for instance some like hunter you know he's got a torn pack from years ago it's not that bad whereas if you're in your 40s and you tear something you're that's going to be pretty evident the competitor it's going to definitely be evident so that's just something across my mind and I agree with your approach God of okay let's retool the exercises let's really slow the negatives down let's work to getting back to those same loads you were using you know maybe six months ago but now with this new form cadence let me throw one more thing into and I'm gonna say this but while I'm making this statement I'm asking you if you guys agree with me how bad as I know I'm speaking for myself with my past injuries and I haven't had a lot when you consider 41 almost 40 years a dream it really haven't had as many as it sounds like when I start rattling them on I think there is always looking back in hindsight there's always red flags after there's something is torn or there's a relatively major injury here's an example if it's a quad issue tell me that your quad tendons weren't stiff or tight like meeting up or maybe your knee was bothering you a little bit or if you get a lower back injury tell me that I would argue and say this you can't tell me that there were no signs leading up to this it's like everything feels great all these reps are fluid everything's good the pumps are insane and then all of a sudden a tour this or I tour that it's not that I look back to my torn bicep I had man boobs it over 260 pounds doing chins my bicep was hurting me prior to that anyway not bad not bad enough to not train but I look back on those signs same thing with the chronic lower back issue so yeah and that's the bulk of my injuries over 41 years but I also haven't had a ton of injuries because I don't have this ridiculous amount strength either and I don't push for that I push for that until what maybe 42ish right around 2012 and that's one of the and it was through the lower back issues I thought I was literally forced not to to train legs heavy because that pressure was going to cause him did continue cause the lower back comes back on the low injuries overall injuries issue would you say also though you weren't dogmatic of trying to force something like if you do a certain exercise like leg press was aggravating your back you're saying I'm not going to do that leg press for a while maybe I'll try again press and probably five years for that reason now I may go and this is this is another good example of potentially where Scott's client is I'll go heavy on belt squats yeah because there's really I don't want to say there's no vulnerability to my lower back but my knees good but if I were to feel something I mean okay then yeah yeah just those exercises that feel good that you can almost say this probably isn't going to be an exercise that's going to create a vulnerability versus those exercises that do and if you go back to torn muscles you could probably it doesn't matter if it's a torn quad doesn't matter if it's torn hamstring porn pack we can pretty much make a list of the exercises probably six or seven exercises that are 95% of torn muscles yeah yeah yeah yeah we have one of one of my friends Paul who he's from Swiss too he's friends with Victoria and then I met him through their skip I had a double quad rupture and he literally took him to the ground during a meat he was doing that was that the Olympian shot putter no no he double quad rupture power lifter okay my mother was over it I know what he said joke but I don't get it he didn't get it oh I thought he did I'm sorry forget it what was the joke he was very fond of he was a presenter right and what had thought he was very fond of someone close to you oh no that's right yeah there's a few of those guys yeah it's probably been more than one yeah but yeah so anyway though he but he literally he's a young enough guy he came back and I think it's like some 16 18 months later he just competed at that that gold's gym classic show that happened in North Carolina his legs are back like his legs aren't like the craziest leg ever seen yeah yeah yeah yeah I was on his show last week oh you were awesome man yeah no like yeah I mean we were going over his injury and everything and I'll tell you what peptides are amazing dude he did everything he made his recovery a full-time eight-hour job yep from the minute he got hurt you know what I mean how old is he 30's okay late 30's yeah yeah I'd say let's say mid late 30's you guys know you guys know Matt Chrisman right I don't know the name I don't know he's like the body specialist at my 40 he works on all of us at the gym but then like you know I know tons of coaches fly him out to like Austin's out has him out a couple times a year to work on his local athletes and he goes to the Olympia and he works on a lot of WWE athletes and travels with them anyway so he he ruptured his quad stepping on he was trying to separate his dog from a snake in his backyard and he stepped on the snake which as you can imagine that slippery you know knees going one way muscle and and tendons going the other way he had a full quad rupture and I want to say it was like not even three months after surgery he's doing leg extensions again not a hundred percent yeah but here he is now three months past starting to wait train again you can't see a different like his strength is right there he's moving around again like he was before that's the way Paul was with the double rupture it was like six weeks later he was leg pressing and you know when I think we saw him it was like 10 weeks after at Swiss and he's just like walking around thought of limp you know both of these guys roughly the same age uh Matt's probably like 3334 okay why I asked that there is I think coming from the older demographic because I've been through a few decades doing this I do think that there is a psychological component that when you're older the injuries are not as easy to compartmentalize they stick in your brain I know there were times where I thought I can see that if like this kid and this is a year after I was rehab that thought I could end up shutting in the shower tomorrow if one of these reps goes wrong and you know I wrote about it extensively because that's what I had to do a couple of times as embarrassing as that is but it was that bad because I couldn't sit down on the toilet short we have to or I got help you know um woke up in the morning because I was too stiff if I sat down I couldn't get up I would my lower back with spasm so anyway the point being is it's harder I think when I was younger looking back at the it was almost like oh this is a road black I'll go out meet Burger King and you know have some drinks with my wife here for the next you know three months yeah it sucks I can't train but I'll distract my brain and I'll be right back at it and I was and everything was fine but later in life those things weigh on you more and it becomes not only a physical vulnerability but a psychological obstacle as well it's there it's much harder to get around that without your brain logically saying this could happen today this 100% to the next set it's harder to do that I think or it's just me I mean there is that too no 100% I think that that psychological thing does exist for people I do I think it does too yeah I think that's a fact certainly does I mean I I I I don't I told you guys before every time I do like a hard like set in particular I kind of have this like mental checklist slash prayer I guess of like okay please not let this be the set that does me in you know work say it's the same thing set up the same way the same music everything has to be from my toes to my ankles to my knees to my hips to my lower back to my abs that you're telling yourself tight yes yeah tight that's good yeah yep I like everything locked into the machine is as tight as I possibly can air is out the right way my abs are set the right way just all these little things that when you're in your 20s you just rip it and bang yeah you don't you don't you don't think about that crap yeah rolled the hips I don't keep it tight yeah I'll set it out loud but I know people are like what the fuck is he saying same I know people looked at me like who's talking to you know yeah we're talking to myself sometimes the best conversation I am all day yeah you got a question I'm Adrienne from George and he says running my TRT crews of 210 milligrams of test in 105 DACA plan on running a cycle of 600 test 300 DACA 300 EQ in a few months when the time comes to jump on the blast doesn't make sense to keep the 105 DACA and make up the difference with NPP or just up the DACA I like to over complicate I say old guy old people say six a one half a dozen others I was going to remember how to word that right you should get that say it because you sometimes I mess it up when I say it but I agree with you if you like DACA because you seemingly do why not just stay with DACA yeah hey Andrew who is reasonable for doing a GI map I'm looking on line and they seem to be $300 to $500 is that normal price or is that a rip off thanks you mentioned GI maps in the last episode yeah give me two seconds all right I got a rate I texted Paul O'Nean too and I was like hey how old are you we're talking about you on the podcast we'll see if he gets back in time all right and maybe we can put this in the notes but if people go to ax holistic medicine dot com back slash gut hyphen testing back slash you can get everybody's going high I'll talk don't do it now because we might lose I know I'll do it after the show we put it we'll put in the show notes but yeah this one is 365 and then they do a test kit and a console for 500 bucks I charge more for the console so you might want to go with them but if you want a plan that's like geared towards bodybuilding and GI maps I'm your guy all right all right so 300 doesn't sound like it's too much 360 right so that 3 to 500 that's not a rip off no so here's the thing is you'll a lot of times because you can't just order the test with the exception of this one website that's why I scoured the internet for like hours one day to find a one site where they don't require you to be a provider you know a medical provider to order the test all these other places like HRT clinics they'll charge 500 bucks they'll slip in an extra hundred dollars on top of the cost of the test and their other doing is putting your information into GI map plus they're sending you the kit you send the kit back to them and then they're just getting results and giving you a little feel about it so they're they're they're taking 150 bucks off the top just to order you the test so how much does it cost me under if I want to like shit in the box mail it to you 365 to me just send you a quick to answer I went to the doctor I had to go to the ER almost two weeks ago all right I had like either the worst food poisoning it had to been food poisoning like there wasn't a drop of food or time left in my body okay like both ends sometimes at the same time which was real hard to see like yeah you just like hmm oh shit I'm getting in the shower like this I wasn't bad for again way so I knew I knew my my kidneys were hurting okay that's how done I needed it was so I knew I had to go to the ER and get some some IV bags and I'm looking at these prices and I was even joking with them when they're like oh we should give you some Tylenol for the fever blah blah blah blah and like oh is this like one of those 175 dollar Tylenol pills and they're like oh no nothing like that sure enough it's a hundred forty six dollars for one Tylenol and you're kidding me and I'm that person that I broke down every part of the bill that gave me and I'm like nope I can get this yeah I see on the medical website you can get this for 17 cents this right here I'm breaking all down the medical costs are just out of this world no wonder people go into debt I mean I could pay it but I'm still gonna screw you know scrutinize over it yeah but it's no wonder that people go into medical debt in this in this country with what they are charging for this and that all right about this one training question my lats are pretty okay from the back in the rear but they suck in my front shots what are the best exercises to improve the taper from the front double and back in thighs I would first ask them you should have said pictures for one thing yeah because lats are two different things back in lats two different things and is your rear like if you are your rear double and your rear last spread shot like it's rare that someone has a good rear double I sorry rear last spread but they don't have a good front last spread at least a good front last spread so I'm wondering if you're having issues with moving your shoulders and your scapula I'm kind of doing it which no one can see if you have an issue showing the tissue and it's not just fairly weakness because it's just rare that someone has a good lat development in a rear last spread and a horrible front last spread no what I mean yeah so I'd love to see pictures on that and and the skipper rings up a good point like back and lats are pretty much different in the sense that when you say back skipper you're probably talking like the muscles of the rhomboids and and maybe some of the terries and the stuff that jumps out at you in a rear double bi-separate yeah so I would agree with you that statement I think pictures pictures don't lie it's always good to see what we're looking at yeah and just to piggyback off of that from the front it's not that you're not gonna see lats but from the front if you're talking about wit and back size from the front you really are talking more terries and the muscles of round the shoulder blade that are going to round out yes the lats can still be seen from the front but the lats predominantly cover or the area in space that they cover is not going to be seen very well from the front so and the reason I bring that up isn't to be you know mr smart ass and correcting you know the guy who asked the question is much as understanding the musculature of the back before you can break down how you're going to approach making your back musculature bigger and in what areas and and that sort of I mean we could just say you want your back bigger but let's just work on those directors oh wait that's not gonna have anything to do with the front last breath you see what I'm saying yeah you know yeah how about this one from the live stream um how do you guys attack TVA training not stepping out of the stage just wanting to age gracefully yeah I could look it up but I have the three of you you're the best right here to ask you could look it up um I think really you got to do a lot of um pikes plus planks well I was going to get there I think people are expecting oh you got to wait at crunches or you can do but no I would agree well Scott why don't you take this one I just could say planks that was by beginning in end that was it yeah that's my number one at least and just say that the vacuum's help yeah I was yeah but you get to the point because I did you get to the point where they just don't help anymore yeah you have to have some bit of resistance you know some bit of weight and you know we got this question I came across this question the other day a couple weeks ago uh and I want to make sure that I understand or say that say this right is it hollow planks what's out you know I'm talking about it's a gymnastics type move yeah and I looked it up because I wasn't even clear on what it was I thought oh this is good so I'm just recently putting them in to see if this is gonna and I do something similar basically and this is the best way to explain it put yourself in a lying lying leg left position on say like a bench right goats at the end of the bench and you're in the stretch position but you're attempting a bit of a vacuum and then as you come up it's just that that that howlowness is referring to the TVA pulling in but now you've got resistance because you're holding the leg and Scott you may have a good point plank same I mean it's arguably the same thing but just in a different position at least that with those two movements you have resistance versus I mean there's resistance you know with a vacuum but it's not I mean there's a thing you see what I'm getting it's the same exercise as a plank but now you're adding a resistance component right because the with the lever arm being your you know your feet just that the simple weight of your feet fighting against gravity yeah adding a resistance component whereas you don't you don't have the same resistance component when you're in a plank so so I would say yeah the plank so we're good starting exercise and then how do you say the elbow howlown? okay I believe I'd have to go to the right what it is it's a how I believe it's a howl point it's bad that I don't know but you guys know this your shows all run together and the things you talk about because you talk about a million things and you can't pull it yeah but it's a howlown plank I believe yeah but that would probably be the graduated exercise right there's like you can do a reverse plank too off of a bench where instead of face down now your face up basically yeah with the plank and that's that's to me the next step yeah I just looked up hollow planks and I see there's obviously like a bunch of exercises and that looks like it's even a step I think you're thinking of the same things got where basically you're in a like if you see one there where they're lying on a either on the floor with their legs up slightly or on a bench like they're doing a leg lift that's I was doing a max of dentally you know since that I just would make sure that I tried to pull in on my TVA when I was in that extended position with my legs and then as I brought my legs up I don't have the ability I don't know you know I'm not I can't do like a rocky rocky three crunchary was up in the the loft you know doing that I did I tried them when I was younger as a teenager when the movie came out it was all I could do what I can do like two of them but the point is is when I do leg lifts it's hard for me because of all these years and I'm 55 yeah lose that TVA strength as you get older and then of course if you're battling with the 90s version of forced feeding for growth oh yeah we have distension you know like if it's a day after you know a big skip load especially during proper there's I'm not even going to attempt to train abs yeah because I have that bit of distension that is just like no I don't need to do crunches with a turtle shell I'm going to wait a couple days I worked with a guy who for a long time who had a lot of gut issues and as a result he had major distension and it what part of for his for his situation he had to work on the gut issues to be able to fix that because he was constantly getting that that bloating out for me I saw the absolute worst like deconstruction of my TVA after I had gotten sick and it affected my breathing because in order for me to breathe I just had to like breathe through the stomach you know this is the way I was breathing and I just let my stomach hang out in order to be able to breathe at all like fast forward eight months and it was pretty ugly so but you should be breathing through your stomach not like that man not like that maybe not to that degree I'll just say in as I know when I was younger yeah we were taught to breathe you know ribcage no no and it's like and when I say young like young like ten and the reason I remember that is I went for a choir I couldn't say yeah I know the guy inside was laughing like bro take up baseball or body building or something because singing is not in your future but I had a couple friends who were in it I thought I wanted to do it anyway he told me that proper breathing at that point was you know through the ribcage and that the stomach that I remember thinking just recently when I heard exactly the opposite or not recently compared to them like oh man he was wrong I wish I knew his name yeah he just don't want to let you know you want to be able to fill the lobes of your lungs up but for me you know it was was one of the things skip remember at Swiss boom I was learning about breathing through the low back and that was a huge one trying to figure out how to get that air to come because I was just like literally man I'd have to leave my stomach just hanging relaxed at all times you know and it just even doing it now it trips me out but literally like then me trying to do anything that took core strength like it was like I just shake so I started getting into planks because I got into pushups it was by accident and I was like oh you know what I'm getting back into training what if I had to do some pushups because that's a chest exercise right and I'm not very strong right now so I started doing pushups and my whole body was vibrating do intend pushups and it's not because my chest wasn't strong you know what I mean right so that was a step for me but yeah I think too that like it's age but then also stuff like Andrew you've gotten into all the got stuff you've talked about that a lot here on the show I think that's a huge factor with TVA and then like for me and I don't know if that applies to as many people but like breathing issues you know yeah well definitely uh it's something this off season that I am looking into very deeply because of coming off of this last diet phase with the distension issues that I had this can't I mean I really got to the point where I thought this can't continue like this is bad enough as it is it can't get it can't get worse you know I'm looking into that the doctor brings a mind I've got a couple clients that work with a vacuum coach or like a a Dom okay coach and I can send you the information skip it might be something worth I don't know she speaks English that's the only thing my clients are Brazilian and see I'm not bisexual so I mean I'm not bilingual I get them sped either yeah it's got I just sent you a text message of an exercise of a buddy sent me I think it's worth showing on the show on everybody yeah give me a minute I'll get it pulled up and I'll tell you too with the the planks I should have mentioned this that then what I had learned from it from Victoria is that a lot of it has to do with putting it together breathing through the low back while you're doing the plank because you you know you don't you want to keep that stomach tight yeah and and so there's like some breathing training for me that goes on with the plank exercise okay and there are some people listening right now who have completely tuned this out and that's unfortunate for them not us yeah it's all for real people approach the breathing well it is because people approach breathing or the topic of breathing much like they approached the topic of cardio like oh I know how to do that I've been yeah since I was one right it's like you don't get it you don't understand what you're leaving on the table and even veteran trainers veteran athletes will have problems with their breathing yeah check this uh like extension out oh that's brutal man yeah that's a full stretch yeah there's a lot of wrecked them in there yeah everybody tries to send it to me up into the holy ground and that and look at the um the weight it's not a weight stack it's actual weight so you know that that's like heavy yeah yeah oh I just I just got a kick out of that I'm like man why don't we see more leg extension machines like this yeah this is the first one I've seen like this I think yeah that's wild man and I get it because I feel like there's times when I'm trying to like sit back to get that you know what I'm saying get your feet further under get that stretch they have that pad now to get your feet further back to I know Kubo's on the commercial for that actually that bad yeah I don't know if he knows he's on the commercial for it they gave him one and now he's on the commercial though they not only am I glad to see that they actually did come up with something like that but then now they need to take the seated leg curl they need to push that pad forward yeah so which pad or even an adjustable the back pad yeah well why can't you make an adjustable leg extension or like for exactly that goes up and down you can adjust it just like you would adjust the depth of the you know how far up you are it it does strike me as add sometimes the minor things that we miss wouldn't be cost prohibitive when you make the exercise equipment anyway yeah I agree all right quick when I guess we can all throw in our opinions on it how long before you started seeing Ben let's let me reword that let me just read it away says it how long after starting redda before you know that it's working I think like six days when you start to I was gonna go a couple weeks but I couldn't remember I don't think it takes very long I remember it kicking in very very quickly but you don't pick it up like you have to really be looking for it so I think after a couple weeks I was like yeah I could care less whether I ate or not like what yeah yeah I think I mean I know some people without knowing the side effects that I've given it to my wife noticed that like two days later like I don't even want to eat yeah what's up with that look oh yeah it's blunt in your appetite you know she's like it works that fast I'm like yeah I guess it does for you just I don't have to take yeah I noticed like after a couple doses because I started real low but once I got up to a milligrams twice per week after that second milligrams I was like okay I get what they're saying now I get this but now I have a client that finished the contest prep and he's obviously really hungry and he was like hey you know I really want to try it for the rebound and we put it and I was like well we'll do two milligrams and I was gonna tell them to break it up he just went ahead and took it took two milligrams straight away on Monday and he was like when's it gonna kick in because I'm just start that so I don't know man for him you know what I'm saying like is he gonna get anything out of two or is he gonna need to take 10 to call that hunger on the red of note have you guys are you pulling it out of some people's plans because it's actually creating the opposite effect what opposite okay so I have I think three people have completely pulled it from where it was working well in the offseason or look we'll call it the the pre prep phase okay and then once we really start dieting their blood sugars one oh eight one oh seven one oh four one oh eight really yep and they're not getting any fat loss effects their weight in fact the weight is going up okay wow now my hypothesis is two two two reasons one it's having such an effect on the gastric imprint rate that it is slowing down digestion so much that it's backing up meals meals are compounding on top of meals hurting insulin sensitivity and leading to those higher blood sugar and lack of weight loss interesting the other one which seems even more likely to me is that because remember breta is a triple action agonist it's GOP GIP and glucocone pathways right the for some people I think they get such an exaggerated glucocone response that it's causing yeah you know I'm going with us it's causing those super high blood sugars and it's actually causing them to hold it it's it's taking out of any type of metabolism and it's just straight and anabolism and yeah it'll tell you real world example one of my guys we were just you know scratch our heads trying to figure out on pulling calories out of cardio weights going up and we're like what the heck is going on I'm like you know what pulled right out within seven days he was down seven pounds damn it's weak he was down another four yeah like he didn't start pooping so that that he was uh he wasn't like super he didn't notice he was super that no because he re-rewarded report that so now that that was one of the issues it was pointed out and oh his blood sugar 84 78 like was in a week so then I started using out of approach with other people that I'm like things are moving away I think they should be right now and and I immediately said okay let's pull the red out same thing down three pounds for a female down you know blood sugar is back into correct ranges so I do think that for some people truthers appetite is probably a better choice than a reticure tide even though the you know side by side studies of semi-true's appetite retta show that retta showed the the largest total weight loss in in the controlled studies I do think for some people truthers appetite or even semicuteite will be a better option I'll tell you what I have noticed since um starting this you know reverse out or rebound everyone called yeah is blood sugar levels are fine I went back up because I had moved down to and I'm not gonna give specific dosage as I have to do all the math I'd base it on units per day at 10 units per day it was 1.75 milligrams per week so 0.25 meg per day okay I went from 10 units to when I got right around that 68 week mark out from the show I started back in it off because I'm like there's just issues going on with the stension gastric emptying is just not working well like I even just regular meals even though I was low carb and all that sort of stuff we're just an issue anyway ended up back and done a tight-take down like a unit a week got down to about two or three units I can't remember I went back up immediately to five after the show and now I'm at seven for the last couple weeks since we've been for five weeks and what I have noticed is this there are no gastric emptying issues I mean I'm moving through meals fast as and that goes same with the high carb meals so I don't I can't explain it I'm not at 10 like I was before but I will be going up again I mean instead of going to 9 maybe I've ordered 10 but I'm curious to see what if this trend of the gastric emptying not slowing down it's just not slow it's arguably faster so I don't know how I can't explain it I would say your overall food volume is going up and the bread of dose just isn't high enough to have and keep on not everyone's gonna have the exact same side effects like some people aren't gonna get the appetite and the effects in their in their hypothalamus until they reach a certain dose right but I did expect similar effects from what I had the dose before maybe not the same but not comparing it to someone else but just comparing it to my experience so that that's what I was surprised I'm like wow were you seeing the day and night were you seeing gastric emptying rates slow down before oh yeah yeah well you were eating a lot less true I don't know it's a lot less it's not like I'm at 5000 calories now and I was at 2 before but but you're right I was eating less you know and I had the lower card days and the cardio which I'm doing very minimal cardio because I can get leanest and staley is very little to no cardio which is the way I prefer it yeah I would my argument would be that it's just the even if it's a 25% increase in food volume over what you were doing when you're previously at these higher doses not that like your doses are high by any stretch but I would say that's probably the component and also you know you gotta think when you're eating more food there's more water in that food you know yeah the only other thing that I was thinking was this and it's certainly a possibility and this is always the hard part about you know whether something's correlative or whether it's causative but I'm TRT and I my okay I just cut in half two so arguably and I'm progressing griff feel like a million my recovery my sleep score my HRV everything is coming up I don't think I'm gonna die this week I think I'm good to get through Sunday but that can play a part too the fact that we've talked about this about me before and and other people as well but I brought it up about my situation where I feel like my system runs more efficiently yeah I'm so much less gear feel like a million books in here I mean it's a simple reason for that is that your liver is just working more efficiently you're having you're probably having better bio flow so your your recycling hormones better you recycling waste better so yeah I mean it all make it does make sense it's not like one of those like this is just so weird I'm doing this and I can't get you know what I mean like I feel like yeah yeah without that I added you know yes that was a you know what I've seen is recently with redda is two guys now so it's enough that it it's either a coincidence or this is maybe happening two guys that hired me that we're taking high doses of redda I'd call them high like up to six plus milligrams and under eating and you know not able to reach their goals because they didn't have enough food in their plan and now in order to get them started we've had to pull the redda back in order to be able to get in more frequent feedings with even keeping the food like under what I would want to them to eat but getting them like almost like creating book markers you know what I mean book it like place holders for meals that are pretty small and that as we get the redda down further we can build those meals up and build their metabolism up so they can actually can reach their goals because right now they're not eating enough to lose the fat they want to lose you know yeah but clients do you guys have that are you know they're starting to say I mean I would say two milligrams a day but I honestly I probably only have two clients at F check to be sure two clients that are over two milligrams a day so many people are responding the vast majority of people to the low dosing and then when they go up it whether they're just coming to me or they have built those dosages up to the reef or six I mean some of the asked to go to eight I'm like just it's not if it's not doing anything it's six like it's not all of a sudden gonna just work it just seems like those initial dosing protocols seem for redda seem to be way too high it reminds me of melanotan when it first came out how that was so overdosed and so we were just slamming our systems was so much more than we needed and I'm wondering if that's not the case with the redda I've got two people two people above that and they're both those same guys I was just talking about they came to me taking more with two's been about what I'd go to now that said if somebody still has appetite issues like like they're still trying to control appetite further beyond that then I'll add in a micro dose of some of the glute tied with it and use that just for the appetite could you know the other thing you could do is add in a cradulinotide what's that do it just hits the it just hits the the brain for the appetite suppression has no other effects on GIP or GLP you know what I have one guy who mentioned that to me recently yeah I've been putting a lot of people on that post-show versus redda okay recently because people that are just having issues with like bingeing stuff yeah a little month in issues yeah yep so that's and our friends over a pair of ballach happen to have they might know where to get that well so I want to point out here Tom Wright's Andrew you can get GIMAPs from synergistic labs for way cheaper okay I'm looking it up and it says here they're 429 and I believe the price I just mentioned was the 365 yeah so I'm trying to figure out how 429 99 which is way cheaper than 365 so Tom if you could explain that to me all right we got to get this thing wrapped up but I can't not take this question Scott what's your current carry setup I got to answer that one I am currently carrying the SIG X macro legion which is like the SIG D365 legion or X macro it's a great little 17 plus one I'm using the Philster what's that it's not little it's my camera micro whatever it is it's micro carry that's little you got 17 rounds 17 plus one and I put that in my Philster Nickmore and Nickmore holster I love it carry it with GIM shorts with dress clothes I don't care got it all what about you guys I'm either my cancamentae SF or cancamentemcy nine depending on what I'm here yeah yeah but I'm kind of looking at maybe one of the smallest accados possibly so it's either that or my staccato C2 it's one of the two that I'm carrying because I just love C2 I love my staccato C so much and it's just a little bit big for when you're wearing you know workout stuff so um you're your big guy Andrew you put on that big like two X leg day your three X leg day shirt for you you know you big you'd be good man I like I faith in you on unlike you those got I don't I don't wear my piece while I'm actually squatting I love your video where you're like no see guys you can totally carry I'm in my gym and I'm doing my exercise and I'm moving and oh by the way I'm kidding somebody got really upset by that I triggered somebody well yeah yeah he was like you don't need that night I don't know he's like giving me all the stats we're yeah I'm not gonna get an argument with you and I can give you stats too you know like no man I think people think when you carry your certain type of way and anyone that I know that carries they never want to have to use it God no man it's like a fire extinguisher you don't want to have to ever you you hope your fire extinguisher expires long after you die right I was just want to live today because Dave and England like they obviously have no concept to that I don't know like listen I want to I'm even more careful that nothing happens like if somebody cuts me off exactly like it's cool bro you know go ahead you know you're all right I'm not gonna start anything I consider like a condom like I'm carry a condom but I don't I don't really want to use it but I like fire extinguisher I just think it's better here's as good I have a okay RDP but it's too big and this is gonna be really bad so go ahead and beat me out but it won't fit into my Gucci bag oh it's gonna be gonna get you the filster nickma I got the timber I got my timber all took care so that's your first gun that's your first gun what I know it works doesn't but that's the funny that's the joke it's like I'm not necessarily gonna have to fire off any rounds I'll just pistol whip a bullet you know I would also tell Dave if you like because I see a lot of videos about rampant crime going on over in the UK and it's like and there's always jokes going around too like they're gonna send a social worker out to to stop a guy who just smack and then you know you know yeah like you know bro's in your house with a knife like oh hold on sir let me call the the cry closet people to come over here and analyze your life while you try to rob me and tell me of my possessions like yeah let me do that so I just don't get you know people from the outside of the world I don't I don't want to have to rely on police where the average response time is like 7.8 minutes to get to your house because no criminals gonna wait no you are your own first responder guys that's the lesson to learn well Scott to you guys know I'm incredibly socially liberal but I'm about as pro gun and pro money and pro business and pro corporation and not having to pay taxes and pro foreign policy did you guys see that post I made on Facebook little while back about my mom's church no my mom and dad's church they they brought their dog over for the weekend so they could go visit my sister but my mom's like super plugged in with the church they both are so they happened to not be there that weekend there was an active person that came to their church I read about our song on the news yeah in Wayne Michigan thanks yeah thankfully they were prepared and one got he was you know cracking off rounds at the church heading inside we're all the families and kids we're one of the members saw what was going on hidden with his car somebody else came over and and extinguished the threat with his with his concealed carry so thank goodness that there were people there prepared the police got there in like two minutes but a lot of damage could have been done in two minutes so yeah two minutes is plenty of plenty of time you get off 16 17 rounds so good for him yeah yeah I'm with you guys so you know and it's not to me even a political thing it's just that if you know there's a lot of crazy people out there there's the way I see it and okay that's fine you guys do your thing but if you want to interfere with my life or the life of the people that I love and you don't take my life into like if you don't have the the same respect for me that I do for myself then I at least want to say in the matter I might not be able to do anything but I want to have a say in the matter I want to be able to take your soul I want to be able to stop this around and reach yeah that's all I look at it that one wakes up thinking I'm going to kill a bad guy no but you know the time is it but in the moment really we can all talk about stopping the threat but the reality is we're shooting to take a soul I'm just I would believe you know the increase the bleeding the the far flip-off thing is like you value your stuff more than than the criminal's life and it's like no the criminal valued my stuff right or that they're on life that's that's how I look at it I don't go and do things by adding other people's property or to them expecting good results out of it so I don't feel like that's a far far right thing to think that you know and you know I'm socially liberal and I completely agree with you 100 percent if you're gonna come and take try to take my stuff or you're gonna try to hurt someone close to me you're not getting away with either one of them and on that note guys we appreciate you tune it in if you're still listening if we still have you here as an audience go over to bodybarry.com to reach out to Andrew for
