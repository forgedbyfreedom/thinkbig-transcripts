Steve Kulskot here for elite FTS and one of the fun things about the office is we get people that pop in unexpectedly and a lot of times it's a nice pleasant surprise. We have Bob Wall here with us who some of the older lifters are historically a deaf lifters will remember Bob. He not only had a number of world records but he also mentioned some people including this up and coming young man. Bob tell us a little bit about your past history and some of your records. Well actually I started out in a weight game because actually 16 years old with a guy named Jerry Bell and George Crawford. Two of the great lifters back then and I started out and I had a fun time with it. I got pretty serious. Finally I started breaking some of the national records and I finally made the world and broke some of the world records and I kind of hooked up with Dave here a little bit over the firm gemmometer. I'm over on the side of Toledo and try to help him out a little bit. And what weight class were you in and what were some of the numbers? I was actually I left at 148 and 165, 148. That's what I was at. 161, 335 bench in a 161 dollar. It's 65 it had 760, 390 and 7. What federations were then? USB-F, okay. Okay. There was one. And tell us a little bit about when this young fellow came into the gym. Actually Dave had some pretty technique and when he first started out power-of-the-need he's quite a kind of bend-over little bit. So we had a correct that situation. To care that his list started going pretty good and there's some a couple good needs and an undergraduate from college and as a last time I'd seen him. Where were you at near lifting career when you walked in there? Right after his after a body, a short and a very short body building stand that I had. I started competing in a thinly barbell club and Bob may not know this but every now and again very rarely but once or twice a year we would make a trip up to training with you know these guys and to the group that they had and it was um the names are them. Forgive me the names right now. Pat Ferrell, Tom, and Darkiotics Tom. Definitely. Dave is down. Dave is. Yes and that was when you guys were all a car's gym. Okay. I mean it was rare but it's just just enough to kind of spot check technique and so forth. So I was I was a wearer bond and when I moved to when I left in the barbell to go to college I was in going green I couldn't really find anybody to power lift with. My roommate happened to be a body motor so I figured what the hell you know will try this. It did it for a couple years and realized it's not my thing so then it was a matter of where where do I go? Toledo had a lot of different gyms at the time to be able to train with the stronger than me who were better than me and found out he was over it the flex connection and my phone was called different time. So the phone. So me met way over there because you know at the time my best squat was low sevens and I was 242 you know you know you guys squatting. One sixty five swine sevens and he said this is your off a little bit but I mean he you know he's he was a technician his his list were technically perfect and I wanted to be around somebody that could help me in that regard because even back then I realized because it was always drilled in my head from day one and that's probably why I'm such a technique not see now technique technique technique technique because that was the fastest way to get stronger and to say for a straight train so I wanted to get in the group and when I was trained with Bob's rhythm I went for five of us just you know basic stuff I just kind of did what I was told to do but you know it's the interesting thing that I was speaking with Bob Bob is right now there's like a fall back there where we're talking about how people turn back in the day and I keep posting you know I train back in the day and it wasn't just train hard you know and lived in heavy shit there was the thought process that went into all this and there was a lot of backing down and you know I let Bob speak more about the training because I really didn't do it you know he planned it all out and we just kind of wrote along and then if we were told the back down we'd back down or if we were told you know if it was a single do a trip and we just kind of did I don't know how it was laid out but it worked and it worked in such a way that we were able to you know fix technique that me and get stronger and at the same time teach me because I was a snott and I was kidding I mean it's all I can speak on that but teach me a little bit more respect for the sport which I don't think I really had come in and yeah into it you know that there was a history for you know it and that you know being a world champion means it met something back then and it deserved a certain degree or respect you know that if somebody's telling you do something that has earned that you need to understand that that's not a fucking easy thing to obtain and then when you start to get in that process you like oh god first I got a qualified for the national so then you're looking looking at the totals to get to the world you're like oh gosh yeah and then some I let him speak about the training and that's okay but tell us what you guys were doing actually me mainly our process back then was he always took the tripals or files you know bottom line is and he always tried to make sure that you never missed your your your sets you know you always want to make sure you hate your sets again some days you can have some good days in bad days so if you did just back off a little bit you know wasn't really rocket scientist but you know how how your body felt you know some of those physical jobs and stuff so you had to come and be prepared you know and if you didn't feel good you just kind of just modified it a little bit more you know so what was the basic setup like you know for daily actually actually worked out for days a week you know you see on Monday what did heavy benches you know some accessory work and then Tuesday was you see squat heavy squats and then Thursday would come into a light bench workout just to pump the blood into your system you know hopefully things are so up and then briding heavy deadless okay so and well so that's a little bit about the crew you you trained with and like what time of the day was it like an after work actually as after work you used around 4 or 4 or 30 hour we trained with me Dave guy named Elbittner Scott McFarlane and North Carol which had norms actually still lived in the day he's at the total of 1900s now so he's doing quite well the number one guys I hope dealt so you know maybe it's just did after work everybody hooked up worked out for a couple hours and had fun at it you know all ribbed each other and especially picked on days until you was a new guy you always need some of the load number ways oh yes so you know I get it all from that you're turned let's do it one of the things that that we talk about this kind of like a corer and what we do is it's kind of the live learn pass on it Dave has kind of taught people that are now teaching myself and other people to lift so it's nice to see somebody that taught him it's also about some of the people that you learn from as you know from I say George Crawford and Jerry Bell George's World Champion back in 70s when the first ones he got hooked up with Larry Pacifico no bikini with a guy named Bob Mayazz that trained them for the first World Championship in which they won so we come from a good stock back in Toledo there of 10 World Champions back in 70s I was lucky enough to make it myself I felt poorly privileged of doing that so and I just try to help other people along the way we really have a good lifters come out of Toledo so and a lot of times when we see some some lifters from your area they're not getting around as well as you what do you think you did that has kept you other than the shoulder you know I got some shoulder injuries I had some knee injuries I said bottom line is that you try to line yourself with good actors so I made me with the sports medicine doctors type of a chiropractic therapy you know just kind of let your body kind of rejuvenate after you get done lifting heavy you know take it easy do the right things as much as possible that's why I kind of stayed in the sport for so long but now it's just a little by me past me here so it's like I'm just trying to stay in shape and you know hopefully help some other young people make them along okay let's pretend there's not here right now tell us what you thought of him and what kind of impression you had actually actually Dave was a very very thoughtful person back then I mean you know it was really kind either everything we needed to do when the gym didn't really question it you know and if you did have any questions and when you're why but we don't explain it to him and you can accept a kind of why we're doing all that so it was a good guy and I'm really trying to body accomplish and what he has students like it's more a matter of like I said there's a respect that you that was talking about is you know you you ask a listen and you shut up you know you don't you don't debate with you know the way I was taught you don't debate with the world champion yeah you know debate with the guy who's taking his time to help you have to get better and you know Bob's one of the reasons why you know I continue to put out the information that I put out to help other people because you know you didn't have to help me you didn't have to help any of these other people you know and a lot of the times that helping out extended past just the training when we were together you know if it was after me and he was taken a few weeks off he's still in there you know because we would have a me going and George was another one that I don't know you know if when I was in there he trained with George and George was already kind of past his prime when I was in there Crawford I was speaking about and he was still in there you know given tips and you knew I mean I always had that hat on you know and you'll also have another guy name you know can you rappers was another guy that helped me matter a lot of us which you know give a lot of information a day also you know the good friend that you know worked out quite well with all of us yeah and if you saw George I mean he'd have a tie-dye shirt on and this you know hat well you know you know you know he come over and he tell you you know looking to push your knees out a little bit harder when you're pulling I was pulling too much at the time you know most the other guys in the gym probably just blown off I could just praise you'll do you know you know you know I'd be sitting at home just thinking about pushing my knees out the whole time I'm watching TV because you got a respect to it's coming from him and who he's created and who he brought up and what he accomplished thank you was one of the first world champions in the area you always yeah him and not me kidding in there a bit of a typical so other than the you mentioned respect for people that have come before you and other lessons to deal with technique just just reinforced the whole thing that I was taught you know I came into the sport young you know 13 years old so I'm not going to sit here and say that I was a 13 year old that respected authority and everything else you know there was a reason there was a reason yeah there was a reason why my dad threw me in the gym with all these other guys when I was just patience you know that you know so when you're when I was told all those things when I was first starting I'm like you have fucked that we're going out with whatever you know as a teenager you can get away with a lot of shit you can do a lot of really stupid things and even when I was training with him I was still young and could get away with a lot of things he was kind of saying you're old but you said he was just born that's what he was to start that's okay I mean he was I understand it I understand it but it's how I got him he already had a spare share injury so the all I always had those guys who were hurt saying look what you're doing is fucking stupid you know you know but never paid attention to it you know I paid attention to it you know coming from him because I didn't want to end up you know going into the private my career then getting hurt I knew all the long and I think we all know long long long term things are going to happen shit's going to happen you're going to get hurt you're going to pay a price the longer you're in it that's just it's a guaranteed my fear was I didn't want it to happen three weeks before me that wasn't shaped for yeah that'd be a bummer yeah so that's why I listen in that regard as well so it was three and firm that and taught that to me even more so that technique is the breakdown of techniques usually the main reason why somebody's going to get hurt it's not because of the overtrain you're a lot of the other things it's you take me breaks bone some stuff I don't see it's going to happen okay well you know Bob I appreciate you again Mr. time your wife is is been calling yeah I wanted you picked up so thank her for for stop letting us grab you and throw you in front of the camera thank you very much I appreciate it you
