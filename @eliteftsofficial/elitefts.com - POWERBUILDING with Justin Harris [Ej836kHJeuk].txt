My training over the years, when it's evolved, is when I first started training it was for football or to get bigger and for football in high school. And really that's how I trained until I played two college. So until I was 22, that's all my focus was, which was for so many more. I do things like Hank Leane's, Cleane's, Jurks, Power Shrugs, and I would a lot of agility, type things or explosive, sprint type work, mixed in with the workout, real core training, squats, dead lifts, you know, always did, you know, curls for the girls and stuff. But really it was just, it was sports oriented training. And then after football, it really transitioned to, I decided I wanted to do bodybuild. And the only problem was I never, I mean at that point I've been training for eight years. I know I wanted to be a bodybuilder, but the only way I knew what a train was to train heavy, try to get stronger every workout and train like kind of a mix between powerlifting and strong man. And so I really struggled with trying to train like a bodybuilder because I couldn't do, I just couldn't do like pump workouts and cable stuff. And so I still always trained heavy. But I'd started splitting my body into bodybuild, you know, like a leg day, a chest day, a back day, instead of like a push pull type thing. And so it's, it's struggle. And I mean even when I still just always kind of train like a powerlifting, eventually I think I wrote a couple articles and they titled the name Power Bodybuilding or Power Building or something. I guess that's, I still have always trained that way. I mean I did my first powerlifting meet, I didn't do any, I trained the exact same way all the way up to the day of the meet as I trained for a bodybuilding show. And I guess kind of the way my training is now if I had described the power bodybuilding as I pretty much go in in my first movement for any of the major group back or chest or legs is I'm a powerlifting. I go in, I leg day and I squat and I warm up slowly like a powerlifting does and I build up 1-35, 2-25, 3-15, 4-5 and eventually leads out to my max effort whatever it is. It might be more or less one set when I might try to get 585 or 6. And that's, you know, that whole workout is I'm a powerlifting trying to get stronger. And after that, I think I kind of transitioned to kind of switch gears. Well maybe for something like legs that would do something like stiff leg dead lifts or good mornings also, which I'm still kind of in the mindset of a powerlifting. But after those core movements, then I kind of switch gears and I'm not worried about the weight as much in a trained bodybuilder. And I kind of, I guess I'll use chest as an example, I kind of finish with like at the end kind of a combination muscle group exercise. So for example, for chest I come in and I do bench and I warm up my shoulders and do all the stuff just like a foam roller or whatever like I would be a powerlifting like it's my bench day. Now instead of spending all day in bench and maybe doing 20 sets of really low reps over the course of two hours, I move through a quicker. But I'll do 135, 225, 235, 315 and then maybe when I'm stronger, 4-5 for one set of, I'm going to be 45 with bands for a set of six with red bands and then that's it for bench. But I trained that whole point was I was a powerlifting and then from there I'll go and I maybe do incline barbell for, and then I'm three to four sets of 10 to 12 and then maybe flat dumbbell three sets of 12 reps and then maybe cable cross overs and I kind of do a couple more power movements, you know, compound movements like incline bench flat dumbbell and then I'll do kind of a pump movement where I do the cable cross over nine, I might do three or four sets, I don't even really count on sometimes I might do five sets and those reps are like 10, 12, 15 even all the way up to 20 reps and the whole point is what all the bodybuilders always talk about like blood volume and then at the end I'll finish for something like dips almost always and I think dips, you know, when I'm when I'm thinking dips is I'm hitting chest hit a little bit shoulders and getting blood in the triceps also and that's kind of my finishing thing and then really there's never intended to be that way but that's just how kind of how my workouts go so you know I'm back it would be I come in I'm doing dead lifts and I'm basically a power lift I'm having a goal I'm on hit a PI I want to hit it whatever my goal is hit this many this much weight for this many reps and then after that then I go through my back workout with compound movements and now I'll finish with the kind of like that blood volume thing and I'll finish with something like seated rope rows and then at the end I might do some kind of compound movement like Romanian dead lifts or something and it was never never planned and doing that I just kind of realized as I was training people doing nutrition work and eventually people want training routines also I kind of as I'm writing out these routines I realize that there's that follows this pattern and that's kind of I guess what the power power bodybuilding pattern would be as you know exercise one is almost like a power lifter maybe not a power through our shooting for singles or soon for a PR event eventual meat day PR of a single but I'm shooting to get stronger for low reps on a compound core power lifting movement then after that I'm a bodybuilder and then I finish with some kind of blood volume thing and then I do kind of a multi a multi body part like like I say with dips or something like that or walking lunges for legs. I feel there I think there is I don't know what it is and I've had people just I've had people when they when they when they when I do photo shoots or videos that they come me I have a certain gants or hardness looker some kind of you know no one as a bodybuilder ever they always look at themselves and feel like they're smaller than everyone else so I I can't tell what they're talking about but I can definitely tell when I and we're on other bodybuilders who trade hard and heavy I mean I think you look at someone like Ronnie Coleman and there's just something different about his muscles and say like a flex wheeler or something and I think there is or Johnny Jackson you know you can tell he's done heavy deadlift there's just something it looks like you know it looks like you could take your 22 and shoot him in the back and he'd hardly notice that anything happened yeah I think it definitely does and I think it helped too I mean when I went back to school I didn't train for six years and I still would I never really dropped a little about 232 35 I mean I wasn't like a lean 230 but still walking on school I would get comments about working out or you know ask me what my work up was and you know where I hadn't even stepped foot in a gym for five years I think there's something that sticks with you with it and I think there's some kind of core strength thickness I don't know maybe you know like you look at a guy's arm that trains heavy you know like you look at there's plenty of bodybuilders big biceps and big triceps but you look at someone who trains really heavy and it's held 700 pound deadlifts there's just kind of a look to their their forearms and a thickness to the arm that I think you don't get from pump movements you might get nice round pretty muscles but there's kind of a just a thick overall which I think looks cool I mean when I first started training even when I you know like I always said I'd just train more powerlifting and strongman type stuff for football but even you know you still want to look big but the kind of look I always wanted was like a billkaz my or something something that looked powerful I just I don't want to just look like you know round and balloony I wanted to look you know I wanted to be you know be strong and look strong you think some guys you look it looks like you know they got that big round muscle but it looks like you could go two knuckles deep with your finger squishing in and then there's other guys it looks like you touched the muscle and it would be like hitting a brick wall yeah branch more and yeah that greeny hard look you can tell he you could tell he puts the work in the gym zero and actually in some things like some of my usually for squats most of my best workouts with squats I think because I'm less bloated my lower back is less tight actually I get my best squat workouts probably halfway through a diet somewhere between you know eight and twelve weeks out but yeah nothing nothing trains at all still do the same thing and I never really lose a lot of I study fairly lean in the off season I never really lose a lot of weight pre-countess I mean they reach as a point where you start getting really lean and low in calories low in carbs and depleted where it's just it's just not smart to try to squat six hundred pounds but I still train the same I still train hard and heavy and how do you divide body parts and how frequently do you right now I'm training I split I do five days a week I do just let's say I say I start my knee doesn't really matter but say just Monday then back Tuesday then I take went Wednesday off then Thursday would be arms Friday would be shoulders Saturday would be legs and Sunday off so I do two on one off three on one off and part of it is I have some kind of auto immune issue which I was having which part of why I left the sport years ago where I my body attacks my muscles it kind of views them views the damage from training is a form body and kind of creates it immune response to it and really if I after about three days in a row of training I start getting like little mini-fevers so that's really part of the reason I do that I break it up chest and back two days in a row then if I train to third day I would start running in a fever so I take that day off and I do two easy groups arms and then shoulders before hitting legs and then I have another day off to recover for training partner when it's the right training partner I mean training with Steve Cooke-Lose to get some great workouts that training with my kicky when I was a kid I have some great workouts but in the absence of a really good training partner I'd rather train alone than train with which I have the training partner who is not willing to work harder and a lot of unfortunately I feel a lot of the bodybuilders don't want to train hard they want they don't like to start out like a part of it they don't want to they always worry about getting injured or getting hurt or they want to go right to the pumping stuff so I mean a good training partner is better than training alone but training alone is better than I'm training with a bad training partner yeah muscle memory definitely I mean I I started out training again I mean I guess four or five months ago and it's now well it's August now I started training again in April and I mean muscle memory came back quick I gained I went from 2.35 to 2.45 it went in a matter of you know two or three weeks and got leaner I stayed at 2.45 for a while I struggled with my appetite but I eventually got pretty pretty lean at 2.45 and then started climbing again once my appetite kicked in after a while and back up to about 265 which is I mean at this body fat in my peak I was probably around 285 maybe around 262 to 62 right now so I'm about 20.25 pounds below my peak which you know was quick I mean probably was open I think probably delusionaly that I would you know it only take three months and I'd be back huge again but it's gone a lot quicker and I think a lot of it is my strength came back much quicker probably too quick because I've had some little injury but my strength came back much quicker than the size did and I think I attribute that to the heart heavy training I think that that background and power lifting is something that you just I think your body just remembers there was you know for 15 years it needed to be strong for some reason and I think your body remembers that really quick and and I always say you know that strength comes size is going to come you know if you're you can you can want small eggs but if you're squatting 500 pounds for sets of 12 you're going to have big legs whether you want them or not and so I think that that's you know that that foundation strength has helped a lot with coming back yeah well I mean almost everybody part I have different types of things that that I do I do I have you know YouTube videos of a bunch of them but they're just little isolation type things like certain like way bent over rows where I do bent over rows but instead of doing a normally I'll stand on a box and I'll stay way bent over so it ends up almost the way your body's tilted down and ends up almost being a like a pull down but you're doing a row of against gravity I do seated rope rows with the same thing where I stay way forward and I actually round my upper back a lot of little tricep things I do I think my triceps became a stand-up body part some of the things I I would do form would be what pressed downs kale pressed downs go with a wide grip and I cram my elbows in tight against my side I felt like that really hit the long head of the triceps which is the largest kind of the three heads I do cable overhead extensions a couple of videos that on a lead actually where I do cable overhead extension my hands apart and then as I reach failure I put my hands together on the positive where you get a little bit more leverage as you get weaker and then keep them back apart on the negative and then eventually I reach failure that way I kind of keep them together the pattern just being out a few more reps so it's almost like three sets in a row kind of like a rest-post like thing I don't really have any for chuss which might be why my chest is one of my worst body parts but yeah I mean I don't really have any I've I've never been one of those like unique exercise finesse here's the specialty thing that I use to bring out the outer head of my hamstring I just kind of figure going get heavy get strong if you you know if you're doing a set of 10 or 600 pounds on deadlift you're going to have a big thick back you can you can want a skinny little back but it's not going to happen at that point now just always took that philosophy get strong in the basic lifts and you're going to get big the progress this you know there's just something I maybe I get a bigger endorphin kick than then a lot of people but there's just something about whatever your days like there's having that that that knowing at the end of the work there whatever you get to go to the gym and then something you know you don't want to go there you don't feel like training but you get there and you start getting the blood flow and you start feeling strong and just kind of get that testosterone surge I don't know what it is just that competitive thing that you know going up your sports you're always playing football baseball or something and there's always competition and always you know getting wrestling we're getting fights with your friends or who knows but there's just always something that kind of feels that and then you become an adult and you have kids and you just don't have that anymore you wake up you can't kick for breakfast and you know more the line and go to bed and there's just never you know ever get that feeling of you know like I think something that you know that is just having side of on something to some kind of aggression just to get out that you can't ever get out and I just that's what I love about training just that feeling of you finish a set you know you finish a sort of 500 pounds on squats and you can't breathe and you just turn and you feel exhausted and it should feel horrible but it doesn't it just it feels great and unless you've been there you can't explain it but yeah you
