Hello, welcome to another Elite FTSQ Ask We Answer with Dave Tate. I'm Shina Lee-Dum Content Coordinator of Elite FTS and we're going to go ahead and get started. Our first question comes from Ryan and he asks, how will this LTT7 be different from previous years? Each learned to train seminar that we do is always a little bit different than the one previously because we use the surveys every seminar that I've ever done that I can think of had been surveyed going all the way back to the very first seminar that I did because I learned that it was through the responses of the participants that we could get better with the learn to train because it's kind of taken to seminars to a higher level than what I've done previously. The feedbacks become even more important. So to answer the question of how this one's going to be different than previous ones, I'm really only going to only go off learn to train six compared to what we're going to learn to train seven because learn to train six was so far different than five, four, three, two, one, each one is progressed in its own way to be better than what the previous was and every seminar has its faults which we correct and then make it a strength then you find out that something else didn't go well so you try to fix that. So this one I think we pretty much have all the basis covered and granted I'm sure we do something we'll pop up but difference between this one and previous seminars, this time we're bringing the speakers down to really just three people. We're going to have Matt Winning and we're going to have Josh Bryant and they're going to speak on programming how to develop strength training program predominantly for a squat bench and deadlift and we're going to allow them to speak for an hour and a half which is going to give enough time for them to cover pretty much their methodology and a general sense for them to cover it in specific sense would take a whole day but enough for some people will walk away saying this is how you're supposed to train how Matt Winning we want you to train this is how you're supposed to train how Josh Bryant wants you to train and then allow time for the Q&A's after that. My presentation is going to be actually based on whatever the previous attendance when we send out the pre-registeration we're going to ask them what they want me to speak on. This is entirely based upon whatever they tell me so I can't even tell you what I'm going to speak on at this point in time that's completely an open door so the lecture part of it is going to be a lot more specific and a lot more detailed than it's ever been in the past for the learn to train. The practical part we're going to limit the number we're going to cut it down I think we got a little bit in over our head the last time when things are for charity and you see people they're signing up you kind of get in that mindset of we can fit one more we can fit one more and last time I think we got a little in over our head so we're bringing the numbers down substantially we're going to try to cut it off at 60 where the last time we had 80 which is going to go over still going to have the same number of coaches which is going to bring up the coach attendance ratio I do believe I don't have the exact list we're going to have around 30 coaches so now you're talking you know one coach per two people which is going to cover everything that they need to have covered that that's the main difference is you know we're increasing the service by cutting the numbers down pricing why isn't going to stay the same so if not like we're going to cut the numbers that and increase the price and the lectures are going to be way more structured and detailed but still understandable because the presenters that we have know how to break things down and to an understandable way so a beginner will be able to sit there and completely understand what's going on they don't have to have an advanced degree and strength and conditioning to be able to understand the programming you know regardless of their level when they leave they're going to know you know how map programs and how Josh program which by the way are completely two different styles so while you may think it will be confusing to whoever the attendance are it's far from that they're going to latch on and they're going to they're going to find commonality in one of the two so everybody's going to walk away with a better understanding on how they should train for themselves awesome well thank you Ryan for your question if you have any more concerns or questions about the Learner Train seminar just go ahead on our website www.eledefts.com or check out our Facebook page
