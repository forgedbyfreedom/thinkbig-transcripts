отStill I'm sitting on a cold green plane Going in the wind, talking to you This is the only way to bring That's the way you go, sleep in The plane to TV too Someone has to think about the current panel What's going on here? What's going on here? And the team home together I want you all to be on to call me a breaker You can't see the road When you go, we will talk to each other We will talk to each other We will talk to each other We will talk to each other We will talk to each other We will talk to each other We will talk to each other The way you go, flow to our senses We will talk to each other We will talk to each other We will talk to each other We will talk to each other
