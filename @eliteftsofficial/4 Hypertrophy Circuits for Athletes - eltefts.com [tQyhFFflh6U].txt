Mark Watts, lead at DS.com, we own the campus of a band in the university and I got a dark ear because I want to make sure you're in this slide not to face so don't be offended. This is part of our Sports Performance Coach Education Series and today we're going to talk about some high-purchase circuits or some of you call high-preacherous circuits for athletes and again how do you get some more work done at the end of a session and this came about because again I found out as a coach is that it's really difficult to try and measure. I know we're in the age of measurement. Wherever you think means to be measured but at the same time sometimes you just gotta get worked on and I got about four methods that may help you. I don't think they're groundbreaking but at the same time it's something that we thought really helped us utilize our time and again got our athletes understanding and bought into what we're doing because it gave them a little bit of autonomy and it gave them a little bit of ownership over the training session. So we'll talk about these four and I'll go right through it. So again the first thing we can do with Dropsets and this is something that I know Josh Bryan has talked about a lot of athletes have talked about and basically we're talking about it as this. We're going to change the angle, we're going to change the incline, we're changing the folder, hand positions of the exercise. So we did a couple of videos on how to do that with two bench press exercises with the boards, one, two, three, four board press and a five position hand position, Swiss bar drop set. So if you're changing the angle or changing the hand position for whatever it may be again I'm able to make that exercise more difficult without adding weight. So when you're talking about putting some size and putting gaining some general overall body size, just more muscle, more armor on your athlete, this is one of those things. Especially when you're talking about isolated movements we really need to need to target some different areas with their athletes that are needing them. So again what happens is to get the biggest thing with this is it eliminates changing of weights, it really eliminates the time that's spent. So with these drop sets there's so many different different ones you can do but I'll just give you three examples and I know we have some resources around doing this as well. Dumbbell elevators, I know Joe Kenner and Oracle way back in a day about these and then we had myself and Derek Doltard did a video on these and again basically we were talking about take a super set like dumbbell incline dumbbell presses with incline dumbbell rows. So again chest supported rows basically what you're doing is keeping the same dumbbells and working the way down the incline. So pretty high up now again I'm doing a high incline flip over I'm doing a row which is more like almost like a high high po hybrid. You know put that weight down put the bench down and now we're working on a little bit lower. You're more fatigued but you're at a more advantageous angle to perform that exercise. So you work your way all down sometimes it's good to go from you know again I don't know if you need to go from 90 to flat but you can go for a couple in between there and really now you're getting more worked on. So I've listened to the athlete performance really for you know sets even if you're too inclines they're using four sets with no rest in between and then you're really not taking too much time away from your other athletes too. So that's an example of that the other ones like up the rack pushups again put in a bar bar or Swiss press bar interact do pushups raise it up. Well we end up doing because we you know we're limited on space we end up using the safety catchers of the rack put them at the lowest part again they'll spin a little bit but you know obviously the athletes once they get their hands in position and they're pushing through the pump on with their hand it's really wasn't a problem was an anation but again now working pushups with that safety catch you know across the bottom moving that out one or two spaces still perform the reps all of a sudden now my body angle you know it's a closed chain version of the first mechanical drop set now my body angle is working my way up it gets easier as I get more fatigue I get more work done and the last part is just body and row same thing with that just you know change your foot position so you kind of understand what we're trying to get at you know any time you can change the angle and you don't have to change ways you can keep that after you keep your hands on that on that on those you know blast trap handles you're just going to get more worked on and again at the end of the day does your body really know understand they just know that again it's filled that the body is being you know fatigue and it's as needs to adapt so from high-perish which standpoint that's really what we're looking at. All right seven ones going to be a rep goal this is pretty easy it seems almost almost kind of but there's a couple of things that you know we addressed early which made it work a little easier for us again total recipe performance few sets is possible so again this is kind of the after you be a rich chunk this down and again it's really when you pair this up so again for us we're going to say hey you need to do this many hand raises this many blast rep rows this many uh we need all pushups at the end of the workout right not the core list but at the end of the workout they can do those in any angle so are any any order they want to and you know obviously they are able to do that some people struggle with more than the other and they're able to kind of hit that in between so everybody's able to work especially we're lucky enough that seven little hand raised benches so you know we're able to do some of that you know the rep goal can be increased or decreased you know throughout the cycle so again we would do that you know offseason we're trying to ramp that up in season we're really trying to ramp that down so we might start with 50 and it work all the way down you know it just it just depends on your philosophy and again how your athletes are responding that to the goal is increased performance so again in the end when we're 25 blue hand raised it doesn't seem like a lot but I think that that you can do some things to help with the parameters of this for some of your guys are doing 5 sets of 5 I mean something you know if you're really doing the blue hand raise right under myself and there's so many you know in so much information out there you can easily manipulate that by saying okay some of your guys that that's might be easier for maybe they're doing one and a half reps maybe they're doing a positive bottom if you have some guys you more of your exposure guys you're doing a positive bottom so it just kind of depends on one who who your athletes are but you might not have to change that and you can always change by position you know I got my my my my my my my my my guards point guards and and and and and two's you know they're doing this many reps the bakes are doing this many reps so I have a basketball team you understand you know you can manipulate that anyway you want to say things with a chance like a set I know 15 chips and somebody were doing that in one set but the easy thing to do with this now you can change so that maybe if you have athletes it can't really do chinos maybe they just do 15 negatives depending on when you're at season that could be a very beneficial for them to get their point when they can do some of some of their own or maybe they do one regular one negative for some athletes if they're really cranking out 15 instead of adding weight on them rather low which takes more time now the sudden you can just manipulate how they perform the exercises for as you know maybe it's a five second eccentric maybe it's a positive top maybe it's a you know obviously I'm segment I'm pausing halfway up halfway down myself and Jordan Houser in a video and how to make regularly pull up horror without ad weight and so that that's another important component you can add with it so you can adjust without adjusting the reps or the exercise and you can always have the parameters for different sports and different times any years so that's up to you all right third thing a rep ladder I really like this I got this originally from Judy Barnett who was with me he's uh as with the ravens out but we were together at west point and it's pretty brilliant it's a way to really get volume to kind of sneak up on you see pulls and Ella has a kind of an ascending rep scheme that that I've stolen from him as well but really then you're really you know again same thing working groups of two to four you're going through a rep range and you can also work up and then down and and really you can increase the volume and minimize the tays again if I'm doing one set the failure that next set I'm probably gonna have a couple of rep drop off and maybe I don't have as much all of a sudden now and if I'm doing an exercise and I'm working myself you know you know one rep and two reps and three reps and all of a sudden I get the ten reps I think that's 55 you have to check my map I think it's 55 reps I don't know if I'm doing you know a set of 25 and a set of 20 you know two sets of 25 you know back to back so that's one thing that you can you can you can manipulate the examples with this would be you know pull us you do one rep at a time blast drop roll we would do three reps at a time maybe depending on your athletes too maybe that's five but you did that's why you're coaching because you can gauge where they're at so you know push up for example would be maybe five reps at a time you know depending on the athletes but again where you can do is if you have it half these it again some athletes might be able to work you know after three reps and you want two three and they get gas a fail on on the on the the four sets the four reps set you know you can kind of manipulate that by making a work away back down so really easy thing we did the same thing we did clean ladders or snatch ladders over it's while I would ever maybe but we would really just make sure that they had to have a certain number of sets total so you're going to work your way up to ten sets so if I work my way up to ten boom that's I've got that to all ten sets I did one all the way through ten if I fail it if I fail it three or four I'm working my way back down and staying on that lower number maybe I do one the way back down I do you know one one rep on the way up you know the way back down maybe I'm doing no I'm doubling those reps are doing two sets at each one and the way down but manipulate the number sets the volume will be based on the athletes ability but you can manipulate the sets to make sure that the athletes are still you know performing as many sets as you want them to the last one's going to be standardized drop sets this was this is another thing again the one thing you have more of in your way run than anything else probably plates or bumpers and you know you've got dumbbells if you're more than one or two sets you're lucky same thing with kettlebells very expensive so it's one of those things that you know you have more plates than probably anything so we were trying to use those again for example we would just go ahead and you can do this either two failure you can do those you know just a certain amount of goal reps and then the last reps they'll fail it or so it's just kind of up to you and you can you can also work your way up then down if you need to be the volume good a good one single leg RdL would have been you know again using you know 25 25 kilo bumper holding it like a steering wheel shoulder blade you've attracted you know and then it would just perform single leg RdL each step put it down grab the 20 kilo and work your way that way or line-trice of extensions anything you think it's easier to grab a plate and be able to use a movement just use plates and work your way down all of a sudden you're getting that extra volume you're getting that work to you know especially specifically with heart purge free and really to address work capacity without you know racking your brain about again do you really have to measure and how much weight or how your athletes are progressing without rear delt rays or a tries of extension you know that's kind of you know that's your your pet your picture poison so again hope those four help you you know for me I think it's one of those one of those aspects where again the more working get your athletes doing a minimum of time that they leave that work out and better prepare for the next training session I think that's important so again any questions make sure you hit us up on the comment
