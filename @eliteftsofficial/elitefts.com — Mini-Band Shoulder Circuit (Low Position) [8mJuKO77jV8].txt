This is more cost for leadFDS.com. We're here with Jordan House, our associate editor. We're going to demonstrate a very quick circuit for shoulder health with the mini-bans. What this circuit you can use are used. Mini-bans, micro-mines, more monster-mines, depending on the ability of your athlete, the lovely your athlete's hat. So, the first thing we're going to do is just align. We already have the band set up. So, if you have a large group of athletes, you just set up the bands at the bottom of the racks. We'll go ahead with an external rotation. So, again, just going front, front, slide on the ground. Make sure it's cool, control on the ascetic. To adjustness, he can go ahead and move his upper arm down a 45 degree angle. And again, the more of a 45 degree angle, the easier it is for that exercise. If you're more perpendicular to body, then that's going to be a little bit more difficult. As soon as he's done, he's going to get up, stay on the knees, cross over with the bands. Now he's just going to do a scare. So, make sure he's put your shoulder blades in his back pocket. Come up on straight, lock it in, and make sure he can bring your shoulder blades together. And down, we're very important. He can adjust the difficulty with this exercise by how far full see is or for the weight is from the right. All right. Third exercise, as both of us, we're going to exertness, going to be just facing up right row with cross up with the many bands. Again, trying to get those elbows higher. Then the wrist, make sure he's coming all the way back. Just really keeping those shoulder blades together. Same thing. If he's farther back, it's going to be more of a massage or a plane. It's going to be basically more of your del. So that's what we'll put the circuit for you. Keep those shoulders up.
