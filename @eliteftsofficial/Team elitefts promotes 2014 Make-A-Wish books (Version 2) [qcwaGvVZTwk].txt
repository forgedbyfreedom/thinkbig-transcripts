Hi, this is Bob Young's. Hi, this is Anna Dordetianne. Hi, this is Julie Oleduski. Every year the members of Team Elite FTS and people closely associated with our site, band together and write chapters for our programs that work e-books. This year will also be offering an additional book, How I Train For, which provides detailed information on how the strongest athletes in the world get ready for their best competition results. The popularity of these books is due to the fact that it would be impossible. Find more densely packed collection of practical training knowledge anywhere else. More importantly all proceeds from sales of these books support Make A Wish Foundation. Ohio Kentucky and Indiana. An amazing charity that provides hope and benefits children suffering from serious medical issues. I encourage you to not only invest in copies of these great e-books and share links on Facebook and other social media outlets. This is a project that can make a serious difference because when we all pull together wishes can come true. Please contribute.
