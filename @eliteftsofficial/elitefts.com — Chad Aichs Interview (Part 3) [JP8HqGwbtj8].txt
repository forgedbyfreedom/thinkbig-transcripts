Everybody Steve Coltscott here for leadFTS.com. I'm here talking again with Chad Ike's and my question for Chad this time He's been in you see my name right every time I like that I I'm careful on that one is so what exactly when you go to commercial jams what stuff do you see that it just drives you a shape crazy? I'm gonna say not even commercial jams. Let me say any gym Guys that squat nowhere near depth, but think they're squatting full Or a person that squats quarter squats and then though they laugh at somebody that wears a suit who actually goes to depth It's like well your squats sucks anyway who cares if he's got a suit on or not Guys loading up the leg press and going like this I don't see the purpose I know you got a thousand pounds you're barely moving it so what Rai-Rai people I hate rai-Rai people it's all you it's all you good job The spider this bench pressing it's all you it's all you I didn't help it all it was all you I hate that X-y I went to gyms like commercial gyms if I'm out of town or something I got to get and like I get pissed when anybody touches the bar So if I need help grab it if not let go of the damn bar I don't want you touching it at all What's uh what would the ideal gym be like are you currently? Tell us about where you're right now? I trained in American Iron Gym in Reiner Nevada and honestly I think that is probably The optimum model for a gym because Most of the true strength gyms that I know it's hard to make money It's not like it can be a sustainable business people do it because they love it or because they're personal trainers and are training out of their own gym American Iron who's pretty much set up with All the machine and select realized stuff We have actually have a little cardio room much a nice tread mill stair steppers shit I never get on But then we have another side of the gym. We have What do we have four five elite power racks now we have four competition benches We have a power squat Glutamera is reverse hyper. Do we have almost all the bars we have chamber bars safety bars fat bars Good squat bars good deadlift bars. We have pretty much all the strong land stuff farmers walk yoke Big tires at listones. I mean we have pretty much everything and so we'll have like 80 old ladies in their training That just want to stay in shape because they're old and guys up to me and we've had professional body builders in there skiers all kinds of different athletes and it's actually kind of cool because It all mingles together kind of I've had old ladies come I had one of my shirts that I sell as I may have came to this world small, but I'm going out huge and I was doing something at the dumbbell rack And I look into mirror and this old ladies behind me and I turn around and she goes hey, that's your it's awesome I really like that You know and then people come up and anybody who's in there that doesn't meet people come up and ask about them And it's like a little community, but it's still enough that As long as whatever you want to do as long as it's serious I mean if you want to lose 20 pounds, but you're serious about losing 20 pounds you can go to that gym You know it seems like there's a trend towards there's there's so few gyms like that There's a trend towards kind of private garage set up for yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, because there I mean there's a lot of gyms were people You know I used to go to a My sister lived in Vegas for a while and I and I used to go to this brand name gym in summer Lin, which is a really nice area and I went there in purpose and I would bring my own chains or my own bands and my own chalk and they'd have signs up that says Don't take your bag in a gym area and I'm like And I would go in there and make as big a mess it as much noise as I possibly could to see if anybody would actually say anything I mean and I would just stare at the kids at the front desk and they're like you know You can say it shit that they I mean like they want you to go in there and not train You know, there's another One that starts with a pee that they won't even have heavy dumbbells and you can't make any noise and what's the point? It's jacer size I mean so you need there needs to be airing. I don't know why any gym can't set it up where you have a little heavier area for people and any other I mean I Speaking for myself I don't if somebody's in there and they go hey, I just want to get in shape I cool you're at the gym man you're working out whatever if you don't want to bench 900 pounds Okay, I don't understand it, but instead of why you don't but whatever, I mean least they're in a gym doing something Okay, very good. Thank you You
