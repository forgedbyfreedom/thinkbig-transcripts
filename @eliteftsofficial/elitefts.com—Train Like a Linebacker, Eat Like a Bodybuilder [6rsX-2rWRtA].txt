So, the sky who is a lumberjack goes into a lumber tank about 5.7 and a 220.5 pounds, doubt down. He says, what's the record for trees falling? Formants that, well, that's 7.7 trees knock down one day, but that's big job. First day, he wants out the rails, trees. He's knocking them down left and right at the end of the day. How many trees did you knock down? He said, that's 6. So the next morning, the sky goes out, can't get. Those out in the forest works way through lunch, knock the trees down. That's how I am, that's how I am. That's the stud. This is a, the trees you knock down today. That's it. So the next morning, he'll get the floor of the sun. He goes out, he's taking trees all day, works through lunch. Finish is the day, dinner, that's gone. Comes in his dog. He goes, got out of it. How many do you knock down today? He says, that floor. He's pulling the trees. So the formula looks at, he says, you know, exactly. I have never seen anybody who works harder in all my life. But at any point, did you stop in short in your axe? And that's what you guys are doing right now. You're short in your axe. And that's kind of impressive because I don't know what the background you guys come from. Just for a guessing Jesus, I say, how many people are coaches? Like, not personal trainers because I'm going to do that. And I said, coach, it's cool. How many are personal trainers? Okay. I'm not going to say anything bad. How many are cross pairs? Okay. There you go. By the way, that's a good luck in the bearded sport care person. And I heard that, but I'm going to steal from David Allen and say, you know that you're a business owner when you have high blood pressure and you're going to be 28. I'm going to get all of that. Yeah. All right. So Mark kind of touched upon it, but he said, I come from a very, very background. Why did you get into trade? Watch this. I got this later. Why did you get into the bomb trade? Yeah. This is your boyfriend in the floor. Okay. Let me see. See you on. Number one. Why did you start training at your fender? Yeah. It was more wrestling. Rest of sport. Okay. I'm left hand. So by the way, I'm right in the racing immediately. So I kind of like, you know. That why did you start training? I was going to talk to you about the job that I did. So this was so that you had benefits of health. Okay. Better. The health for the job. Okay. Okay. All right. If I don't get your names, it's because you're not wearing a tattoo. And I just suck at it anyway. So. Yes. Why did you start training? Actually because I wanted to help other health kids who learn how I had to do this first. So you're a, you're a, you're a, you're a, first of. And you say kids and I'm, I'm going to segue off. Okay. Your high school strength. Straight. Yes. That's my state. Yeah. Okay. Let me, let me, Chris, Carl, cross their. Why did you start training? I was. 60 pounds of weight. I want to take my life. I'm going to go small. I need to go small. I'm going to go small. Okay. So I'm kind of like, they're, they're different reasons. I was vertically challenged. No. Did you just like that? I didn't. I got a lot of questions. But I had aspirations of playing black background in a film. That wasn't going to happen. And I realized that when I was. Yeah. Maybe. I'm 56 now. So I realized that it's 50. And here's the thing. I started out, you know, why I'm seeing a weight room. And the rule there was you had to be 15. I stopped in at 12. I looked at 9. And I, and this old guy. And by the way, anybody know the definition of old. You're getting it. Hold on. I didn't know like this. You know, did I tell you what the definition of old is? No, but I don't think it's made. Not on your, 15 years older than you are. And I was raining by. Okay. So you're about old. 15 years from now you'll be old. But then you push the nubs, right? You got that? I'm never. Anyway, salt. I can't see. I could not bench press 100 pounds. And I'm just kidding in the corner. I worked out with this. Why not who is part of this called culture? You, you, you, you guys are all too young. The physical culture where where budget gymnastics guys used to. The weight bar goes up on their feet. You do lay presses. Freestanding. There was a defensive end that played for 10 to see. It came home for the summers to work out this weight room. A buyability is due as huge. Well, that's all. You're under the balance. So anyway. So we would all get our assignments. And then I could go to the Ricky bench in the corner. And I would do a form wherever the exercise that there's old. Throughout the debate. And my goal was to support my sport habit, which was playing tailback and lineback. And I played through. Pop order went to high school play. The pharmacy is a freshman and back again. That was like a new thing. And I felt recommend that for a lot of kids. It was a little skill work. But I got to play. And I was college. And I had visions of running down. The 50 yard line. The 50 yard line. And I got the crew there. And I was going to be a Saturday hero man. All 110,000. Anyways, I looked at the statement. And I remember on that. And I went down the end. It looked like a whole group. And I painted the picture. I was going to come back one of the warm green helmets. And I got to be where Michigan Park just pissed the day off. So anyway, I didn't do that. Because I came back in my high school coach that you've never played a minute of a game with anything. You're trained up. Everything is out in the division. Three, two, rest. What is that? Anyway. So that's an excellent story. But I've always thought of myself. My background. By the way, Matthew, he's a girl. I'm a chill like that. So what's the best program to do that? By the way, this is the TV online. I don't understand the picture. Because if you heard me speak the last time, like, totally went off the cuff. I had that 10, so it's so fair. I'll bring you back to the end. So what's the best program? The best program is when you're done. You like it? You got your energy, Jim. You're training hard every day. Now, what's the best program? It's when you're not building. Because that's all the stuff you need to do. But you don't like to do it. Now, I'll give you an example. And this is going to be a big. If you follow my logs, I'm going to go through this. And you can read. And I'm going to be very, very detailed. I'm not a detailed guy. But we say, if you work your weaknesses, okay? Now, I always go in and I do glue cans for kind of squat, man. I squat. I warm up doing glue hamstring raises. I squat. And then, as an accessory work, I do more squats. I know it's a dress. Because here we've heard this. We've heard this and said, you know what? You want to stabilize spine. Put more weight on your squat. You'll get stronger. That's not necessarily true. Now, you'll hear argument, but I'm going to tell you, I'm not the mercy. I'm not at the mercy of anyone that has that theory. And I'm both at all. It does that? Large. That's a dog. Look at him. Look at that. That guy doesn't know too much because he always is. I don't know. No, you're stuck to the gap. Do it that guy that, that, that, trapezoor's ex-do. No, you're going to get stronger. So, I always have to glue hamstring raises. And by the way, I glue hamstrings back in college. But I got the strongest hamstrings on the planet right now because I do them by sets of like gay. And then I go, wait for that son. I do because I always done it. I don't feel the workout here. The workout, unless I do more. I can't leave the gym without doing squat. God forbid. I don't squat. If I don't squat, that's not working. Right? Um, let's see. Uh, we'll pick up somebody here. I don't know. I don't know. He works out my gym by the way. All right. All right. Where's that one guy? Look at him. He was huge. Anyway, I can't find that muscle left. Big of Stevenson's done. He didn't have here anymore. All right. So anyway, you can't work. You got, you know, he didn't beat it. So, I always do what you always done. You get what you already have. Do you hear that one? All right. So, you got a squat. You got a squat. More. You got a squat. So, you can't squat. When you, when you're done with that, you don't have a second. Unless you have that particular exercise. So, I don't hear it. Tell me, no, no. I went in the gym the other day after going back. Oh, yeah. I'm going to detail this progress and rehab. I'm going to address that sparring better than the guild dolls. No, I got a wicked sparring. I pulled that crap apart. I had gone through all these videos. I bought all these CDs. And I pulled that very apart. He is wicked smart. Don't doubt about it. But some of the stuff that people come up with, I have no clue what they're saying. I consider myself a fairly educated human being. When I go like this, I want to say, hey, you can't play the explain. It simply simply don't know it. If I can't take it to the guy, you just want to be jacked. And say it in this way, you can really jack. You don't know it. Anyway, you don't do it from that. Okay, I'll ask this. Oh. Oh, yeah. So I designed programs based on getting fit. All right. Frequency intensity and time. Mode is an acronym. Frequency. How many exercises? How many actually about per week? There's been here saying parallelity and community. And you should know 12 to 14 a week. Now that is, now that you know what is, maybe four. How many times do we do you train? Five or six. How many times do you do? Five. No, okay. Okay, okay. How many times do you train? Seven eight. Seven eight. Okay. You're a big dude. How many times do you train? Three. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You left right. All right. How many times do you train? Seven eight. Seven eight. Okay. Four. Four. Four. Basically times you get it. Okay. I don't know where. I thought you stopped. I thought you were going. I thought I was going. Pretty far from that. Anyway. Based on that five times, you have two variables. Based on that four five times. That eight times. You have a variable on your intensity. How hard are you training? Now, I don't know if you might get an out-ass by participants. This question. How hard do you think that was for you? That's a perceived exertion scaling. When they turn to me, they say that's a five. I know that's 50%. Based on what they voted. Not what I voted. Now, here. I have the other end of that too. But God will take away just an actually smashed by it. I don't know. Okay. How hard was that? That was great. Okay. So let's put reverse fans on that because you're not going to play with you. So if I'm going to train at an intensity level, and we all want to think that we train hard. Nobody goes to the gym and is a fact. You're going there. You're just saying, laugh because that was like, really. You're going to say, you're not not. I'm going to put your crash. So, okay. You're going to be proud. I know I'm Tracy out in the hallway. She tried to pull back. Back in the hallway. I don't know. Only until it's awkward. Okay. I'm not discriminatory. I get on people. I get on people. No. I'm not discriminatory. I get on people. No. Don't come super. What do you say? Where's the longer? You know, osyclosing? Right? Now, here's all the creepy things to say. You're so different. You're just not. You're just not. You're totally totally your school. You're totally your school. You're getting it. If you're getting all that, just say, soon. That's a requirement. All right, so I'm on your attention level. If you're going to be really in test, eight, nine, ten, and you're free from sea, and you're free from sea, you're doing seven, eight, balance a week at eight, nine, and ten, then the only thing that you're adjusting is your time. Now here's the question, all right. Who here trains for ten minutes? No, that cool. You must have everybody here in an hour, 60 minutes? No? Regardless of your intensity and your time, don't pull me up. You don't move me. You're just smarter than your average value. Okay, so that's your variance. Now you're going to be 15, 20 minutes in your main exercise. You're going to take the energy by your frequency by your people. Because what happens if your frequency intensity is high and your time is long? That's whole burden. That's an ingredient waiting to happen. And I don't get you to try to debate me on this. I don't get you to do that. You know, I do this so that you won't act it. All right, is that fair trust me on this? It hurts. And I'm going to tell you what. There are some of you, J. I was going to be one of the ones that is definitely guilty of this. He's going to go to the hall and I'm going to go in there. I'm going to tear it off and I don't care. But that's why he's that way. And it works for him. We had this conversation last night. The guy on my way. Gay and Greek are a real man. Gay and Greek. Gay and Greek. You're not a free, go ahead and bring. No, J is a free. He can get away with this and you'll come up here and speak. You look at him and you go over the dark right that dude. And he has his heads and he's going to blow you up. He's going to make you want to get out of here and rip our bumper. He's going to go like that. I'm going to go with Chad Aix and he goes like this. He sends off me last night. Oh, I would imagine all of Chad. He's sleeping. I'm going to go home. Who the shit man, let's go. Anyway, this is where I saw I'm walking. I've broken a little couple of times this year. I don't want to just let this look. I'm telling you from the experience that if you do this, this is what's going to happen eventually. My intensity was to lie. I trained seven days a week because why? Why? Why? Why? I like going to the kid. And you know what I trained? I trained in free study in the morning. I do that because there's no one else around. To get in my way. Now, I don't mind you. I don't get paid to train. I don't get it. Chris Carwatt did one day a little early on. One of my feet and I was not done. And I kept the door open. I was going to go. And then I thought, oh, crap. He doesn't need that. He didn't need to do it. I said, you know that. But that's my time. That's why I do it a day at hour. I go to bed 6. 3. 9. But I can't. But I train seven days a week. And I hit those muscle groups because I don't squat itself at work out. If I don't back, I feel like I'm working out. I don't do pull-ups. It's not a workout in my book. And I do it for an hour. And I don't get what he has ever watched me train. I'm not a nice guy. I'm dialed in, speaking, complaining to myself. I'm at rule 67. It speaks, don't complain. I write it on the board. Well, I hear it. So I go, I'm a-ah. And I do it for an hour. Seven days a week. Three hundred and sixty days a year. I don't do it on the trial and day here. So that's three hundred and sixty one days a year. And we did this four times in four, two times whatever it is. And then eventually the breakdown. This year there was a peftair and lower back below. So why do I want to train like a lightbacker? Well, being a lightbacker was a take. It takes a variety of different sports skills. Now, if you're a power lifter, you can shut down for a second. If you're a, uh, certainly a bodybuilder, you can take a picture. I like football. I like what it stands for. And I use this. I train most of the people based on, um, being a professional linebacker. Um, I played it. I coached it. Um, I love the game. I think there are a lot of lessons there. I learn. I play football. Now, you two years forward. I know, ironically, my son plays hockey. I moved from, recall, to California. And I hope being cold. Where do I end up 40s a week? Anyway, our in-argible. You cannot deny this. The best thought. That's how it feels over the tight ends. We're lying back. They think they have to quality of both. I just think lying back. It's cool. That's why I say tight end. So top this straight, quickness. Power, endurance speed, body composition, mobility, agility, and power, agility, and power, stability. That's complete. That's complete. Pack. Me, that's complete workout. You engage all of those components in a week. And that's a complete workout. Okay? Um, was that? Altitude. Altitude. All right. This kind of changed the game. Look at him. I can, I can chair the arms up for most people by hand. All right. So dude, I can't, I forgot. All right. So here's the prison. Because I don't have any original thought. I stole everything. And I make it work for me. Okay. So I shouldn't go out of that, but we're not coming. Anyway. So I lay out a program in combat sports academy. That's cool name of Jim. I feel like we're going to work out. And I do it like this. Here is your first time. Mark. No. Tell about the different April. May. May. May. May. May. May. May. May. May. May. Let's do this. How. January. We'll be at no December. I start planning out the yearly objective based on a person being a lineback. Do you come in my gym? All right. John. John comes in and Jim. I look at John. What is it you want? What do you want to do with this program? What do you want to do? You want to do it? Be in the house. Okay. All right. So John comes in. John comes in. John comes in. John comes in. So Dr. Z was being a lineback. John. What do you want to do with my program? Yes. Awesome. Okay. That's good. Awesome. He has overall objective to say like look good naked. I don't want to be strong. But I don't want to be a bad champion. I want to be jacked. So I will never have to move that muscle. If that is something comes up. I hang out with big guys. I'll let them handle that. comes up. You know, I hang out with big guys all at the end of the day. We are just a dad. Anyway, so, um, check it out. I threw this one, it was like, oh. Was that? It was the eye fashion. That's the end of the day. Anyway, I actually, I had laser-icers three weeks ago. All right? So I had it on Wednesday, 15, that's even now. It's better, it's a guy call. I go back the next day and they test your eyes as you have it. I don't do it. So I go, I read the thing, I read the thing, I read the thing. I go, oh, that's pretty amazing. You got 20, 20, that is a 20, 20, a big two. And it's only going to get that right on. Wow. That's great. I go, I have actually this. You might, you know, do it. You might want to check that vote. You'd be okay. I just had two. So anyway, who is a girl with that one? All right, so you're good, Jimmy. We're getting a week and they all look good. The play was based on being a language. And January, February, March. That lays out as this. I want to work on everybody's, because here's the thing. You want something, I'm going to give you something, because by the way, I've got over three decades of experience. I want you to stay with me, so I'll give you what you want. But I know what you need. And you need flexibility, hip mobility, and you've got to school to the problem with and so you're sick and tired. So I can use the word, Swat's, so you're cute. Well, we're going to do this again. Yes. Because you're kind of not really great at it right now. You know, so we're going to work it on to your crepe. Well, wait, wait, wait. I get to lift the weight. I don't know. You've earned the right to lift the weight. And nothing's going on in your back. And so I make sure that this movement is dialed in and hammered to perfection. 300 repetitions to create a movement pattern. 5,000 to collect the whole feeling. So some of you guys are going to come in. Some of you guys are going to come in. And you're going to squat like this tomorrow. And I'm going to know. And we're going to work on this. And some of you guys are going to work with Bob Jones and I. I'm going to go, oh, I'm going to go away. And I could do more. I don't care what you can do. This is about sharpening your abs and getting better. So you can do more when you go home. Some of you guys are going to do it on a platform. Just bust records. And this is really cool. Anyway, I got to say I'm going to start on a tangent. So you come in and get your favorite large. I'm going to work on those basic things. We're going to work on mobility and the hips. We're going to work on stabilizing your spine. And we're going to work on the basic fundamental moves. What happens right here? Right here. Oh, this is bigger than it. I think. Okay. Well, he says football, but right here. You ought to see now. Right? Some time. You ought to become a soft barrae. You ought to be a good guy. You ought to be a good guy. Who does want you? What guy in here does want you to be sure of? Right? Get it off in first one. How do you do that? Well, we're going to go into a very big, high-terrificy phase. While still maintaining what we're going to require. Because everything piggybacks. Okay. Does this make a sense to you? We're trying to like linebackers getting my yearly plan down? Now, you don't have to do all this all out. Ready for it? Chris, does this work? Yes, sir. Thank you. July, August, September. The big event there. Massive strength games. When you should have been schooled in the primal moves, we know that you're spying a stable. I need this thing. We know you're spying a stable. We know that you're hit your mobile. You're not going to get hurt because we put more muscle on you. And then boom, we're alone. Do you have what you're squatting? No, not that we're getting ready for you. Yeah, how much is your best squat? One, three, five? All right. That's your change to all of it. You're right. I didn't work the work of that. It was really cool. But one, three, five. So my goal is for her to take that. And in that next phase, one, third, one, forty, five, one, five. Two, three, five. May I now take you back? No. I don't know. But I know that you're not going to get hurt with the process. I'm going to try to smash it. But you're very strong. Okay? We're not too much. But what are you going to do? So then you're at your strength. Now here comes October, November, and December. Why are they kind of mesh together as the holidays? And everybody kind of falls apart. And here are my goals from the people, not to gain that average seven to fourteen. You know, hey, go out and join. Now, all about balance. Go out and join. Okay, take it out. All right. I don't know. I wrote that by putting the picture up there with my hand on that. And that's not my life by the way. You just get your approval. And I told them, they should get the foodie short. And like, can you pray that I think of yourself? You should have to make it again. Oh, yeah. It's a little. All right. That's a girl. She's the by the way. I've got that by a lot. That was when she first started. Oh, come on. And you know why I get away with it? I'm old. No, I use that as my truck or I pull that on or I need it now. How high did you go? That was a lot. She got you there. All right. You said how high did I have to be shown to the victim. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Alatélalwood. Oh shit. How popopädman. I know that a lot, everybody really the shardest I don't know. Jordan Joe Charlie Priest. you're 14 year old. He'll. Butoplan is but kind of gross. Explain. variable if I have to read them? The question by my faculty? Sorry about that. It was about one second unhealthy thing that was李 Kennedy, from hahatic Veterans name, a minutes and circuit is being heard forever. It was like a negative, coming back from vast states, finally I would want you to move that job, He's in a regional tournament, wrestling, heavyweight. He has a chance to win this based on record. So everything counts. He goes out and he matches up against a special knee-skin. He gives the chance to win. He can't have to win. He contacts me and says, what would I have done? I told him I was a kid. But I'll be mature. I'm just, and he thought that he was, that was a weak move on. His partner said, no son. What you did there is admirable. And you have a victory that's tenfold come. So my hat's off to you. And I'm impressed by you. So anyway. The other way around in the years train cycle, we're out here. So if your goal is to first split it up into chords, however, you want to do it. A-okay. I'm personally never getting on a platform again. I'm not going to get on a stage to pose. I'm not going to do the super bowl of workouts at the day. I'm just not going to do that. But I had a chance I would play for the Reaves. Yeah. Yeah. The drum had a spot open. You know what I mean? I didn't know anything. And so then, you know, be awesome. I was with you on that. I do this the way I do it. To be awesome. And to really teach you all how to avoid the pitball that I'm running through. So again, hopefully be awesome. Crack is up here free, by the way. Yeah. And I got to tell you, so we used to have a... They took it out. The day was pretty smart. Let's see. You took out the... Where all the spikes are at the score. And you guys get to watch this workout. So again, working out with Crack. He's right behind me. And I'm having 125 pound double. And I'm going to have exactly like a rock. He's quite a little bit of shit. I'm like, oh, I don't know if you're going to take it. Or it's not like, hey, Matt. You don't really have to wear about this. I feel like a month is it. All of you guys are watching this workout. I feel like you're wearing about this. I wish they could come up. They'd start talking the other way. It's going to be cool now. Anyway, I did my early break down. I'm going to highlight season and conditioning my face, turning back into the kind of getting basic daily session in our work. And we warm up, get yourself ready for 10 minutes. I'm based in an hour in the major strength move. Depending on five, rent max, three, rent max, four rent max. If the folding chairs come out, you're going to be there a while. That's just what we do things. I use some maximal lifts as furthering the warm out until you get up to the heavy one. And like I said, I give people, hey, how about I'm going to scale and 110. How hard was that? You start hitting 89. My incremental jumps go down. Otherwise, I don't count weights. Anything. They've written in the naked ear. No, okay. Anyway, Brandon's not. Slathering. Slythering. Slythering. Slythering. Brandon shows up one day. First day, he's at the LTTS. I look at him. He's got these arms. He's got these arms. This wall. And I go, hey, Brandon, which reminds me that she goes 425. I'll figure that. He goes, take a bar full of plates on each side. Throw 10 times. And that's 425 now. That's where I am. My gym, we don't count 10 spikes to max. So your max bench is 4.05 underweight 4.59. And he goes, oh, it's 5.05. Okay. I'm trying to get rid of the 25. I like the 240. And we have 600 pounds plates in my gym. And there are two of us use. I'm just moving around because they're just huge. And anyway, so let me address the weaknesses. And here's where I told you that if I'm out of my lap, and I'm going to detail the spinal stuff that I'm stolen from. Dr. McGill. I stole it from other people. And again, no original thought. Then condition. By and way, if you want like this, I'm okay. Because you're just a big guy. But I'll watch some of the guys walk like this. And I go, man, that is not going to make it throw a hole. And I'm like, you know, you're just, you're great at powerlifting. And that walk is indicative of the use that you need it for. You don't need to go side with you. Because you don't need to go that down. And that's what you're going to do. Okay, that's your sport. But if you're throwing back the images being awesome, you better be able to move in three planes. Three planes forward and back. Sages side to side to front and you better be able to move in that transit, transverse plane being able to twist. Why? Where do you think you get how most often? Right here. So you better train that up. And as soon as I become advanced enough, I promise I'll put even videos in it. But I got a slip phone. That's how it is. I'm a knuckle drag. So in your accessories, this is where you're getting to. You're trying to look at the scotch team. Okay, and do high-purchasing works. You're going to get jacked up. But also throw in some different planes of motion. Oh, my. Hey, right. When you become mobile and agile about that time, you can become hostile. You can. And I grew a standing in the red card place last night. This is what guy came in. He jumped the line. These two guys over here started going. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Tell him off. I'm like, do you shit? Fight, fight, fight. Yeah. I want to see you go down in first. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, we, we right. You get some guys out of our, our safe. They're talking about the, um, ween of America. Look, some things you just have to stand up for. Now I promise I'm not going to get on my knuckle so a box. It's, it's a going. Um, you don't have to agree with me, but then you have to write to be wrong too. Anyway. So you work, uh, you're, and I'm a big portfolio. Try to get as much back to the buck. So I get work by mobility in with my condition. I told Steve Goggins. I said he goes, hey, you're pretty good for an old guy. I got a little won't. He's because he's pretty close. Hey, if we were standing there in the back, there was maybe Steve Goggins and comb and, um, buddy, works. I look. Three, four, there's 200 years of experience. And we're standing there like this. They're looking at us and they're coming. Right now, everybody thinks that we're talking about something really big. And on there was looking at that girl's body. He didn't want to get trouble for that. Anyway, so Steve Goggins and me, um, you work, springs. You know, everybody wants to push, probably I love the prowl. Anybody here in the last one in the big pub, probably to be pub. I mean, some guy's got sick and it's kind of fun. Um, that's not the goal and every workout, but the condition when sometimes you got pulled trigger. Anyway, so okay, I, I, I spread, uh, if I'm not pushing the prowl on a leg day, on an off day, because I would do this three to four times a week, remember, free to see intensity time. I want to get four bounces of conditioning in and I spread. I got a football field right behind my house. And I'm either to 50 or hundreds. And I chased my kid. I bet him, uh, work up flints and then we have a lot of fun. Anyway, there's a good Jewish vacation picture. That's me. That's on. That's in Capaluma. That's a long, more modern. Yeah. I'm gonna be there next week. Yeah. You're going there. There's, there's another one. That's my wife. I say, Paul. That's me, you boy. You have to take your coverage. Oh, dude. She has an IQ of 10 billion. Uh, speaks five to little languages. Has an MBA. Genius level. And she married me to keep her humble. So I, I do they've been there for brownie points. No, because he always called me a song. I said, you know, what, what, what, what? I didn't hear because I was going to be late. Then Scott was covering all the dietary stuff for, you know, even like, why do I go there? He, he, he, you know, I can't, I can't talk that. That was, you didn't get something from that. Then you probably needed to go watch a face. Um. Oh, that's my own personal week. And we can not wait to get it play on words anyway. My, my goal, my, my idea here is to plan out your entire year. And if you have that opportunity, then you have kind of a direction. Everything that you do should have a specific intent. Well, just have had, we do this stuff. Because if you have had, we do this stuff. Then you have had, we get injured. Frequent, we see intensity time. Unless you have a plan. Now, my plan is to make everybody as fit and able to play one back in the years. Um. Then you're going to be a good shape. No matter about, because of all of the, uh, attributes of a good lineback increase the things that you're a weekend. But you have to know what you're weekend. We're going to pick that part pretty tomorrow. Um, I'm good. It's really not as hard as I just made it sound. If I keep you, I'm certainly going to apologize. But that's, that's how I do. I've been doing this for three decades. And it's been laid out to kind of the same. Um, I've coached, got straight coach, uh, the feeder team to the Colorado out of the way. Um, and the Phoenix coyotes. I've got a couple guys that are really in a felt. Um, and I said, I have a mate chose me to coach that. And I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time for that. Um, I've knew as my own personal experiences to avoid pitfalls, occurring with these guys. Um, you know, could I have, have really done damage? I'm sure. And you will. But if you have the questions, that's one by the way. Dave allows that Q and A. That Q and A is so that coaches have a, you know, you can't go in one of your other coach. You need to sound like, you don't want to go in. I don't want you to go in. I do. We set up, you know, and a lot of you this morning thrown ideas back. And for that, stole everything from Matt Roach. He's coaching you in, uh, in Rhode Island. And, um, and then, um, I turn around the chat. Chat, chat, like that guy just needs a text. All right. You're going to get back on the back by this big hand tomorrow. And you're, you're going to have to increase your weight. Because he said so. Oh. Oh. No, I'm serious. Dude, you're, you're hitting your arm. But I see that that was not the case. He was out there. That was funny. Seriously. Any questions about anything that I said? And this is the part where everybody goes, oh, who's a cold. Please don't pass. Oh, this is great. I covered everything perfectly. A lot of rakes. Awesome. Yes, sir. So just to go over your periodization or a year for like your line doctor, how many weeks total you plan out? I do by quarter. Yeah. Depending on his season though. Okay. His season begins when when is a, when do your football guy's at the end? You're asking me to do that. Please start in the bottom. Minologists andologists. Okay. What is your goal at August when they start, is that still increasing strength? Awesome. If I'm at. And your program is your program. If it's working, stay with it. What are you doing? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And your program works. You're good at what you do. This is what I have done. When I start in season. That means they're having two days. That's why my goal for in season is recovery for those guys. Up until that point, I'm in strength, gain mode for that period of a core. And before that, I'm in high-purtrific phase. Okay. And by the way, you never do one of those others. You just have an emphasis. Makes sense, you? Makes sense? Like in my accessory work. I said, I would work mobility. I would do injury prevention. I would work high-purtrific. Like a lineback. And that guy was jacked. Right? So that's all I'm saying. If you decide you want to increase strength, how old are the kids? You high school? A place close to the university. Okay. The younger guys you can get away with going a little bit long. They're covered pretty quick. When I get away at the college level and into the pro, you've got to really less is more in this case. That makes sense to you. The injury prevention effect. Be more. Cool. Hey, listen. I'll let you do my cool. All right. So one of the things that we all all, and this is just how to work the rest of the seminar for you and shortening that acts, try to get into conversation. With the coaches and sponsors athletes. And over. Don't you drop? Where you offer your chair to sit down. Sit down. And join it. Because while this is the part where we're trying to keep you guys away. Hopefully, it'll change your enough that you didn't fall asleep on me. This, the, the lesson, the meet the drippings from the pot. That happens in, in, in, in a round the hallway. The stuff that you can then ask is going to be very candid. Right? One works. This works. Cool. Right. Okay. Thank you. I love you. Okay. I'm going to start the next presentation. One, two, three.
