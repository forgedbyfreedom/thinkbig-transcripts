Everybody, Steve Kolskat for elitefts.com. Sitting with the Beast himself, Chad, I like how you doing, Jeff. I'm good, I'm good, how are you? You know, for people that are not familiar with you, who there's no real note, no excuse for that is there. No, there's not. There's not. Give us a little rundown of your athletic history. Like all the way back. There's power lifting wise. A little bit before I... High school, I played football, football and through the shot, but I found out my senior year I'm not much of a team guy because I want to win and I hate losing. So I went just to throwing through in college for a couple of years. Had chronic compartment syndrome or lower legs, had surgery, basically. They said you have to stop. Kepa lifting that whole time. Started competing and power lifting back in 97. When I actually got talked into doing a meet that I just wanted to go watch and I got talked into entering it and that pretty much. Stay at the fold, Jeff. On the platform. About a week before they finally got me to go, okay fine, I'll do it. And I took second place. It meant like four or 15 raw or something. And I was like, oh, this is fun and I miss competing a lot. And so that kind of started it. My best total is 27.33. My best official squad is 11.73. My best bench is 821. Deadlift is like 755 or something. All those were done with injuries. Actually, had my bench over nine. We're getting ready for the meet. I tore my tricep early bad. So. And where are you at right now? What are you doing? Right now, I'm kind of trying to get my sleep situation square away a little better. But I do actually know there's a meet in Sacramento. I think in March, which I think I'm going to try and bench in that. My bench is still around eight. I've dropped a bunch of weight. So I'm playing with my shirt, but I mean, if I could go in and hit 885 for coming back, because I haven't done a meet in a while, I'd be happy with that. Nice. Thank you.
