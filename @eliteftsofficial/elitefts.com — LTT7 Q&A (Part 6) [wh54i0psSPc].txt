What was the biggest lesson you learned at West Side? Mine's going to be very similar to Steve and I'm kind of thrown off because I have to go after him. The biggest lesson I learned at West Side is to love the sport of power lifting. You're all here because this is something you're passionate about and I'm going to tell you if you don't love this, it's not for you, it's not where you want to be and I'm not trying to be negative but this is a sport that if you don't love it it'll chew you up and spit you out but if you love it you'll make some of the best friends in your life you'll have a passion in your life and you'll live your life every time. I'm probably the only guy sitting up here who can probably never compete again because of where my body's at but I love the sport and I enjoy, I get to go and wrap Ryan Carroll's knees, I get to go with Adam Dregors and help him and spend time with all these guys. The eat lunch and talk about the military power lifting team with Steve Goggins and it's a like-minded brotherhood who all these guys sitting up here are so passionate about what they do, what they've done and I saw this weekend how much it spills over into other sports. I got to meet Mark Dougdale for the first time and we sat down for dinner and you could just see this passion when we started talking about Bara bodybuilding and how he did and whatever you do and this goes back to what Harry said you have to do it 100% and in this sport if you want to succeed if you want to totally if you want to win the XPCs if you want to set the world squat record you've got to love it every time you go into the gym.
