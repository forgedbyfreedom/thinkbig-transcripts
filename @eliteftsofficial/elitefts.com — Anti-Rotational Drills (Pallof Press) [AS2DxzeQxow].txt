is more at www.leadupds.com with Jordan Houser, one of our social editors, and we're gonna go and demonstrate exercises that are gonna help you with the entire rotation, one of the biggest components of core training will be the entire rotation at how it relates to sport. So the first one we're gonna do we're gonna just do a good demonstrated pow-off press using the lead-upds band. Again, the most important thing is gonna be in a good athletic stance, and I have a straight line from my nose always through my midline. Pressing that band out, I don't wanna make it more difficult, obviously. I can get a more resistance on the band, or I can step away from the rack of the apparatus. Next thing in this series is using the same exercise we're using a blast rack and using gravity. So now, these are gonna have to lead. Still keeping that straight line from those nose roots midline, so you're gonna have to lead same principle. Stagling the feet again, we wanna have basically our opposite or our way forward from the rack, use your mixing little easier, but you can switch those up, you can chop parallel stance, same thing with the band, you can do these with the band, you can do them kneeling, you can do them with both knees, half kneeling, and again, just add some variety in that system, but again, two very excellent activities, great exercises for anti-rotation.
