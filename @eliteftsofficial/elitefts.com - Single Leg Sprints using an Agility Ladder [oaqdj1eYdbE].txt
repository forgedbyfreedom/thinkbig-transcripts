Mark Watts, lead at TS.com. I'm here at Capital University. We're just going to demonstrate a very good drill. A pie metric drill that has a very good carryover to sprint technique. We have a couple track athletes going to demonstrate it, but this is pretty good even for non-track athletes. What is going to be is a single-laved run. We're going to use an agility that we have from power max to go through and we're going to use those runs as a way to build up for less growing contact time and to cover more ground with each step. So the single-laved run, again for one leg, going to be very similar to the sprint and again upper body-wise, they're going to cycle similar to what they're sprinting. So we'll go ahead and just narrate the omasse they go through with this drill. So the first one, we're going to start with the jog. The athlete's going to jog up and they're going to go ahead and just skip once. So they're going to get their foot in the first, first, third, fifth and seventh-run and they're going to end with a sprint. The next time the athlete goes through once they're proficient at that drill, then you can have them go ahead and they'll maybe skip too. So they'll get their foot in the first, the fourth, the seventh and then end with a sprint and then sprint out of there. So again, the one good thing about the power max ladder is number one, they can separate, they connect in the middle so you can have those shorter as long and connect them all up to up to the 30 feet. And also the actual runs themselves are flat. So if you have an athlete that steps on that wrong they're going to be less susceptible to injury when they go ahead and sprint through.
