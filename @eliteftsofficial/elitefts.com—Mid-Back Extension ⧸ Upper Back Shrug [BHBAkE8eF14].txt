This is a movement that kind of stimulates what we do as the upper back and one is with the yoke bar. The little state for vergence is actually a version of it. It's easier for a lot of people to do on their own gym to stay on top of the bar. We're going to have John do this as a hybrid exercise. We're going to start with the upper back and morning. Put the dumbbells and then even go into a truck. So it's actually two movement, not one. We're going to round over, so we get some dress. Arches up and then shrubs. We relax and then stretch. So it's not one movement that's exactly two going on together. With a key band to work the upper, finally record. And now we're firing the grass too much. So I need to get the hands and both of them for me when he's dry. Now it's back down and we're going to my fingers around. And when it's time for a back and forth, we're going to have to play half the dog.
