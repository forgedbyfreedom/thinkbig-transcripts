Everybody Steve Colzcat here for Elite FTS. We're here with Ryan Mini at Prime will Training Studio in Chilacothe, Ohio. Many of you may remember Ryan. He was helped us out with so you think you can deadlift. Good to have you here Ryan. Thanks Steve. Good to have us here in your studio. Tell us a little bit about your background and how you how you came to where you are now. My background is I started out I've always been athletic my entire life I've mostly been involved in racing track bikes snowboards that kind of stuff. And when on the college after pursuing a degree in computer science I decided that it was really where I wanted to do. Then I got into sports science with an emphasis in physical education and built from there and so my degree that I use the most is obviously my sports science and education degree and that built out of when I was in college I raised down him out in bikes professionally. Build from there and I got out of school and I was I was getting older and you just can't hit the ground like you used to and racing anyone who's ever racing knows that it just gets old after a while. So they get into something else I wasn't ready to quit competing. So I was looking at master's levels track and field and I was looking at different forms of weightlifting and just with training and what I was interesting weightlifting kind of worked out for me and and it was just all going from there so then I started weightlifting and I started training and I started getting into it. So that's how I ended up where I am today. Okay and tell us about the evolution of private training studio here. We have had a really we've been around since about 2008 I think we've been around for about six years. Basically it started out I've moved here from Moscow Ida how and I had no facility I started out in a small private fitness club and that really wasn't working out for what we were doing. We were just kind of we were square pegging around whole it's not that there was anything wrong with the fitness club just what we were doing wasn't fitting into it and it was it was revving some things wrong way so it was best to leave. So out of that I basically went to my backyard and people's grudges I started training I had a barbell sitting on a concrete pad my backyard that was training myself with and then my in laws had a farm and I had a barn there and it was too far out of town for people to want to come. Sort of training people and people's grudges and that started picking up and then through training people and grudges and my backyard and out the barn and stuff like that. My equipment started getting pretty mobile so then I started offering a general fitness kettlebell class that I did down in the park and it was just me down the park and then people would pay me. On that way and it was getting November and I was starting to get cold out and everyone wanted to go inside. So I had enough for rent out of that so then I rented another building that was about two or three blocks from here and we were in there for about, let's say about a year and then we got to the point that we really started taking off as a weightlifting facility and it was the we had to switch. The place where I had a basement underneath us, best story on that was we were deadlifting one day and my wife was about a block away, get a cup of coffee and she could hear the bar hit in the floor. Literally a block away on the corner she came in and she and so that kind of so we out grew there and then once we and then I found this place I looked in this place it was really it was a good fun for us and we've been here ever since then and now that we've got a location that can really support lifting heavy and what we want to do is just been grown and growing from there. Okay the thing I like most about your club is there's not a lot of equipments you've got really good equipment here lead FTS equipment not to that sounds like a blatant plug but you've chosen really well tell us a little bit about what you what you put in as your basics. Well I put in my um for what I we are primarily um we're not really I hate it because I lead FTS I love power lifting I don't want anyone to think that I I think everything is great but we are primarily a strong man and weightlifting facility so our basic that we really put in was half-rake and the reason I wanted a half-rake was when I was an Idaho the the Van Gogh Athletics Center always had was half-rake so I kind of get used to it and you just have more mobility more options but the problem was with the level that we want to lift out and level that we do lift that most half-rake's couldn't handle the amount of weight that we want to do we want to look so basically lead FTS had about the best half-rake on this side of the world that I could find that that was made on in this hemisphere so we want so that we used the half-rake continuously we used it all the time and so that's our squatting all of our all of our pressing all that is coming out of half-rake and then we secondly we back up with bench we use I have a couple guys who bench in here but mostly most of our bench pressing is done as accessory lifting to our pressing kind of like back in the 50s and 60s when they used to they would either lay on like for the four press of all from or they would lay on center blocks and stuff like that with the board on them so the bench evolved out of the accessory work for that I figured if I'm going to buy one I'm just won't get one that we can do work because I hate it when people come in here and they want to do something on my quote we can't do that so I try to get everything that pretty much this guy's going there but so out of that then we have just basically standard Olympic weight lifting platform okay and then out of that and then we do a lot of a lot of our strongman and then are some of more stuff out of that okay and you have a wide variety of bars in which I recognize so many tell me some of the the ones you have I have I have all the bars that they sell I'm a huge fan of rotating lifts I'm working with athletes and being an athlete myself and everyone thing and even the fitness people even more because of the athletes they're the very goal one point specific and they're driven in that so what you get so athletes they they just want things you're your general fitness and your general strength clients who just want to get stronger get board easily so one thing the nice thing is all the bars that they load your body up differently so what we can rotate through them and we'll keep changing them and so that's why I like it and kind of variety of seat keeps injury down because we're always pushing heavy weights but we're pushing heavy weights with different load emphasis so to me I think it keeps our backs healthy and it keeps them more well run this strength zone so we have Texas Squabar we got the Yoke Bar we have Spiderman Canberra Bar we have Axel bars we have the Nutrubriar Pressing bars and then we compliment all of that with bands and then we're top banding and bottom banding typically we're using our bands for a max but yeah so so those are so yeah if there's a bar out there we have it okay it's also a little bit about the the type of client you have and who you're working with here typically what we train here as we train beginners to intermediate one of the things I really sell out with my physical education background is I I have an education education from K through 12 and if you've ever been around 31st graders at the same time it's like rounding up cats so if you can if you can work with that and you can organize it you can pretty much adults enough problem so one thing we really excel at is whether it's someone who maybe picked up like a muscle and fitness magazine or flex magazine or something like that and was like I want to do this or maybe someone saw on TV on YouTube or they found your website and they but they don't know really know where to start um a lot of just everything I hate saying couch because some people they do a lot of other stuff but people who don't really know how to start we start there we start from a really basic never down before and then we'll build them up and do really highly physical culture of weight lecturers or we'll get um the other thing is the intermediate we get a lot of people who start and they get on the internet and they have a lot of self-drive and they build up through that but they get to a point where they start hitting a wall and either the the gain stop coming so their number stop getting up or they just find they randomly hurt all the time they have no idea why and so then that the intermediate people come in that uh they just need that that extra they need that knowledge on how to keep going to to get up and to the higher levels of the sport and then um within all that we have um so we have more people just want to be strong looking to stay in shape and really the athletic population which is what I really like I think I'm more I'm a poor big fan of more people should that plays okay uh you're involved in strong man you do some promotion tell us a little bit about what you have come up with uh North American Strongman yeah I am the North American Strongman a high-state chair and we I have a meet coming up we we do it every year it's called Frankfurt Strongest Man it's in Frankfurt Ohio at the International Sunflower Festival and it's every Labor Day weekend it kind of the the day kind of moves around we try to have it on Sunday just because everyone can get there better that way but it's always a Labor Day weekend and this year the events that we're doing is we're doing a max effort log press we're doing our max reps, axle dead left we're doing a tire flip for time we're doing a sled duck walk medley medley and um I think that's and then we'll then we'll allusons I always do allusons and then we're going to do allusons for reps every bar okay so if you are anywhere to your telecoathy I definitely recommend you stop in you visit Ryan check out the place and uh he'll show you a few things thanks for talking us thank you appreciate it
