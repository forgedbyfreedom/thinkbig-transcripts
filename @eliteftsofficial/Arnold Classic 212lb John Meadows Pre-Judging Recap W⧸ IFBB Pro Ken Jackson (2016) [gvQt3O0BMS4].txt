What's up guys, Ken Jackson. I have been to 2016 Autoplasic to see where my coach John Manors got up to state. Well, competition was for the state. I believe I'm a little biased, but this condition was probably the best on stage. My first goal being in. I got the second ball out. I would have had him in the first ball out. I got a couple guys for an off-road. The condition was off, and the judge's condition made those guys look way off. So, today, they pull them in the first ball out, we'll see. Please welcome John Manors, the Buddyfighter of the Hamilton.
