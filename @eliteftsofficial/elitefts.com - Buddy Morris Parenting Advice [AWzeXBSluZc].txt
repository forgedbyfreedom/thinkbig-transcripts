You've got already people here with problems. What is technology done? I could solve all the functional movement screen problems in this country right now. No, what is? Get rid of the computer, get rid of video games, let kids go outside and play again. Let the body solve complex motor problems in a chaotic environment, let the brain figure things out. The brain learns by getting things wrong. How many of you have to hear our new parents? New parents? Stop helping your kids. If a kid's in a bad scene and he can't clip the fucking seat belt, don't turn on, say, here, a lemon in the body help you. Let him figure it out. That's all the way. The fucking seat belt? Don't turn on, say, here, a lemon in the body help you. Let him figure it out.
