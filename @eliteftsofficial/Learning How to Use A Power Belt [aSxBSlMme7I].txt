When you're under a bar and see this in your videos, and you have that bar set, you can bring the squad, you go to take a grab, chest and jump. When you breathe out, you go down, you can hang on around, you can pass, you can feel the fear. It's never moved. Now, it's the bodybuilder that's back when you think of it on safety. So this is your dad's life, then you only need to be caught in safety. Everything else you can do here. The last thing you want to do is to get up there. Well, that's what you can get on that. Yeah, you're so trained. If you breathe in the fear, you can sit in here and get this in here. You've got to break that, that's what you can protect from. So you want to go a little higher, a little higher, you're about to get up. Don't worry so much about it. Here, but here.
