Mark was Chuck Kyrnline, lead us to ES.com. Today we're going to go ahead and give you an idea for adding weight using body weight movement. So again, if you don't have a dip belt for pull ups or dips, this is one way using elite up to ES bands. In this we're going to have a heavy band. Trust me, he has put this on like he's putting on a backpack. Now the benefit of this is a couple. Number one, it's a little bit harder on the center of gravity not between the blades. Using a thickest band, he can, regardless of what the body weight is of the athlete, you're going to have not a lot of play with a plate bouncing off and down. So we're going to try to get the thickest band to come when you're doing this. And again, it keeps it at a good center of gravity for him. So if you're going to go just to a pull up, you can say basically, principle. Again, if you have a lot of athletes, you should have a lot of bands in your weight or anyway, this is the way you can cycle a lot of athletes through using adequate weight for any of your body movement. So give that a try.
