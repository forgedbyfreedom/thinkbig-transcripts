besides tracking field coaches, how often do you ever see a seminar on kind of general sprint training or speed training or acceleration training for athletes? It's a jammer. Okay. Hey, there was only 2.45s on each side of 25, you could push the hell. And he was like, dude, you don't fucking understand. Like, I can't move my fucking legs. Some, it's never gonna get better. I'm never gonna be able to bend my legs. So we talked about it, he was eventually able to walk again. Anybody, anybody could have done what we did with these guys. And the simplicity of it is what I think makes it so special. We take all the complicated shit out of there. What do we need to help our athletes get better, accelerate faster with it for a 40-hour dash or the soccer field or the basketball court? If you teach them the basics that I'm going to cover, 99% of them will get faster. Unfortunately, I would like to apologize. I'm probably one of the main people who used the prowler wrong and f***ed up many children. During the early stages of the prowler. But not as many as I thought. Guess what that head coach tells a football coach, football strength coach. We better win the fourth quarter. We better be the most explosive, condition team in the fourth quarter. However, you get to nuts with their challenge. They don't care if we dominate the first quarter because then we're asking them to hang on.
