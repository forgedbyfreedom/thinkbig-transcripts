uh... can date over training economy again for the older washed up meat yes uh... just do what you have to do you know it's is i wrote in the article it's it's gonna be easier for you to do because you're you're an older washed at me head so you kind of know what's important what's not important so when you're looking at your training session let's say you were you're gonna write it out before you go into the gym which most older washed up meatheads are not going to do but say that that's say you were right and let me let me reframe this let's say you you did a full training session and then you went home and wrote it down afterwards when you look at that training session how much of the shit did you do did you really have to do to meet whatever your training objectives are with most of us i'm gonna be willing to gas it's it's a third or a half of that whole training session so just get rid of the shit you know get rid of the shit that's not going to help move you forward and you can keep in some of the stuff that's fun like i get that i get that more than anybody you know keep that stuff in there but understand that some of that stuff maybe to the detriment of your ability to recover so there's a trade that you got to be able to make with yourself and sometimes that trade is definitely worth doing because you really like doing that sometimes it's not so you just have to look at it from a little bit different perspective and make that call based upon that so it's training economy is basically doing the least amount possible to get the greatest yield of the greatest result and keep in mind too that if you increase the training density in other words you you know lower the rest between sets from ten-fuck a minutes between sets down to to you know you're gonna increase the overall more than likely you're gonna increase the overall workload as well but you're gonna increase the the effort expanded during the training session so you're gonna actually be able to get more out of the training session that we're going to get I can't frame them up desert on my hands strong like a tree there's roots where I stand oh I've been running from the law
