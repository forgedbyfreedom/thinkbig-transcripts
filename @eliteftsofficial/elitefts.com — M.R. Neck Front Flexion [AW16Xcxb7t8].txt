Mark Watts, this guy hates here, we need FTS.com. Gonna talk about manner resistance for the five lane neck. This is just going to really go talk about front flat shin. Two ways you can do it. I definitely want to have pressure on the forehead. Some people want all the pressure on the forehead, some coaches want a little bit of pressure on the chin. If you're going to go chin and forehead, make sure that most of your resistance is on the forehead. All scots going to do is just come up and then probably drive and bring his chin to his chest. He's going to hold it there. He's going to resist me as I come back down. Slow each rep should take probably anywhere between three and five seconds. Going up, hold, come on down, resist all the way and we're good.
