Steve Colz got here doing another segment of video inquisitions with Eric Mirosher this time. Eric, you built up a fantastic power team out of monster grads gym. How exactly did the Mirosher power team develop? Winnie, you kick it off and tell us a little about some of the lifters you've got on there. You know, I didn't specifically go about developing a power lifting team that really more just so, it's just that Kurt naturally I was training with Ernie Franz at his team in the 90s. So on the weekend I would travel to Ernie's place in Aurora and then during the weekend training at my gym and it was mostly a bodybuilding gym so I'm doing my power lifting movements and people I think just became interested and we started the original team with four guys and we trained together and traveled and competed together and then that grew from there. There's been four actual Morosher power lifting teams over the years as you have the different gyms and locations but the first one was in 1993 and now this team here in 2013 and this team trains at the monster garage gym and those two work the gym and the team works and be out of the league together to bring the best out of the listers but probably 30 total power lifters at the gym and on the team there's probably 15 to 20 guys that guys and girls that compete and they really run the whole spectrum of lifters you've got raw lifters, single-ply and multi-ply, cash war and every federation there is pretty much from 100% raw USAPL, APF, there's newer lifters, there's multi-time world champions, there's 1,000 pound squadters and 400 pound squadters so it's a pretty eclectic group but it's a very like-minded group and it really operates to be quite honest with us on them and she's really operates like a family pretty much and that gives a lot of power to the group itself but that's where the Morosher power lifting team is right now in 2013 and for somebody that wants to start up a power lifting team what are some of the basics required to really create a successful power lifting team? Well I think you're going to go out of your way to have a power lifting team you really need to know the sport of power lifting you need to know a good history of the sport you really need to know the lifts well you need to have a pre-in-depth background of training methodology you know training with earning for a number of years I get to kind of see up front you know how he would run his team and it wasn't so much running the team as kind of leading by example so I think the tangibles are the knowledge of the power lifting and the training etc etc but the less tangible is you really got a vision where you want that team to go you know you've really got to have a good plan and then you got to have a you get care at the mission you know so you get your kind of management parts of of being having your own team and then the leadership parts but part of that whole process is really believing in each team member like each person that that comes to the gym and ends up being a part of the team at some point or another meet with them and give them kind of the history of the whole team and the gym and how everything kind of came together but really to believe in your lifters as well and once you start believing in them they believe in themselves but then they'll believe in each other too like there's not a person at the mosque or at the gym that doesn't want the next liftor to be the best that they could be and in turn because each person is getting stronger because of the power of the team they're getting stronger so it's this symbiosis that's happening and I think that's part of if you're going to have a team you really need to bring that to the table so you kind of have to give the no people but you have to really believe in people as well and that's a big part of the whole thing so but those are I would those are the basics too it you know knowledge of the sport knowledge of training but you have to know where you're going to go why you want to go there that's just as important as you know you just not just about winning titles but then also really believing in each and every one of the lifters it's pretty important I think you
