Powerlifting, pretty consuming sport. I'm sure most are, but you know, you look watching a fell players, they're getting, that's their life, they're getting paid to do that. We're a powerlifting, you know, none of us are getting paid to do it. But you still put in almost as much time and definitely as much effort. Wates are so simple, you're either, you've got better you didn't. To me honest, it's, it, some of these is difficult. You know, a time away from my girlfriend, a time away from family. I try to be the best I can't have worked, but you know, everything is centered around it. I need to make sure I go to bed early enough to get the right amount of sleep. If we have a meeting in the morning, I get to make sure I either have the old eggs and I have the floor, or you know, trying to prep some of the stuff. You know, I'm focused on work when I'm at work, but I also have a plan of what I'm going to do as soon as I get out of work, you know, make sure everything is set up to get to the gym on time. I actually was pretty good at baseball, and to me the best feeling in sports, you hit a home run. I think I get the same kind of feeling, you know, you stand up from having a squat or you get a deadlift. It's, you know, a medium rush. Powerless and can be a team sport. It's individual, but you can have a great team behind. Everybody comes from a totally different background. It's all here for the same reason. It's that competitive edge. You know, your heart's racing, but you're still in control of the situation. I don't want to live in myself, but I also have to be real-estant. Do I want to be number one in my weight class in the world? Absolutely. What are you willing to give up to get to where you want to be? You're either going to go out with your buddies from work and have a beer after work or you're going to, you know, we go to the gym and we hang out and swap stories and that's the path we all take. You know what I'm saying?
