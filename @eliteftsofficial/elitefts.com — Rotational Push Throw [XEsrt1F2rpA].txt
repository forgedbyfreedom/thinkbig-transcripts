This Mark Boss for lead at CS.com over here. Show time strength and performance with owner Nick Schillman who will go through some rotational power exercises using a Medball. This is going to be a Schillman's Boss Medball throw. So what's going to happen here is we're going to go at the end of that extension. We're going to make sure our elbows are up. And we're going to do this rotation. We're going to make sure that we're using almost like we have a camera on the back hip. And I'm going to try to take a picture of that front wall. This demonstration, we're going to go ahead and use a camera to do this workout. We're going to drag it to find. And that's what goes once we rotate here. We get the positive. Or use the stretch reflex. And again, trying to get that hip to take a picture of the front wall. Make sure we're rotating with the feet. So here's one demonstration. Rotation.
