Okay, so now we're going to just a little bit of psychology of the deadlift. So basically we talked about it really like Stevie's saying to me commit to the pool and that sort of an antithesis to the modern day, you know, add it to you see if you go on the internet you're going to you know read 500 articles about you know how not to get heard or something which is good I mean but like you obviously can't be stupid but there are has to be an element of balls to your training if you want to you know get good and that's that's what we're talking about it's just committing to the pool and you it's basically walking up to the the the lift and knowing it's it's complete ahead of time it's it's your internal rage is going to assist you in the deadlift more than any other lift and I'm a so visualization here anybody here ever do any visualization at all for yeah good okay so the the whole purpose of visualization and strength training is we want to bridge the gap between absolute strength and limit strength is anybody know the difference is okay limit strength is just how much force you can exert and one all our own effort regardless of time basically like you're max on a corollif we just walked in there right now okay what's absolute strength you got shocked electrically you're under hypnosis or something like that basically there's some outside force it's going to help you or like you know your grandma's caught under a car and you're able lift it off so we've all heard those stories of people that are you know shouldn't be able to lift certain things I've certain people do it so we're trying to get this close to that level basically ideally with visualization we're going to the point where if your grandma's under the car and it's more than you can definitely can't pick it up I mean it's cruel as that sounds that's kind of a goal but anyways so some of the visualization strategies I've used here is basically you're going to lay down for 15 to 20 minutes and just vividly imagine the the experience you want to do it on a panoramic view three-dimensional bright colors and try to see yourself as vividly as possible completing what you're going to do you want to use all senses you want to like smell it you want to feel it and that's going to be you know your best chance of visualizing actually helping your lift okay for training partners here you want to surround yourself with good people I know the self-help gurus always say you're a product of the five people you spend the most time with so you want to have people with the right attitude so ideally you're going to train with people that are a little bit better than you that's perfect scenario but that doesn't always exist so I would personally rather work out with somebody that's weaker that has good attitude than somebody that's stronger that's kind of just magically gotten there okay so you want people similar goals so someone's goal is just to you know maybe like look a little better and lose five pounds and you're trying to set the world record probably nothing wrong with either it's just probably not a conducive training relationship and ideally you're going to be with people that are slightly better than you but that's you know you can you can you can you can play with that one but I've had people that I've trained with through a lot of weaker that really good training partners and you know finally just basically if you run with the lame you're going to develop a limp eventually and you know old power for once told me it a good a good training partner is harder to find than a good woman I think there's some truth that because I go to church and I'll see like you know 500 women they're most of them are good women but I don't see a whole lot of people I want to work out with so now some of the training variables so so basically the frequency of the dead left so it's going to be anything with anything left it's going to be the frequencies the biggest variable amongst individuals so you know squatting you have a little more high frequency programs the people who are successful with but you have some people you know like that are top of the game right now squatting heavy twice a month yeah so I mean it's all fine if it's working from great but it's going to be the skill level required it's going to determine the frequency so the higher skill level involved like a Olympic lifting is going to be more frequently than delved by far the lowest skill of any main strength you know powerlifting or Olympic lift so that's why it's not going to be as frequent so generally I'm going to say delved if someone just puts me on a spot and says for everybody I'll say four times a month three heavy okay that's generally going to be where it's at we'll be a starting point and then that wasn't working so well we did just off of that okay and then the residual effects of tapering how so who are it can be some powerlifting meats okay how far out do you generally do your last heavy dead left workout yeah what would we we see okay I would generally say my advice would be on that is about ten days to two and a half to three weeks with you know bigot is Matt Crock that was talking about how every time we got injured before me he'd have this like PR in the delved because he's forced on the delved for three weeks and all of a sudden wow hit a PR so then it's like you know why not take a instead of like a so-called preventive strategy just do that from now on so basically with that depend on a little bit on your level of electric that's why I say next absolutely yeah no you're good question so that's gonna depend a lot of it besides individual differences level of left or because I don't care you know how accustomed you come to training and 800 pound dead left is always gonna be more tax in the three-air pound dead left no matter what it I mean unless the person's Benedict Magnesin the other person's Max in 305 you know it's going to always be more taxing so absolutely it's gonna be on the okay so the dead left a lot of it is meaning it's an equation of brute strength so the recovery is super important it's not super high skilled so when you're looking at a Olympic lift you're looking at okay it's very much show I mean every lifts about neurological proficiency but those are like complicated neurological proficiency this is more or less an equation of brute strength you gotta know to do it but you need to be recovered to perform your best and how how much we recover is technique dependent now this is back to the principal of individual differences anybody here seen Orlando Green Deadlift would you call it good technique no okay doesn't seem to work okay yeah works pretty good yeah but anyways with him if we try to actually deadlift heavy with him every single week there's no way I mean it's like ever it's like once a month you know then we do a lot of stuff the strength and it's posterior chain and actually as we get the right muscle strength and it's sort of got his form of tad better you know so that but like I'm saying if somebody with that ballistics rounded back style they're recovering so slow from that workout that if you try to do that heavy every single week you might run into problems okay so deloading anybody know what delo is go yeah even if not necessarily we'll take a step for it and not even necessarily peak for event like a back-off yes okay so what these do is they provide a good opportunity to develop your technique it's not just like slack off and do nothing it's actually like do something you know technically more proficient at what you're doing so generally for the delo is we'll say about 60 to 70 percent of the total volume you're gonna do okay so volumes your weights your set times your reps and for deadlifting generally I'll say every three to four weeks is a starting point of how often the deloed and man to be a little bit more it may not be a little less but that's a good starting point to try out okay so techniques pretty individualized here but we're gonna talk a little about foot placement so again we talked about it with a stumpy body of types or generally stimo is there anybody here besides the routine that's pulling stimo oh we can we if you guys just stick around for the practical after let's let's look at some stuff things I got a couple things might help you for a conventional deloed thing where do you put your feet anybody vertical jump that's a good one anybody else have any other way to terminate generally that's all normal you know the principle of individual differences right now there you go beautiful okay but anyways the way we're gonna say unless you're you know one of great girth that has some issues getting down you know you're gonna generally start with your feet about where you vertical jump from so just like actually get like you're ready to jump so if I'm gonna jump my feet are right here about hip width that's where to be the other old school way that you used to do is stand on something like a bench jump off and where they'd land they would they would determine their deloed stance that way there was that way too so a lot of people like that one pulling the slack out of the bar what's that mean anybody okay so that that's a good thing obviously but we don't want to do that enough the expensive not being explosive so obviously you're gonna create tension before you pull and it's not going to be you don't just like go up and like if I'm gonna grab this you know it's not going to be it's not a deloed so I could be like this where I just grab it it's going to actually create tension first and then you just got to think of it as a pool not like an actual jerk and that's how you can sort of get your explosive power without you know we're still taking the slack out of the bar and my main cue that I use on that is I just think of the the deloed as one giant hip extension movement like that's what I'm trying to do is just extend my hips that's all I think about you know because I've had some emails from people and they'll have issues with a deloed if I say well what cues are using and the deloed are you list out like 12 like no wonder nothing's getting done because you're confusing yourself you know so I'd stick with one or two and just roll with that you know if we if you guys stick around after we're practicing you know that's we can try to figure out a couple that might you know work for your style so okay so dead stop or touching girl that's huge debate and parolting what do you guys think I'm I'm a both I don't think one's all good I don't think one's all bad because the advantage of touching goes what exactly you have that stretch shorty cycle it's gonna assist you and be more explosive on the way up that's another advantage okay but let's look at dead stop okay if your problem is every time you deadlift so let's say your problem is you know you're pretty good your excuse me you're you're not good off the floor then you're gonna want a dead stop because you want to work that point so just keep that in mind okay so basically what I'm talking about here is if you guys see a lot of deadlifters that are pretty successful like a semi-rounded back technique it doesn't look you know too healthy yeah exactly but like you've seen people be successful like a lot of people yeah exactly so there is you know if that's how you deadlift I'd make sure you're a serious competitor of parolting I wouldn't do that if general fitness is your your thing that's fine I wouldn't do that style if you're a parolting you know just proceed with caution you're not going to be all pools heavy that's frequently and you are sort of picking your poison with that when you start with a semi-rounded back position what I mean by that is you're gonna be able to yank it off the floor pretty quick but then when you get right here you're kind of like out of position so you're basically just trying to outrun your bad technique and that's not saying that to be negative because there's a lot of good people that do deadlift though but that's the reality if you're in a flat back position when I get right here it's just a real easy hip extension okay so no deadlift if you people heard about these no deadlift no deadlift training like I'm gonna do my workout and I'm on this new program and increase my deadlift we don't deadlift a general thing that's a very good idea you know anecdotal evidence I mean usually people that do that are like mediocre they went from crappy to mediocre and it's you know because they gave a drinking or something to do with this so anecdotally that wouldn't make sense it would totally violate the principle of specificity and usually the people that say they do that are gonna throw like some science at you but then it's like totally violating the principle of specificity so it's definitely very skewed and you know you're obviously gonna need some technical reinforcement and next time somebody's talking to you about how good they've got the deadlift without deadlifting I guarantee you they're walking to bar out their knees so they can just walk in and smell a deadlift and increase it you know okay so now let's talk a little bit about speed okay speed is king in the deadlift because there you know there's no stretch shortening cycle so we want to pull that way it up as fast as possible even with even with crappy technique can still outrun potential bad sticking points if you pull the weight fast in us yeah the national strength and condition no exceeding the national association speed and explosion the nace certification they were talking about they're standard for what athletes should be able to lift us 2.5 times their body weight they're basically saying if you can deadlift 2.5 times your body weight you're gonna you know you're gonna get faster beyond that you know it's not gonna continue to carry over so much in your speed so if you weighed 200 I mean you got to be able to delifant about 500 to be as fast as you can probably okay very beneficial because all the posterior work to you know any kind of jumping and here's a here's a picture of Dr. Fred Hatfield he was like 46 years old right there the poem of 760 look at how high he's jumping that's a real picture and that's right up between smoke and cigarettes between attempts that's as real as it gets he got rushing up before that or yeah he he's actually one of the innovators of that yep if you look at him when he's then look at him now you know okay so cluster shots like um I didn't know there's that that's so much research that I heard um Jonathan Oliver at T.C. you talking about the cluster sets and basically that's the way I've been doing it forever is um just you know the whole thing of more sets less reps so what the cluster sets have basically done is you know they're basically we already talked about with the catch running earlier it's basically you're gonna be able to produce greater force greater velocity greater power power excuse me and the deadlift you know want to keep in mind especially which speed train the deadlift the deadlift is a deadlift so the one rep thing really holds true there because there is no stretch shortening cycle on it that's something in the left it's a this is kind of a transition doga from there because Olympic lifting because of me the technique required you should have to set up after every rep so what they come up with is about 20 seconds set up and drip because form is so important so that's in that transition no without power there you don't ever see anybody like sets of just eight straight or something I mean not very often no I mean yeah I mean you do see it but generally not people know right so some of the research that he pointed out I've talked him by email a little bit since then was basically when they were doing cluster training they're at at you know about 85% max this is in the bench press so they were producing 21 to 25% more power the the peak velocity was much greater to move weights moving faster and you know just greater force greater velocity and greater power even in the power clean 80% training this way so I mean there's actually research to back it so I mean logically like we talked about if you just walked out of cave one rep sport more first reps make sense I thought about in terms of energy systems from an 18 page standpoint I guess there's some energy system recovery in that set it have to be yeah yeah big time after even like even like 10 seconds that's why the rest pause training works so well after like 20 you know you start to replenish absolutely
