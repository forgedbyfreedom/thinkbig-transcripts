We're on the strategy you use to bounce everyday nutrition and particular when you travel. I've tried a number of different approaches when it comes to nutrition, low carb, a few years back when I had to get down to 202 pounds when that was the weight limit in the Olympia. And low carb served me well. I found that you know, guys like Branch Warren can eat a thousand grams of carbs and I eat 50 in my ankle, start to swell. So it served me well and until I started training under John Meadows and then I realized recovery is impossible from his workouts without more carbs. So I switched over to consuming more carbs during my training sessions, particularly plasma and made a huge difference in recovery. I still go pretty low carb throughout the rest of the day. I cook often and it's just a matter of planning your meals and storing them up in the fridge. And notice it's almost as much of a full-time job as training and you have to have a plan and you have to prepare because if you just go on the fly, you're not going to find the food that you need traveling. I don't actually travel a whole lot and if I do, I'll cook food ahead of time. If I can, otherwise I'm living on protein powders that I'll take on the plane. And then not, and stuff like that because I keep my fats fairly high when I'm not consuming carbs. So yeah, that's my nutrition approach.
