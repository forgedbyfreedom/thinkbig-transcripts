What's your head, you have a form, Chris Jenning? So I still want to still totally like 20, 60, 70. But in the meat yesterday was my, was my, so I was going to come out. Had an okay squat, five pound PR, and missed my 11th, 30 that I needed. And then the shirt, like I said down in the shirt, I just, there was just too much, I just gotta find a shirt that works, that shirt just doesn't work for me. So we'll figure that out today and then transition to the next meat, hopefully soon, sooner or later, I'll have my next one and then I want to do worlds in September and Vegas. So those are my two next plan on meats. If not, if they says something little earlier, I'll go. Okay.
