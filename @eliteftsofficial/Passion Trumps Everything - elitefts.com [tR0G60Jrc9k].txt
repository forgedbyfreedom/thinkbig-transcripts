Human potential is a lot higher than what we think it is. Much higher than it's always been higher. Human potential is limited by the human mind and it takes a very, very, very strong, rare, special person to break the barrier. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. So whenever you're feeling with the head of the mind and people who are being locked in, people who get locked into a vision, all right, that's it. Me and that's their drive. That's their passion. Great of no matter, this no matter, they're going to do whatever it fucking takes to be the best of what they do. Most people in society will never understand that because they never had passion about any. Just because you have a sticking point, does it mean you're not going to go any further. It means you need to get smarter. You need to try something different. For the world thing that's the chance that there's passion, passion, passion, passion, passion, to be there because passion is the thing that's fucking trunks everything. Thank you.
