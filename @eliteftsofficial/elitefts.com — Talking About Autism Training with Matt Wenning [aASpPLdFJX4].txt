Alright, so we're planning on doing today. How many years have you been a part of this? I believe I watched that you train children with autism, so tell me about that. I know what you're talking about. I was in Chicago all last year and I created programs for children and adult photographers. I was just that was my niche and that's what I focused on. I was a teacher, so the teachers would have it that the kids that can't participate are just alongside the wall, you know, or in another classroom sitting at a desk or something.
