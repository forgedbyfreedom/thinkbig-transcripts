What you're about to see are clips taken from an event we created called Train Your As-Off with Dave Tate. Two main objectives to this event with one over reaching goal. The two main objectives are to teach the best technique possible on one of the main lifts. The second objective was to be able to teach effort in intensity so they understand what training hard really is and then from there it's much easier to grasp and understand what training submax mainly is and then the overreaching goal of all this is for them to be able to utilize this information to make their training better and to have their lifestyle help their training instead of take away from their training. Okay, somehow or another I want to know because we address the technical part. I don't know what your physical. Yeah, I mean you're kind of fucking obvious. But any sticking point can be mental physical or technical so the technical is kind of addressed. Physical is kind of weird because I don't know because I don't train you guys that I want to work up and do really heavy sets of five because I don't know what can happen from that. And if I fatigue you doing like 225 for a rep test then it's going to just be a disaster because form just goes to shit. So we're going to try to kind of like the rest of the guys did before except you're going to rack it so you're going to do one rep, rack it, count to six. Oh, just count to five. Do one rep, rack it, count to five pull it out, two reps, rack it, pull it out. That way you have to sit. You're not going to completely set up jack set up. It's like a B half of a set up so you're back. You know, so I don't want your back cramp and all that shit because that's all fine. Your back's not going to fatigue but I don't know if it's the triceps on the shoulders on the lid is. You're going to see how high you can go. So it could be 10 reps but if you do nine, rack it, count to five. That's 19 reps going to 10. So I don't know where everything. It doesn't really matter where you die, it's just that if you die because where you die is where I want to see where it dies. So you guys are going to use 135. I got to think about what you're going to use. We'll see. Okay. And I do want it here. I don't want it up high. I want the stand here so you have to actually use your triceps to get it out because you'll proceed faster. So you're going to do one rep, rack it, count to five. I don't care if you let go of it or hold on to the bar makes no difference to me. You'll figure out what you want to do after five or six reps. I'll take it out, you'll five more and just keep stacking to it so you can't do anymore. And don't quit just because it's hard. Just keep going. Yeah, it's not going to hurt. He might not be able to breathe. That could be a different after we get after two, three reps. We could have a problem over here. You have to figure later. You're right. So one, two, three, four. Five will go six, seven will go to eight next time. One, two, three, four, five, six, and go. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. You did. Come on. I did it. Let's go. You did it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go. Go. Get it. Come on. Come on. You're good. You're good. Let's go. Push away. Push away. Away away away away. Come on. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Yeah. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Come on. Push away from it. Away away away away away away away away away away. That's good. Take it. Take it. That's good. Oh. You're upper. It's your upper back. Your upper back is the guilty muscle. That's what I expect. Yeah. It starts as unstable eyes. A couple sets ago. Yeah. Would you get to? 11. I think it's 11. That sucks when you do the 10. Right? Because you're acting like five. After nine hours. Yeah. I got the 10 next time. I should get your credit. Yeah. I got the 10 next time. I should get your credit. Yeah. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. That's good. Try-subs. I wasn't surprised at that one. I knew that one beforehand. I must still have you doing it. They close in about three. They get to three. They close. Come on. Come on. First one's easy. Squeeze. Just walk not to. Go. Squeeze. Squeeze. Go. Go. Go. Come on. One more. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. You got me. You got me. Go. You can be cocky now. Go. Push away. Push away. Let's go. Come on. Go. Let's go. Push away. Push away. Push away. It's good. Through lats. You're a tricky one. Because you do like a zillion-glute hammer-a-race. I'm not sure what I want to do. Because we'll be here all day. What do you think? You think she can do 95 and get a number of reps out there? She can get a lot of reps at night. That's embarrassing if she uses what you guys just did. This for warning you guys need to get a water and a monster drink. She could be going for an hour. Okay. Don't get too tight. Because I don't want you upper back knee and rectors to be with nocturne. Okay. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Push away. Push away. Push away. Come on. Okay. Was that all? Was that nine? Good. A sanitary or a delts. Front delts.
