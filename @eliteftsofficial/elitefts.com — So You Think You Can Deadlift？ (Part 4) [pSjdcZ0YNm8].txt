This is another segment of So You Think You Can Dabla. So we've shown the conventional pole with the single delet that has an accessory exercise we've shown in the good morning. Now we're going to show another variation of a straight leg of delet. Obviously you can use a straight bar, dumbbells, anything that tear discretion. I like to use the Velzcova machine because the cable tends to act a little bit different to normal weights and put me in a different position. So when I do on an conventional stiff leg it stands, you can do a sumo conventional. But if I'm trying to get glue to activation in which is what he is missing then I bring my feet in super close, almost my heels touching. And I try to focus on keeping my legs as straight as possible, driving my head up and utilizing the trying to utilize 100% glue to stand. Obviously the lower back is going to get attacked as well. But the Velzcova is a great variation for your stiff leg of delet tools and also to engage more glue activity. So he's going to show you about five reps. So the first thing we're going to do is really try to focus on arching the lower back to pull from the hamstring. We're trying to really focus on this, driving through the front. So we want to push those hips through the front. Now when using heavier weights it's optimal to do double over hand stuff. Most of my training 70% of my training of anything that I can hold, I hold double over hand until I can't hold it anymore than I switch my grip. The reason for that is eventually some of the most lifters you can have in grip issue. But if you're always done grab and stuff double over hand your fingers will be really, really strong and grip will never be a problem at a meat or a gym. I also advise against using any kind of straps or anything. If your hands can't hold it typically your body is not ready to lift it.
