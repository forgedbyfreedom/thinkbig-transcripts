This is the first video of the finished series. I'm going to have Mason do either. We actually have to push up, but you can either do this with the Tri-Sep extension or JM variation. What he's going to do, what you're going to do, he's not going to do. He's going to demonstrate. He's going to go to failure on each step, all the way up to the very top. This is a finish or so is what you would finish your training session with. So go ahead and first do the Tri-Sep extension. So if you're going to do these with Tri-Sep extensions, you'll do them all the way up with the Tri-Sep extension. Go down. You're going to go down to your form, hit your Bicep, elbows, tucked, and then Tri-Sep extend up. Then for push up variation, just move your grip out and do a regular push up. It's down up. And what you're going to do if it's in real time, you can do it more. You're going to do these to failure. I stand up and then move the Smith machine. And then you're going to take it up and notch. That's fine, one, two, high. Right there, then you would go to failure here. One, two, okay, take it up another notch. Then every time on every notch, you keep going to failure. Go through two there, take it up and notch. Just do one here. And then again, and you're going to keep going up. One more. That's probably going to be about as high as you're going to go. So you can either do this in a power rack, which is kind of time consuming and paying the ass. Smith machine is easier, because you can just notch all the way up. That's it. Next time. Yeah.
