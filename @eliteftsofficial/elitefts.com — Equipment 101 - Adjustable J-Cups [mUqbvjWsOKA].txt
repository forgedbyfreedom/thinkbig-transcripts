This is Mark Wash for leadFDS.com. This is a quick but 101 filling in from that building. I'm here at Showtime Stratus Performance in Newark, Ohio. We're talking about the Jusquake Cups. If you have E-Series rack or an old school rack, which you have is 3 inch hole spaces. With the Jusquake Cup, you can now have 1 inch hole spaces with the adjustments through the pan. Put it in. Now you have 1 inch increments with your spacing. Any questions feel free to give us a call, 888-854-886 or hit us up on the website, leadFDS.com.
