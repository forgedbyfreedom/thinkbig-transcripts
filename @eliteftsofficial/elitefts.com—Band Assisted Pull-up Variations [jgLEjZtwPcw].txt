Mark Watts, Savannah Steamer, today we're going to go over two band variations for the pullup. Now once pretty common you probably use before, the album is just a little bit more of a variation that might fit your system. This is really good for beginners and really good for a big group of athletes. So when you're talking about the band, we're going to go double up, we have a monkey bar attachment. So we're going to double right on that middle run. We're just going to hang it down. So the athletes are going to step up. And we'll see if the easiest part is to put it right around five mid-shin. So once through there come back around and you'll spot them in the mid-back. Unless you're sure like me, they can't reach or from the opposite foot from the bandland. You can go ahead and spot them. When the athletes are done, make sure you're going grab that band. Right, so it doesn't snap back up into our face. Other variation is going to be taking a band to wrap it through the jails. So again, with the jails, make sure that they open up from the outside. So you have to put it so again, they're going to go and open up from the outside. That way they won't bend them inward. With the bandage with this, the athlete performance boss is going to go ahead, grab on. They're just going to step on the band with the legs straight. So now the resistance is going to be a little bit different. So there's just going to be able to perform the movement. We usually want this set up so that we're at the top of the movement. The band is almost straight. The advantage of using this system here is that you can adjust the tension without using a different band. So with the same band by adjusting the height of the jails, you can adjust different ranges of motion in different sticking points when you're doing a pull-up. Combine band pull-ups with negatives. Probably the easiest way to get young beginners. Um, able to do a pull-up on the run. So try those variations. See what you think.
