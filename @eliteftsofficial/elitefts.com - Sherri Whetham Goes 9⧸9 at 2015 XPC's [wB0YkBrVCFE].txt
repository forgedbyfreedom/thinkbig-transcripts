Alright, I'm here at the Arnold Expo XPC Finals 2015. Never thought I would be anywhere near this. I've one of the powerlifting for a year. My expectations for the Arnolds were exactly what I did today. I expected to do a 200 pound bench, which was a 24-met PR, 24-pound APR. I did a 350-pound squat, which was a 24-no-actually 40-something-pound PR. And then I did a 420-pound deadlift, which was a 18-pound PR. So I know we're all about 100-pound meat PR. I pulled the 970 total today. So for me to commit the edge of 53 years old and compete amongst all these strong women, I pretty had an amazing day. I did exactly what I wanted to do. And it's exactly what I said I was going to do. Moving forward, we have the national's coming up in June. I might do another XPC meat. And of course, we're going to go to Portugal for the worlds in November. There I want to pull a 1000-pound total that's my goal for the end of the year. The miss-haps coming into the meat on our final day of our opening training session can, unfortunately, hurt his legs. So he wasn't able to lift tomorrow, which is unfortunate. So he just pulled my legs today and coach me through this day. So that's it. So I had a great experience. First time being a team-lead FTS member. I hope I did them proud and strong-care and old-her.
