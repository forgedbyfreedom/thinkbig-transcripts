Hey guys, Matt Goodwin and LeeNFTS.com, equipment sales. Over the last five years of selling equipment at a LeeNFTS, I noticed that people have some frustrations trying to get the rack that they're looking to purchase. When you go to the website, any companies website, you see the rack you want, everything looks great, good price point, and then you start adding the options that you want. By the time you get all those options into the cart, next thing you know, the price that you saw online that drew you to that product is no longer there, and now it's exponentially higher. So what we did at a LeeNFTS was we made packages. So we took our three most popular racks, the scholastic, the R3 and the collegiate, and gave you three package options. A basic package, which will give you the standard rack, chin bar, jacubbs and spotter pins. Then the next package up, we went with band pegs, top and bottom, monkey chin bars. The third, we went with band pegs, top and bottom, monkey chin bars and a dip attachments. So now you have three options for each rack, and that way it'll be easier for you to buy it. All you have to do is go to the site, pick the package you want, select your color option, drop it in the cart, and hit checkout. So over the course of the last five years of selling equipment, we've noticed that these problems come up over and over and over again, and you just can't get the rack that you want. Trying to make it easy as possible for you guys, let's just take all the confusion out of the purchasing process. So now you can go right online at www.leadfts.com, select the rack package that you want, pick your color, and away you go. You guys have another questions.
