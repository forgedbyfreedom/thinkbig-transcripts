Hey guys, Matt Goodwin, leadFTs.com episode of Equipment 101. Today we're looking at the new leadFTs signature competition bench. We have a couple new options on this. I want to go over with you guys. The first thing we did is we raised the step up platform. Get your upper lip at higher as you're lifting off. Make it a little bit easier. So we get that good lift off so you're not kind of struggling to get that thing out of there, pulling your back out. Another thing we also did is we add lever arms. So as the bar is loaded into meat, you got eight under pounds on here. Instead of your spotters lifting up, moving to J-Cups, we added a foot lever system. Basically you're just going to step down, drop the pin, and then it raises the bar for you. The foot lever system guys is great. Especially if you got a small training group, three, four you guys. Short arms, long arms, intermediate arms. This will be a quick way to adjust the J-Cup up and down without having to interrupt your training. So again, just kind of thinking of different ways to make things easier for you guys as a lift or as a spotter as a meat director. So this I think is going to be a really big feature for you guys. This is shown with the optional band pegs. Again, this is something that you're doing to meat. You're probably not going to need, but again for a training facility. If you want to have the only one bench, we do have the band pegs available for you. Again, this is the new leadFTs signature competition bench with the optional foot lever system and then band pegs.
