20, like 20, 25 down about you can do it at the same time. You know how to do a cross body line extension, just support the arm, go here, do as many as you can on this arm, hopefully you're going to fail somewhere between 15 and 20. Switch arms go here, go back and forth three times so you should be able to get 15 or 20, 6 to 8, and then 3, you know going it's a yeah, if you don't have to you don't you know but if you do do so it's triple sat just won't pull, pull, pull back and forth and just no rest, bones on bones, bones on ball three sets, no break back and forth. You get a little more stretch on the first round you can show them up and it gets really hard. Sorry don't have a mirror for you to check your pump out. There's time to do you can die man you'll go 15, 6, 2, that'd be what I call a finisher. I mean it's just probably good for hypertrophy but it's really I see it more for recovery once a week just kind of throw a ton of blood in there you're not going to really get sore from doing it you shouldn't know if it's a fuck sure elbows up don't die but you're not going to get sore from doing it and anytime you can get the blood in there helps visually you get it and there's a turn on a tissue down.
