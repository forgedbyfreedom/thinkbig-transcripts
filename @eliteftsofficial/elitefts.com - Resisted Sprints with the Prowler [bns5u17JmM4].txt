Alright, so we're going to go through a quick resisted sprint drill using a couple devices that might help you especially in a team setting. So we're going to use a prowler to pull instead of push, which is one of the features that we don't talk about too much. We got some easy chain loaders to go ahead through the eyelids and then we have just our regular sled strap. Now, the harness, the one thing we were using right now is just a lead-up TS strong band as a harness. Always going to do it, put on like a backpack. You can use a carabiner from chains. You can actually intertwine some of those straps, but whatever's comfortable for your athletes, the good thing is that you can get these on and off. And the good thing about these bands because they're elastic, they will fit a multitude of their athletes. So no matter what size athletes you have, they'll be able to fit those. So when we're doing these resisted runs, the most people have coaches have talked about having about 10% of the body weight anywhere between 10 and 20. My suggestion is if it does not inhibit the runny mechanics of the athlete, if you're getting enough of the contrast that they're not going to be changing their mechanics, it's good. I would also say the keep resistance, resistance sprints at a shorter distance, 10 to 20 large, and also try to use a contrast. So again, after resistance sprints, go ahead and do a normal sprint as a contrast, would be my suggestion. So again, what it would look like is again, have you actually have enough distance? If you're too close to the prowler of the sled, the front of that will pick up. So again, for right now, we have no weight on this, just to demonstrate. Obviously, for Roosevelt, we'd add a little bit of weight for his ability. So again, you can do any kind of start with this. Go and just demo your regular commines start. It's going to make sure you have tension, obviously, on there for the athlete and these who's going to go ahead and sprint. Again with those resisted sprints, again, with a large team setting, the key is making sure you can transition from athlete to athlete without wasting too much time. So again, I hope you have that'll give you an idea. Again, just using that band and putting it on as a harness.
