3-D God, I just opened a knock-down sleigh-doh 8-D to some class engines The only use that I make is strong enough to live just self-bowl When you feel like I felt cause I can't explain to you Your heart's hanging, dr. My next felt Just having a balance matching self-bully In shells I was made to war But thank you, Mark, is that game me though Straight to cause shady, nanny y'all Someone in today's day, nanny y'all Meas, I made it out of that house About the place in this world when the day was done So this is why every kid who was ever divorced I'm the one they just gave me and accepted I've been saying him a horror anyone similar You're the reason that I make this song And everything is gay to say Don't be afraid to say no more From the state of war just like the mayhold's tongue Take it with a grain of salt And eat the fucking faces off The legend of the angry blind Lips on through you when you go on and the thing I want to start I've breathed, make a single song A freedom I never mind where I am You have to do what I think makes it more better So if you are there trying to help people Show them the right way, show them how to do things You know we better for the sport Which I've always been a lift and try to teach them You know right we'll do it
