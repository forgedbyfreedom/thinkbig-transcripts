All right, I'm going to kind of show you what's going on here with the lead FDX here drop strap. Why I have two different loops on here. I'm just closing on to my belt for this. Well, before I do my strap, here's the deal. With the regular push down strap, you're only going to be able to get so far because it's to strap the looms I can be able to allow you to pull out and to get a full contract with the tricep. But having a longer strap at the end range, we can now get all the way out here. The problem with this is for most guys or girls, and most anybody who's going to buy it. You have a really hard time getting the top range because the forearm jams into the bicep is just because of the way that most straps are built. So all you're going to really be able to get is the end range of most straps. But with most of you are only going to be able to get here with our, if you're going to be able to pull it way out, the negative edge you're not going to be able to get, that top beginning range. The top loops are shorter to be able to give your hands up higher to get that full stretch to allow for greater range of motion. But the negative here is you're not going to be able to get. I can only pull out the here. So what I'm going to do in this set is you're going to see I'm going to use both straps. It's going to be done as a superset to be able to work the full length of the muscle. So I had four inch of motion and range at the bottom and range. So I'm going to start running to the top without any of them being completely full to the way that the straps design. I'm always going to train everything to failure. So I'm going to try to rest. Just go and take the end doing more. Go the other strap. I'm more partial to starting with bottom strap first. And then you see what the top strap is and they're getting different. That's why we have two loops.
