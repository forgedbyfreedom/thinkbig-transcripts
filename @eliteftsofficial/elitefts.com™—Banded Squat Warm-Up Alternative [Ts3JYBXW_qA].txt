Mark Watson, FTS, calm. We're just going to go over a couple squat warm up exercises. Besides the standard double end up around the knees, excellent warm up because again, addressing some blue activation. So, knee valve is what not. But here's a couple twist on the same one exercise you can do. Using a partner or using a wrap. We'll demonstrate what we're many men today, but you might need to think of band-dependent on what exercise you're doing. So, the first one is going to be in the same basic around the knees with a kind of a TKE twist. You'll get it from here. Just in your normal squat stance coming down. Coming up. So, after that, you can go ahead around the hips. This is something we've got from Creddard. Check out his video page. He has a couple good squat variations. Just something to get the athletes to force their hips back. So, again, around the hips, come all the way up. And then you can also incorporate with a hip-hage. Or with this one, you can get the athletes to bring the hips through at the top. So, that's another twist on that. So, with this, another thing you can do. Another series would be underneath the feet. So, you have the your normal squat stance, underneath the feet, and then the first variation. We'll just be a normal front squat. Bring your hands in front, distribute forward. Help the athletes to back. The next progression would be just performant. And overhead squat. Same basic principle. And then the last one would be just as a cut of a muscle snatch with this quad combo. Get the athletes to drop down below. Force in her hands up. Take it the same over as water approach. Take it the band around and wrap it with a partner. Same now. I actually force my shoulder blades down. Together, the right, right, lock my hands up top. Same thing with an over and squat progression. Okay.
