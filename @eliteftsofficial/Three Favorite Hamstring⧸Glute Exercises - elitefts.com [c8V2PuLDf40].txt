I have spent a lot of time the last year doing a lot of hamstring work. A lot of that comes from being a geared power lifter where the suit sort of gives you a little bit of that aid going into some raw lifting. I needed my hamstrings to engage a lot more. So I've spent a lot of time doing a lot of stiff leggy dead lifts that's probably one of my favorites. Another variation of that is a snatch grip. So a wide grip stiff leggy deadlift. Those two things work my hamstrings phenomenally. And then I obviously also do a lot of leg curl variations. Specifically I like single leg curls just because for me it helps me to focus a little bit more on a deeper contraction. I can slow the movement down a little bit. One other variation that I shouldn't say a variation or an exercise. What we do a lot in my training is we tempo those exercises a lot. So a leg curl you could go in every week and do a leg curl machine. But how you switch that up can really make a big difference. So you can do slow tempo reps. You can do east centrics. You can do fast reps. You can do rest pause. You can drop set. So there's a lot of variations that you can throw in. They're taking that same exercise and just making it different from week to week in order to bring about a little bit of a different change in the muscle.
