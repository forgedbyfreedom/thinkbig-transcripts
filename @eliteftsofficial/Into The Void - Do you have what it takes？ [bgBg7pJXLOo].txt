It was my place to build and grow mentally and physically. Which like other kids who came from similar situations, I built walls around me. By walls were built of past iron and steel. It was something I was good at. I went from the kid that got fucked with to be in the kid you don't want to fuck with. Everybody's human, there's a time in your mind when you're going to want to quit and you do another rep. Then you do another rep and yes it's going to burn. Yes it's going to hurt. Yes everything your body is going to tell you to quit. But you keep going that shuts down. It stops and your mind stops telling you anything. You just go. And within those seconds that's what I'm talking about. That's the void. That's earned. Not give it.
