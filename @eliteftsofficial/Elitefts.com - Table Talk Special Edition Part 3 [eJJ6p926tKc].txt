Second part of this table talk, I want to continue answering the question that Adam asks, but I'm going to approach it from a different standpoint. And that is, when you're asked by parents or younger kids, if they should, usually it's for me over the years, it's always been the bench press. I run into this situation many times. I can think of four right off the top of my head over the past for five years, you know, if I go back to when I was, excuse me, actually working as a trainer and coaching athletes and training athletes, it was, it was a lot more often than this. And that is, you run into the situation to where you have a younger kid, junior high school age, who you're working with and you're doing the body weight movements and you're doing the conditioning and the general preparatory work that they need to be doing at that age to be conditioning enough to be able to get into the weight training. So you're doing the right progressions, so to say on the body weight movements to move them into the benches and the squads, cleans, whatever you're going to have them do, whatever is part of the basic mix that you're going to put together for them. So you have them on track to be able to do this and then the call comes from a parent or the kid tells you something about how their junior high wrestling football, you know, whatever coach has them, you know, bench pressing and they're maxing out on the bench and you know, you want to scream, you know, and there's nothing you can do because you know this kid's not prepared to be able to even be on the bench in the first place, let alone have some idiot having a max out on the bench when the kid can't even do proper push-ups. And you are kind of hand strapped a little bit because you can't call the coach because all that's going to do is hurt the athlete in the long run and you can't for a lot of, I've tried, I mean a lot of the coaches you can't really educate them because they think that they know everything in the first place. So you're stuck. So what I found as effective is to make a deal with the kids that I'm working with and the deal that I throw out there to them always involves a bench press because that seems to always be the lift that they're maxing out on. It's these guys, you know, these coaches never have them, never test them in the in the squat or the deadlift thing God but it's always the bench press. So the way the deal goes is I'll sit the kids down and or you know parents, I mean there's got to be communication with the parents as well if you are working with kids so the parents need to know how you feel what's going on and at the same time you need to make sure that the parents aren't going to call the coach and tell them that he's an idiot for having a max out on the bench press and everything else. So there has to be a good line of communication between the trainer and the parent as well as the kid. The way that I've always explained it to kids is in 12 years old we're talking, you know, teenagers junior high school kids is the reason that they want to bench press and the reason they're doing the bench presses because everybody else is on the team is doing it and by if you've been training for any period of time you pretty much know that in the United States the bench press is a cock measuring contest playing and simple that's all it is everybody wants to know how much do you bench, you know there's t-shirt slogan everything it's just it's how much do you bench. So and that's why they're doing it they want to be able to bench more than what their peer did or if their you know buddy bench 95 pounds they want to say that they bench a hundred so they could be through buddy or they want to bench the same as what their buddy did and on and on and on and on because you'll hear the bragging from the kids on you know they bench an 85 pounds 75 pounds whatever whatever it is you hear the bragging about it so what I basically do is I sit them down and I tell them that the bench press is a cock measuring contest playing in simple that's all it is and it doesn't matter if they're bench pressing 65 pounds 55 pounds 85 pounds 115 pounds or 135 pounds 155 pounds whatever it is all it is is a 4 inch cock playing in simple that's it it's not a big bench we all know that they know that it may be a big bench to them but in the overall grand scheme of things it's a equivalent of a 4 inch dick so that's how I explain it to them then what I ask them is you know if they listen to what I tell them to do and they stick to the deal that I make with them which I'll explain at the end of this video that I'll make sure when they're in high school they have a monster cock they have a 10 inch cock instead of a 4 inch dick so everybody else will still have the 4 inch dick because they're inadequate training methods and everything else I'll make sure that they got monster meat and that they're going to be able to bench 3,400 pounds you know whatever they're capable of bench and I'll make sure to do that I'll show them how to do that I'll make the promise to them that I'll technically show them how to do that I've been there before I know what needs to be done to do that I've helped hundreds of other people do that before I've trained with people who have benched well over that I've bench pressed well over that I bench pressed over that when I was in high school as well so they can either learn from their inadequate coach who's going to help them develop their 4 inch cock or they can do what I tell them to do and have monster meat when it comes to high school so usually they're going to make the choice that they're going to want to have the greater strength in the bigger dick when they're in high school and so what is the deal you know what is the deal that I make with them very simple I still allow them to go in and do what they're going to do with their coach because the coach is going to be having them do whatever stupid shit they're going to have them do so if the coach is having them do two sets of six on the bench press whatever it is I want them to fake it until they make it so I want them if it's a set of six I want them to fail with the bar it's six reps if they can do 85 pounds I don't give a shit I want them to fail with the bar and make fake their progressions so they're always training way under what they're capable of training under and making sure every wrap that they do is done slowly controlled and with good technique and I will show them fairly good technique you know good enough technique to be able to fake it through this and that let them know that it doesn't matter that everybody else in there is going to be benching more than what they are that's not what important is important is the physical development for their sport and how well they're going to participate in their sport and the total strength they're going to have as an athlete for the sport that they're participating in not their bench press well we're working on his development the total athlete will work will worry about the monster meet after they've developed the foundation to be able to actually train the bench press properly in the first place so my expectation on them is for them to fake it and if they can fake it then you know by the time they mature and they can do 50 good push-ups that's one of the markers that I use before I'll work with any kid on the bench press at all is I want 50 good push-ups so they're going down touching their chest on the floor and back up with a straight back none of this cheat and bull crap once they do that then I'll be able to start working on their technique so I want them to fake the bench press start working the crap out of their push-ups to develop their arm strength their upper body strength and their body weight strength and then from there once they're able to do that I'll begin really working their technique and then they'll be able to reinforce that technique when they go in and do the training with a junior high strength coach if you can call it that typically it's just a coach who read an article somewhere or is just doing whatever he did when he played and didn't start years ago and keeping the kids safe and keeping them from you know I from I don't want to say hurting themselves because I doubt they're going to hurt themselves because they're not going to be lifting weights heavy enough to really hurt themselves they're just they're going to they're going to screw everything up that you're trying to develop they're going to have a false interpretation of what their strength really is and in the long run and in the beginning that false interpretation is going to be false because they're going to think that they're stronger than they what they really are and then in the long run what's going to happen with their poor technique and crappy methods of training that they're doing they're going to end up actually being weaker within what they could possibly be if they develop the proper foundation.
