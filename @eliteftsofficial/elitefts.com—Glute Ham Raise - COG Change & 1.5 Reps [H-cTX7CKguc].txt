Mark Walsh, Derek Dormer, lead at thes.com. We're going to go over a couple glued him variations that you can use to make the exercise more difficult without using a ton of weight. So one thing we're going to talk about is using a Medball or any kind of resistance and how you can make it difficult by worth the center of gravity with that. So the first option is to have an easy hold on your chest. Again, we come off and we want to push our toes, snap our head back. And next we'll be, we place that behind our head. There's a Medball or a plate, push the toes, snap the head back. And then the last one's going to be, if I have that over my head. Now I come down to the changes that are grabbing pause, coming up. So those are three ways. And that's the kind of progression you want to do. Chest, you mind the head and then over the head. Okay, second variation you can use to make it more difficult without actually having that weight is the change where you pause those reps and really just the accentuate certain ranges of motion. So we'll do a one and a half rep. So we can start by coming all the way up. Half way down, so about halfway, come all the way up and again that becomes one rep. The other thing you can do based on your athletes, based on the weak points, your base on the way area, you want to work on. We can do a one and a half rep, but we're going to come all the way down, come halfway up, suck all the way down and then complete a full rep. So those are two ways you can do one and a half rep to make that more difficult. Well, I actually adding more of certain weight on there. So again, try those out, comment, tell us what you think. All the way up and then come halfway down, right? Oh, shit. Fudge!
