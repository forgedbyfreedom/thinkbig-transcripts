I decided to do the XPC meet kind of on a whim after my last RPS meet, for a total 1320. Had a good meet there and I saw what the payoff was here and the competition looked pretty stiff, big meets in Columbus so it was travel expenses made it very affordable for me. So that's why I chose it. Expectations coming in. Always looking for PR total as any tire left there is but a personal goal of mine is for me to meet to set a PR somewhere either in squat bench, deadlift or hopefully total but if I can manage a PR somewhere I know at least made progress and then I can break down for me to meet what to work on. So based the way today went, today's really well. I mean with expectations I came in I was hoping to hit around 1340, the way training went and things felt good. I exceeded that today by all my expectations total 1360 with the 535 squat. 320 pound bench and 505 pound deadlift and then I hit a world record squat of 565 on my fourth. Great knowing that now because I can take a little bit of your squat and it closer to 1,400 which is a big goal of head for a while looking in past the 10 times body weight. My plans after this meet, Mario is trying to talk me into a bench only multi-plied meet in like 10 weeks. I'm going to give it some thought. I'm going to take a week off and kind of to see how I feel. I feel mentally good to go have some fun. I probably will. I'll probably just compete at 148 there not watch my way at all and just learn the shirt and enjoy the different experience and the different side of the power lifting. Especially putting it wise. But if I decide not to do that I'll just take some time off and really look at my weaknesses and where I need to go from this point and then try to eye a meet based upon again location time and what's going on my life.
