Hey Mario, you ready to hit it? Come on, see you again man. I'm ready. Good deal. So I was thinking, you probably have like one of the cool shops around here. I have to admit I love what I do. It's a lot of fun. But what's actually like inside the LIDOTTS offices? You know, you're on the site all the time. So you know the people in there. It's pretty much what you would imagine it'd be. I got to go warm up. I'll catch in there. I'm out. I'm out. I wonder what it's going to be. I wonder what it's going to be. I'm going to be in the future. Hey Joe, I got a customer online three and he's helped choosing to new gear. Hi, this is Joe. What are you going to help you with? Can you speak a little louder, sir? I'm having a little trouble hearing you. Hey, little Stevie. I'm doing inventory. I'm looking for this Supreme protein bars. Do you know where those are? Do you care of me more? Alright, hey, how you doing? Merfrou, with the lead FTS customer service. What can I do for you? You're interested in getting some bars. No bars. Hey, brink, you give me a hand. I'm trying to reach that box if they're only a few of those. I'm not doing that. Someone get Brandon here. Brandon, what do you need? Fuck. We sent you a model left. I am not sure how to have. I realized that inconvenience a big truck showed up. I understand and I do apologize for that. I'll tell you what. If we can do how about you just keep the model left. We'll get that t-shirt out to you. I'll probably first and next week. Is everything else I can do? Okay, there is a severe thunderstorm coming in the optical scope. You might want to pull the ring over for today. No, no, no, no. John Lens and Don Hickman have their meats coming up. They need their metal gear. I got this. Yeah, I can, I would definitely talk to Matt Crocker and see if I can get you a autograph picture. Yeah, I don't think that'll be issue. Okay, again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. We'll get that stuff right out to you. Thanks. I'm sorry. Cut into the cross-fitter train to get in. I'll take care of him now. Not for! Okay, good. You probably get to need some pro-lock collas with that. No, callas. Callas. You know, the things that hold the weight on the bar? Hold my toe, we had it in turn. One second, boss. Boom! That's like a press of shirt. I think you're a little close. Thought it looked shorter. Late FTS, you've been resources. This is Harry Salko. Hey, how's it going? Hey, I'm one second. I'm on a video Skype call with Clinton Darden. All right, Clint. I know we've got some apparel issues. There's a lot of back orders lately. We need to keep Molly in the warehouse happy. I need to know what's going on over there. We have lots of labor here in Cyprus. The buy-set nation is huge. The problem is the machines. Every time we get our finger stuck in the machine, one of the gears break. Well, you do whatever you can. Just gotta keep things rolling. All right, we'll keep working. We'll do our best to hammer things out. You know what's funny? The machine that keeps breaking the most often is that Little machine we use to sewing the tags that says Making USA. All right, listen. Did you, did you fax over a resume? Okay, that might be a real good idea to do. All right, I've got you down for the plates and bands. Could I interest you in a prowler as well? You're in a heaven prowler? I didn't have a record of that here. No, no, no, no a prowler. That's not a prowler. You got it. Where? And what we'll do is we'll look again at your resume. If you can send a video of that pole dance, that'll help your cause. Are you fucking kidding me? BAH! Okay, hey, thanks for calling. We'll put it dark, rainy, seen off the window. Yeah, don't come on the fashions. Right, and moving. You're not interested in modeling. Did you read my article on the model lift on the TVFT? You can't afford it. I don't know what you mean. How can you not afford the money? You need a model. You can't afford not to have a fucking model. Only a jackass would have a model. Okay, I'm all right.
