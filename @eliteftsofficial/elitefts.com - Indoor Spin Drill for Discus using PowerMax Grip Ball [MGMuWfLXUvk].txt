What I'm going to do is I'm going to demonstrate a drill using the power max ball to help you get used to rotating out of the back of the circle. It's a quarter half three-quarter full pair of wet drill. So first I'm going to do four quarter turns, going and then go straight into four half turns, four three-quarter turns, and then four color chairwats. And then the purpose is to get you as a throw or use to keeping your center gravity over top of your axis of rotation so that you can stay balanced as you exit the back of the circle. So starting with a quarter turn, we're just beginning to develop some transverse movement with resistance, with full extension. As you see, he's just turning, now he's moving to a half application. And a little bit more challenge. Now we're doing a three-quarter movement. So going 270 degrees, with resistance, with extension. Now we'll move into a full 360 arrow-wet movement. You try to drag that back of the circle. He's trying to control and break. He goes along to over rotate. Once again, it's getting to the release. You have to stop. You have to transfer all this rotation, all this power into the implement. And you want it to go the direction you want it to go. That's outside the sector lines. So, so. So. So. So. So. So. So.
