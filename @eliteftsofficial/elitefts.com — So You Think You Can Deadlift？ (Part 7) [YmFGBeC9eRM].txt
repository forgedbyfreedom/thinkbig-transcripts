So the next exercise is you can't ever discredit ads. You have to train ads almost every lower body training cycle. Even I train ads on my off days including my training days. It's just one of those muscles that needs constant attention to protect your back muscles and allow you to pull for a long period of time. So what I'm going to do is show him, show him, Roman chair or reverse-loving him raises for ad for my favorite exercises. We use any words from 15 to 100 pound dumbbells depending on how strong you are. And it not only gets the abdominal strong but it also creates a strong hip flexor which is very important. If you've ever pulled the hip flexor you realize how painful it is and how much it will get you. So this kind of work can keep you from having those issues. So he's going to go ahead and show far-press the scripts of that. So with the workout, it's probably a good idea regardless of whether you're novice beginning or all way up to advanced. We do many wear from three to 500 reps of some type of abdominal workout week. And that's not by coincidence. Most of the guys that do that have very little lower back problems. It's transferable for people that squat in gear and or raw, which you know maybe in one of the first lifters to kind of transition from both and be the highly successful of both. The abdominal training that I did in gear helped me to achieve all kinds of all numbers as well. So make sure that you train your abs as far as possible and give it as much attention as you do your other muscles.
