What I'm gonna give you guys here is a sled routine workout, whatever you want to call it that I Used a lot when I was competing Stay paid with another addition of quarantine table talk last time I talked about different Progressions and Exercises you can do with the bands I will get back and do more of those But I was asked to talk a little bit about sled training So when it comes to a dragging sled There's there's a lot of different options that you have here we sell Several different types of sleds. We have a steep sled Then we also sell Spots magic carpet sled which is a good sled if you're indoors because it you have to see what it is It's cloth material I suppose nylon cloth whatever the hell it is But it's good for indoors. It's not gonna tear the shit out of everything Steel sleds good for outdoors. It's the best thing about a steel flood to be honest with you is Elg your fucking neighbors crazy so that's something that I that I like Really No man I'm cracking myself up sitting here because I'm thinking of all the neighbors that are gonna call on you for being outside Because they don't quite understand the concept of social distancing So if you're outside, you know, they're gonna call on you just for being outside Fuck it now they can call on you for being outside and making noise with the sled anyhow. I regress This is the sled let's get back to the sled What I'm gonna give you guys here is a a sled routine Work out whatever you want to call it that I used a lot when I was competing and I used it for a few different reasons. I used it to Build up the glutes and hamstrings so this part the front end part of this is Heavy, you know to be able to build that up. I also used it for recovery and I used it for GPP so I'll explain you know the how this all kind of flows together As I present this so the strength aspect is going to be just forward dragging so you put the The you put your belt on and then you put the strap through your belt So you're dragging the sled behind you. I like this better than I like a harness For the goals that this is going to try to accomplish which is building up the The glutes in the hamstring because the loads going to be closer to that and it's going to take a lot of your upper body out of it because the loads going to be lower as well With the forward drags I always kept things easy and I keep things easy when I Have other people do this as well You can go off distance if you want and you got to wait a market I just always went off 25 steps So a trip would be down and back so 25 steps down Rest than 25 steps back how long is the rest on these not long so just about long enough to go down spin the sled around Maybe 15 20 seconds 30 at the most and then back down again With the forward drags they're heavy so you're gonna use As much weight as you can or as much weight as you have access to for this You can also use a tire I should probably put that out there or just anything that you can tire roper strap around To be able to do these works you do want to have the ability to be able to increase or decrease weight So with the forward drags you're gonna do two trips again. That's down rest back. That's one trip So you're gonna have you know four sets I guess you would call it You know for this so with the forward drags load that up so it's hard Down and back then you're gonna do back drags so basically just gonna turn around you're gonna walk backwards So the forward drags and work hamstrings is where you should feel it and when you're when you're doing the forward drags Try to rip your heel into the ground as you are stepping so be very deliberate on your steps just don't go and walk or try to you know muscle fuck through it. You don't want to do that just be deliberate on trying to Almost do a leg curl in a way like a standing the the start of a standing leg curl is how you want to Initiate it and then flex your ass at the end You know of every step to be very deliberate about it try not to lean forward. Try to stay upright So you're keeping the the tension on the hamstrings and glutes So you're gonna do the forward drags and you're gonna do the backward drag the backward drags are gonna be more quad dominant So you're gonna be you know pushing out from there again try to To restrict the momentum be deliberate with the steps Once you do those you really shouldn't have to reduce the way if you do you can reduce a little bit Then you're gonna go into rows So just grab the strap and pull so you're gonna have a strap that goes from the sled around your belt You know how a second strap is gonna go through the first strap which a lot of us will just call it an upper body strap or And we we sell both on the site, but it can be a rope it can be whatever you can find it You have to have something to be able to pull with or to press with as well so you want to do You know two trips of rows so down and back same number of steps same logic with these trips here So down rest 15 20 30 seconds whatever it doesn't come back So you're gonna hit the forward drags the back drags then rows then you're gonna hit presses We're just pushing through with that strap so rows presses then you're gonna reduce the weight and you're gonna go into front raises for two trips as well rear raises for two trips as well And then if you want you can go into like a tricep extension With it as well when you get into the upper body stuff You can reduce the rest periods and should I usually recommend once you get to the front raises rear raises and Those things just get rid of the rest period entirely because the weights gonna be light, you know for a lot And maybe 25 pounds and maybe 45 pounds something like that So it's not gonna be like the forward drags and rear drags to where you're gonna feel Wounded or exhausted the the the stuff down towards the end The front raises the rear raises the tricep extensions and the ankle drags which I'll talk about in a minute Those aren't gonna be is exhausting so to say But they're gonna be more GPP oriented because the rest period's gonna be completely taken out So there'll be larger rest periods at the front end of this when things are heavier When things lighten up you're gonna take the rest period's out So it's just gonna be down back down back down back because by the time you do the rows Press this front raises rear raises triceps and ankle drives you're looking at 12 trips total so you're looking at you know 24 down and back so 24 reps So you're talking a pretty good period of time that you're gonna be out there moving So that's where the recovery aspect comes in because when you get down to this Especially in the lower end stuff there's gonna be no eccentric loading So there's a lot of concentric loading So there's a lot of blood that's gonna be flushed into the muscles of be able to help aid in the recovery process without a lot of tissue tear down that comes with the eccentric part of the training So That's pretty much the whole Training session as you're gonna start with the forward drags backward drags rows presses front raises rear raises Tricep extensions and then the ankle drags which I forgot to talk about the ankle drags you're just gonna take the straps They should be loop straps that you're using for your upper body Slip your feet through the straps and then you're gonna walk kind of like you got a little kid grabbing on your ankle on your dragon I'm across the floor that's that's kind of what this is When you do that as with all these other things all the steps need to be deliberate and need to be intentional When you're doing it for the ankle drives you want to keep your hand on your obliques and Make sure every time you're bringing the leg through you're bringing it through with more than just the hip flexors You're bringing it through with the whole frontal abdominal wall obliques You know whole torso with the hip flexors kind of all If the same times synchronized I guess is what you would say to be out of make sure that it's deliberate And it's working what you want to work so you're not muscle fucking this shit through you have to make the steps to liberate And you're not just out there running back and forth you're out there doing things deliberately So you're working the muscles on a way that's gonna actually help your lips which is the point of all this Right now I can serve a different purpose because you're not able to get into the gym So this can be pushed a lot harder than if you were doing it for recovery So don't be afraid to load the weight on these things and I'll talk about the loading here in a second But don't be afraid to load it because it's not like this is gonna screw up the training that you're doing in the gym This is gonna be a big part of your training So as I said in the last video still do all the maintenance stuff that you're doing But add this and the band stuff to it So when you get back to the gym you will actually be better and not just maintaining things So this is to help increase your general physical preparedness but to also you know increase Small body parts that you may not be able to hit with a lot of the other things that you're doing You're gonna use a four-day progression on this so the first day You're gonna move the heaviest weight that you can possibly move or the most weight that you have access to For all these trips so it's gonna be trial and error You know some of it might be too heavy. You might not be able to finish it. That's okay. You have time. You know, so Figure out what you can do that's gonna be the heaviest for this So you're you're gonna feel tired as hell. You know after you get through the whole first session That will be your day one day two will be the day right after it So no days off between this so day one day two you're gonna reduce the weight by a third So right yes, you're gonna reduce it by a third so I don't want to give percentages because you might be using rocks and shit like that So just take a third of the weight off for the second day We keep the trips the same keep the steps the same the only thing you're gonna change is you're gonna reduce the Load you're gonna reduce the weight on the third day You're gonna reduce the weight again by a third so not a third off day one you're gonna reduce it by a third off What you used on day two on the fourth day? That's the day you're gonna take off then On day five you're gonna come back and you're gonna repeat day one same thing you know There's no reason to take the trips up. There's no reason to Increase the weight or any of that yet so just go through this whole thing for the first what is it five days because you're going back to day one go through it for maybe 15 days or Three rotations then after the third rotation either take the overall weight up on day one Which is gonna lower it's gonna change the weight is gonna be on the other days because it's all based upon what you do on day one So either take the weight up on that day or Add in a half of a trip with each exercise You know it's completely based upon you, but it's also based upon if you have access to the weight or not So that's the sled training that I have for you guys Let me know what you think and the comments below if you want to have more of this stuff. Let us know I can do this kind of all fucking day if I have to Let us know thank you and out Oh
