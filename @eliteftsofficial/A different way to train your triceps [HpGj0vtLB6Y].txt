Here's a try step exercise that you can do with seated debt machine. The way that you're going to do this one is you want to pick a weight that's just about one plate more than you could actually push down with one arm. So you're going to need both arms to push it down, but then you're only going to lower it with one arm. So you're going to press it down with both arms and only lower with one. The key here is to not go too heavy because the tempo on your knee center is going to be too fast. So I recommend going about one plate at most two plates more than you could press down with one arm. I'll show you. Then when you can't take it on a negative five-pound, it's not got as many reps as you can do. You fail there. Hit a lockout, slight bend, and hold. Then you'll keep holding until you feel exactly on your back so then you're done.
