Offshot, take your stance on water. Oh shit. I'm not even hit, love. Like. They can replace them. I know a guy too. What you're about to see are clips taken from an event we created called Train Your Ass Off with Dave Tate. Two main objectives to this event with one over a reaching goal. The two main objectives are to teach the best technique possible on one of the main lifts. The second objective was to be able to teach effort and intensity so they understand what training hard really is. And then from there it's much easier to grasp and understand what training submatsmele is. And then the overreaching goal of all this is for them to be able to utilize this information to make their training better and to have their lifestyle help their training instead of take away from their training. All right, my good, no big end diet. All right, because warm up stun. Fuck, I forgot to have you deadlift. Yeah. All right, I guess we got to do that. We'll do that next. We're just going to work technique. That's it. Just do a couple warm upsets. This this really won't take long because I'll be able to pick this apart really fast. Wow, you got to get your shoulders better. You got to get that your shoulders behind the bar. Yeah, that's why you got to get at least. So I got to get the media to tell you. You got to flare. Same thing. He's right behind just so you're not going to fall over. Get them shoulders behind more more more pull there. There. She needs more weight on the bar. She probably needs a quarter just throw over top. I get these. All right, what I'm trying to show is when the way deadlift's conventional or similar you want the mid-x, medium dealt with everyone call it. In line with the bar or slightly behind the bar, it can't be in front. If it's in front, they're always going to be falling forward. The problem is when they get big delts, you start looking at the muscle and then they get it being back too far. She just got to have confidence to sit back. He's right there again. So back, back. Go. Now you got to bring your hips through. As soon as they get your knees, bam, drive your hips forward. That's what I was talking about earlier. Yeah, that's my problem. Yeah, it's all mental, man. Just bam, hit your hips. Again. Yeah. Shoulders back. Shoulders back, back, back, back, back. Kips, there. Feel that? Okay, he rest. That's good. All right, next up. Oh, shit. Stop. I got to think. Man, that was a nightmare. Trying to act like your arms. Like, I'm going to age myself. You know what stretch arm is? No. Fuck. Act like your arms are like six inches longer. Just try to make your arms as long as they can be and grab the bar and pull. Make your arms really, really long and think of really long arms all the time you pull. Chin tucked. I do that again. But keep your chin tucked. Blow your air out. Blow all your out. Go down the bar and get your air when you're in the bottom. Get your air. Chin tucked. It's better. Okay, do one more. Same way. Blow all your out. Get your air. Chin tucked. As in. Better. Now you're dead. Let's go. Why the chin tucked? To get her head back. Her head was, you know, you want to talk that way. You want your cervical spine in line with the thoracic spine in line with the lumbar spine. So it's kind of all working together. If one piece of that's off, your body always follows your eyes. Always follow. In your eyes, your head always follows your eyes. Like try to keep looking to your side without turning your head. At some point, you're going to have to turn your head. You know, so it's all dictated by that. Try your upper back so that your upper back's weak because you're your mid back, your lower traps or doing everything right here. Okay, so what do I need to do? Getting more hip involvement and get your spine a more of a neutral position. The more a neutral. Like, uh, you were doing it. Go there. But instead of thrusting your traps back, throw your hips forward there. Hips. Okay. Just say the same one or your best one. Okay. Yeah. Just use gap in the belt. You got to fill your air. Mm-hmm. I just want you to try to fill and make sure the lower back is. Now you push your stomach against the front of the belt. You want to fill your lower back tight against the back of the belt. So it's the same thing. But that's where you're going to focus. So get the air and try to pull like that. This is what your belt will never slide up your back. So people will say, oh my belt slides up my back. Tells me immediately they don't have a fucking deadlift. Okay. It's a little better. Okay. I was going to fall again. Yeah, if you're starting to pull us to the bar. Okay. When you set up set up this a little bit, climb back. Okay. I want to see your shoulders come up even higher than they were there. Okay. You're still in front of the bar. Thank you shoulder to shoulder front of the bar. Yeah, there you go. Okay. So we're back back farther. Roll it into your belt. I don't know how to get them back anymore. Yeah. Without like leaning my whole body. That one was better. Okay. It's closer. See where you ran a better position. Okay. Off shot. Take your stance on water. Oh shit. I'm not even hit slow. Like. They can replace them. I know a guy too. It's like I just want to see what's going to happen. I don't know. It could be a complete. It's a complete disaster. So. No, down. I don't have anything. Yeah, that's not going to happen. No, that's not going to happen. No. Okay. Just try to just. Just. Let's not over thing. It just pick it up. Okay. I just fucking pick it up. Like you're at a meal. Let's see what just. What happens if you just pick it up. Okay. Okay. Keep it the same. Just taking it along. Yeah, just maybe it's just your tight. You know, whatever it is. Yeah, yeah. Good. Okay. Okay. There's more. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Do it a lot better that way. Like that. Yeah. It wasn't much. Yeah. It makes it different. Yeah. Yeah. You get your whole body a little bit more upright. It looks good. Stop. I'll see you up here. Okay. Good. Go. Okay. Okay. There we go. Nice. What do you have him do? I wanted him to arch more here. Okay. Didn't that same neutral position? Mm-hmm. That helps. Yeah. Do it again. Yeah. Just like that. The same like this one. Get the same. Letting the arch. Yeah. There. Good. Go. Nice. Good. Good. Good. Good. Five. Four. Get up. Get it up. Get it up. Go. Two more. Go. Get it up. Get it up. I get it up. I get from the moon. Does that on my hands? I think it's a bird down man. I think it's been laying in the same place for about a month. I did throw it away at one point in time. Yeah. I need to see if I see if my sponsorship is still good. Let's see if they'll send me another box of shit. If we burn it out the other one, I'm like, what do you mean? We!
