Ken Skip Hill here in Team Skip World headquarters just outside Denver Colorado I'm just gonna quickly do a intro to set up the following video segments for seminar workshop that I did down in King's been Jamaica a couple months ago That is if you can hear Christmas music in the background so it's been a couple months You don't want to just throw the video segments at everybody without some sort of Intro that I know was common so essentially it's my train philosophy My supplementation ideas nutrition skip loading also or stuff. I like a lot of good information I also want to give you heads up to because I'm quite a bit darker in the Video segments when I was down in Jamaica my wife and I spent half of that week on a beach So when I'm rubbing my head and I'm rubbing my eyes During the seminar it's not because I'm bored because I'm tired This because the top of my head was burnt pretty bad And my eyes were really dry from being out on the beach for your three or four days So I want anybody to think that I was bored or not enjoy myself during the during the seminar Not information hope you like it I Keep going on my phone it's only because I did me some notes out here I do here You know just background what I do I'm not a I'm not the kick everybody's but can about a goler. I just got into it with Little road genetics and you can find a way to weave that way was to learn as much as I could about a Trishy condition so on the guy that shows up it looks like I have no skin because I can't win So it is it just kind of Blossom from there and have a lot of people approach me and saying how did you do how do you get like that? Give me like that and I start scratching my head one day because I'm not terribly bright But I don't feel really like so I'm not a longer fine Thank you couple of work So I started a business back early 2000 And we catch a break because that's when the internet body building message boards was So I'm really sorry to take off and United States is considered the Kind of the mac of kind of the center of the body going so Now unfortunately not be able to stay alone with my kids and they drive me nuts all day I don't get a lot of work now to be able to sit right but it's still a lot better than the sounds I do work with some athletes like I said I had out of all players and I worked with Especially linemen because they like to get Got a chunk in the off season And then before they get back to camp they decide to get a straight so they come to Denver I live in Denver however, I just outside of Denver powerhouse our elevations quite high We have United States Olympic training facility there for that reason is trained to high all to We come down to regular base we've been even fat-riding Rolls and a bunch of other ways to know until they're basically And as much as I know about elevations I've got to find that around each number of the other days It's just to give you perspective But as the idle elevations you body tends to adapt to use the function Whether it be for sports and or not with less oxygen The RBC is criminal clothing in America levels. You know Change Everybody is trying function in this option it'll take 40 days to get kind of surprised me I go back to work all the time I know they smell It'll take 40 days where your blood To return to normal when you go down to our age So I don't know if you guys are in a family it's good if you see the brown clothes playing my friend I'm maybe a cheer When you have teams coming town and hate is running that no auto office He's killing them Because they're just suck hands, so they so when I'm sorry I love to talk about oxygen That's why that's a reason part of the reason this is actually to come to me Come to where I am Train prior to building into their seats here in the hand If you're interested in something that takes you to big part of that I am I trained for 30 years So I know a lot about training to and I'll touch on my ideas and classes around Weight training for muscle things like that, but my aerogax retention nutrition tradition Succulation that's sort of like if you've got more skin into life My model for my business is skin is overrated So we need to get rid of skin I'm the guy that was skin I do ideology and Philosophy And I'm real simple up to this in the Justities and in the sense You just over you don't Topicate things and we've all heard it at the same time We tried to divide it into two to me Train I've got a couple of okay cool And to again, if you want to talk another some talk about business I don't have that up there, but I don't know what to look at great with you guys have questions about Business internet business things like that, they have videos to those questions too Not to overcap it, things and it was funny to have a quick little story kind of story guys Talk to But I'm a story guys, I've got a 13 year old son. I got we have four kids And on the ones boy As a 13 year old son, he's our working out, he's started out in the hole they used to train the heart core Damn You know I had to go in there and you know we got to be in the hand and we got to wait I got to go to the gym too And I train with my wife You know if I'm wife, my wife is both gorgeous and I have four years, she's still awesome But I'm training with my wife That's a little different training we know You know the guy trying to rip it up, you know thinking that you're being some So anyway, kids want to come along so I've not myself gotten a couple of not just so I don't train an Arborist pro very much World of pros and cons, you guys familiar with Bodybuilding, I mean, he was a friend of mine I could get him against him that you know three when he competed in his first show Step down stage not have a clue what he's doing But he's just kick there by dancing He was certainly dusting for the parade He was dusting for his third, what do you want here this last week? I don't know in I try to take sides I know a lot of the pros But because I know him I know the type of guy that is like you like in my duet And then he was good at the sport And they're pretty much with him I'm getting a bigger fan of I apologize and he had a fan there was him And there was everybody of the since last week He pretty much dominated Which was good to say So his wife, you guys know he has wife's battle and breast cancer Which if you have a regular job you go to You're trying to support your wife There's something like that It is hard enough to get to Still stand your name And remain in your top here And that's body-to-off plan That's like you're getting ready to jump Think one day And you're off and tired of it So you're doing it So little jam and time But back to the 13 year old school So we go to this Taking the kids now to get a going on a gym We got to go gym where we can do something But we're finally going to work at some of the sun starts working out And I'm actually going to work out for the staff to do And I'm thinking to myself and I've brought back everyone And when I first started And this brings back the don't overclocking things Just bounce around Don't know what he wants to do Checking it out who's grown one Because he's done nothing before As a 90 training before Nothing specialized I'm terribly efficient But he's getting enough Sometimes I think when I'm looking at one I don't want to get over any Because that if you want Perfectly you're not going to grow And just it reiterates The whole team is simple thing Yes, there's going to be a point where he's going to have to Maybe come to me And I'm going to have to help him set something up To become more efficient at him And then time is progressing so well But it's one of the people alone Let him do what he wants to do And I can't hear it is over And you're a lot of what we're sure I've been training 28 years So we've got some probably putting in Quite a few years to some And you can put in any bit of your motivation And you don't want to waste time I can play through a special event And if it's the case where you want to add your song money You know, you shouldn't hear any of those other training I can save you a lot of time too But in the meantime, time on there There's somebody set a trial where we play Or play with a play with a training And you're nutrition And you're making notes and you can't do track things That's where you find out You use a few of its logical from calling You can keep track of what you know And if you're progressing right You're not making changes And that's the part of keeping it simple And we keep it simple in the variables Or low, you know what's working When it's working And you know what's not working It's not sound simple But if you're doing 12 different things Or you change six different things And all of a sudden you start progressing That's great Until you try to figure out why you're progressing So it comes back And just keep it in the subject And I was not going to go anywhere It goes for anything Whether it's training Whether it's nutrition Or supplementation And I'll touch on supplementation Or nutrition Skip loaded Just by short hands And I don't know if anybody has it Does anybody hurt? Skip loaded or Recyts or okay? All right, right, right All right, very good I'll go over that to competitors Any competitors they might Can people want to compete or Think about down and down or all Can't take a good decision If they're going to write up And you got it right now No, that's good That's cool, that's always a good thing So we have a dance, which is always nice Um, as far as training Look, what? What training for a call Is that a story of a long dog? Not a dog Anybody along? John Lettos? No? Okay, hi, hi, I'm John Um, pretty big of a hand I'm going to write it down He writes it in order to study that too As well, John Lettos, not a train I used to do this, for example, because He's a high volume kind of guy If that hasn't been very trendy I say trendy because Everything trends Training really Is a terribly confident Trainers will try to make it Topstated and Writeers from magazines are open Most of the length, but I still write the plucks Every time I'm in And we will throw in things And you know, it's just Back in the 70s, Marlboro's training High volume You guys, I mean, you just would do a ton of work Then I went to being Right with six-day grabs And that sort of thing It's more closer to failure training And he gets a Dorian Then we're real low volume High intensity, rip every muscle in your body Tori can't even hit anymore because You know, in all these ways are effective First short period of time You know, even if Dorian comes back into Minds, that was a high intensity low volume People are so fine These training, top training Okay, these are I've worked with him from 10 years He's based off of intense muscle He also has trained through your cushion To boost your protein That's sort of thing His training, because that low intensity Low volume, high intensity as well Very effective I mean, I used to myself, I probably would more And that to every year's and I had no long time But I pull everything because I'm full And so any time you're pushing the envelope To where and you have to To get broke, you got to do something different The chopotty isn't used So even if you're, you find something The work's real well They need the low volume, high intensity So it'll work real well for so long And then you can battle it Interiors, much like Dorian here The guy ripped it, pretty much anything He ripped to a point that he couldn't really compete anymore Because it has changed, it changes the So much So it's surprisingly a As much As much as I've had tons of clients who had that type of You know, the sites who are all big shots You know, you lower the volume To some degree tend to recover a little bit better But the higher the amount of trends It's coming back around now Just nice to see it because when you get older It's hard on Enjoying it's hard on tendons We start pulling things And it passed on the end So with the training I don't really have one way The one style training that I am Because of course If somebody says to me Well, what do I do? Because I've been doing this training program And I haven't I haven't been progressing I want to know what they're doing at that point Not progressing with And then we're going to train it up Basically the body growth when it's not used So if you even if you're doing real well Instead of wanting to You still want to change that out And if you're what you got to do There's a lot of factors to take in consideration One of the main ones too real is a And how much of you can beat yourself up And a lot of times that's not a And I'm 43 And it's not as much as I'm 43 as I've been training on Almost 30 years So it probably would be better to say I'm more like a 58 year old Because I got bad needs I got bad Not bad back Because the more years It's like the training years are gone Years The more years that you have training That's really the most important thing Because even Perfect forms And everybody should be training with With there's good controls, possible To save your joint, save your body To save your needs, that sort of thing But even when you're doing everything right over time And I said it's over and over It's a mantra that I have But I've said for years That position in and of itself is degenerative You can do the same You can do the squat perfectly But if you squat 10,000 times Your needs are going to be going to Wear it down, you're back You're going to wear it down That's it You're going to wear it down You're going to wear it down You're going to wear it down You're going to be really glad You start hurting, you can do it You're going to be really good for it Because if you're warm You're going to take half of that You're going to be nice That position is probably the only thing that I've really Got with over 30 years But I've already seen this six times And it's a constant loud But the alternative for any of us In dealing with injuries as well I don't know if a lot of symptoms can come It's like I'm going to ask them to keep having injuries I don't know if they can do it They don't do anything That's the alternative So if they're going to have some You may not be able to squat They make the heel You only need to say squat makes your legs bigger You can squat really well with squat on your legs Because that's their grip So squat can make your legs so foot-press So the hands That makes sense to be comfortable But nonetheless, if you're moving away You know there's some people who are talking Just are not going to the right way to squat So instead of forcing yourself into an exercise It could potentially answer you Because it doesn't feel right Hands up I've seen plenty of guys Same with dads Everybody thinks they have a pole dance for a big class Johnny L Did he I just said I posed this question Like Johnny L Johnny L which I said That is a back Which came first That's left through the back Which came first Yeah, I mean it's one of those types of things Is he pulling big numbers because He's not canically He's built that way And his back is big He's back as strong Anyone Plats is another good example We have plates Big huge legs Because he's squatting all the time Or getting squatting all the time Because he was so weak He comes strong And he's got six squat For a fifth Time range is a new one Everybody looks at it Yeah, which one is it And I'm not to say All the time I've seen Bill he For a year And that man If I explain how he trained Because If we don't see the videos Pictures Guys never fully said this in life Because I need a pole dance And drop it 25,000 I've seen him get up And I'm not picking on him I love him I think he's great guy But I've seen him get ready for shows And only news is the shit he's So sometimes when people say Well, you're telling me one thing You skip it I saw Bill train Okay Bill You're here Just in most of my life They're overinteriffing us May and we're in this real day Through like four baby people And you still And there's pride And there's brains With those We're so Not They should put them on another planet Because They aren't that way Because the way they train They aren't that way Because the way they eat Because some other factors in there But make them a state I know many people We do so some factors But they don't look like film So really what it comes down to That's not to take away from them Or be hard Clearly they were hard That's That's an old writing I guess my point is There's a lot There's thousands and thousands of people Who work at real business arts They will never have a chance I changed 20 years I've done some things In games But I think nobody has planned Because train party And I can't come in I got as close I took 72 in Oh, for eight And his second show And that's as close as I'll ever get to And trust me when I say first and second Wasn't as close as film and time Right? There was 100 people there Because they didn't look like it And also what the party is So that's the most important thing Pointing when it comes down to it What they do Really You should forget about Because in this sort of train There's a many buddies going To train everybody's working To keep my work with somebody Who comes from those middle of the road Genetics Maybe And maybe he was just a Chatting who had no muscle or sheep But that man When you take someone who can't tame The situation and the average number of genetics And quarter-nine Think that someone Then they know someone Prove someone No Much more than anybody else They just ran away So we carry a lot of bond Or a lot of stuff Drives three or four of the years a day Or get four of the years a day How many times you've been told That dream so much while you're going to get through this So there's a different set of rules You can tell You know, rest of us at My main point is just rest of us at dealing with these average genetics And we're not going to That's not going to change Something to change Something to change It's about to take away my play poker The game is not over When you're done with first and card It looks real good if you got a pair of hands But the six seven suited You still got five more cards And the straight one is going to be in a pair of hands You just got to play the hand out Sometimes it takes a long time Play the hand and out All that stuff I was done with pair of six It was just 20 years ago So you play the hand and out As far as the high volume Low volume, high rev Low rev Again You know It just comes back to what you're doing now You're sitting there with a program That you don't think is very effective Take what you're doing Look at what it's up now Your progress is recovery Most people train harder And it just I gotta say this too If you think it won I'm not really hearing it To build a lot of volume To tell you how long you're going to get in the air You need to build a lot of volume There is no volume in the screen It doesn't need to build a little volume So that's why sometimes I cringe when I hear on I just want to tell you Or even in terms of the sound Just want to hear about it You're somebody's volume Like your tall volume You're just too big You're on the way for 20 years You're just going to make it That's not working Yeah That's some point if it did You just go back to sleep And not train for a couple of days Everything will go away If it came that fast It'll go back to that You don't have to go right Yeah You'll want to ever come back So you work you but you don't get the muscle Because that's hard to find The dieting and everything is going to work It's going to be a headache But if you lose weight Nobody, you're not going to do this I'm talking about the tricks And the question in the car is The two of you are going to be out there Nobody should be starving Nobody should be starving Nobody should feel their strength You shouldn't be dragging Feeling like you're pulling your tail Where you're clawed warm behind you Should go for your day Not being able to function that sort of thing Not getting that warm Just getting the weight in nutrition And I separate Try to separate the two Because I'm not going to die It's not going to be certainly not going to be in the middle So I cover both I like to cover regular nutrition Because evenly I just get both of you Isn't that important about just going to have What's considered to be a regular diet You're not going to be hungry But again, the things I'm working out for And trying to go and take a look at what you're doing And just put the top around ten of the cover Is the ocean if you are going to much work And you're not sleeping You're not getting the nutrition You're not going to be recovering You're not getting the nutrition And even if you say well I'm good with what I am trying to maintain If you're not recovering from the workouts And you're not going to look right Anyway, this is going to be flat It's going to be just not going to look big Not going to look for what's like that Trying to work out the wings It's going to sit with sandals If you come onto the brakes And everything that you're not going to use Something like that You're not going to be in the middle I have a great addiction You're like cringey sound You can cringey twice a day I'll take my pad I have a great place I've been going to put the pillow for you Before the clothes And get ready to take your bag Because I know you're not going to be hungry It's not going to be hungry So I've got butter nuts I've got butter nuts I've got butter nuts I've got butter nuts I've got butter nuts I've got butter nuts I've got butter nuts Anyway, I'll be back Any form of one? Any question with training here? Yeah When the first thing is going to be that small You know, training on the training You know, you need to do a lot of questions I've got some time to discuss it I've been seeing somebody for personal training I've been working on it I've been saying really new times Are really nice You know, you need to be training Different body parts and different things And I present them with a book And they do that thing So party at party was one bit I've got to do a high one Or some boss It's fun to do a good thing Good question Yes But it's not that simple Usually if you're walking on a train You see somebody in the gym that has A good body part They're walking They didn't really use it But not usually They didn't train that much They didn't have anything else to describe Okay If you're that person And you want to bounce to see Then you need to take a look at the priority of a training And that seat Those quality, you know, if your chest is good And you legs are good Then don't get a priority When I say don't get a priority Early in the week when your energy is higher You want to train those weaker areas Early in your workout session Maybe you have, I don't know how You work out instead of But if you're training three muscle groups in a day And chest is your strong point Then you may not want to lean with that The other thing to do is But as a couple of reasons you might have a weak area If you have a weak area, it might be the two training You know, legs tend to be weak for a lot of people Because they just don't like to train those two hard They come up with some lean, knee back They need to see you That no one's hurt of the floor They die and go some self with That's you just like a new one Then I go Then I go Then I go So that's one thing They may not be training real hard But there's the other aspect that is overlooking a lot Right about this lot when it articles When I'm ready about training in recovery They're about to write about so much That my F I have to find a set of things to write about something That's my goal People aren't getting it That's why I want to keep writing so much And that is over training A lot of people will come and say This happens a lot of secondary muscle group But the shoulders, arms, things like that They can't grow Guys freely in the arms, won't grow It's hilarious They just don't do everything I don't do everything And then I'm what people would do But I turn three times a week And I don't know if anybody in there is your joint That's your own fault That's not true I always say that I have to do it Your own fault Training for three times a week Because they're weak Didn't get a lot of recovery that you need Plus when you're training test in back How does it get in the camera? I still say this day I did this for myself I'm real jail-shower But when I was trying to compete in the way I could hold this too small To narrow Something I got to do more for chest and back Everything else that I had to do I would keep back And that is my child and work And it's grown more And what was happening is Most of it I firmly believe this on right about this What you're trying to test about heavy Shopeers and arms I believe it most of the growth Most of your arm and shoulder growth Will come from the second day of work From back in chest So when you're moving They've numbers on back in chest Your arms will be broken I don't believe that it's curls and press down To make her But try and get the binding But there's a nine new curls and press down You see it It doesn't work It's like trying to take you from day to time So what I talk about I'll do is I have a training protocol That I put together And I've written about it Especially where You train Basically the cries of it is You train back and chest Twice as much as training shoulders And that balance is out of the work But if you have to manage that now The training balance Now the problem is If you've got to actually get some given the doing And stick with it Then the only hit Shopeers not has to be able to 10 days That all of a sudden Like I've heard of it more There's a thing on top of it They're just like, like this is crap But I don't want to get smaller I don't want to get smaller I'm trying to chest back more So they're giving it smaller What then when you get a talk And you start asking questions They're stronger They're getting wider And there isn't a muscle in your body It's going to get stronger And not get bigger It doesn't happen But let me, I better be here If you're doing many new trickles You're doing like power of the type set That's way different So if there's any power of the new guy Other than that Burn the power of the new If you're in bodybuilding replanters And you're getting stronger And it doesn't necessarily mean the weight goes up If the reps are going up Same weight, you're still progressing You're still getting stronger That muscle has to grow And just to make sure I cover the other side When you're dying And you're losing a lot of weight And bodybuilders do this And having weight is different That was the 40 point they started losing muscle You're going to get smaller You won't lose muscle You're going to get stronger But not straight And then you're going to have to go down And tell you you're getting smaller That will measure even more And then you got out of losing muscle And finally your whole day will strengthen You're not losing muscle And you can't lose muscle And you're going to lose strength And you're going to get stronger Now losing strength You lose a little bit of strength And not necessarily losing muscle Not talking about that More than we get into the tertiary part Because then you get into going flat Those energy Things like that You've got your top side You've got your top side You've got your top side You've got your top side Go far, go calories That's a good way to get a touch on that
