Talking up is awesome, isn't it? All right, that's live and man, you chalk up and you go to a bar, that's when shit gets real. All right, your adrenaline's running, you have passion, you love it, you're looking at possibly breaking a PR, getting better. All right, to me that's what you want to strive for in life, you want to strive for getting your hands in the chalk box and moving forward. You can spend all your life in the warm up room, talking about things and trying. But to me, that's not living. Living, talking your hands, getting ready and taking that step from the box to the box because that's that one step. So few people take because that step isn't easy and with that step comes risk. Let's go, three, let's go. You go to list a heavy weight, two or one. I'm sorry, one of three things are going to happen. You're going to make it, you're going to miss it or you're going to get hurt. Two or three are not good. But one is awesome. That's why you want to strive for the chalk box. Get the hell out of the warm up room, find something that empowers you, like that chalk box, to be able to move forward with your career, relationship, family, business, whatever it is. Because that's where life is happening. If you're too afraid to dig in, chalk off, that's fine. You know, that's your choice. And that's the majority of society. I'd like to empower you to be better.
