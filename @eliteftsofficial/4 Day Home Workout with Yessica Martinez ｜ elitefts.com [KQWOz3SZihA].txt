I guess the Martinez Elite FTS athlete here, I'm going to show you today a four day workout plan that you can do in the comfort of your own home. You're going to do it upper body, lower body core, and a full body workout. All your required is dance, and a towel. If you don't have bands at home, I highly encourage you to visit EliteFTS.com and invest in them. And let's get started! Oh shit, okay let's do it, let's finish this shit. Just roll, okay just don't stop roll.
