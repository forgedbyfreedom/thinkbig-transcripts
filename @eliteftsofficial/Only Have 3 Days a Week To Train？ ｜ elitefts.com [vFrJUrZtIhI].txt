What sort of program would you recommend for a 50-year-old for three times a week only sessions? And he said he's already an intermediate with a squat of 365, a deadlift with 450, a bench of 280. And he said he's been on 531 for over three years now. Even if you can just train three days a week and you find a program that's laid out on a four-day week scenario, then you can still use that on a three-day week breakdown. Just Monday, Wednesday, Friday, then the fourth day we'll be that next Monday and it just cycles through on an eight-day period instead of a five or seven-day period. That's the biggest thing that I see that people forget and they don't take in consideration. The only place where that gets a little weird is if you are trying to peek for a meet that's got a specific day and you want to... You're going to have to work backwards from the meet to see exactly what day each thing we need to fall on. You can't forward-think as much with this situation because you don't want to end up with your last heavy deadlift being the... Monday before a meet for instance. That might be better to be the bench to be able to fall on that. So just work it back that way. So that opens your opportunities on what you're looking at now because more than likely you're looking for and you're vetting out programs that are situated around three days a week. And that's where you're finding the restriction with what you're looking for. Don't do that. So a little more open-minded on that and then you can look from that standpoint and go that direction. And I know a lot of people and I've always known a lot of people, it's not so much a age-related that can only get in twice a week. Same Monday, Thursday, something along those scenarios. And they would break out the same four days over two weeks. So from that standpoint, because that's broke out even more, the accessory work may want to be a little bit more at the end of each session. And the or you might want to take the volume up a little more on the work sets than what you would typically see. Because the only reason for that is because you're going to have longer period to recover from. So you don't... yes, you still have to be worried about recovery, but more than likely you're going to recover. And the situation like that no matter what the stimulus is. So you don't want it to be so much that it's going to run you in the dirt and you know lead to injury or something like that. But you can push it a little bit more than what you would if it was going to be all pushed into a five or six-day period. So that would be my answer for that. These are the things. I can't bring them up. Does that on my hands? Strow like a tree. There's roots right there. Oh, I've been running from the law.
