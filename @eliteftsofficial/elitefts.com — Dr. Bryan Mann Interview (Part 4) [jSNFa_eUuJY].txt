Everybody, Steve Coltscott for leadFTS.com. Sitting here talking to Brian Mann and Brian, you've coached hundreds of thousands of people. Tell me from your perspective, what things do you look for that tell you both from a physical mental standpoint that someone is going to make a good strength athlete? Well the good strength athlete was first obviously the frame. They've got the big strong heavy bone structure. They move well. We've got, for instance, we've got one of the top shop putters that have ever lived at our school. Christian Campwell, 2008, 2012, Olympian, 2008, Silver Medalist. I've spotted the dude doing 624 for Bench and it moves fast. You know whenever he walks in the room, he's got the shoulders, he's got the chest, but that's not it. He turns around and he's got everything on the backside. He's got the lats, the hamstrings, the glutes. They're the people that have the best athletes with the ones who aren't training the bar bodies. You know, what looks good in the polo shirts, they're training what they can't see. You know the hamstrings, the glutes. That's easy to tell whenever somebody's going to be a great athlete. They've got great hamstrings. They turn to the side and they've got a lot of bumps in the front, nothing in the back. You know, you're working with somebody who might look good? They're not an athlete. Thank you, Brian.
