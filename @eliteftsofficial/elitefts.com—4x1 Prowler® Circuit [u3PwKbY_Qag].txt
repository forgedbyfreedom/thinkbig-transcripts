More Boston NTS.com, we are at 11.1F Linux and Columbus, Ohio. We're going to show you real quick circuit using the prowl. One of the issues with the prowl is if you have a large team and you have not lost space whether with wise or lengthwise, here's a quick circuit or a quick variation you can do with that. So again, we're going to make four trips without actually spinning the prowl. And we have four different varieties and it's a way to get after you do pretty quick with quick turnaround. So again, the four different legs of this one trip is going to be the first group to be here's all the whole heels. We'll go ahead and demonstrate through and so again, push on the whole heels, make sure the arms are locked out. Then you go to that through, reach the ramp on the high heels through the upper ass, just jump and change your. Coming back through on the high heels, going back and then the four points going to be on the toes again. On the top, race it all with through. You can adjust the rest of the work ratio by the distance. You can also adjust the speed by how much weight we have on the upper ass. The good thing about this is that that a very quick circuit, you can get a lot of athletes through. And not take up a lot of space. So again, we low heels, high heels reach through high heels going back and then finish it off. Hands on the poles. So as you go through that circuit, with the out against the T, the actual mechanical advantageous change and it gets a little easier as you get the T. So you can get a lot of large movements through there and very quick amount of time. So try that out next time. We're doing a problem push.
