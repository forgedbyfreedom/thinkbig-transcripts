Besides track and field coaches, how often do you ever see a seminar on kind of general sprint training or speed training or acceleration training for athletes? There was only 245s that he'd signed at 25. You could push with the hell and he was like, dude, you don't f***ing understand. I can't move my f***ing legs. It's never going to get better. I'm never going to be able to bend my legs. So we talked about it. He was eventually able to walk again. Anybody, anybody could have done what we did with these guys. The simplicity of it is what I think makes it so special. We take all the complicated shenanet out of there. What do we need to help our athletes get better, accelerate faster with a 4-yard dash or the soccer field or the basketball court? If you teach them the basics that I'm going to cover, 99% of them will get faster. I'm going to do it. Unfortunately, I would like to apologize. I'm probably one of the main people who used the prowler wrong of f***ing many children during the early stages of the prowler. I'm not as many as I thought. I guess with that head coach, it's football coach. We've got to win the fourth quarter. We've got to be the most explosive, conditioned team in the fourth quarter. However, you get to know that's what they're challenged. They don't care if we dominate the first quarter because then we're out.
