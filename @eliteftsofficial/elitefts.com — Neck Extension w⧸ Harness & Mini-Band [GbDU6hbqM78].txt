our quads, Scott Hayes, leadupts.com, doing some neck flexion with the elite at the ass neck harness, set up with some mini bands. The benefit with our neck harness is one of the few neck harnesses has a chin strap, so when you're doing some lateral lateral flexion or front side flexion, it will actually stay on your head. So we have the mini band set up, Scott's going to go ahead and put it on. All the work about it now is the fact with the accommodating resistance of the bands, Scott's going to have some good posture and get it set up. And again, when he's at the most vulnerable position, it's going to be less resistance. As he goes through extension of the head, flexion, reflection, it's going to be more resistance. So again, we're working the same benefits for bands, but he had to other exercise, it's going to benefit him when he's doing neck.
