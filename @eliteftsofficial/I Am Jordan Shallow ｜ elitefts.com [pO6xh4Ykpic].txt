I'm Jordan Shallow, a columnist in coach for lead FTS. I was born in St. John's Newfoundland, which was like a small town in the East Coast of Canada. I grew up in Windsor, Ontario, which was like a great opposite to Troy, Michigan. I'm a strength-efficient coach, a chiropractor, power lifter. I just traveled around and he said, we can just kind of talk about the injury risk management and sports performance and how it applies to power lifters. How power lifters can apply to the rehab, how it re-help applies to sports performance and sort of just let's kind of the long and short of it. I always paid sports growing up, so I played hockey from the time I could walk, I could skate, just kind of like par for the course in Canada. Then it was always into like strength conditioning as an adjunct to like get better at my own sort of hockey career. One day training for hockey became the main goal and hockey sort of phase out and training kept going and it was like personal training at the time and it was like well how do I turn this into something I could do as a career and that led me down the route of like going to a chiropractor college. From there I got linked up into the power lifter community, one of my first patients was a pretty prominent power lifters in his day and green. So it was an Mountain View California, so he was kind of like how I learned the rope. So it's like car practical when I first started and then in return sort of learned power lifting that a very accelerated rate with him and the other lifters up boss barbell. That smile office was actually inside the gym. So I got to know a lot about power lifting really quickly and started competing soon after starting to work there and the rest is kind of history. I think if you look at Dave's Instagram, it's either as inboxers in Instagram. I've been messaging Dave in some capacity for six years maybe longer in like either on like through his like direct message on Instagram or through Facebook or through email. And I was actually I was out here with John Meadows and I'm just right like because I've been I guess that my head is always from the gym even when I was in class and one of the things that obviously one of the resources you find is elite and once you find elite like okay I'm just going to everything that comes out I'm just going to digest and digest and digest. So I've been on elite FTS for eating articles since Jesus since I could read and since I could give a shit about training. So once I kind of switch gears into car practical and into like my my graduate degree like I started just you know the superimposed my education with my training and it was actually like a really a calphate like okay the more I know the better my training becomes. So I would message Dave like once a year I just be like hey man like this is what I'm doing this sort of especially when I got into power lifting. I had some strengthening of dishening background and prior to going into school so I was like okay maybe this would be enough maybe this would be enough and you know in running my own business online even to the scale in which I have like free script operates which is nothing compared to this. More sympathetic I could not be to Dave's situation of trying to answer every email and DM especially from some kitties never heard of. So years go by and I ended up in here last year with John Meadows who I had just met from I don't know the fitness industry is I like an acceptable thing like I just knew him because like met him and he kind of saw what I was doing and you know social media kind of put me in front of John and we were talking and I flew out to pick her and to stay with John and we did some stuff for his YouTube channel and one of the things like hey do you want to go train at elite and do a video? Is he kidding me like that's like a dream come true and then it was supposed to be him and Dave and I was just kind of sitting here like stunned silence like lifting weights not being able to make words and then after that Dave started following me on social media and then realized that the guy he just started following had actually had messaged him prior so I guess he was to read it and he was like hey like are you serious? It's still serious about writing for elite and I'm like yeah absolutely now probably more than ever and he said okay like we have a few things that we're getting sort of sorted out and we'll send you a contract and I was like all right so he and then months go by and I think June ish that was February so June of this year I think I started writing my first call him so it was persistence I think and just kind of like no doesn't mean no no might mean not right now and then just kept pursuing kind of like more education and probably now I'm in a position or hopefully the stuff I write like I would have started writing five years ago it would have been like the arm bone connects to the elbow bone like I would have been nothing but now hopefully with like the experience I have in the education I have that the stuff I do write for elite is at the level that it should be and then at the level that I was used to when I was reading articles back in the day Oh god it's a plague I don't know okay so here's the Inchirer Practice College everyone is very bone first whereas like I approach in getting to the nervous system being nervous system first and nervous system doc is too long of a handle and so my different dating factor even from day jump in Chirer Practice College was like a muscle of first right we use the muscle as an intermediary to access the nervous system for most times it's it's too far removed to start with a bone in a lot of cases to my different dating factor is a chiropractor was the fact that I may be operated more like a physical therapist so it was I saw the writing on the wall I kind of know how the game was played it's like look I was an honestogram before I started the pursuit of my career but it's like okay if this is something that I want to do there's a breach here that that super seeds geographical bottleneck I want to be able to have more of an impact because I think some of the things I'm saying are a bit different especially in the field I mean so I just started I started the social media pursuit and oh she's I don't know maybe my last year of chiropractor college so before I graduated and I needed something that was informal because it wasn't graduated yet so doc is not necessarily a official title and then being a chiropractor kind of differentiated myself from the bone first model I just went with muscle and then it's been it's it's a blessing and a curse right like you'll be in the gym somewhere okay like in the muscle like no my driver's license does not say that but at the same time we kind of like okay that's that's pretty cool that through social media wherever I tend to land there's someone somewhere who like has read something that I put up it's like bless you for taking the time to actually read the stuff I mean you have to read the stuff I write like it's it's not easy sometimes it can be complicated so the muscle lock handle just came from that and then it was something as I pursued like as I transitioned into practicing graduated I was going to a change it I already had someone of like a following or whatever you want to call it so it just kind of stuck and it's kind of like a moniker and it's just like all right it is what it is let's just go with it I guess yeah so I mean essentially prescript.com started as a way to help the patients I was seeing in person you know like the the patients I was seeing based off of location I was that was pretty unique for someone in my situation who was a new graduate you know having one of the most renowned powerlifters in the world you know allow you to open up shop in his place is kind of like a like a big honor that you you you want to service that properly right so you want to make sure that you know you're working under a brand like a boss barbell that's been established through you know being the best so you wanted to make sure that you match that and you fit the location so when patients would leave my office like I don't want to see people a lot if I have to see people a lot they have an issue that either I'm not helping or they need to go see someone else who can help them so what I would do is record resources that were scalable to the strength athlete right so I would you know on my downtime I just graduated I didn't have like a ton of patients so I was sort of all into my new practice but he I went to school with Olympic Waylifter Crossfitter also a chiropractor we sort of started helping each other record these this communal library of of corrective exercises that would scale to the strength athlete right the last thing I wanted to do was patients leave my office with the same photocopy scans stick figure stretches at the last hundred people left with so you know we sort of started to make this like robust library of interventions everything from you know how to do a pull over to maybe help fix your thoracic spine to how to do an incline dumbbell curl so your elbows don't hurt in a low bar squat like these aren't things that most people would consider to be rehab exercises his most people maybe get a patient who's a power lift like once a year which I get was odd for me to get someone who wasn't a strength athlete or wasn't a professional athlete in some capacity so it's like you know the usual like hey here's a band here we're going to strengthen your rotator cuff doesn't fly for a guy that benches over five right like here we're going to do like you know clam shell so the band it's like dice squats over 900 pounds like you're going to have to find interventions that scale so basically just started like to minimize the amount of time I spent with people in my office that was just more okay what's the dysfunction where is the lack of range of motion where is the instability how can we fix this and how can we send them out with a plant so it just started in my office and then through social media people started to reach out and was like hey I have this like look look I can't see you in person but here's like a very broad spectrum approach given like the depth and complexities and difficulties in the skill set of all these exercises we have here's like a four week progression and then all of a sudden you realize like well that catches a lot of dysfunction so we started to systematize programs around reinstating function at the shoulder hip and spine from there graduated on to like you know we would send out these programs and you know people like all of like I can I can I can bench rest after years not being able to bench rest I still have a bit of shoulder plane and then like okay well send me your program so we start to examine full scale exercise programming and you're like well here's your problem like you know corrective exercises not and I'm an air-cool corrective exercise for what it's worth it's not the end game right execution and fatigue management so like how do you actually perform the main lifts and how do you program these main lifts into into a mesocycle like into a block into a year of training are you managing your fatigue appropriately because you can do all the corrective stuff in the world if you know you can't out corrective exercise bad exercise from there that started to evolve like look we need to take the wheel from start to finish so we need to create the movement preparation strategies that in state proper function at shoulder hip and spine and super impose those over progressions that makes sense when it comes to fatigue management and programming so then we just took over the full experience and then from the time you walk into the gym to the time you leave relative percentages help us customize to the individual for progressive overloads in particular compound movements and then we use variants like rest periods and tempo reps and sets to help dictate weights for accessory and supplemental movements all with like every exercise has an action that we're trying to train a particular muscle improvement but we're also trying to reinstate function with some of the accessory and supplemental that allow us to continually make progress in whether it's powerlifting whether it's body build a lot bodybuilding style training or body composition or whether it's Olympic weight lifting so those are kind of given the skill sets from a training standpoint of me and my friend Jordan Juntah the co-founder within being coming from an Olympic weight lifting background and being one of the top Olympic weight lifting in the country we program for all three of those from start to finish to and again all we're saying is this is hopefully going to minimize the risk of injury injury prevention is like I think that's a bit of a fallacy I don't think that actually exists so we take this sort of cerebral approach around our programming to minimize the risk of injury it's interesting I asked Dave this question like two days ago and he told me really like he told me really interesting anecdote that's sort of like it stuck with me and I thought I thought it over the last couple of days he said like like it seemed basically means when you're in the when you're in the casket what effect do you have and like the people like you kind of leave who is he walks you through this very like visual just those hypothetical scene of like he's like look I'm dead in the box I don't know okay and he's like there's a people at the front row those are the people you care about so those are the people that matter when it comes to legacy right and then there's people in the back who are wondering how long you have to stay there for just to sort of do your social crisis and when he listened to Anna I've never thought that Dave was ever wrong and tell them because I think like what Dave doesn't realize is that the people at the back when like you know we're all gonna go but in that situation like the people at the back will have been just as impacted by Dave as the people at the front and I think that was something that like the first time I ever probably disagreed with him and reading all the stuff throughout all the years I was like fuck like this guy gets it this guy gets it or holy shit like more often than not I was like oh my god I never looked at it that way I totally agree but when he said that I was like too I think and I never told him so if you watch his it like Dave I think it wrong so I think people in the back of the room are gonna especially with the reach that elites had I think are gonna be as equally affected by that by his legacy as the people close to him so to be able to just reach more people and have the industry and have have it be different than when I came like when I came into the fitness industry or rehab or snaking and just anywhere whatever like change a paradigm like leave your mark as far as like okay people now look at it this way because of you because I I look at training differently because you know I started reading like Charles Paulicman was a big influence of mine in the early days and then obviously Dave and then going around and seeking out like these like these oracle resources that were just like everything they put out was just so different but so pragmatic so I think like being able to just be in the conversation of like if you're gonna make a round mouth rush more of people that really like push the envelope when it comes to thinking about strength condition when it comes to thinking about powerlifting or rehab like leaving your mark and making it different like there's a shift in paradigm from when you started from when you left
