Steve Colt's got here with Dave Tape. We're doing more U.S.P. answer and our question here. It's actually two questions from the same guy. We're going to merge it together from Brace Lewis, thank you, Bryce. Bryce asked us, well the first one is, what type of changes does an experience lift your need to make in programming? It's good to great terms of, combined total in general. And then his follow-up is the same question to go, how do you, what do you need to do to go from a 600 plus water to a 700-pound swatter? So to make that quantum leap, what type of things have you done or people that you've trained with or trained, what have they done to make that jump? Well you're using my my scale of shit, suck, good great, you know, so to go from shit to suck, it's a big step because that means you got to actually commit to something which most people have at or are not able to do then I really able to go all the way in to these might mess around a little bit, to go from suck to good, that's another big flight of steps because now you got to be consistent, you got to be dedicated to what you're doing, you need to train hard, you need to train intelligently, it can't be hobby, it has to be something that you are very serious about, to go from good to great, it's only one step, you know, what it's that one step, nobody wants to take, you know, it's being sacrificed or making the sacrifice when all your buddies are going out on Friday night but you got to train on Saturday morning, you got to be able to say no, I got to train the next day and more, many, many, many, many, many small steps like that to term and going from good to great, you know, it's making all those small sacrifices that everybody else isn't willing to make because they just to file, well I can go do this and it's still okay, so to answer that question, it's not really a programming answer, it's an answer of discipline sacrifice and what are you willing to actually do to go to that next step. Very, very, programming wise, you know, if you're already good, you've already kind of figured it out, you know, once you are at that level to where your commitment is that you're going to accept no other option but to be great, well then you will be that because you're not going to accept anything else other than that, when you are there at that level in whatever it is, you know, usually I'll define that as being in the top 20% of whatever you're doing, then it becomes more of what I think he's actually asking me, what things need to be done if you're an elite lifter if you want to become even better, you know, has that elite lifter and typically a lot of that falls back to a lot of the same things that need to be focused on as a beginner, the technique has to constantly be dead on, the one thing that you'll see within a lead or a pro lifter is if you watch their technique the only time it will ever break down is if the weights to have it that forces them out of the groove, if you watch him in the warm up room, every, every single repetition looks the same over and over and over and over and when I'm looking at videos of our lifters when they want me to analyze it, usually they're going to send me their last three or lifts, the first thing I look at is the consistency, you know, our all three lifts do they all look exactly the same and if they don't, which one looks the best and then you look at that and then you compare what went wrong and those are there too. So techniques can be a huge factor there, the other factor from the training and it falls a little bit back down to the original statement is there's a lot of things that you can do if it's nutritionally, if it's you know just basic conditioning, your GPP that mainly add a half per set or 1% but all those little percent add up so you need to look at all those things that could make you a better lifter and then you need to do them and that's pretty much it, you know and that's, that's not saying that you're going to be the best of the best because too many other factors fall into there such as genetics and other things but it will make you the best you can possibly be and probably better than you ever thought you could be. So the program you doesn't change but you get more from the program you might put it more into it with those other aspects. If the program and does change it's going to change because you know what needs to change, there becomes a point in time with every advanced lifter and probably every advanced athlete as far as that goes to where they they basically almost they have mastered how to train themselves so they'll know through their own training at what point they need to back it down at what point can they drive harder so if the program says they need to do 85% for a triple and their warming up and they know this is a day they could probably push you a little bit more they know to push you a little bit more if the warming up and they know it's not there they know to back it down so they become more in sync and more in tune I call it auto regulated you know with their training are audible ready they know how to make those calls during their training while they're training from set to set from rep you know rep to rep set to set session to session so the program I mean isn't so much now I'm doing block training or now I'm doing west side training and this is now I'm doing Dave training you know which is modeled after whatever you know theory or you're using but you figured out how to train yourself that's a big part of what that lead this as well at the same time those are the people who no longer fall for every new training method that comes around because they already know what they need to do and how they need to do it now they look at the other training methods and the other programs for ideas to help fill those foods but that all falls in there and it's something that I don't believe it's a teachable thing you know it's you can teach them different methods and programming but that's something that they just hit a certain point in time and then they know and I remember speaking to Jeremy for a year's ago you know and talking about this very subject and he said they just came every time where you knew you know this is what I need to do this is how I need to do it and it locked in and everything took off from there so it's the magic moment I suppose I was to define it okay thanks for the question boys
