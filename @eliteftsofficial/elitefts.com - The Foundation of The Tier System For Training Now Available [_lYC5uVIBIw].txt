We've got to be the most explosive, conditioned team in the fourth quarter. However, you've kept there, that's what they're telling. They don't care if we dominate the first quarter, because then we're asking them to hang on. Dude, you don't f**k understand, like, I can't move my f**king legs. It's never going to get me wrong. I'm not going to be wrong. I'm not going to be wrong. I'm not going to be wrong. I'm not going to be wrong. I'm not going to be wrong. I'm not going to f**k legs. It's never going to get better. I'm never going to be able to bend my legs. So, we talked about it. He was eventually able to walk again. Anybody, anybody could have done what we did with these guys.
