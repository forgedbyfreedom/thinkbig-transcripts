SmartWars for workoutts.com. I'm at Shilton, Strays and Performance in Newark, Ohio with older Nick Sheldon. We're in a demonstrate three different glutean variations that can overload the eccentric portion of the lift. If you're not in that, that's fine. But this is something you can do as you get some more eccentric load. So the first we're going to do is, because basically, we're going to go ahead and change the center ground. He ends up both the head. Going to come down and essentially, all we're going to do is, because he doesn't just drop up. Okay. Second variation should be with the midball if you want to add extra load. We're using CDPTX midball. Going to come down and say, then, have an on chest as it comes down, drop the ball. Come on up. Right? You're going to do another one more professional pace. Come on down. So you can get some bottom problem. Come up that. Third and final variation. Same thing with the midball. Going to go ahead and change the center ground. Then, come all the way down. Go to the chest. Come on. One more time. Come down. Put in. Try to set. Push this tilt. It was a three way should go over of the eccentric version. The eccentric contraction of the coherent pace.
