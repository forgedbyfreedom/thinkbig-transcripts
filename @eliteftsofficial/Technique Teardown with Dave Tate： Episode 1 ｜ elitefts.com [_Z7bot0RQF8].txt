We are going to do video reviews of lifts and I've never done this before on camera so don't take my reactions personally. There are going to be like this stupid shot things that you see what are they called. Reaction videos. It's going to kind of be like that because when I see things that are a little f***ed up, even if it's a little f***ed up, there's a lot of f***ed up to me. No, it's probably shouldn't say f*** up. We can be too like anyhow. We're off to a stellar start and I haven't even looked at anything yet. So we solicitated these videos from Instagram so I don't know how we're going to continue to pull the videos in the future but we'll let you guys know without further ado. Here we go. Welcome to Tag Meat Tired Out. Yeah, so the first thing I'm looking at here is to make sure it's kind of hard because the monoliths in the way. Make sure that the grip is even so I have to kind of assume that it is for now. And make sure the feeder even, it can be the camera angle but it does not look like the feet are even. So that can be okay as long as the bar when it comes out, you see the bar twist just a little bit. It's obviously not option optimal but it can be okay because the body can shift because of that. Generally it's not what I want to see to begin with. And so those are the markers that I have to look at before this even starts. I can't tell if these are priests or not at this point in time. So we go. Oh fuck. He's doing it. I don't know if I can one wasn't bad enough. Before the descent even starts, you can see the instability. And it's coming from here, mostly hit flexors and it can be torso as to see but for now you can just see right there the shaky and it's going on while subtle it compounds itself as it goes down. So a lot of things going on here. That's where there shifts, come and see how it shifts to the side here. How do I do that boom thing there? There we go. I have no idea what I'm doing. So here you see that shifting kind of going this way. There's more strain being put on this leg. So there's a lot of things that are happening after the descent, which are all stemming from the stance not being even and the tightness not being where it needs to be in the hips and the abs. That can all actually be coming from the fact that the stance is not even. So it's easy to go through and say okay, and pinpoint all the other issues. Say all right this is shifting out to the right. It looks like there's more stress being put on this leg as they come up. These aren't stable. Everything's kind of shifting and moving around. So it's easy for somebody to say okay and he's starting to stall here. There and that's upper back where it's starting to buckle in on him. So it's my point is a lot of people look at this and say well you know what is quadruped or weak is upper back needs to be brought up because all that is being shown and displayed after the first second rep and just kind of compounds from there. And I don't think it's worth even looking at any of those things at this point in time until the setup is corrected. And the tightness is corrected. So what I would advise him to do is to work on all this here to make sure maybe even pull the belt up just a little bit higher to give him better feedback on trying to push the belt out all the way around. Yeah, I know. Even into the back. You know, so it's not just here which a lot of people will try to do and he's actually doing that. Because you'll see when he breathes and pushes out there. And he keeps the tight. But I keep falling back on his stance. The stance has to be corrected and then after that, see what happens from there because everything just it's like a ripple effect. Everything falls apart from there. So we'll go on to the next one. Sores are not pinned down. And they're up. This isn't bad. You know, I can't tell. And there's limitations when you're looking at one video is you can't really see everything because you're only going to get one angle. And if you had to angle from if it was as if it was on Instagram, I could go dig back through. Some of his older videos to kind of see. But his legs look tight. They may not be where it looks tight. Actually looks like he may be driving his legs into the bench, which is even better. All this is tight with the area that is here. If you watch through here. As he sets up, you'll see that he's set up on his shoulders, but he doesn't have his shoulders down and in. He can get this set up a little bit lower compared to where he is, which is going to increase that basis support and keep the weight over the lats instead of keeping the weight over the rear delts. So here's where you're going to watch. See it all. Then what he did have set up. I like this reverse grip thing because it allows you to get your shoulders in a better position, but he didn't do it. So that reverse grip allows you to pin your shoulders back. Fucking mouse. Getting pumped around. But here's where we want that tension to be. And boom, it's all lost. He gets a little bit of it back before he goes down, but it's like too little too late. So that would be that one. All right, what I'm what I think I'm seeing here, but I can't tell because every time I click back it goes to the other video is he's pressing it out. Instead of pulling the bar out there. See how the bar goes back. When he brings it out, got to him it. All right, so boom, it goes back. And that again, like the previous one, takes the tension out of the lats. This is pain in the ass. So fucking thing. That is where he wants the tension and it's all here. So again, that's he's got to pull the bar out. Instead of press it out. And then we'll lock all this in here. Lagerive is good or tightness is good. That's like my, I'll say the old gym. I can't from the mud. Does that on my hands? Just like a tree. This route's right, stand. Oh, I've been running from the lats.
