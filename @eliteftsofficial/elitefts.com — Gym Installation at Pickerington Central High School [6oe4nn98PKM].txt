Hey guys, Matt Goodwin, leadFTS.com, quitment sales. Good friend of mine, who is a coach at Pécoranton Central. They finally call a bandit and say, you know, our weight room is a mess. You come out, take a look at it, give us a chance. I took a lot of pride in this being that I am a graduate of Pécoranton Central High School. So this metal art made, this was the room where I fell in love with weight training. This is the room I spent my whole junior senior year in the gym. Of course, doing the high school, being a singer in the league is a week. The gym pretty much looked as active as he did, 20 years ago when I was there. The benefit of our equipment is we have something to say to the budget. We have everything for the ESRES line, all that you're saying to join. So whenever budget you're working with, we can accommodate them. This is what we do. Bye-bye-bye.
