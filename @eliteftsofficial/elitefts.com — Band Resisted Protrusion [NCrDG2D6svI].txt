Mark Watt Scott Hayes, leadupts.com. Now we're going to work on just protrusion, just basically bringing the chin and forehead forward together, which is really important, especially pro-properceptively on any kind of, in kind of contact sport. So Scott's just going to go ahead, bring his chin and his chin and his forehead straight up. As high as can, lead with that chin. The good thing about this setup, using leadupts pro bands on the J-Hope's exact, you can have the same setup for an entire team. And pretty, there's not a lot of discrepancy between athletes. So now it's the setup that way if you want to adjust resistance, we can go ahead and move the J-Hope's upper down. And obviously, you're going to just buy the band tension as well. So again, this is just, make sure that the band's on the forehead, push the chin and the forehead straight up, hold that to the concentric. I'll hold it, I symmetrically at the top, and then get full range motion. Same principle with the bands, it's going to be more resistance toward the top of the movement than at the bottom, whereas next is an opponent position.
