To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided. Make sure your knees are slightly bent and not long. Next, lean over while keeping the natural alignment of your back and grasp the handles. With your upper arms extended, pull back until your torso is at a 90 degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should feel a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the weight in front of you. This is the starting position. While keeping your torso stationary, pull the handles back toward your torso while keeping your arms close to your body. Pull the handles to your abdominals and make sure to breathe out as you perform the movement. At this point, you should be squeezing your shoulder blades back. Hold the contraction for a second and slowly bring the handles back to the original position while breathing in.
