Stand direct with the dumbbell in each hand and the palms of your hands facing your torso. Your arms should be extended to the sides. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and raise the dumbbells as high as possible by elevating the shoulders. Your arms should remain extended at all times and you'll need to refrain from using your biceps to help lift the dumbbells. Only your shoulders should move up and down. Pull the top contracted position, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
