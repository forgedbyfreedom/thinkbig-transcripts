Back the bar across the back of your shoulders holding it with both hands. Arch your back and keep your chest and head up. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and step forward about two feet with your right leg. Your left foot should remain stationary as you lower your upper body down. Focus on maintaining your balance and keep your torso upright as you lower your hips. Make sure to keep your knee from bending forward past your toes as you come down. Now using mainly the heel of your foot, exhale and push upward, returning slowly to the starting position.
