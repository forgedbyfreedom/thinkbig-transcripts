I've spent my life in pursuit of the perfect program in the gym, in the lab, moving weight, making adjustments, training clients and changing lives. It's what I do. It's what I know best. I am my own subject. My body is my brain's greatest work. The gym is my testing ground, I inflict trauma and tear tissue. I practice the science of cold iron and calculated change. Every rep is a road to growth. I hit the books as hard as I hit the weights. I make research a reality in turn studies into results. I measure mixed nutrients, to maximize recovery. I swap exercises and alter variables. I target as results. I chase the perfect program, the ultimate combination of mind and muscle.
