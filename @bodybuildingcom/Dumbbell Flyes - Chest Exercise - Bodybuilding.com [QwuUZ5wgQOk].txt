Slide down on a flat bench with a dumbbell and each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position. Now with the slight bending of your elbows, breathe in and lower your arms out of both sides and a wide arc until you feel stretch in your chest. Then return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Focus on using the same movement arc when both lowering and raising the weights. Pause for a moment at the top and try to position before repeating.
