All right, welcome to Project Mass, Mesocycle 2. Essentially, we just got off the taper week, so you're fresh and rested, so you're getting ready to switch it up. We're about to start some new training variables. You got to try some giant sets. It's still be some blood flow restriction, some intercess stretching. So a lot of great things are about to happen, and high-perch if you're really about to start. Yeah, and the key thing, guys, is you're rested. And as you remember, during this week, one of face 2, you're going to start off really heavy and teach your muscles to actually recruit those large muscle fibers so that in week 2, you do traditional hypertrophy. And week 3, we put together a program that's going to essentially disterry you off. And again, you're going to feel like you can't make it, but hey, that's why we got another taper for you.
