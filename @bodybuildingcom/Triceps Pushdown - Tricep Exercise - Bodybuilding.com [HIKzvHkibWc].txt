Attach a straight or angled bar to a high pulley and grab the bar with an overhand grip as shoulder width. You'll want to be standing upright with a very small forward lean. Your upper arm should be close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. Your forearm should be pointed towards the pulley as they hold the bar. This is your starting position. Now using your triceps, exhale and bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and your arms are fully extended. Your upper arm should always remain stationary while your forearm's move. After holding for a brief pause in the contracted position, inhale and slowly bring the bar back down to the starting position.
