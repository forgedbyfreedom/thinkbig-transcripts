Start by gripping a barbell with the palms of your hands facing down. Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward. While keeping your back straight, bend at the waist until it's almost parallel to the floor. Keep your head up as well. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms will be hanging perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. Now while keeping your torso stationary breathe out and lift the barbell toward you, keep your elbows close to your body and only use your forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause. Bend in tail and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.
