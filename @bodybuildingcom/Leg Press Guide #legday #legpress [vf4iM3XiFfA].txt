Legbris is one of the best exercises to build your lower body, but you need to know how various foot positions target the different muscles of your legs. Number one, low foot position. This is a great way to emphasize your parts in the legbris. When you place your feet lower on the back, there is a higher degree of knee pain. When your hamstrings are almost touching your calves in the bottom position. This is what leads to the maximum brother situation. Next, high foot position. This is the best way to target your boots in the legbris. When you place the feet higher on the back, you'll notice that the degree of hip pain is more than the knee pain in the bottom position. It results in the most tension being placed on the boots instead of the quads. Lastly, wide foot position. This can be a great way to bias your adactors in the movement. A wider foot stance with the toes pointing outwards allows you to easily co-deeper in the end range of motion. This is where the adactors are the most active out of all the other muscles. Keep these dry and you'll feel the difference right away.
