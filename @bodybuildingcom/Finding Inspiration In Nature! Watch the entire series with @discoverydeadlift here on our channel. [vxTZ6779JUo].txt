There are a few feelings as good as hitting a big deadlift. I've hit big deadlifts in the gym and they felt great, but I've hit big deadlifts in the middle of nowhere and they felt even better. I'm a guy that deadlifts in the middle of nowhere to combat his anxiety. All of your failures, all of those things that you think you're not doing good enough at, and trying to create this darkness or the shit. When I'm approaching the bar to pull a deadlift, I'm not thinking about those things. Set your seat, only wait, rip this shit. I think a lot of people are just like, what the hell is this? What does this have to do with anything other than this dude just wants to get a whic on a post or something?
