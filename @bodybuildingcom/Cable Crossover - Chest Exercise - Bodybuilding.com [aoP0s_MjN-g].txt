To get in the starting position, raise the pulleys to a setting above your head. Next, select the resistance you like to use. Then while holding a pulley in each hand, step forward in front of an imaginary straight line between both pulleys while pulling your arms together in front of you. Your torso should have a small forward bend from the waist. This will be your starting position. Now with the slight bend in your elbows, breathe in and extend your arms straight out to the sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Then using your chest, bring your arms back to the starting position as you breathe out. Make sure you use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. Hold for a second at the starting position, then repeat the movement for the prescribed number of repetitions.
