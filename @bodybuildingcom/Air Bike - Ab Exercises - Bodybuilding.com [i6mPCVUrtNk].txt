Life out on the ground with your lower back pressed against the ground. You'll want to put your hands beside your head, but be cautious not to strain your neck while performing the exercise. Lift your shoulders into the crunch position and bring your knees up so they are perpendicular to the floor while your legs are parallel to it. This will be your starting position. Now go through a cycle pedal motion by simultaneously kicking forward with your railing and bringing the knee of your left leg toward you. Exhale and bring your right elbow close to your left knee by crunching to the side. Then inhale and return slowly back to the starting position.
