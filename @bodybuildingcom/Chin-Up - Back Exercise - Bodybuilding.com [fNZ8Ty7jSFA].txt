Grab the pull-up bar with the palms of your hands facing your torso and a grip closer than shoulder width. Next with both arms extended in front of you holding the bar, bring your torso back about 30 degrees while creating a curvature in your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Now exhale and pull your torso upward until the bar nearly touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and upper arms down and back. This is in trade on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position and keep the elbows close to your body. Your upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only your arms should move. Your forearm should do no work other than hold the bar. After a second in the contracted position, while breathing in, slowly lower your torso back to the starting position where your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.
