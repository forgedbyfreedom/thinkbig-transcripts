Power body belt, what is it? I developed this by putting together power and the physique of a body belt. In the old days, they used to do a power lifting meat one day and the next day of those guys would have to show their physique. So that means these guys were strong but looked good. And in today's day and age, I don't see it. I still want to be that superhero. I don't want to be just show and no go. So I developed power body belt. You know, it's something where I can continuously, as strong as I am, but as developed as a body belter. I'm here. You focus hardcore on a power movement. Just keep that strength up. Then afterwards only two exercises. That's it for your body belt. You just do it once a week. You're only training that body heart at one time for you humans. I would say do it for 12 weeks all. I do it year round, but I just want you to try it for 12 weeks. And trust me. You give this a couple of months. You can see such a change. First of all, you're going to put on so much more size than just body belt. And you're going to get a better physique than the power of this. Combined with two worlds, it's a superhero. Kind of sounds fun, doesn't it? I hope you're excited. I got to go train. You've got to put that alter ego on now. And slam some weights. Let's do this. We're going to go train with Michael here right now. Yeah.
