We've got a great show lined up for you here today. I feel absolutely amazing coming into this I wanted to make history and I did. This is a historical event and I wanted to win this Olympia more than any Olympia ever. I wanted to make history and I wanted to win this Olympia. First of all I want to thank you guys, my fans who are crazy. You make me do my best. Absolutely a lot more pressure I think this year. But I perform all in a pressure so it just pushed me. I really love the sport and I hope I can continue to be a good ambassador for it. Thank you guys. Thank you guys. We have to get through this because I experienced losing my mom and she did my crab. I've been working with the few other pot holes. We all as individuals would like to be a service resource and be loved. And those three things my fans gave it to me. I look for the Lord to leave me and motivate me and teach me and give me all the spirits that I need. All the little pot holes that I run into. I just pray and leave me the hands of the Lord so every time that I come out to the stage. It's a gift and it's honor. It's a privilege and my fans. I love you to death. Thank you. I love you. Really, I would never ever get to meet so many positive people about people who want to change their outcome in health and fitness. The reason why you guys are here is because you want these three things. You want to look good. You want to feel great and you want to have hope that you can do it again throughout life's obstacles through I've said versity. So I'm just very, very thankful for each and every one of you guys that stuck around not just for me but for bodybuilding for the world of health and fitness for what Joe we'd or stood for and what it still stands for today. So thank you guys for coming out. Good night. Thank you. Thank you.
