My name is Chris Gettin and I am here to help you achieve the body of your dreams. I lost about 35 pounds during the whole transformation. He's kind of like I said, no nonsense, no frills, you have a goal, you stick to it and that's pretty much it, you don't mind I'm complain. You see, I know what it's like to be trapped inside an unhealthy body. My severely injured my back, I was depressed, my asthma, my back was getting worse and I sunk to a personal low. It was this low point, was my transformation trigger to change my habits for good. But I didn't do it overnight and I didn't do it alone and you don't have to either. Workout plans, nutrition advice, motivation and supplementation, you'll get it all right here. If you have somebody like Chris behind you and knows what he's talking about, or just lose weight, look better, feel better, you're just going to change your life. So what's unique about this program? I'll be doing it right alongside with you. I'm going to be there with you every step of the day in the gym and on the non training days and you order info that you need to have a successful transformation and be a winner at the end.
