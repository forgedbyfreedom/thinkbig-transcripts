My name is Isira Vargas and I am a bodybuilding.com master coach. I am an NASM CPT, a pre-postnatal certified coach and a pain-free performance specialist. I really feel like fitness chose me. I wanted to help people in need and so I joined different nonprofit organizations to help areas that were affected by natural disasters. The work was very rewarding, it was also very physical. Coming back home, missing being active every day, I started taking classes all around New York City and was surrounded by coaches who inspired me to look into becoming a coach as a career. Movement makes me feel empowered. It allows me to be the best version of myself around the people that I love the most. Welcome to bodybuilding.com. Build your body, build your mind, build your life.
