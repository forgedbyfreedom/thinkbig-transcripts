Lye back on an inclined bench. Grasp the bar with a medium width grip. Lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and slowly lower the bar until it nearly touches your upper chest. Hold for a brief pause then exhale and press the bar back to the starting position by contracting your chest muscles. Ideally it should take twice as long to lower the weight than to raise it.
