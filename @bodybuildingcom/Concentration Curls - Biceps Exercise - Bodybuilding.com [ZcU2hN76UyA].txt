Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you. Use your right arm to grasp the dumbbell with an underhand grip. Place the back of your right arm against your inner right thigh. Your arm should be extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position. Now while holding your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the weight upward while concentrating on the biceps. Continue to raise the weight until your bicep is fully contracted and the dumbbell is as shoulder level. Hold the top contracted position for a moment. Then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position. To maximize the benefit of this exercise, avoid swinging the weight at any time.
