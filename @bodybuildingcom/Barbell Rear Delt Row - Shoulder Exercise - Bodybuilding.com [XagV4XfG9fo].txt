Stand up straight while holding a barbell with a wide overhand grip. Bend your knees slightly and bend over as you keep a natural arch in your back. Let your arms hang in front of you as you hold the bar. Once your torso is parallel to the floor, flare your elbows out and away from your body. This will be your starting position. Now while keeping your upper arms perpendicular to your torso, exhale and pull the bar up towards your upper chest while squeezing your rear delts. Focus on using your rear delts when performing the exercise. Finally inhale and slowly return back to the starting position.
