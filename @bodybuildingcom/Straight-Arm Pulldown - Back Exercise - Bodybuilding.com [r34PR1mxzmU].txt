Start by grabbing the bar from the top pulley and stepping backwards a few feet. Next, bend your torso forward about 30 degrees at the waist. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you with a slight bend in your elbows. If your arms are not fully extended then you need to step backwards until they are. Once your arms are fully extended and your torso has slightly bent at the waist, tighten your lats and you'll be ready to begin. Now keeping your arms straight, breathe out and pull the bar down by contracting the lats until your hands are next to the side of your thighs. Then while still keeping your arms straight, return back to the starting position while opening this entry, just like an일 a seah ihrinーム side of your leg. A corner of your head stitch must stay between your floor and floor.
