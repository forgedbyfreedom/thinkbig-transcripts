We're holding a dumbbell in each hand, sit on a military bench press or a utility bench that has a back support. Place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs. Now raise the dumbbells to shoulder height and one at a time using your thighs to help propel them up into the position. Make sure to rotate your wrists so the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is your starting position. Now exhale and push the dumbbells upward until they touch at the top. Then after a brief pause at the top contractive position, slowly lower the weight back down to the starting position while inhaling.
