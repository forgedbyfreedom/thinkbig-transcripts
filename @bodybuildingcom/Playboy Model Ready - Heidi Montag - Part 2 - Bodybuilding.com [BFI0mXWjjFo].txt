Okay on Chad Waterbury here showing you a couple pieces out of the Heidi Montag workout and when I train Heidi or when I train any athlete I like to focus on full body explosive exercises and one way I really make sure the people are doing it right is that given exercises that can't do slowly and two of my favorites are the swing the kettlebell swing and then a medicine ball slam so Heidi's going to demonstrate here so we're going to start off with the kettlebell swing to stand with a slightly wider shoulder width stance. You'll push your hips back and squat down keep your abs tight bend your knees, grab the kettlebell pull the kettlebell back start the swing so when she comes up she's locking her hips out squeezing her glutes as hard as she can at the top one more and drop it good now she's going to go to the medicine ball you're going to hold it up overhead and with as much force she can slam it to the ground it's going to grab it do it again good three and two more and one excellent excellent so those two exercises together makes for a great combination to work every muscle group in the body you can do it slowly and it'll really help reshape your body so for the Heidi Montag workout I like to combine two or more exercises together full body exercises with minimal rest in between so we're going to demonstrate one of my favorite combinations which is the dead lip of the kettlebell and a squat for us with the medicine ball so Heidi's going to start off here to stand with slightly wider than shoulder width stance she's going to squat down through the kettlebell go ahead squat down keep your abs tight keep good posture back flat she's going to do five reps it's fast as she can so go ahead to Heidi squeeze the glutes hard at the top it's really helps develop the butt muscles great exercise to make the lower back strong I'm sure most of you are familiar with this which will do one more rep and then she'll sprint down and get the ball this is about a 15 pound medicine ball you can use kind of 15 pounds to set it right here it's a piece of jumper feedback stand up press it overhead this is a squat for us with an overhead press works every muscle group in your body and you can make this even more challenging by jumping up in the air at the top so Heidi's last two reps she'll jump up in the air good one more excellent so you can do about five to ten reps of each exercise do that four or five times and then rest about a minute and repeat and you will burn a lot of fat and reshape your body thanks for joining us at the beach in Malibu we you found that it's exactly how Heidi prepared for a playboy cover shoot how she got prepared for the Miss Universe and for the new season of the hills remember you can get more in-depth exercise and tips on HeidiMonthagworkout.com so until next time we'll see you again
