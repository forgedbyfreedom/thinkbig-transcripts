Hi, I'm Erin Stern with Team Diamond Type. We're here in Dallas, Texas and have Octagon in the major doing a photo shoot and training film. I've got in the bodybuilding after I missed feeling the call of my standard in the high job by 3 centimeters. I wanted to be at an elite level and I figured I could do it just in the high job. So I entered a bigger competition in the one and the one in the next one and I got my profile. The Arnold's, it was my second time there. It's always a great experience. I train for every show to win, but realistically I wanted to be top five and I can check it, which is great for a pro-gloaner for something here to do. I'm happy that I know what improvement we can make in back to the ground. Protein is so important. I can't stress that enough. A lot of the girls will eat yogurt, maybe they'll do a salad, a handful of almonds. It's not going to cut it. You need protein to stay CCA, so you're not hungry all the time and you need protein before you work out after you work out to help maintain that lean mass. The Olympia is coming up in September. It will be my second one. Training a little bit heavier on legs and you've had some sides from the quads and work on the back a little bit. Those will be better that. So I'm going to do everything that I can possibly do to win and of course it's in the hands of the judges. I don't want to give them a reason to give me seconds.
