Sit on a military press bench. Your grip should be wider than shoulder width. Once you've picked up the barbell, lift the bar overhead with your arm straight. Hold the bar slightly in front of your head. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and slowly lower the bar down to shoulder height. Then exhale and press the bar back up to the starting position.
