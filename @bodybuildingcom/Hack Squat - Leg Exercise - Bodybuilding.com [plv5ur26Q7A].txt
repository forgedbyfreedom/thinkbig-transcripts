Place the back of your torso against the back pad of the machine and hook your shoulders under the shoulder pads provided. Position your legs on the platform using a shoulder width medium stance with your toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up and back on the pad at all times. Place your hands on the side handles of the machine and disengage the safety bars. Then straighten your legs without locking the knees. This will be your starting position. Inhale and begin to slowly lower the weight down by bending at the knees. Maintain a straight posture with your head up and back on the pad at all times. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and calves is slightly less than 90 degrees. Now exhale and slowly raise the weight by pushing the floor with the heels of your feet as you straighten your legs and return to the starting position.
