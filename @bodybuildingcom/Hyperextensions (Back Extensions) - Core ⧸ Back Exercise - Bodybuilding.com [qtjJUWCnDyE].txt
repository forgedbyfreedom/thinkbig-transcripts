Life face down on a hyper extension bench, tucking your ankles securely under the footpaths. Adjust the upper pad to allow you to bend at the waist without any restriction. With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you. You can hold a weight plate for extra resistance if needed. This will be your starting position. Now start bending forward slowly at the hips as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without rounding your back. Then slowly raise your torso back to the starting position.
