Start by standing in front of a loaded barbell. While holding the barbell is straight as possible, bend your knees as you sit back with your hips. Grass the bar using a medium overhand grip. This will be your starting position. Now begin the lift by pushing with your heels as you extend your hips and knees as you breathe out. As you approach the standing position, pull your shoulder blades together and drive your hips through the bar. Then slowly return to the starting position by bending your knees and hips and leaning forward at the waist. Keep your back straight and breathe in as you execute this portion of the movement. When the weights on the bar touch the floor, you are back in the starting position and ready to perform another repetition.
