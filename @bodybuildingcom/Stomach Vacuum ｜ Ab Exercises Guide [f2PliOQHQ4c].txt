Stand up straight with your feet shoulder with a part from each other. This will be your starting position. Now slowly inhale as much air as possible. Then exhale bringing your stomach in as far as you can. Hold this position and try to visualize your navel touching your backbone. One contraction is around 20 seconds. During a 20 second hold, try to breathe normally then bring your stomach back to the starting position. Once you've practiced this exercise, you can work your way up to 40 and 60 second contractions.
