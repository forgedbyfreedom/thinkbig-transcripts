Music Ten minutes. Ten minutes. Ten minutes. Ten minutes. Was that too much for you? My card yet. Music I'm going to attempt to do these tight jeans on. Oh, that. By an off-law. Caw tight. So you visualize sucking your belly button and just spline a kick of like that. Heels on off-law. That side. That side. Six either side. Then lift up to here. Same thing. Six either side. And then the third level is legs straight. Same thing. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Chosen. Chosen. Okay. I'll sit. Right down if you can. Good. Good tight. That's just activating the muscles in your lower back loose and everything off. Next one is for the hamstrings. I'm going to do it like a regular hamstring stretch. I got them walk out on your hands. Keep legs straight. And then just ankle walk in like this. And then walk out again. Push, push, push. Good. Walk with your hands again. Your hands down. Keep your legs straight. Walk out of your hands like your body stretch out. Keep your legs straight now. Just walk without an ankle. That's it. That's it. Just keep going. It's close to your hands. You can get push a little bit. Good. Go again. You do it like a regular four with lines like that. Which is going to rip my jeans if I do it. So I'm not going to do it. So line it forward. I'll sit. I'll just elbow inside here. And then in such stretching the glutes, keep that leg straight like that. And pull one hand, do the side of that foot. Now sit. Straighten this leg up and keep the other one straight. Come up on your toes. Feel that I'm straight. Then lunge forward on that one. Down. Keep this back leg straight. One, two, three, four. One there. One there. One there. One there. One there. One there. One there. One there. One there. One there. Good man. Feel that loose enough as you go along. Yeah. There's better than the static stretching because of this stretching like this. Because a little micro-thairs in the muscle and actually we can re-can you in the workout. This is activating getting the muscles ready to fire. Kind of warm up and sit up and all. All right. Nice little warm up. Leg extensions. Just light warm up set. 15. Easy. Nice and light, yeah. Yeah.
