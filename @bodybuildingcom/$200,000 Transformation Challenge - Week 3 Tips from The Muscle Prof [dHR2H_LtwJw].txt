Welcome to Week 3 of Bodybuilding.com's 200K transformation. I'm Dr. Jacob Wilson. One of the biggest things that people think when they're trying to transform is that all of their meals have to be, you know, check in and broccoli or to lobby in a spare guest. But that's actually not true. You can make meals that are nutritious, shreds you in that or animal look that actually tastes good at the same time. Tell us what meals and what recipes are good for you by tagging us at Bodybuilding.com, at Diamondize, at the muscle prof and using the hashtag 200K Transform.
