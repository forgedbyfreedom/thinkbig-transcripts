My name is Chris Gethren and I'm here to help you achieve the body of your dreams. No matter your goal or age, no matter if you've tried and failed before, with body by design you can transform your physique for the better. Your journey will begin from the thoughts in your head through the muscles of your body and the food on your plate. You see I know what it's like to be trapped inside an unhealthy body. When I was a teenager, I fell in love with motorcross, cross-country motorcycle racing. I was eating greasy breakfast and my meals often consisted of processed food, candy, and a lot of alcohol. Before I knew it, my social network had shaped me into a different person with different priorities from the ones I'd always had. I was depressed, my back and asthma got worse and I sunk to a personal low. It was this low point was my transformation trigger. The catalyst I needed to change my habits for good. In this book I've collected the most effective exercises, the best eating practices and the latest science on peak performance and motivation and I'll share them with you. But even the best diet and exercise program will last for long without one key factor, real and lasting motivation. Body by design will set you up for lifelong success beginning with the four pillars of motivation. I've seen the most amazing things happen when people get the tools they finally need to achieve their goals. The Body by design program isn't a workout or a diet. It's a movement of like-minded people who want to look and feel their best beginning with today. Now it's time for you to join the transformation nation and create your own story that will inspire others. Get started today with Body by Design.
