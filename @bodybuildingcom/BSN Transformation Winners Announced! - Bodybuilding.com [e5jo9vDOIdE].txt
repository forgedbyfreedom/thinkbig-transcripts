Hey everyone, I'm Scott Herman, Team BSN athlete, and I'm here to congratulate both Joshua and Elizabeth for winning the BSN eLeap Physique Transformation Challenge on BodyGilling.com. Now don't worry guys, all that hard work has definitely paid off because the two of you will be spending seven days in the Montagobay Standards Resort in Jamaica. You guys have both won a year supply of BSN supplements and also the chance to be a spokesman or a peer-to-national advertisement for BSN. We're all super proud of you guys. We hope you have fun on your trip and just do me one favor and bring back some of that sun because it's five degrees outside here in the Hampshire. So once again, congratulations guys, have fun on your trip and we'll see you soon.
