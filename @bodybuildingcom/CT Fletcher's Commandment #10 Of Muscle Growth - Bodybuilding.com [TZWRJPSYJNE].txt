The Manment Number 10, and this is the good one. I'm big enough. I'm satisfied. Never, ever. Big come. Satisfied. Satisfaction is the death blow. It's the end of the line. You cannot progress farther than Satisfaction. Satisfaction is the end of your growth. It is the end of your journey. It's over for you, Motherfucker. I have satisfied. I no longer need to struggle. I no longer need to push myself. I'm done. I have reached my goal. Fuck Satisfaction. Am I satisfied? Not by a long fucking shot. It's my journey over fuck no. And I fucking will not go quietly until midnight. I will go kicking and fucking screaming. I'm not satisfied. Fuck.
