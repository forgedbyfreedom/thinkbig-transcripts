The Freak Mode mindset of never settling is going to help you get the best transformation out of this 12 week trainer and also it's going to translate into other areas of your life. At one point you have to say enough is enough. I want something else for myself. I want something better. I'm passionate about that and I'm going to pursue that to the fullest. That's Freak Mode. If you don't work hard at it, you don't stay on top of it, then it can all disappear. I'm giving you more than just a 12 week trainer. This Freak Mode program is about making an amazing transformation for all weeks. But also learning. Get ready. We'll just stay ripped. It's a part of your daily life stuff.
