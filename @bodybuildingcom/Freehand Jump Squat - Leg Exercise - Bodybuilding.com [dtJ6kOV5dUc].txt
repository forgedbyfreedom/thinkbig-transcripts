Cross your arms over your chest. With your head up and your back straight position your feet as shoulder width. While keeping your back straight and chest up, squat down as you inhale until your upper thighs are parallel or lower to the floor. Now jump straight up in the air as high as possible. Exhale during this portion of the movement. As your feet return to the floor, allow your hips, knees and ankles to flex to absorb the impact of your jump. Then immediately squat down and jump again.
