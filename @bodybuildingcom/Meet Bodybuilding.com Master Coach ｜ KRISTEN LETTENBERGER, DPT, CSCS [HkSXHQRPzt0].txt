I'm Fristen Lentenberger, Dr. Physical Therapy, and I'm a bodybuilding.com master coach. I used to work for physical therapists, and I saw the impact that she could have on a client's life, so I became a personal trainer, and I started to see the same impact in my client's lives. I just love what I do. Movement has always been medicine for me. I always look to movement to sort of lift up my spirit, just bring me out of some kind of fog. My first interaction with bodybuilding was back in 2006. I was looking for some guidance on how to do a workout, and bodybuilding.com was the one place that I felt like they brought the best people, and the program was really approachable for me. There really is something for everyone there. Welcome to bodybuilding.com, build your body, build your mind, build your life.
