To the flat bench, place a dumbbell on each side of it. Next place your right leg at the end of the bench and bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor. Place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support. Now use your left hand to pick up the dumbbell and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of your hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position. From here, breathe out and pull the weight straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side while your torso is stationary. Focus on the back muscles when you reach the contracted position of this exercise. Also, make sure the lift is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. The forearms should do no other work besides holding the dumbbell. Now lower the weight back down to the starting position, breathing in as you perform this step. Place the switch sides and repeat the movement with the other arm.
