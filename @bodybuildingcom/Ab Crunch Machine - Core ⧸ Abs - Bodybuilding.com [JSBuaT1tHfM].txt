Select a light resistance and sit down at the machine. Place your feet under the pads provided and grab the top handles. Your arms should be bent around 90 degrees with your triceps resting against the pads provided. This will be your starting position. Now exhale while crunching your upper torso. Be sure to use a slow and controlled motion with a focus on using your abs to move the weight while also relaxing your legs and feet. After a brief pause in the contracted position, inhale and slowly return to the starting position.
