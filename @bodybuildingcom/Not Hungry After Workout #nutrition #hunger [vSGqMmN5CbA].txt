Have you ever gone for a long intense run and by the time you got home, you were exhausted, not hungry and maybe even a little bit nauseous? If so, this video's for you. If you workout long enough at a high enough intensity, your workout can alter your hunger cues and leave you as for yourself, why am I not hungry the day I workout? This can happen for a couple of reasons. In increase in stomach acidity, particularly for those who have a history of acid reflux. A decrease in blood flow to the stomach as the blood is traveling to the muscle that's being used. And perhaps even a decrease in your hunger hormone. This small study found that growing your hunger hormone was lower in athletes who had exercise at a moderate to high intensity level compared to those who were sedentary. Therefore, causing these athletes to feel less hungry after their workout, which can then impact recovery time as most individuals will wait until their hungry to eat. My suggestion, take your closer look at how you're fueling your body. Are you eating enough carbs before your workout? If not, try to have some simple carbohydrates that just fruit 30 minutes before your workout. Is your high intensity workout longer than 60 minutes? If so, then you might need to supplement with carbohydrates during your workout, such as gel packs. And lastly, eat carbs and protein, post workout, emphasis on the carbohydrates. For example, you can have Greek yogurt with honey and chia seeds or maybe a protein shake with banana and oats. Try using trialan error to fuel your body during your workouts and monitor your progress through performance as well as hunger cues.
