There's a difference between like only using your lats like for example if I only wanted to activate my lats on this row I would say more so bunched over and let them drop and just pull directly to my lats like this You see how this would only be a lap row, but I want to prop test up so we could hit lower lats like a bar ball row But more so doing dumbbell So this is gonna be mid back lower lat upper trap instead of just like so this would be a lat row That's fine, but we want to do hit the mid back and the upper back To your waistband everything you do when it comes to a row pulls your waist Because if you pull a pie you're always gonna hit upper back But you want to target lower lat always
