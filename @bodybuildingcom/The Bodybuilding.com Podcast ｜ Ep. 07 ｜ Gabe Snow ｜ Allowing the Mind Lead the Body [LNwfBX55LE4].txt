Think over at Spartan 4 or 5 years ago, pleasure to have you on today. I'm really excited for this deep dive into your mind. It's such a pleasure to be here. Thank you Danielle. Thank you bodybuilding.com. Yes, we do do way back multiple brands. It is an honor to be here. Very excited to chat even though we have our phone calls that sometimes turned into a solo podcast themselves. Absolutely. We're just going to start recording those and releasing them soon. We have a great episode up for you guys today. We're going to start our first half really breaking down some physicalities here and talking about physical health. Backhaff will be focused on more mental and emotional health. Really great conversation, Q, up for you guys. Let's get into it. We are going to start off with time-under tension as our first topic. Gabe defined the practice of time-under tension, the use cases and the benefits, and why this pertains to every level and not just beginners. Just high-levelics plan. The definition is create, so everybody's only no tension. How we create that tension, whether it is through a large heavy load, a moderate load, a small load, that is the first choice. How are we going to create the resistance? Now it's up to us as to how much time we can put under the concentric and eccentric phases. A lot of times you see beginners on a bench press, maybe you have the first thing that you see where they're just trying to bang it out as many reps as possible. Very rarely actually hitting their full ranges of motion. Not understanding how their scapula is working on, not understanding that they actually need to lock their elbows out. Trying to get as much done as possible. It actually has quickly as possible when you could create more tension being as our bodies a lever pulley system. You don't need to just lift up one large crate. You can hold one large crate or even one smaller crate and create more time in that lever pulley system to create more adaptation to tear more muscle fibers. Also to confuse the central nervous system so that your body doesn't just get used to banging out as many reps as possible. In terms of how a beginner should approach, I always start with time to centrics. If we're doing a bench press, three seconds to get to your chest explode off fast on the concentric on the shortening phase. You can do the time to centrics and you can do time to pause it. It's a down quick hold at 90 degree level, press back up from there. Just finding ways to increase as much tension as possible rather than trying to add as much load as possible. I found in terms of sustainability is most beneficial for joints for ligaments for tendons and then also just to not burn out your CNS because me as a college athlete, we had our test which the one was 225 pound bench press as many times as you could do it. You can get under it and do it like 39 times with this sloppy form. Create a lot of tension because you're using a lot of weight and you're doing it fast or you could take that 200 or 25 pounds and do it as slow as a rep on the eccentric phase on the stretch and as slow as a rep on the eccentric phase because all that tissue actually knows is strain and then that strain is what's going to cause that temptation. So it is, I'm going to say it's lazy because you know good old fashion have you lifting definitely works but if you're constantly stuck in that facet and you're not finding any progress that's where then for the higher level athlete you know I want to know what their program is looking like and if they're just trying to bang out as many reps as possible you know I challenge them unlike why don't you hold a pause at the bottom you know find where your strength is at at your end range of motion rather than you know your shortest phase and I think that's where a lot of people kind of sell themselves short is you know whether it's you know the push ups whether it's you know even like bicep curls guys that are kind of just going you know from 90 up like you have this full lovely eccentric phase of completely lengthening the bicep and if you're going to fully lengthen you're going to create a larger stretch which is going to create a larger contraction so then again for a similar amount of adaptation well also just not you know getting stuck in the same routine so you know there's there's a lot of ways to do it and I just find the easiest to be for beginner to just time there are centuries like how long the phase takes for them to go back to full range of motion you do this a lot with bands I noticed you do it with body weight so this it doesn't just require weights I think you know from what you're saying and what from what I've seen and noticed as well maybe for a beginner this helps develop a little bit more that mind muscle connection and for them to really understand hey I really want to target the glute right while one I have to think about what part of my glute is that could be the glute max the glute meat etc. what am I actually targeting during this exercise and to how am I going to slow down enough so that I feel it working both in the eccentric and the concentric phase right on the other side of the spectrum for maybe a more seasoned lifter let's say a bodybuilder in this instant right it's going to help with hypertrophy it's going to help with growth by gaining that full lengthening of the eccentric phase as well in the concentric both you know equally so you know that just proving that it's placed to both sides of the spectrum here. Yeah absolutely in the glute bridges honestly I think out of all the exercises the glute bridge and the plank right so my goal is a training is to teach people how to create as many points of tension in their body like how many people can just hold a plank hold a plank with their you know spines sagging like you know their chest is up their shoulder blades are you know retracted and they're just hanging out and they're just dumping all that way into like their lumbar will teach somebody how to you know pelvic tilt so that they can actually use their glutes also to hold them up flex and knees create a contraction that glutes pro-jocally they're shoulder blades so then you're getting a T spine and a little bit a lot and then also drag your forearms down so then you're also getting oblique and abs so like that's one of my tests my first kind of new clown like show me show me your glute bridge show me your show me your plank you know and the biggest thing that you see and you go to a big box gym there's people doing glute bridges and you know they're flying up and down off the floor and the first thing you see is the low bat their low back is still arched right and their but their butt is you know a foot up in the air you only have 15 degrees you know of rotation you know or excuse me of hip extension from the floor so if you're not talking your pelvis underneath creating that tension finding your glutes before you raise rather than you only feeling your glute at the top of the glute bridge after you've just used like your extensors in your lower back to raise you up then you're not really understanding where the tensions built so I do go as far as like we were mimicking a glute bridge for them to even push their hands their palms into the floor as hard as possible so then you're creating tension the obliques you know have them think about dragging their heels towards their fingertips so then they're finding their hamstrings and then learning how to do that pelvic tuck so that low back makes contact with the floor then when they raise from their heels the lower back is not active at all you've got hamstring glutes and a bleak being the main you know points of tension in the body and I think that if you can teach people how to create tension in their body rather than just load their body that's what you're going to have a more sustainable program you're going to have people understand what they're supposed to be feeling when you do then progress that to a lift or a full body movement so it really is you know using time under tension I find you allow people to empower themselves more by understanding what they're supposed to feel versus how many reps they completed. Yeah absolutely you know when I when I think about these exercises too it really puts an emphasis on the core and I don't think some people out there understand just how integral your core is and that that doesn't matter if you are a runner a swimmer a biker and I say that selfishly from triathlon over here but if you're trying to do the 500 pounds or run the fastest mile you can right core is so extremely important to any athlete any person walking around I heard someone say one time I really stuck with me not having a strong core is like biting the middle out of an apple and at any moment you can just break and I really resonated with me and made me want to do core every day and my weeks every day the weeks since then you know but where does core come into play for a lot of these time under tension movements that you implement? I mean that's just time and attention with everything just like not being able to control your ribcage like you're just standing ribcage just what you see especially in the bodybuilding community like you have all these guys holding hundred bandun bells doing these you know these overhead press you know and if your ribcage is descended and your core is not active then your spine is actually what's holding majority of that weight so like I have some of these guys that are you know they they're built beautifully aesthetically but as soon as you give them a bench press or any of a movement the core becomes completely inactive it's just completely elongated so like sure and the goal of raising something over your head like you know the hundred that becomes like a 50 because you're done me on half that weight into your you know into your spine so if you have people learn how to pull the ribcage down pull their hips underneath to keep the core active you know then you're also learning how to use your diaphragm as a place of stability and then that's also going to increase your strength you're you know you're testically you're not going to feel very great because those dumbbells you have become a lot smaller but then you're actually earning true functional you know strength in the muscle group they are actually trying to train so you know with the bodybuilders I would say it's really rare to watch a bodybuilder put down the hundred pound dumbbells grab 30s and like sit there push the ribcage down and press overhead where then you know with runners because like you know cores also not just like your abdominals it's your hips as well it's your abductors your ad doctors right that's your hips stability so like the hips aren't stable the knees aren't stable the knees aren't stable like when you run you're wearing tires also you know kind of increase dramatically so for me you know the kind of you know mantra or with the comparison I use is you wouldn't build a skyscraper in a swamp right like you know try to sink you know this big monstrous strong building in a I don't know weak foundation so your core being your hips and your abdominals and your bleaks that's going to be your foundation so no matter what you're trying to do in terms of longevity you know not loading your spine and allowing your core and your abdominals to hold that tension is just going to keep it's going to keep you health here it's going to keep you safer it's going to keep you you know being able to go longer so you know the core is something that I think people have to isolate you know they want to do their planks they want to do their ab wheels and stuff like that but in my programming it's you know it's using a symmetry so like doing your overhead press right but found only if one dumbbell and I press over here well now once I my body's loaded and this one's to happen so now this this oblique has to then shorten to keep me upright so there's a lot of ways time you know that's not so much time under tension but there's other ways like you know training asymmetrically to be able to access the core without you know just keeping in an isolated and the side plank or plank you know making it more intricate that way that the body also learns that you can have overhead movement you know horizontal pushes and pulls while you know keeping the core active like and like when someone does a push-up same thing they do their little sway back in the plank if you can tuck your pelvis find your abs and come up as one versus you know your your chest and then your hips coming up you're going to be able to hold out more push-ups now it's going to in terms of intention and using your mind it's going to take a lot more neurological load which is another thing I say like training with me it's more of a neurological load than it is a physical load because I've seen that you can make equal parts even not you know more progress just having more intention behind your exercises rather than just going and grabbing a bigger dumbbell or a bigger kettle though so you might you I always like to use the front squat as a great analogy to you sure you can load that bar up and you can use your quads and you're hampering your glutes and you may able to get 200 pounds up if you think about pulling your belly button to your ribcage and really engaging that core it is going to feel like a completely different exercise that I guarantee you're going to want to take some weight off your two in the back and then just with that like even people does not understand like for moral attraction like pulling you know pulling your femurs into your hip socket like that's kind of come from like you're so as in your hip flexors so when people a lot of people do front squats are just like all I'm going to train quads and it's like no like you're smashing that co-can now and you're you're using your core as you're you know your main point of stability and then learning how to use your legs you know secondary to your core where I would say you know 90% of the population are just you know they're targeting so they look at an electrosizing and I'm thinking that they're going to do any core like like you said with you know the back squat you people just folding in half and I'm like if I could do Leonardo DiCaprio inception you're just on a leg sled you know what I mean like if you can keep your chest upright keep your ribs down through your elbows forward and come down vertically what's keeping you upright your core is right so there's you know a lot of misconceptions everybody you know learning these things is going to take a distance so you know but he's going to squat like that you know naturally take us through a progression take us through maybe a warm update for yourself let's say it's squat day right are you starting from the floor are you moving to bands are you moving to bells I see you do a whole ton but what what what is what is step one and what are the steps that you take before you even start loading up that bar for myself which is interesting because for myself you know if we were talking years ago it would be as opposite of what I have my clients do now that I'm having a lot of old injuries plague me from you college athletics and just life and whatnot I'm doing all the same things that they're done you know which is you know as a trainer probably should but it all starts with FRC so like functional range conditioning right which is you know people feel like they're in a stretch right but you know the stretch is the feeling that you know the brain it's only even the only thing our brain can can make sense of in these you know feelings of tension so like a 90 90 stretch you know stretch again like I call them drills I call them like activations you know it's started the 90 90 my left hip you know it protrudes I have it's anterior it's it's forward because my left hip is weak so you know a lot of people think that like oh my my left hip is tight so I need to you know go into my couch stretch and like really open up my hip or my my left hip not it at all I need to actually do the opposite and I need my hip to understand that it's comfy and cozy and a hinged position you know into single like hinged position and then that's what's going to allow me to have that hip allow me to access my glue in my abductor more so a lot of the times people think that they're tight you know tightness and usually it is in essence weakness or it is a neurological little disconnect with the brain says if my hip goes that motion I'm going to create some type of bad news for myself so whether it's me it's my clients it's all in the floor it's all I would say functional range conditioning you know which is like the 99th stretch learning where your ad doctors learning how to turn your ad doctors and abducters first putting your hips into a deep hinge you know for a lot of people my first step is always pain mitigation you know so if we've got one person who doesn't have very much dorsy function in their ankle and when they squat their heels come off the ground and they feel tension you know in their in their Achilles tendon you know we're going to work like debankful flexion driving the knees over the toes some people do it loaded I don't really think that's that you need to do it loaded you know squeezing your toes into the ground lifting your toes off the floor so that that you know your shin that your calf everything in your ankle or or prepared for that deep ankle flexion which is another thing I see so many people not prepare for in a squat so you're sending these signals to your central nervous system is prepping it yeah and that's you know because we don't use these things like you know because you know sitting up and standing down like the perfect example like how do you sit down plop down okay every time you plop down you just did yourself a disservice to teach your hips how to hinge lengthen your hamstrings use your hips to lower yourself into the seat but we don't do that we just plop down but every time we get up what do we have you got a lot of the hip extension and we got knee flexions so the quads are quads are going quads are going quads are going so there's all these things during the day that we're just like we neglect these parts of our hips on our hamstrings are supposed to your chain that just don't get any love so you know whether we start with the joint stuff finding you know finding hip mobility if we're talking about squat a lot of people it's also shoulder mobility because people don't have the ability to pull the bar underneath just because you know that they're extension their shoulders are so poor and then from there it would be more like of an activation technique so like creating stability in the hip you know waking up the glute waking up the ad doctors making sure that they're not just going to just be doing knee flexion just you know bending the knees straightening the knees because that all we're really teaching there is you know your myso being your bodybuilding you know just doing a leg extension so for myself because of all the pain torn knees torn hamstrings it's always going to be you know accessing mobility first then from accessing mobility a little bit of you know isolation doing isolation to make sure that I got blunt phone the right places and then I go into dynamic so that's like multi-plane or movement you know literally literally literally reverse transverse going up and down turf creating proprioception so like my body knows where it is in space and then you know getting the heart rate up so that's really getting warm is good and then from there that's you know I'll get into a load you know using the back squat as a you know as a as a prime example but it in doing that also making sure that the core is active you know so I like to do like a plank a low plank from my knees and then creating a hamstring contraction by squeezing my heels so it's my butt so learning pelvic tuck getting glutes getting hamstrings on and getting out getting abs on because for myself those are the last three things that I ever activate my butt rarely turns on all quadz over here hamstrings need some love abs always need love so that would be like my final kind of move and then I get under the bar but it comes with a lot of tedious work but I back squat seven days a week then I don't have any pain and I make progress you know there's the days when the ego does get there and I'm like oh I get to go a little bit heavier today but I can say I've been back squatting six to seven days a week for over a year and a half now and that's all thanks to mobility and stability training. With the conversations certain in landing itself to our next topic which is creating mobile and stable joints so you know first let's talk about the difference between mobility and stability and if you fall along to our newsletter the catalyst which comes out every Sunday evening subscribe on bodybuilding.com we just spoke about this topic but tell us in your words the difference between mobility and stability. Yeah so you know I've got I've got my written version which is joint stability is the ability for a joint to remain in a fixed position and resist movement okay and then mobility is the ability of a joint to move freely through the range of motion so you know stability would be more of like an isometric you know holding like you know if you were going to do an LRDL get rid of the way like get into your single you know your single like deep hinge right and then have control over your hip with the adduction the abduction so understanding you know that the hip is what's holding you up or a lot of people can get that hip deep enough behind them and they start driving the hip forward and then it's all the quad so that you know the hips ability is what's going to make the knee feel stable and a lot of people have knee pain and a lot of people have lower back pain and in my case 80% of that is all coming from either weak slash tight hips you know we don't have nearly as much of a neurological response and like our receptors and pain to our hips as much as we do our lower back just because of all the nerve endings there so you know people are coming oh I have a bad lower back it's like no you don't have a bad lower back you have weak hips that neurologically don't know how to move because if you're not you don't know how to hinge you know not to get your hips behind you you're just and you're just trunk flexing just folding in half those extents are muscles in your back and I've built for that so of course your back's going to you know light up so I can bind the two I would say I start with the mobility right which is getting people neurologically to understand you know internal external rotation whether it's the shoulders you know extension flexion pro traction retraction and if you're listening to this instead of watching it he was doing some superb demos doing into our YouTube for the visual yeah so you know people that's you know just a row like how many times you see people take a row and they'd be there already started retracted and they're just doing a hammer-crowing a shrug right like you're not going to be able to understand your own physiology unless you understand that like the lat starts from a protracted position and you're actually retracting the shoulder blade in order to activate that and scapula to then bring the elbow back so that's where you know a lot of people I start with retrit-excuse me protraction and retracting on the floor then you know for doing a push pull day because in essence you know a push in a pull in terms of your scapula are the same exact thing it's just where the tension's coming from right so like if I'm pushing the weight I'm going from retracted to protracted if I'm pulling I'm going from protracted to retracted we're so many of us we don't you know finesse with our skeleton we just pull it or push it you know and then you're just you're getting half of the rep and you're not getting any of the neurological benefit for you know your scapula your shoulder blades actually learn how to move things with with your skeleton you know a lot of us are just like how to make the muscles bigger for you know bigger faster we're like yeah sure if you like do a bunch of half reps you're going to have you know a lot more concentric phase the muscles are going to have a lot more blood flow in it but in terms of like your endurance and how much longer you're going to go and how long you're going to be able to complete these movements it's going to be minimal so yeah for the moving from shoulders to spine you know so we've all been taught this like flat back thing where like good posture is upright and you know if as long as you can hold that you have good posture and then in lifting like keep your back flat like for me now like just learning as much as I have like your spine is one of the most high tech pieces of equipment that exists in your body like the spine is resilient but the thing is it's so resilient it's so smart that if your hips don't work appropriately your spine is going to be the first thing that's going to learn how to move instead and that's why people have a lot of back issues in these lower back issues because what's connected to your hips you lower back so if you can't move your hips appropriately your spine's going to try to do it and that's one of those muscles you're QL and your labor and your QL and your extensors are going to you know are going to go to shit like they're just going to be overusing over warned so QL is going to be the exact one I start calling out but I'm going to realize the QL is when the only muscles in the body is it the only muscle in the body that extends upper to lower body so if your hips are at a whack that is attached to your spine and you're going to feel pretty unhappy if that's happening you know I think it also comes from people just not understanding that there is a difference between a mobile and a stable joint and you know walk us through the skeletal system in terms of a mobile versus a stable joint so yeah I mean like that's for instance like what I just talked about like my hips it's like me playing football my left hip again being you know not hinging not having you know proper external rotation or internal rotation served me in my sport because I was an outside line back at defense events all of my body weight was on my left leg so all that all that leg ever was served as was a platform for me to push off of but then if I had to make a lateral movement it always had to be off of my right leg so my my right hip in terms of like internal and external rotation moves significantly better but if I'm going to sit there and hold like a single like an hinge all those years of just leaning into my left hip has now created in essence you know a more stable joint the joint is isn't stable and it's correct you know range of motion but I can hold the weight there much longer because that must that tissue that tissue integrity is now built more for holding in one place where my right hip you know if I'm going to step off of a curb and jump off you know to like do a lay up for a basketball this one is how to get out of the way this one is how to move so it also sometimes you know does come down like people's like dominant side and non-on overtime just that neurological pairing behind you know if I tell you to go reach for door you're going to reach with your dog and a hand you're not going to like slowly reach across with your left hand so you know a stable joint does have the ability to resist more force right but that also doesn't mean that it's end range of motion it's going to be the same so you know if we use like you know shoulders friends since like maybe I can you know I can internally rotate my you know my right shoulder much more than my left shoulder but if you push against it it's not going to have as much stability in that fixed position where you know look my left shoulder which is the case not having any Jenny like I'm in love to make you join my range of motions limited but now I've had to learn how to build strength because I don't have mobility in the shoulder so now this joint is an SNS stable but it doesn't have the full range of motion and you know the big thing with training is like you want to be you want to have both you want to be stronger your end ranges and get your shortest range but a lot of people to understand that joints you know internally rotate actually rotate abduct you know an abduct so if you're just kind of skipping those points you or you're not you know your strength is no longer functional and those but that's what you'll see you know people who use machines you know for training versus people who use free weights you're going to have a much more stable joint using free weights than you are using a machine because you're not putting that joint to compromising positions where you know maybe that dumbbell goes overhead or goes in front of you or with the machine it's just guided straight up so you can build all this great soft tissue but you can join it you can be a building and on a joint that is probably not very mobile and you know that's why when you take these bigger guys who you have a lot of muscle mass the joint are in essence stable because they have so much soft tissue around them to protect them but then the second you have you know you're doing end range motion test as an injury rotate push against my hand oh really drop right away right so it is about you know what type of strength you have in your end ranges and in your you know in your rotations and abduction and abduction right rotation is really the key word there to you know explain how important it is to train rotation on movement patterns right because you use the perfect example machines you're usually in flexion extension flex extension maybe that's great for a lower back with a lower back your your lower back doesn't like to to rotate your thoracic likes to rotate right so we need to get the rotation in for for your thoracic for your hips they love to rotate so how are you implementing that into a routine um that's so I mean it's it's with people are so used to linear training forward backward up and down you know it for some of the bothersome just because they can consider themselves a high level fitness but not many people are doing rotation um what makes it fun is when you do like to implement it is when you kind of if you get a golfer if you get a tennis player like get a bodybuilder and make him sweat like swing a tennis tennis tennis racket like you're not really creating much power right and that's where like understanding that your body is not just made up of separate muscle groups that is you know it is one organism that works together and like you can't turn your body into a whip or if you're gonna throw something overhead you know unless you learn how to rotate flex and extend your you know flex and extend your spine you're not gonna be strong so teaching people that you know whether the client is more like strength performance driven is like a lot easier because it's like you know let's see how much of a whip you can turn your body and so you can see how far hard you can throw this med ball or how much you know better golf swing is gonna get or how much better you know you can swing a racket stuff like that and then for people who are less performance focus and they are more focus on their longevity you know people who've been sitting in a car for you know or travel which I have a lot of clients like and they're like my hips are tight and I'm like no you know no poo of course they are we know that right but like so is your back and what it's so interesting is because like we've been especially in fitness like it's almost been taboo to move your spine in all these different ways people have they don't know what it actually feels like to feel good and I find that you know so many athletes we're so you're feeling shady all the time so we don't know what actually feeling good is and like for me specifically like as soon as I learn how to implement spinal rotation in my training I mean everything became easier you know because like whether it's a you know a single arm press you're going to your bench press like just having you know your shoulder blades understanding that they can rotate so much further behind you you're increasing you know your ranges of motion you're feeling better about your training but then just overall like in your body because you don't have this systemic you know issue going from your either your shoulder or steer your spine or your hips it's keeping you less hesitant and you know that like I said so many people just don't even think or function you're thinking to increase function others to make their spine until it's like oh no I can't do that I have a bad back right where we're in theory it's actually going to help with injury prevention it's good and it's going to prepare you for those moments where you do need to move fast you need to be on your feet especially here in the streets in New York City like you know both know very well stepping off a curb like your car is going like exactly your hips are pointed this direction but your body needs to move that way like yeah you'll see you know there's a million times a day you know I'll tell a little bit of sad story in my dad had when I had a full spinal fusion he was for extra facial athlete we guy was built like an adonis I watched him throw a coat can out one time literally slight rotation hips in the seat and this guy like he did not show pain and the grittest teeth sat there gripped his grip his you know his own fists for like 15 minutes because he went into a full spasm just from slight rotation and that was just that was 2001 so like people not understanding that like the spine needs to rotate needs to flex in order to be fully operable unfortunately is like new information but if you've been looking at anything greatest athletes anything created is quarterbacks and greatest pitchers you know those guys can basically point their hips at you and pull their guys to pull the exercise they do the exercise that's like look behind them so you know if you're trying to increase your power in any way you know and create longevity of your life you know the more spinal rotation you have the longer your problem you can you live because the quality of movement is just going to be so much higher yeah I mean I'm just decreasing the pain that you're experiencing on a daily basis as well if you're if you're someone who's in an office all day or even if you're working from home and you're seated most of your day go outside do some rotational movements I guarantee you're going to feel better just with five minutes of doing that and injecting those into your daily routine you know why is this important to do at a younger age why do we not want to wait until one we're feeling those daily aches and pain and two you know we don't want to wait until we're 15 60 year old to to start doing quote unquote some of these more boring things right we're adding in mobility work adding in our activation work wise it becoming inherently more important for people of younger age to add this to the routine um I think the reason being is because the information wasn't as accessible and understood so I think that's why like right now we're kind of in the pinnacle of people actually understanding you know when you just look at like people with their back surgeries like so many people so many less people are getting cut open now than like 2000 to like 2005 you know for a multitude of reasons but you because people are actually understanding that the spine is durable and that you know if you cut something open you're basically you know if you have a six cylinder under and you know engine and you pull out one cylinder like the car's not going to run the same so now you have to teach this car how to you know drive with one of the cylinder so you know I think that you know using like more of a pre-hab technique and teaching people that you know using their spines daily and you know whether through sport or just daily life is going to create a longer pain-free life which you know if you're in pain for less amount of time and you don't hesitate with movement you're going to move better longer that's going to keep you alive longer you know you see especially in the lower East side you see these you know elderly women doing like these crazy Tai Chi exercises but they're in their 80s and their 90s and they're moving around better than most of the 30 year olds in Equinox so you know there's you know there's a lot of you know cultures and societies that have like kind of figured it out but I also believe because there's not you know when we first get into this stuff when we're younger that's we're lifting because we're invincible we're invincible we're working because we're invincible we're working because we want to be the biggest most shredded the fastest the strongest we don't think that you know it's going to end at some point and then if it does end you know it's not going to be because I didn't do my mobility drills so you know I think that ego is honestly you know it's just so prevalent in fitness and in a gym culture people don't want to be on the floor for 30 minutes doing these things they want to get up and get after it because that's being really like another great part especially the mental the health part of training is to make yourself feel better right so unfortunately there's not a lot of people until they've already had an injury where they actually go through these drills and it actually feel accomplished and feel fulfilled by doing them so it sucks that it usually comes with you know putting your hand on the stove first to learn that these things are going to serve you you know whether it is progressing your performance or if it's just keeping you out of pain or if it's just you're longevity so I do think that it is a little bit of an ego thing you know I have my guys who come and I don't want to go on the floor I don't want to go on the floor I don't want to get in the rack let's go and I'm like cool we can do that but like do you want to be able to do this for like the next 10 years or the like the next 25 years right and then they're like oh okay I also you know I also think we don't I've said this before and I think I've said I've also said this in recent newsletter the catalyst but we don't play enough we don't we lose the element of play and we may have gotten to this at a later part in the podcast we can talk about it now we are not moving the way that we move when we are seven years old and I I'm even guilty of that for me I am I do train a ton um linear but you know I'm purposely adding in those lateral moves in the gym but when I think about it am I really getting that much lateral work and throughout my day without doing it intentionally probably not right so we need to start you know go join the softbally go play this recreational soccer go out and play whatever it is that you like to play as a kid because we are losing so much of those skills the older that we get and we're losing it a lot quicker than a lot of people realize absolutely I just had this conversation the day um and it was originally pertaining to play and then I guess my rotation like went back and do what I was with some of my buddies that we put in college football with and I was like tell me you can throw a football at 32 the same when you did when we were 19 and everyone was like no I was like an idiot when I football now and it's like it's not you know the neuromocular connection yeah it may have faded that you know neural pathway maybe isn't there anymore but like what's more you know what's diminished more is that ability of moving your spine if you're sitting in a desk all you know all day and then you know in terms of play yeah why do you think you know you take a 30 year old and you tell them to go quadripe on the floor they look up at you like are you fnc areas like you want me to go on the ground because something happens it like 18 19 years old the floor is just the enemy it's like we don't go down there anymore like my youth is over and the thing is when you're down there you are moving dynamically like if you look at like a toddler like a three or four year or five year old get down and play on the ground if you watch how they actually lower themselves to the ground or how they reach for things like it if it if it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it should inspire you it was an adult you know you're not like rolling on your side and they're like pushing yourself up like the way that their hips move the way that their spine's move you know and people like oh that's because they're young yes and no like if you've committed to those practices from age five years old to 55 years old there's no reason that the integrity of the soft tissue in the joint and that you that neurological connection would go away the same way that if the 32 year old is throwing a football today capstone and a football every single day you know we graduate college we stop playing our sport or if we don't you stop playing as kids those with those pathologies don't those practices me pathways no longer need to exist because ultimately our bodies are lazy because ultimately our bodies are just here to keep us alive as long as possible so if there's a way to conserve energy you know using less muscle mass using less energy using less movement our brain is going to reward that it's going to say stay seated don't move your spine like that but the thing is is like that's where you know we're at this point of evolution where bodies are so smart and our jobs and our daily lives are so stagnant that we're reaching this point of like you know yeah sure we're living longer because you know form of suitable is and you know hopefully understanding a little bit more about the nutrition but does that mean that the quality of life is high like you know if I'm going to live to a hundred and from seventy to a hundred I'm stuck in a chair I will trade that for living to sixy and meet moving freely so you know I think that there's just a lot of things that go into play as to whether it's we're not playing anymore you know we're so work of so work driven maybe you know we're a little shy we don't want to go join the softball team but you know play is the first thing that you know is going to put your body into multi dimensions in terms of movement and you know that's why training you know training with people like me and a lot of the people I work with that's like I don't care if you're doing a body building show like you're doing a lunge of the rotation you know what I mean like you're doing your moving your spine because you know ultimately it's if it's about longevity and if it's about life it's like do you want to be doing this for a little bit of time or a long time right you know we're certainly not naive to the fact that yes you know we're in terror and your joints happens you're not going to be able to be the all-american quarterback that you were when you were 18 when you are at 60 but can you come pretty close probably between nutrition and recovery and the movement patterns and you're instilling to your programming you you can kind of stay right there your energy levels may decrease etc but I don't think we're giving ourselves enough enough credit especially in this country as we age I think this I think we've already started topic three for today but decreasing pain through mindfulness and movement you know whether this is dealing with acute injuries or chronic pain I think you touched on it before people saying no I can't run anymore you know my knee suck or you know no I can't I can't get on a bike or you can't even I just was in a car for six hours you're like no that's all the more reason to be going on a bike you're listening to it join up right so break down how you approach both sides of the spectrum there you know and how the brain plays a crucial role in healing not only for acute injuries you know breaking a pinky or you know dealing dealing with chronic back pain that someone's you know on the brink of of going to that surgery you know how do you how do you say hey no hey let's let's take a step back here and figure an athre movement I mean that that would be an I could go like so deep dive on the tangent just because like I work with physical therapists and I've seen so many doctors and like I just had a crazy shoulder injury and you know I hate to say this and there's my cats and flock but like I think we do live in a society whether it's doctors surgeons and a lot of physiotherapists like they and our food everything this country because of insurance they want you to stay sick they want you to stay and some shape or form in need and some form with an ailment you know to believe that you need to keep buying you know whatever it is you're joined supplement your pain killer you need to come back for your ultrasound and your little stretch session like you know that is the way that a lot of the industries working our country to say oh we have no obesity problem okay like let's just invent a drug that you know plays with your you know insulin and blood sugar levels rather than us just fixing and teaching nutrition like you know so the the quick fix and then I think also just like a lot of people want to have some self-limiting belief in like a bit of like a victim case because but that's what we've been taught you know like especially when it comes to PT like you know oh you spraying your ankle put a boot in it don't walk don't use it like that was the old school way of doing things well what happens when you stop using it you're losing your your losing your mobility you're losing your rotation you're losing the integrity of of the soft tissue surrounding the joint so if you're not moving it on you're just booting it in that ankle and that calf and then that quad is just atriffing because you're dragging your foot around like you're not you're not gonna get like you you know the the spring will go down physi inflammation went down but now you got a like that's completely a symmetrical in terms of its strength and you've got an ankle that doesn't move compared to your right so now you're working with you know some severe severe asymmetry and over compensation and then that's just gonna lead it might go from the angle and that's just gonna go to the knee so you know I just think that there's there's a lot of people who started with an acute pain and it just wasn't handled it right why and I'm lucky that I work with some of the peat knee and the the the leading physical therapist in the city where it's like sure like let it calm down but also like do not stop using it like even if it's as much as just squeezing your toes and like pulling your toes off the ground like keep blood flow keep the neurological connection paired because that acute injury is gonna turn into a chronic one because you want a boot or a cast for six months so you know when it's when someone comes to me with with you know with a chronic injury it's usually finding out like you know the epidemiology like where did it actually start and again if we keep using like knees and lower backs it's because no one looked at their hips you know and it's like how could you expect your lower back to ever get better whether you had an injury or not or you just have a weak hips and a weak core like and that lower back is just trying to create all this movement because your hips don't even have if they don't have the neurological connection or they don't have the strength and do it like of course your back's gonna hurt so I can't tell you the amount of people and this isn't me like tweeting my own horn but like guys who were like 29 like women who were 56 years old I've got one incredible client she was like fan of the opera Cirque du Soleil New York City ballet like incredible athlete but has one hip that causes her to you well pain and then if that you know driving traveling if the ql goes bad then it makes it way down her knee and it's because her left hip does not hinge it just doesn't hinge you know like her left glute doesn't activate the glute doesn't activate because it doesn't think that the integrity of the hip is gonna put it in a safe place so like that somebody that like has all the systemic stuff who she's doing you know whether was medication whether it was acupuncture whether it's massage like that's a chronic pain whether that existed from you know in a q injury we don't really know her having such an extensive dance career but like she gets to the point to where she's like I'm just gonna go in for surgery and have her cut and it's like when you do that then just what happens same as the boot on the ankle you don't use it you don't get blood flow yeah you do your P.T. but like you're starting even further behind so like if we can find a way if your brain to become dis sensitized of putting this hip in the right pop in the proper place not having an impingement and then strengthen the glute strengthen you know the abductor ad dr so this thing shows comfortable moving then guess what happens the q l pain goes away the lower back pain comes away then the knee pain goes away so that's somebody I've been working with for not even two years now and you know this is this was a chronic pain that she had had you know she's in her 50s she's had this and she was like 30 like 30 something especially something like the hip as well I mean that's just it's not a path you want to go down the amount of work you're going to have to do to quote unquote you know re-ignite those glute muscles create that connection again get those firing properly the glutes are just such an impressive system that you have to work with 24-7 right so to get those turn back on a such a hard job and I know it because I experienced it you know and same thing the amount of people that I can recall that are so quick to go into a I'll say low back because that's probably the biggest one that we see across this industry because they're trusting the the physicians that they're working with and I think that's also part of the not the problem I'm not going to say it's a problem to trust your physician I'm going to say that as a healthcare system we need to do a better job at educating people not only for things like nutrition but also how they need to move their body and why are we not you know recommending them to not only physical therapist but physical therapist that can teach them other ways to alleviate these pains and take things that's up further than just the standard six-week protocol right go take PT for six weeks if you don't feel any better we're going to surgery that there's got to be more of an elaborate process that's put into place but in my yeah just the back point on that is like when you get these people you know and they have poor hip extension or shoulder extension I don't like that when I don't want to do that one probably because it's exactly what you need to be doing so and I think that is just the hard truth that a lot of people are afraid to face they get to that point and they're like oh I'm going to upset my client they're not going to work with me anymore you know luckily I've been to the point where like I you know my clients have the trust and rapport with me and we're all like let's just try this because like if every it's the same as like you know we get into our personalities like you get into a new relationship and like see you got some trust issues from your previous relationship right and like you know you don't get a phone call for like a day or two and you immediately jump to conclusions like I'm not doing this I'm not supposed to be in a relationship it's like no being the relationship but work on what it takes in order for that chronic pain or that acute pain whichever one how you're feeling in that moment work on that to be able to become regular and normal and culpable and functional so you know anytime I have somebody who's like yeah I don't think that I don't want to do that one it's like okay we don't want to do that one but let's do a regression of that one because that tells me if you're brain you know conscious or not you're saying not to do something it's probably the exact thing you need to be doing and what that tells me too is it's that individual may not have ever been taught to work through pain right they were taught or they had developed the behavior of this is painful I'm going to stop now there's a different there's different levels of pain of course you know we're sympathetic to that but there does come to a point and I think I think if you or someone who has an athletic background maybe you're kind of used to working through those areas of discomfort I'll certainly say that from experience I'm sure you can as well and you know what I even find with you know I'll use my parents for example like you know this doesn't feel good I'm like well what doesn't feel good about about it right we're not asking those follow-up questions and I think I see we see that a lot in doctor's offices as well well what does it feel like and when you move this way does it hurt when you move that way does it hurt we're really not kind of doing that due diligence of understanding where it's really stemming from all we hear is this hurts go to PT here's a pill if that doesn't work here surgery so we've come a very long way I would say the last five to 10 years have been extremely transformational in this field but there's there's still miles to go for sure I want to move on to our fifth and our fourth and final topic excuse me you know what I will say before we move on we're we're going to be moving on to discussions around PTSD and depression if these topics are not where you're seeking today we thank you for listening in and we will see you next time on the bodybuilding.com podcast so game you know you love to say mind leads body follows it's in your Instagram bio you've been saying it since the day I met you I see and I'm as any interview that that you sit down to take you know let's let's I'm I'm really going to turn it over to you I want to know what what prompted you to pursue a degree in psychology specializing in neurochemistry and I want to know you know what personal experiences led you to the journey that you're on today yeah mind leads body follows you know that is has been my motto in a lot of ways you know it almost moved people that didn't want to warm up so much the you know the vulnerability in psychology and it was more just like you know do it light do it right form base fitness over just like you know crushing your body like having intention with your mind and then allowing your body to follow that but that was that's like scratching the surface but you know for me what mind leads body follows is that like as somebody who is competitive bodybuilder as somebody who grew up borderline morbidly obese barrier over weight 275 pounds in college never looked the way I wanted to look you know I had to find solace and peace and self respect and confidence in my process and you know so many people are obsessed with you know if we're going to call their journey like you know climbing the mountain to the sunset right to see this great sunset well what happens when you get to you know the top of the mountain you get to the peak and the sunset's got clouds and overcast and front of it how are you going to feel that right so like if you don't find joy and confidence in efficacy in the climb right which the what's getting you through the climb is your mind like you know if the sunset is that dream body that you wanted like in my history like it doesn't make a difference you know what that body looks like you know how low your body fabric percentages or what you think you're supposed to look like because if you don't build that efficacy on the way the air like you're just the same you're just the same insecure person you're the same person that's still in search of something that still has a hole who now just like looks a little bit different you know so like if the brain is not happy if the brain is not pleased it doesn't matter the body's never going to be able to overpower your mind so like if you can't find success in your day to day process versus your outcome like you can you can take as far as you want you know like I said body building competitively fitness modeling I was never happy I was never happy once I always could have went further I always could have been more lean I always could have booked another job like you know the body just more feel whatever you want to call it it's stuck with me from the beginning like from forever and majority of my existence was becoming all the things that I didn't have in childhood like I needed like a father figure I was the only overweight one in the family so I had to lose all the weight you know I was always expected to be you know football player my dad was an NFL player you know so it was always all these outcomes you know that I had to that I had to get myself to for me in order to feel good about myself and that's what I find so much of so many my clients I just have to lose 15 pounds you know like what happens if 15 pounds like you know do you like sprout wings and you can just fly like into the heavens and you just feel great like no you know then that's why then I kind of lead with the you know the questions of like what happens at 15 pounds in your mind or why 15 pounds and like while I was 15 pounds last on my honeymoon well you would just had your wedding you just had all of your loved ones show up for you to celebrate your love and your devotion for the your one person that you're gonna spend the rest of your life with so like what's your connection like with your family one the last time you're not a gathering how's your relationship with your spouse like do you believe that they don't love you as much because you don't look exactly the same way as when they marry and you like so we've been programmed to have all these beliefs that like our body is going to be the outcome for you know our joy or success and you know this especially in this field where for me it's if you know if the brains aren't healthy doesn't matter what you do with your body so that's why I just kind of try to get people to meet themselves halfway where it's like let's lose five pounds and let's call your cousins in your aunts and your uncles and ask if we can get dinner or let's talk about you know maybe your sexual relationship with your partner or how you're feeling about like your social life like because we've just been told that all of our issues come solely from ourselves and within and with our external self you know in society especially you know social media is just constantly forcing external validation so it's like your mind is the only one that matters and how you feel about where you're going it's solely your choice now yeah it's really hard to untie a lot of those knots you know to be able to be like I'm doing everything I can but when the rest of your world is like you're not doing shit you know it's really hard to convince yourself otherwise so I use that I use that mind needs body follows is to be like you know people walk out of a session like well I'm still time pounds away I'm like yeah but how do you feel right now how do you feel about the work that you just put in right now your brain how does your brain feel well I did everything I was supposed to do right okay and what comes next what's for lunch well I know what I'm going to do and you know I'm going to follow my meal plan or I'm going to eat my 80 20 great so that's your mind so like do not let the outcome be the the the the obtaining fact on how you where you hold your value and if you can keep that positive mindset that you're doing everything that you can the body will follow you know it will happen if that's the goal that will happen and I've been so lucky to be kind of keeping that mantra for so long with people that like I've got a couple people who look exactly the same they're a little bit stronger they're a little bit more mobile but like in terms of their their self-evigacy and where they hold their success it comes and there comes in their mind because like this is all temporary you know anything like how good you look right now especially from a bodybuilder like you know you're not going to look like that in two weeks so like why put that emphasis on there put the emphasis on the fact of like you know you did everything you could do accomplish a goal and that you had discipline and you showed up for yourself so the mind leaves body follows kind of mantra is just more about you know finding finding the the joy from within and the appreciating the effort that you're putting in rather than the body being your you know your measure of success and then you know if we can go into psychology yeah it's good with problems in the movie psychology I grew up I grew up in a pretty tumultuous household my father was an alcoholic in a drug addict because it takes a to the oxy cotton somebody who had his whole you know the world the world was his oyster you could do whatever you wanted he was somebody who always kind of did the right thing like college football and a fell and a fell in work out started the business business was successful married the right wife had the kids but like really didn't do much for himself so he kind of fell off the wagon when he like sold his business in retired really on my mom struggled a lot with like some BPD things and like once she got divorced was you know always kind of searching for external validation for you know someone to make her feel better so both of my parents I kind of took a role as a caretaker like really young and kind of learning how to be there for them which you know has has made me an incredible trainer in coach is because I know exactly how to put someone else's needs before my own in order to make someone feel safe and heard and you know and and understood in these moments and when I was in school I was like football on school and I made the HD and couldn't find a major that worked and as soon as I got into psychology we got into like paired associations and you know the way in which fear is created and the way in which doubt is created and in their minds and you know the actual like neurochemistry that goes behind you know just thoughts and actions I became obsessed because it made it allowed me to make more sense of my my childhood and myself you know and for a long time it wasn't so much made it was more so than everybody else around me so what led to this psychology was just a obsession of like understanding you know me I was definitely like addicted to fitness mainly through football but then I quit football and then the fitness became even bigger out that and you know I was I was an angry I was an angry athlete I was an angry gym girl or everything was you know that was my that was my outlet which was great it served it's purpose but like you know sometimes having that outlet be so aggressive as one like you know I was getting injured I was getting angry so like it was getting angry that I was injured and I couldn't work out so over training just trying to chase something out yeah just just you know eradicating the demons and trying to to subdue the anger and the weather was you know before it was it wasn't taboo because I had football so it was like oh it was just training for football well then when I quit football you know and the training didn't stop that's you know I went from a 275 pound defense alignment to a bodybuilder like so then I took it even further like then it was okay well I grew up in a household that had no routine I never knew where the next meal was coming I never knew if my parents were going to be home after school so then I'm in college and it's like I can cook all of my meals I can measure all of my meals I can know exactly what my workouts can to be able to know exactly when I look like so it became a sense of like OCD well you you've geared to the completely opposite and the spectrum yes yeah I where I had no control growing up I knew they control was gonna give me peace and then that was like you know towards like the senior year my senior year of college and it was just like learning all of these things were helping me make sense of them but now you make sense of everything that doesn't necessarily mean that you're gonna change anything so it wasn't really until like getting into personal training where like most of my healing actually began because I mean countering all these people with these different minds and there are different ways of thinking and I became fascinated with getting to know these people like interpersonal not just and you know training with me is not just you know it's not just a one hour we're lifting we're sweating it's deep chat it's talk therapy it's whatever you know the client needs a to be and in understanding you know all these like we all have holes we all have these you know these these insecurities and that's like the most beautiful part of other gym is like everyone's coming in because they're insecure like the gym needs this because people are insecure or they're like afraid to die young you know whether they're getting a revenge body because they're insecure about a breakup or you know they're just trying to admit some people that I just want to be better you know I just want to move better I don't want to be in pain so psychology someone who's seeking therapy and someone who's coming to training is like it's just a vehicle in which that you're trying to get there and that's where like I'm all forth therapy I'm in therapy I'll always be in therapy but for me the self-evegacy and the confidence and effort that you put behind your training if you're also aware of why you're doing it you know and not to knock any you know anybody's success in and just therapy but like the things that I've seen people overcome and the people that I've watched evolve while becoming more self-aware and then using that awareness to aid in their transformation and then not become obsessed with the end result not become obsessed with that 15 pounds but understanding that like I need this movement I need this hour to love myself because a lot of times when we're in therapy it's just we're talking about what's wrong with us and you don't get that ability to like rebuild your back you rebuild yourself back up unless you kind of take that after you leave and with training and psychology compared to the other it's like you you can do that if you have intention and you understand why you're in that room and that's where you know the obsession with psychology and the obsession to the human brain all really began not so much that just you know studying it but watching people kind of you know unveil you know their vulnerabilities and then also use training is a vehicle to overcome it yeah it's I mean it's so profound that you've taken really years of the experiencing that you're describing and you've been able to apply it with what you're doing every day and you've applied it even it fits up with what you've done over there if you want to tell people about what you've done over there I think that's tremendous as well but I mean it's just it's a testament to you as a person and really resiliency I think is the best way to put it as well and and and I don't think I don't think people understand how resilient the human brain really can be but taking one step further I don't think they understand the work that probably has to go into you know looking back at years and years of let's call it trauma right and taking that not only to use it for good but also you know to to channel that and healthy healthy coping ways so I would love to hear a little bit about you what you've done at fit-ups and how you how your experience transfer it over to their organization as well yeah fit-ups you know they've gone they've taken it to the next level with their dinner with their and it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever been a part of um yeah it was the only time to my career that I ever showed up to something nervous I was like I know my stuff like I can all can do this but like this is a lot different because you know these are some of the toughest dudes in the world do you have all these you know navy seals, ex-marines, ex-military who have been struggling with their own PTSD and they've been struggling with their own addiction and you know alcoholism and as far as they know they're coming to a camp to get like trained by you know celebrity personal trainers you know gain a certification so that they can become repurposed and get put into society in terms of you know finding jobs and whatnot and I was doing it I don't know like three or four times a year for like a couple years of going down and teaching like the first 12 to 16 chapters of their um it wasn't nasum I forget the one that they use but of their of their um of their texts to get them prepared for this test but every night they do I was just it was just called performance talk because performance was sponsoring it and one of the vats were government is tell their stories and for the longest time they were performing talk was literally just people about their war stories it wasn't so much about how they got to war how they joined the military and there was the first or so I can camp I went to nobody signed up for it and I was like I would love to give my talk and obviously I don't have not been deployed I'm in the military and I told my story and um it then really shifted things in the way in which that these young men looked at their PTSD because I've been diagnosed with PTSD three times from age 7 to 20 22 so um you know for them to understand that like some of them probably have been struggling with PTSD way before they got to the military and that's actually part of the reason why they joined the military you know it is something to take them away from home it is something to for them to distract themselves from whatever trauma or anything that occurred before they joined the military because maybe they didn't have a lot of options and have a place to go um it's kind of where it really came down to and you know veterans unfortunately have the highest way to suicide in the country so this put this program became more of a suicide prevention program than anything and you know it it became my passion because it was where I really both had the ability to show these guys you know the emotional end of being a personal trainer not just the physical end and what's so beautiful whole one of the things I guess the one of the few things in military really does right and their training is they they really teach these guys how to take care of the person in front of them much like growing up in my house I had to learn how to take care of my parents and put myself second so we you know found a really you know close empathetic title that so these men and women you know as soon as they learn the text there there's their program to just be these incredible trainers because it's just you know how do I put this person's goals needs ahead of my own and you know watching them blossom and then repurpose them self and you know assembly back into culture it's just like one of the most beautiful profound things that I've ever been a part of and I had one of the guys live with me for like three months like interning me and perform eggs and you know it is it is um one of the few programs out there that is actually combining physical fitness not just from the repurposing their career but also getting them to understand that like you know your your paired associations and your trauma is like do not have to be like something that you you know keep on your back forever like a lot of things of PTSD is kind of like when we talked about like a cute pain like you shouldn't write a bike you have bad knees okay like same thing with PTSD like oh your PTSD because you were in a helicopter or a parachute probably shouldn't be in a room with helicopters right or like we work out in a room that has some helicopters you surround yourself with some good people you know and you you know I'm not saying like full-decentedization but like you understand that like your safe and that there's a way to overcome like you know there's a way to work through the pain and I watched these got these men and women do it you know for a couple years and it was to this day one of the you know most proud things I've ever been a part of I got super emotional about it um just because to watch people who'd feel like they don't have options and are played by you know their diagnosis to be able to just lift us up lift themselves up but also lift themselves up by helping other people and that's something I feel like I've been doing for years so that's that's fit-offs it's incredible stuff yeah I want to end the episode with a word of encouragement from yourself and everything that you've been through and the incredible career that you've built as a coach I like saying coach because it can mean so many different things right you know someone out there who is struggling with mental health who is using the gym to chase away some demons what is a word of encouragement that you can give them that maybe does get them to ship their mindset to put mental health not not ahead of physical but at least let it have a seat at the table with their physical health um there's my and there's a million things I would say I would you know the one line that I do have in there is that you know our bodies are the vehicle for our minds right so again you're you know trying to get your mind as healthy of not healthier than your body you know if you can take care of your body brain will also you know we'll feel that and it'll feel good and doing that and you know if you can keep yourself healthy enough to gather as many experiences as possible right to be there for the people you love to be there you know to find those you know those lighter days you know the thing is is with you know people who are struggling with mental health like you know there's got this lighthouse tattoo on the back of my arm because it's like you know there's there's always going to be darkness right like there's always going to be dark days but if you really know darkness like if you know true darkness that means that you know you do have the capacity to find the ultimate light you know if someone's lived a pretty gray life maybe not that's had maybe not that happy you know I'm not saying that they're selling them shorts that's their existence but like for people who are truly truly struggling to understand that no matter how dark something is they're can't they're cannot be darkness without the exact opposite so like the light is there it is on the other side you know and to keep trusting in yourself whether it is like through physically you know physicality or just the discipline that you are actually taking the time to love yourself every day because whether training meditation your nutrition you were you were showing yourself love and I think that the shift a lot of the shift that I try to get people to take is not looking at these as things that I have to do all I have to do my dog to have to do my meal prep I have to work out like these are things that you get to do like you get to do this you get to show yourself you know show yourself love give your body love give your mind you know an hour that is solely devoted to yourself and that whatever you do in that hour you know it's a lot of times like that doesn't matter how many reps and sets you did like did you spend an hour solely devoted to yourself like how many people do that not enough so you know getting people to shift their focus from the end result of what you know they're working towards and understanding that like every day that you show up for yourself like that is the win you know you gather a lot of wins and then you know hopefully the outcome comes but I'm doing my best to get people to just not completely forget what their goal is but to focus on you know consistency is a superpower and if you keep showing up for yourself and you keep showing yourself light and you give yourself grace you know to be upset to feel things that you're struggling with you know rather than running from them and rather than neglecting them you know that is that's beauty and you know so many people like I said before like I used to lift angry and you know it wasn't a good lift unless I left completely drained but like now I use it more like a meditation where it's like well I'm working out but why not just because I want to be healthy not because I want to keep my body healthy to experience more things but so that I can have something to offer myself every day I can give myself a gift every single day and to look at physical fitness and anything that goes into your physical well being because so many of us are so tied to our bodies but not our minds you know what did I do I took my supplements today I drank my protein shake today like that protein shake in the supplements can be equally as joyful for your brain as it is for your body if you look at that protein shake as as a form of self love if you look at that hour and the gym as an hour of meditation for you to just be alone with yourself you know instead of just the next thing you have to do so you know my my my send away there just to just you know if you're going through something right now and it seems like you know it is the darkest of nights I can understand that like that dark night is going to be you know it can last a little bit or it could last a blip but how bright isn't going to look when the sun actually shines through.
