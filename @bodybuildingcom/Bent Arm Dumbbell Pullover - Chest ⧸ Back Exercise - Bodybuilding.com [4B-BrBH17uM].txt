Place a dumbbell standing on in on a flat bench. Lie perpendicular on a bench with only your shoulders lying on the surface. Your hips should be below the bench with your legs bent and your feet firmly on the floor. Your head will be off the bench as well. Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest with a bend in your arms. Both palms should be pressed against the underside of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position. Now while keeping your arms in the bent position inhale and lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head, continue lowering the weight until you feel a stretch on your chest. Then exhale and raise the dumbbell back to the starting position through the same arc you used to lower the weight.
