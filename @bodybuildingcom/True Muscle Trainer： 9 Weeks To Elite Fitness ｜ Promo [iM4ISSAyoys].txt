For the True Muscle program, is a nine week brief-based program. What you're going to expect from me is the coaching staff. Don't swing them up. I'm Steve Weatherford. I am a plentcher for the New York Giants. Priority number one is performance, but it's a constant battle because I'm not a football player who loves fitness. I'm a fitness guy who plays football. The primary goal is to build muscle, but it's not the only goal. You know, anybody can come into the gym and train as hard as I can for one day. But can you do it day after day after a month after a year? To win the True Muscle program, I'm going to take you step by step. You're going to get the sets. You're going to get the reps. And a lot of cool form cues to help you get better results. We're going to condition the muscle. And we're going to help you build the physique that you've always wanted.
