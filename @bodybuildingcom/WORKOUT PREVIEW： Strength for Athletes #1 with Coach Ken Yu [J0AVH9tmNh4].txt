Hi everybody, bodybuilding.com, Master Coach, can you here and I'm about to get you through a strength for athletes workout. We got kettlebell squats, one more rows and leg lowers for our first set of exercises. We got locked and loaded. Come up. We're getting some nice squats. We're gonna push. Big key here. It's getting a big nice stretch. Really pushing with those legs. It's a quad exercise. If you're not feeling your quads, you're not doing it right. That's the only thing I really want you to focus on. Drive with those knees. Feel those squats. Last one. 15. Perfect. Next up we got Renegade rows.
