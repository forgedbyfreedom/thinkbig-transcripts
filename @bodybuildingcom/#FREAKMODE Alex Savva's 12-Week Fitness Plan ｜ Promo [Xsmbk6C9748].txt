My name is Alex Sava, I live and breathe fitness. The Freak Mode mindset of never settling is going to help you get the best transformation out of this 12 week trainer and also it's going to translate into other areas of your life. When you're willing to go the extra mile and you're not willing to give up on your passion and your goal, you're going to truly realize who you are as a person. When a lot of the people that I was growing up with, the life was going one way, my life was going another way because I had a place to full manage. I would just hate to leave something out on the table that I know that I could have accomplished. It is true when you love what you do, you don't feel like you're working, but I love to work. How many times have you heard people say, I hate my job, but they're still at the job about 10 years later. I don't like my physique, but they still have the same physique. At one point you have to say, enough is enough. I want something else for myself, I want something better, I'm passionate about that, and I'm going to pursue that to the fullest. That's Freak Mode. If you don't work hard at it, you don't stay on top of it, then it can all disappear. I'm giving you more than just a 12 week trainer. This Freak Mode program is about making an amazing transformation for all weeks. We're also learning, we get Rick, stay Rift, it's a part of your daily lifestyle.
