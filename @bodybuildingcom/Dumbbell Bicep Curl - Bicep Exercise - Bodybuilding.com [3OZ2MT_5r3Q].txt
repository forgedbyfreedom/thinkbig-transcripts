Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand at arms length. Keep your elbows close to your torso and hold the dumbbells at your side with a neutral grip. This will be your starting position. Now keeping the upper arm stationary exhale and curl the weights while rotating your hands so the palms are facing up. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps. Then inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
