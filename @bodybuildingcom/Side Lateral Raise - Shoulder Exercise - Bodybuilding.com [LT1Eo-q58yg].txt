To start hold a dumbbell in each hand and stand up straight, the dumbbells will rest at your sides at arms length while the palms of your hands face you. This will be your starting position. Now maintaining a stationary torso, exhale and lift the dumbbells to your side with a slight bend in your elbow. Your hands should be tilted slightly forward as if pouring a glass of water. Continue to raise the weight until your arms are parallel to the floor. While spurred brief moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position.
