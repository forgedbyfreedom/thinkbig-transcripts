This is command number two. Listen up motherfucker. Question. Question for yourself. What is impossible? Never accept the limitations of someone else. Somebody told you that it's impossible. Don't even try. Give up before you even fucking try it for yourself. Never accept the goddamn limitation that someone else has placed it on you. These side for your fucking self. What is your limitation? Try it to you son of a bitch. Try it for your fucking self. Damn that is the only way. The only fucking way to know if you can't do something. I can't even a fucking try. That's how I know. Get your punk ass in there and give it a try.
