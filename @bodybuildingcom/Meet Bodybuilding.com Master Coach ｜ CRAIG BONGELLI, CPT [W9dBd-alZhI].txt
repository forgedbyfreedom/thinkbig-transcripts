My name is Craig Bungelie and I am a bodybuilding.com master coach. I was pursuing my dream of becoming a professional athlete. I realized all the things I was learning to move myself forward, could help other people as well. And it was a natural transition for working as a coach. After seeing Scotland's strongest man when I was 17 years old and being a star, being a professional strong man was all I focused on. Becoming a coach, opening a gym, mentoring with some of the strongest athletes and coaches on the planet to learn as much as I possibly could. I build my body because I want to know what I'm capable of. For no other purpose in feeling what it's like to redline it and find out what I have. Welcome to Bodybuilding.com. Build your body.
