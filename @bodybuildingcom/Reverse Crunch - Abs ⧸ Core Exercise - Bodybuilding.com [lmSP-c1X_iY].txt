Line your back on a mat with your knees bent and your hands to your side. Lift your legs and bend your knees to 90 degrees. This will be your starting position. Now pull your knees in toward your chest and hold as you exhale. Slowly lower your legs back to the starting position as you inhale. Remember, don't use momentum to swing your legs up. And it keep the motion controlled by your abdominals.
