Hi my name is Ashley Sheets and my body is Ms. Profile as Heidi I am. I had first come to bodybuilding.com through my decision to change my life and change where I was healthfully. I had lost 40 pounds and in the beginning of my journey I went to bodybuilding.com to look at transformations of the week which my boyfriend sent me a link to Tiffany Furnace and I just found motivation that way and seriously at work I would look every other Friday and every day actually just it like what was going on and just find people that inspired me to push harder and move forth and that's what I found at bodybuilding.com. I was also a transformation of the week which when I saw Tiffany Furnace transformation at thought in my head I want that so bad like this is what I want. So I don't even know if I never visited bodybuilding.com. I mean honestly I don't even know if I would be here. Standing here right now today I feel very grateful is the word I want to use because you guys chose me to be a part of this photo shoot and it's really emotional for me because I just think it's so great that you guys are giving someone else an opportunity and everyone's been so great and I'm just really happy to be here.
