Alright, now jump in, let me show you something to look good. This is too high for you, so you have to step all the way back in order to pull. You want this to be like right above. I level, so it's easier to control. So this is the weight, right? So we're here instead of sitting back, stand here, bring it up, just come to the stretch. Your upper body comes down, then you bring your torso up, squeeze up here. Alright, step back slightly, not too far. You're going to lean forward into the weight, lean, and then push the bar down. And then four stretch one. Good, and then up comes up. Yep, when you stretch, bring it up, your body down, so you can get that stretch in the left. Nice, right there. Down, stretch, stretch, stretch. Very thick. Good job, you know. Come on, come on, come on. It's starting to shake already. That's how you know you're using your back, now your legs. Come on, one more, one more. Up, up. Nice, let it go. How does that feel? Exactly, exactly, alright? Good job.
