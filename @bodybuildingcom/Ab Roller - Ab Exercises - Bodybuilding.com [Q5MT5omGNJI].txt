Hold the ab roller with both hands while kneeling on the floor. Place the ab roller in front of you so that you are on your hands and knees. This should look like you're about to do a kneeling pushup and will be your starting position. Now inhale and slowly roll the ab roller forward. Stretch your body into a straight position going down as far as you can without touching the floor with your body. After a brief pause in the stretched position, exhale and start pulling yourself back to the starting position.
