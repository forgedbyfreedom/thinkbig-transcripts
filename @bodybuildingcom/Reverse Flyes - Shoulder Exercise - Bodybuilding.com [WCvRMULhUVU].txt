Lion and incline bench with your chest and stomach pressed against the incline. Have dumbbells in each hand with the palms of your hands facing each other. Extend your arms in front of you so they are perpendicular to the angle of the bench. Your legs should be stationary while applying pressure with the balls of your feet. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and raise the weights away from each other and to the sides while keeping a slight bend in your elbow. Try to squeeze your shoulder blades together to get the most effect from the sexier size. Your arms should raise until they are parallel to the floor. Once you've reached the top contracted position hold for a brief moment, then exhale and slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position.
