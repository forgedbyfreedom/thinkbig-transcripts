My name is Ken Yu and I'm a bodybuilding.com master coach. I used to be in a journey and for 10 years I sat at my desk, poured over the old documents, I started prioritizing work over my own health and then I decided to join a future finisher. I still love the pit. I wanted to do that every hour of every day. I went from feeding my body down to building my body up and then became a coach and I never looked back. I love how bodybuilding.com has evolved over time. It used to be only about big muscles and now it's so much more. It's parallel to my fitness training. But I first started out all I wanted to do was get really big. I went from 125 to 150 pounds and then I even wanted to do strength and I pulled off the website of 5.5 program and did that until I was really strong. And now I'm looking for more wellness. I want to be prepared to take on any challenge. Welcome to Bodybuilding.com. Build your body. Build your mind. Build your life.
