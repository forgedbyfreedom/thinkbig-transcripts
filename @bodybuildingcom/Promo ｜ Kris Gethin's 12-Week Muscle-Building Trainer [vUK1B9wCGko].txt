MUSIC Live reporting from Mumbai. We're on the way to the gym right now. Meals already prepared here. If I go to the gym, I'm going to fucking walk. That's enough to talk for now. Let's have some action. For the next three months, we're going to control our environments, hold each other accountable and become training partners. But you have to do exactly what I tell you to do. We'll eat, train, travel and grow together. I'm going to be your personal trainer who will be with you every rep, set and step away across 84 daily videos on bodybuilding.com. All for free, but you need to commit. Other screw around, so don't screw me around. Every meal, every rep can't smell. Fuck it genetics and fuck it busy lifestyle. Kill your excuses. This knee was fucking killing me. I don't cheat. I'll never quit. I'll only roll. I should be doing at least four flights aside there. Grow with me. 92.8. I'm nearly three kilos. And we won. I can definitely feel it this week. That was just a work out of form hell. Really fucked up today. I've done some serious damage. I had an MRI yesterday and whatever the outcome, it does with the matter. I can't stop. I don't have the luxury of stopping. You've got to embrace that pain this pleasure. I said it was going to finish strong, didn't I? Night night.
