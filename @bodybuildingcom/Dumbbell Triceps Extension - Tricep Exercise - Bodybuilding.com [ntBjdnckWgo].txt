Your feet should be about shoulder width apart from each other. Use both hands to grab the dumbbell and lift it over your head until both arms are fully extended. The resistance should be resting on the palms of your hands with your thumbs wrapped around it. The palms of your hands should be facing up towards the ceiling. This will be your starting position. Keeping your upper arms close to your head with your elbows in and perpendicular to the floor. Lower the resistance in a semi-circular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Breathe in as you perform this step. Now go back to the starting position by using your triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.
