Rastame Starch is a star tree's carbohydrate that comes from a certain type of corn, then when you cut it and put it on the microscope, it looks waxy. And that's why I got the name Waxi-Mane Starch. Rastame Starch actually is a slow-dad gesting, low-glaced seemic, low-inch-slim-spicic carb, and it raises blood sugar gradually, and brings it down so it's a good long-distance or long-term carb to use without a blood sugar crash. Rastame Starch because it enters the blood slowly, give you a person that are involved in long periods of training, or people that have a blood sugar crash when they take other carbs, because over a long period of time it doesn't lead to a blood sugar crash. Rastame Starch, you can use it before training, you can use it about an hour before training, to allow the slow-dad gesting carb to get into blood, or you can use it right after training, to combine it with protein, and because it leads to slow gradual insulin rise and a slow blood sugar rise, it can be something that can be used for recovery if you get a blood sugar crash from other carbs.
