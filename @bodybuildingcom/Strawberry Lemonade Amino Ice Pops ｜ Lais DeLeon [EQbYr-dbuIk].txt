Hey guys, I'm Lise Dileon and I'll leave for her athlete and today I'm going to show you how to make my strawberry lemonade amino popsicles. This recipe is super quick and easy. First we're going to start by filling a shaker bottle with water. Then we'll add four scoops of NLA for her pink lemonade amino's and the juice of half a lemon. Then just shake it up and fill the popsicle molds about three quarters of the wafel. Next slice and add one strawberry to each popsicle mold. Last just cover and put them in the freezer overnight. In this recipe I use strawberries but you can use any fruit you like. Just have fun with it. I love this recipe because it's a fun summer tree that's guilt free and I can keep on hand for whenever I'm creating something sweet. The step-by-step guide and macronutrient breakdown for this recipe can be found in the article below here on bodybuilding.com.
