Connect a standard handle to a tower and move the cable to the highest pulley position. With your side to the cable, grab the handle with one hand and step away from the tower. You should be approximately arms length away from the pulley with the tension of the weight on the cable. Your outstretched arm should be aligned with the cable. With your feet positioned shoulder width apart, reach upward with your other hand and grab the handle with both hands. Your arm should still be fully extended. Now, in one motion, pull the handle down and across your body to your front knee while rotating your torso. Keep your back in arm straight and your core tight while you pivot your back foot behind your knees to get a full range of motion. Maintain your stance and keep your arm straight. Return to the starting position in a slow and controlled manner. Repeat this motion to failure. Then switch sides.
