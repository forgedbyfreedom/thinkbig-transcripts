Slide back on a flat bench. Use a closed grip to lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms straight. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and slowly lower the bar down until it nearly touches your middle chest. Be sure to keep your elbows close to your torso at all times to maximize tricep involvement. After a brief pause at the bottom contracted position, exhale and raise the bar back to the starting position using your triceps to push the bar upward.
