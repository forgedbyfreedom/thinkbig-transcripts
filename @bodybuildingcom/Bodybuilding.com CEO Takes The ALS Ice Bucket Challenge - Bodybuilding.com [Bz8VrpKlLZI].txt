Hi, I'm Ryan Delucas, CEO of Bodybuilding.com. I've been nominated by many people to do the Ice Bucket Challenge, so thank you for that. ALS is a condition that affects the family members of many of our team members here at Bodybuilding.com. So I'm proud today to participate in Ice Bucket Challenge. I'll donate $100 mark-company in our team members for every bucket that's poured on me. I'd also like to nominate Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jake Keller, the Bodybuilder, and author Bill Phillips. So I guess here we go, $100. I'm not quite ready. OK. Oh, that was horrible. All right. Oh, no. I like to do it now. I'm not sure if you're saying everybody's fired. And that's a hundred buckets, so we're donating $10,000 to ALS. Yeah. Great job Evan. Horrible. vegant. Now, let's see what you've got to say about it. You really are one part. I got to go to horrors. sorry about that, Ryan.
