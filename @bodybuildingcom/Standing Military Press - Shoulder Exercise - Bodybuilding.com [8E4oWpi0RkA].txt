Stand with a loaded barbell in front of you. Grab the barbell with an overhead grip wider than shoulder width. Clean the bar to shoulder height. This will be your starting position. Now press the bar overhead taking care to move your head out of the bar's path. Exhale during this portion of the motion. Then inhale and slowly lower the bar back down to your shoulders.
