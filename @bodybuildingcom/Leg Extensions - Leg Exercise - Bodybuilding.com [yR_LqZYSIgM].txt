First, choose your weight and sit on the leg extension machine with your legs under the pad and your hands holding the sidebars. This will be your starting position. You'll need to adjust the pads so that it fits snug on top of your lower legs. Make sure your legs form a 90-degree angle between your lower and upper leg. Using your quadriceps, exhale and extend your legs while the rest of your body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second in the contracted position, then inhale and slowly lower the weight back to the original position.
