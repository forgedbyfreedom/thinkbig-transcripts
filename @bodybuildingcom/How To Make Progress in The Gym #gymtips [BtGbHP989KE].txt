Good day guys, sick off to my last post on how to make progress in the gym. We discussed 4 key points out of 8 which are 1, No Your Body, 2, improve your nutrition. 3, your eyes lifting weights, 4, choose more effective exercises, 5, increase your workout density. You could increase your reps and set for instance. If you squat, 1.35 pounds for 5 and it's felt so easy, next time try to aim for 8 reps or more. That way, you'd be checking up your workout density. 6, don't prioritize in your lifting. In your lifting is a phase that we all want to experience. When we get to a certain point of lifting personally, I feel like it's not impacting to want to test your strength or feel strong and confident. Or try to impress any only cause. Who would happen to be around you in the gym? But don't make it a priority. 7, because it's not in a life-compagrass without consistency. 10, both to the gym, because I thought not to be consistent with the grind. 8, the patience. This is the part where most people are missing it. You want to get resulting in one month, which is not realistic. 4, in strength. Do you know how long it took you to idle so much weight? It's probably months or years. So how do you expect to lose it in weeks? You just gotta put in the word, I'll be patient. If you find this helpful, kindly share with your friend and family and don't forget to follow. Thank you.
