Thank you for having me on. I am honored to be here right now. Awesome. Well, we're excited to jump in. We're excited to have you on today and we're starting out with topic one as usual. Everybody building Jake. So this is our opportunity to learn a little bit about our guest where they come from the story that brought them here today. Jake tells us a little bit about your background and health and fitness and tell us about you know point A to point Z of rope brought you here today. Yeah, for sure. So I guess it started back when I was 12 13 dad got me into lifting. I played high hockey growing up. So very into sports lifting, etc. About 16 17 I decided and I don't know where I got in my head that I'm going to move to New York. I grew up in St. Louis and I wanted to be an editor of the minse health. So basically I wanted to work and finish editorial. So basically from 18 on I shifted my whole career and trajectory of life towards that single goal. So 19 rolls around. I moved to New York to go to college. That's where I started doing my actions. As science bachelor's, eventually went back to my master's was also training all throughout college and my thought was if I get the educational background and training that's better to then tie into the editorial background so that way I can kind of be my own expert in whatever anything else. And have a level up. I think on just journalists who report on the stuff but then have to go out of their way for quotes and eventually finish my master's, Mr. Training College, landed a job at a company called barbond.com which like we a lot of folks listening have seen. They are a strength sports media site. They cover a cross-fit, strongman, weightlifting, etc. Work there for four years was their first employee helped them build up a lot of different verticals for their fitness content and eventually got to a point where I was just burnt out and started asking myself what I want to do in an ideal world and that's where that fit for in my business now kind of came to full circle in the sense of tying in my training background but also love for design and performance gear because growing up like I wanted to be a designer for like a peril and stuff like that and that's a whole other story we could talk about but it basically tied all these things together and being my own boss seemed really interesting like I had never came from an entrepreneurial background so taking that leap was a completely buffet. Had no idea how I was going to go, had like no money saved up or anything basically just started on a whim and yeah three and a half years later that fit friend has been my bread and butter and my baby and that's what I do full time. Have the website YouTube channel and the social channels and we have a really dynamite community and on that I basically share fitness content to tie in the coaching background to scratch that edge because I think it's very important if you're going to be reviewing performance gear to have the background there and also be walking the talk basically. It's a rare combination with the editorial and the journalistic background blending with the exercise science and fitness you know it's it's a hybrid that we don't see too often and it's definitely a unique POV to be able to put this type of content out. Let's back up and talk about what goes into achieving a degree in exercise science tell people a little bit about the learnings that come out of something like that how that blends well with the quick follow-up that is the CSES certification right so give us some contextual background there. Yeah and college I was going to Hosh University that's where we actually met and the basic like foundation of that is you know by a mechanic learning your basics for personal training how to navigate that and navigate clients and everything else and I think what really helps with the educational background in that context is also just personal training at the same time because it almost blends like this academia with actual practice because a lot of times I don't think academia really delivers in the sense of the situations you're going to navigate from a psychological standpoint with clients and just how everybody is different and they're biomechanics and how they think and how they move and so the schooling was really fun and interesting and there was a lot of I would say biomechanic focus in the Hoshia program and I think they did a really good job of trying to set us up for success if we wanted to go like the formal college coaching or collegiate coaching or professional coaching route or if we wanted to do our own personal training thing or find something else but but yeah I think for me during that time too like the blending of the writing component that's what I felt like it was kind of lacking and so that's why it was for me very important to in turn a place is to where I could write and do freelance stuff and I think for most trainers in school if you're going to school for exercise science writing is such an invaluable skill to build up and doing it just over and over and over getting reps in because it likely your program won't have a writing focus in it I think it'd be huge and it could open up so many doors outside of just training and then all of a sudden you're doing freelance work for different companies and blending in your coaching background and then you also you can market yourself better if you want to go to your own business route the foundation of like getting an exercise science bachelor's because I have a lot of folks who often ask me is it worth it? I think it is worth it in the sense of giving you a level up over you know just going to get your personal training certification because you should be doing these things in tangent to one another I think having that educational background teaching you the foundations of biomechanics and some of the teachings in the sense of how to navigate different contexts of training and different settings whether that is from a healthcare perspective a sports perspective a collegiate professional team etc it's really cool because it gives you I think just more exposure and to okay how could I realistically take this career and degree into different directions but all that to say I think it's also very important that if you do go to school for it you definitely want to be personal training at the same time and blending in what you're navigating on a day-to-day because academia I think at times and I think more schools are picking up speed here they kind of drop the ball in the sense of like prepping a lot of the students for the day-to-day of what personal training looks like or like coaching or you know offering you a different lens into how this degree can basically help elevate your career and so blending in that personal training element with the academia side when what you're learning and academia is cool because then you could like take things that you learn put them into practice and then also with the editorial side of my life I would highly suggest even if you don't want to go that editorial route as a trainer as somebody who might be doing exercise science or considering it start writing more writing is one of the most valuable tools I think everybody can possess and that's not only just from like an editorial or journalist standpoint but from a marketing standpoint being able to language yourself better even just being able to articulate thoughts better when comes your own life being able to do that more cohesively on paper is such a skill but yeah it's it's interesting like I get asked that all the time is it worth it to do my bachelor's and exercise science is it worth it to my master's and in some cases no in some cases yes but I think if you do decide to go that route it can give you a level up if you're also considering okay how else do I implement this into where I want to take my career next? I think the your point about putting it into practice is probably the most important takeaway that I heard through that I think too often you know our heads are in the books where like you said we're not getting out there and getting the real life experience until probably you get your degree right so learning it in real time being able to take those situations that you might be put in when working with individuals and then bring it back into the classroom with your professors and say hey what happens when XYZ happens and learning that right there can just I think double the productivity of that degree that you're there for absolutely and I think that's actually you bring a really there were times I remember in school where you know we would talk about something I would implement that in the gym or I would learn something in the gym and then I would bring it back and then to make them I'll make it almost a case study with my professors and like you know students at the time who I was homey's with and we would just chat and figure it out and to that point it's it's so incredibly valuable and I think don't wait until you get your degree to start doing that stuff because I know folks from school who did that and then they either wanted and stick with it and it's like okay now you have a bachelor's in this and you're not even using it for your career because you waited and then you feel like you're behind and then you find something else to do because you feel like you're so behind that you're just like kind of give up but really making sure that you're getting ahead of that and just being able to think of training and from a different lens because now I think with social media and everything too we have so many different points of view that if you're not putting some of those into practice it can almost feel so overwhelming and get you here per hour so by analysis like looking at all these concepts without physically practicing them and figuring out okay what do I resonate with how do I blend these things together what is this actually look like in practice is this valuable do I need this because there is a lot of knowledge you're going to learn in academia that you likely will never implement and that's okay but at least you have the availability and the options to know what's realistic and what's not realistic versus like with the actual career and what you plan to do with training. Yeah I agree I mean we're in the era of information overload specifically on on social media and I think the skill set of being a really great writer can set you apart on a lot of these platforms you know acquiring the skill to create a 15 second video a lot of people can do that but if you really dedicate the time to becoming a really fantastic writer you're putting that work into your captions your writing blog and editorial content that you use your social media platform to drive to and create extra value for your followers I think that's really kind of the the type of creator that's going to outlast the short form way that we're living through right now 100% and I mean it just gives you another level up on connecting with more folks right because not everybody resonates with the 15 second clip and I think we're getting to a point now where it's like you see so many things it's like boom it's gone people have already forgotten but I think what I'm noticing at least within myself that I am clicking you on the creators and people who I like to look up to more and more from that level of depth that makes me feel something outside of just entertain me for that 15 seconds so the entertainment stuff is awesome the short form is awesome but being able to tie this nice cohesive message that I can then think about and think of myself and then maybe even put into my own articulation of writing kind of figure out like okay like I really like what they said here but how do I put that into my own life and well it is like what does that mean to me how can I extrapolate data from this and implement that into how I look at the world of my systems and I think that's to your point just that's like a level of depth that you can reach now in audience that won't necessarily always be reached from that way so it's just a bigger shot on that regarding bringing in eyeballs to connect with you and I think piggyback off of this I think where we're going now with social media too is community is going to be the biggest outlast for folks who build dynamite brands and being able to build connection is I think what people are craving more and more that's why we're seeing a big boom and experiences and brands doing that route and brands trying to invest more in creating more of a storytelling element behind everything they do and that all circles back to writing and be able to do that and articulate that and blend it all together and reach more people doing so. I couldn't agree more when do you feel like you really started to put the editorial craft into action you know for your own career and start blending the fitness and wellness background with the writing and media. So I think my first exposure with physically trying to write more about fitness was back when I was like 17 or 18 on Tumblr and I thought about it. Tumblr and like it was and I think about that content and I hesitate because I'm like I don't think any of that's left on the internet but like if you find it like please don't share it forever share with me because it is so cringe but that's when I started getting a little bit of a dip into you know just putting more of my thoughts out there with the training interest with writing and then from there I interned at a gym and college where I was personal training and they had a website and stuff and I was like hey can I build your blog? I don't know what I'm doing I'm just like I want to write and like write about the things I'm learning at school right about the things I'm doing here in the gym with the clients we have it helped them build up their blog and then one thing needs to another and that's just like passively doing that because I just was ahead of the interest there and like my dream was to do the editorial route and then loan behold by to a shop corporate found my writing on their blog and had hunted me and landed a job there as a content writer and then loan behold far bend wrote for them randomly because I was like hey I just want to write and like put this like topic on paper as a post activation potential and one thing I do another there and then it landed me a job and then four years later now I'm not running my own thing that's very based in writing so it's like this it was very much like a baby step of like cringe little bit less cringe little bit less cringe it's the evolution right and it's awesome to hear so tell us a little bit more about that bit friend tell us you know what you're doing here and why you're so passionate about putting out this content yeah and so I think the base route of that fit for an awye started it outside of just my own interest in that niche of performance gear and also training is I think when we look around the reviews industry in these strengths boards and just like the fitness space there's a lot of BS and there's a lot of reviews out there that I think can be a little bit misleading for example like roundups from like a New York mag or one of these big editorials that don't have people really testing the stuff it was kind of my nudge to be like okay if I wanted to build this type of content like what I want that to look like what level of depth would I want to present in this that ties in the background the showing you everything I'm doing in the shoes and everything else it was that like need for connection and honesty that I think kind of thrust me into that fit friend and that's what kind of like really lights my fire in the sense of what keeps me going when it feels like everything is like just kind of you know imploding out of myself and that the rat race of content and everything when I feel exhausted but the the ability to I think just build honest reviews and try to create a community that is fostered with trust and everything else because that I think with review content too and I'm curious your thoughts here I feel like there is a line you have to strike between integrity and capitalism because obviously you need to make money but at the same time like where does that pendulum swing I think oftentimes for some of these folks it goes way too far into the make as much money as we can burn out all the trust at all those costs and then where does that get us it gets us to people not trusting content not trusting reviews and that fit friends basis I think is really on that hey I'm a small business I'm a single dude producing all this content I'm going to show you exactly what I'm doing and if you ever have questions I'll be honest with you does the product suck I'll tell you does it is a great I'll tell you who is the best for and I think that's where for me it's really interesting to keep being in front of in the sense of the coaching background too with the brand is just being able to recognize the context in which things are great not great for and then you know building a more home like homey like small business feel with it I think something that is applicable to brands regardless of size is that they need to lead with injecting more value into what they're doing creating a better product a lot of this starts with just quality products and caring about the product that you're putting out into the world and building that trust you know we always like to say something to the not of leading with content and community and that ultimately resulting in what you're looking for on a commerce front right so giving people and providing that trust value to them through the content that you're producing building real valuable community you know how many brands don't even know where to start when it comes to creating and nurturing a community that would solve a lot of you know kind of question marks that are sitting in top executive's heads right now who are in a meeting room looking at the numbers if you lead with quality community and content it can likely solve a lot of your commerce woes and you know when it comes to reviews to your point they've become a bit saturated right and we're seeing all these tools being injected we're seeing all these platforms who are specializing in in bumping the SEO and bumping your top quality reviews and problem is and and reality is it's probably your product that you need to go back and look at right yeah 100% yeah it's interesting and I feel like we're in this day and age now too or we're seeing like I think affiliate marketing start to die a little bit more because how many times do you get people just pushing product to push product to make money and that's okay great cool like I'm already forgot about it I've already moved on it's been interesting too I think talking to brands because I buy everything I review and they're always like well like you don't have a big following so blah blah yeah but like the big influencer is not going to convert for you in the sense of you know giving you the the trusting eyeballs that you want and to your point it all starts a community and you don't need a huge community I think to really build a dynamite business brand product etc you just need enough people to understand the why in the mission and have them buy in and then from there just let everything else just grow organically and that's been like I think the basis of that fit for him too and that's something that I'm very proud of is that the community has grown nice and slow and organically and I love that people are like oh like well don't you don't you want like your vidrio go viral as I know because I don't know then who's going to be coming into the channel like I want people to be subscribed and like following that you know give a damn that want to actually see the content I don't really care about growing that fast because like I know how much I need to get by on a day-to-day basis from a business context and that allows me I think to be really much more conscious of that underlying element of what value am I providing you and do you actually want to be here? Well go to the BB com marketing master class every funny I agree with you the days of the macro influencer I think have really become depleted I think the trust that we are just speaking to a moment ago really lives within the micro and the nano world of individuals who are wholeheartedly using these products on a daily basis and there are some brands who are caught up with that fact and they are contracting that size of influencers at scale and there are others who are blowing their entire influencer and marketing budget on the one to two nano's a quarter and scratching their heads looking at a very low ROI on those contracts. The big question that I always think about with that fit friend and like that idea too of like also where I want to take this business next which is eventually a brick and mortar is like what is the strongest element to get you to buy a product? It's a referral from a friend. Anybody in your circle that you trust that is like hey this is actually a dynamite product like go get it that is so much better than just seeing it really fast from a marketing lens or like an nano influencer and that's I think also like the basis of it too is when you think about whatever you're producing whatever it is like wood I recommend this to a friend or would I buy this if a friend recommended it to me and if you lead with that it's a game changer regarding just how you conceptualize content and how you foster those connections within the people who are consuming your content. Yeah I agree it's a great stress test for shoes for supplements. Would you give this to your parents? Would you put your siblings in this? Would you put your friend of 10 years in this or suggest that they start taking this on a daily basis? That's a really great filter for a good product. 100% and I think speaking too you know more of this reviews industry when I think really gets under my skin is when you see some of these reviews that are very shallow and it's just like money driven. I think about the beginner like my mom to your point like when you said parents it kind of triggered this but it's like my mom she likes to work out at home she doesn't know much about fitness and stuff but she'll go to like you know a CNN and see like this nice review but she doesn't realize that it's honestly all like it's all fake for the most part in the sense of like they're not really testing stuff it's all affiliate driven and it's just like where do we where do we walk then tow that line of okay like at what point guys do we have to like you know create a higher buried entry to make a lot of this stuff way more worthwhile in the sense of consumption, producing, etc and yeah we're in a very interesting place I think right now with the review space too and just I think people are losing trust in it because of the types of sites like that and the types of content like that and it's making it very difficult I think for me but at the same time speaking to the slow growth and organic and connection community standpoint I think what people do find the channel hopefully they're like oh like this is sick like I've had so many people comment like hey I spent more time trying to research to find you than I actually did like anything else with the product and it's been cool I think seeing that but yeah it's an interesting industry right now and we're seeing I think a pretty tumultuous nature of is it really feasible to build a reviews business anymore like what does that look like and that's kind of where I'm starting to shift my mindset too with the business yeah I agree I want to move into topic two for today the closing thought for our first topic I really think everything that we're talking about really is why we're seeing the decline of the big giants that have been around for the past 10 15 20 25 years and we're seeing the rise of the quote unquote little guys right and your testament to that who are just doing really honest work people are in dire need and desperation for finding people like you so good was everything you're doing and let's let's jump into the the meat and potatoes of today's discussion which is topic two footwear matters so Jake's gonna drop some knowledge on us today and we're gonna start with the question why are shoes so important for accomplishing different training goals yeah for context to that fit friend the shoes I review are cross-training shoes we're lifting shoes barefoot shoes all of the shoes have different purposes and I think when we look at the footwear industry sometimes it could be a little bit dogmatic and people can box themselves into one thing and I think looking at shoes is tools in the sense of how are you training what are your preferences how are you moving that's the more productive way to look at shoes and so it's for example like my folks out there who love barefoot shoes and love training barefoot I am all for it I train barefoot often I train barefoot shoes often but I'm also not necessarily limiting myself to that type of footwear alone and I implement all of these different types of shoes based on what I'm doing if I'm doing a cross-fit-watt for example and I ran the day before I might be feeling more beat up and if I train barefoot or barefoot shoes the amount of stress and just load on my body in terms of the ground reaction the force it might be too much so being able to build this lens of how am I training what am I doing what are my preferences how I'm moving and then blending that with different types of footwear I think that's the secret sauce and I think when people finally started adapting that mindset of okay what type of footwear is gonna allow me to perform my best and this is the type of footwear that isn't you know blanket with my bias is my brand royalty that I just buy every time like I'm a Nike I buy Nike okay but those Nike they're actually subpar for what you're doing like if you get out of that lens in mindset of this is what I've always done and you look at shoes instead of hey this is a tool solely to prop up my performance and my comfort and my preference it changes the game and that's how I try to language shoes on the channel in the sense of hey I like to use a little bit of everything based on what I'm doing now how you want to do it that's your own bread and butter like figure that out and you go do a lot of trial and error do a lot of testing to see but leading with that mindset of this is solely a tool to get me from point A to point B in the most efficient and you know best way possible regarding my biomechanics and how I'm moving where do we even start on the hunt for a good shoe for something like this like there's tow job there's a new troit there's all there's all this terminology out there right and we go to the product pages on you know the big footwear brands and we will read the details well what if you don't have a clue right and you're looking to to get a new pair you know we can put a specific sport into place but I don't know what are the key features and characteristics that you're looking to take into account yeah so let's talk cross-training shoes I feel like that's the broadest topic regarding what people are using in the gym this is the type of shoe that you're going to use for a little bit of everything you can lift in them you can do some short runs give or take like every we're all training shoes a little bit different in that context but then also it's a shoe that you can do agility and different type of versatile workouts maybe some hidden and when you look at cross-training shoes like think of them on this massive spectrum of stability versatility somewhere on the line the shoe is going to fall and that's where you're going to then think about okay how am I training every week if you're somebody for example lifting three times a week you do a hit class and then you maybe do some short runs you're going to want to shoe that probably toes that line a little bit more on the versatility side so you're going to want something it's a little bit more plush and a little bit more responsive but you also want to be stable enough to lift in now when we start to focus in on that and how you plan to use that shoe then we could start diving into some of these construction details and if there's anything you take away from this podcast with cross-training shoes three construction details that can really be huge to think about that really aren't that complex that you could pretty much identify pretty fast from a product page is number one the midsole of the shoe this is that layer of material that separates the outsole aka the bottom of the shoe from the foot so it's that foam layer that is going to dictate how much stability and responsiveness that shoe has generally speaking lighter density foams more plush foams there'll be a little bit more bounty little bit more comfortable and then you'll have like you know lower stack height aka the height of that midsole the shoe itself that height of material that separates your foot from the floor will be lower it'll be a bit more dense that's going to give you more stability and balance and so when you think about what you're doing for this person who's lifting doing some hit and doing some short runs they'll want something that probably toes that middle ground a little bit more on the edge of her utility again it's going to be a bit more responsive and comfortable it's not going to beat them up when they're running if they're not used to running on a denser surface the second future to consider is the outsole now when you're thinking about how you're training so you're that person that you lift you do some hit you run I feel like we need a shoe here I feel like you need a feel he's going to take a shoe off everybody go look I like to okay this is also running shoe so like we're going to have to like we're just going to use the pieces of the shoe yeah so midsole is the foam material right here as you can see like a running shoe very bouncy very plush now running shoes we're not going to dive into them right now but they have a huge range of midsole's and feels and et cetera but for the cross training shoe example this wouldn't be a good shoe for lifting and this wouldn't be a good shoe for somebody who does that lifting hit training like running bias because likely you won't get the stability you want for your lifting context and because you're lifting more than you're doing hit running that would indicate to me you should probably look for a training shoe for this and then if you want to do longer runs maybe find your running shoe for that or find a separate shoe for that the second construction future to look at is the outsole so this is the bottom of the shoe this is going to be what's going to give you traction and grip in the gym so when you're thinking about how you're training so lifting hit doing some short runs generally speaking what are the surfaces you're training on are you training on turf are you training on rubber gym floors wooden platforms etc that will dictate what type of outsole you should be looking for on a product page win and doubt generally speaking if you go for outsole's that are fully rubber or mostly rubber you'll be in a really good spot it's going to give you a bit more durability it's going to give you a bit more traction and that is why also for like a running shoe here you have more exposed foam they're trying to save on weight or whatnot there's enough tread to give you durability and grip but they're also trying to save on weight with a training shoe you got to think like okay if I'm doing a lateral skater jump on turf I want this to be able to grip me down this might not give me enough grip and traction so when you're thinking about how you're training in your shoe the outsole can be incredibly important and if you are varying your surfaces and you just want more durability going for shoes that have full rubber outsole's near full rubber outsole's can be huge and from there we could talk durability but we're not going to unpack that there and that's where a lot of the wear testing does come into play and watching reviews can be really useful the third construction character see that I want to talk about is the upper construction so the upper is basically the upper of the shoe it's all the material that locks your foot down this is incredibly important because when we're thinking about how we're training this is what's going to give our foot security it's going to help us from spilling over the out the midsole here so for example if you have a shoe that is designed for let's say hit but it's not the best for lifting if you're for example going for a power clean and you are catching the weight and you start to spill over that's going to hinder your ability to perform well be efficient with your lifts and then also it's just going to be not that comfortable and you never know what can happen when you're wearing a shoe that has an upper that's letting you spill over I don't want to talk injury because it's not an always injury but there are things like that that can come into play there so the upper construction is being incredibly important and when you think about how you're training if you're lifting if you're doing any form of explosive work you're generally going to want to find an upper that locks down the foot pretty well so looking at shoes they have like knit biases like this model this isn't designed to give you max stability I mean max security if you're doing multi directional work for example it's designed to lock you down enough for running aka running forward and give you ventilation while you're running but for a cross training shoe you're going to want something that's going to be a little bit more reinforced with the layers if you're doing a lot of lateral work looking at the upper and seeing if there's reinforced here on the lateral forefoot can be really important looking for materials that will be a little bit more resilient to your general wear and tear so for example if you're a crossfit athlete finding a cross training shoe that's built for crossfit can be incredibly important because generally speaking those shoes will have reinforced layers at high abrasion points aka the midfoot the heel for handstand pushups for rope climbs for burpees on the toe box you'll have a reinforced toe guard extra synthetic layers additional materials here and considering the security can be incredibly important and then you have those three features from there that's when it can be really useful to consider durability but from that on that context you're not going to generally see that on a product page that's where you're watching reviews and just listening to the communities who are wearing the shoe already can be really important so all that to say three features for a cross training shoe to consider midsole that's going to dictate your versatility stability outsole that will dictate your grip traction and overall durability of the shoe and how you're protecting the bottom of the shoe and the upper construction aka the upper on the shoe that is going to give you security and lock down when you're doing your various forms of training. Thanks for the real time demo, Shanky, you want to have your shoe back on now. You want to switch back over to Spotify or Apple in the Azure time. So it's safe to say that finding the right shoe not only can help you perform better but it can play a role in injury prevention right and I don't think that consideration gets taken a whole bunch by Jen Pop right. I think we often like to reach for what looks the coolest. Maybe what's the most comfortable comfort is surely something to consider but there are times to take into account. I'm going to say like Olympic weightlifting for the perfect example. You want that really flat solid surface underneath you. I mean you should if you're going for Olympic weightlifting investment repair weightlifting shoes. I mean you've reviewed a bunch of weightlifting shoes. What would you say about weightlifting specifically? Yeah, weightlifting shoes can be a fantastic tool for anybody who wants to get into the sport of weightlifting or if you are for example across pedathlete and doing weightlifting on a regular basis. Or if you're just a recreational lifter and you do want to explore that type of footwear for getting more into clean, snatches, etc. They can be really useful because with a weightlifting shoe, the midsole is going to be entirely different. Think of this as like you're going to your toolbox, you're finding this specific five footwear for this activity. They can also be great for squats because of this type of construction that they have. And three calls on to weightlifting shoes to take into account for this sport is when you're doing any formal weightlifting you generally want to be catching weight with a more upright torso in a deeper range of motion. So catching a clean at the bottom or squatting to depth for example, what a weightlifting shoe is going to have is it's going to have an elevated heel. That is going to put your foot into a planter flex position before you physically start lifting. Which then can allow the knees to track a little bit further, which can then allow you to feel like you can sink your hips back a bit more, give more depth while maintaining more upright torso. And so with a weightlifting shoe, three things to think about here, similar to our cross-running shoe is the height of the heel. If you know for example that you struggle with mobility or you struggle keeping an upright torso in catching weight in a clean or if you're just having trouble with depth in the squat, a higher heel can generally be a good bat, but most weightlifting shoes will have a heel height around like 0.75 inches. And that's usually a good bat for most the second thing that we're lifting shoe will have to your point is like that nice stable outsole or that nice very firm outsole. And that's designed to allow you to catch the weight from a nice stable context while also really feeling the floor and getting a nice grip. Generally weightlifting shoes will have a full rubber outsole. If you're buying a weightlifting shoe that doesn't have a solid pass on that shoe, it's not going to be worth it. So you have a higher heel elevation, you have a very stable and grippy outsole. And you also have similar to the cross-treating shoe, a reinforced upper but with weightlifting shoes, you'll generally have straps. Or even like a bow-alacing system like on the EIT's Lesting models that give you additional security. And this prevents any form of spillover because to our point like if you're catching a clean and cross-treating shoe with a really loose upper and you're spilling over, a weightlifting shoe will have like dual straps to really lock that foot down generally like leather upper or synthetic upper that are really going to lock the feet down to prevent any form of spillover. But all that to say yeah weightlifting shoes can be a super specific tool and another question that I get asked with weightlifting shoes while we're on this topic is do beginners need them. Does everybody need them? And in most cases probably not. But I do think they're really useful tool to just have in your toolbox and generally we're lifting shoes will last you a while because they will offer just a different way to train. I think it's very important too for example squat with a zero-dropper or flat foot position but then also with a weir lifting shoe depending on what your goals are. I think a lot of folks into your point with like the injury context is we often don't realize if something's a problem until it is and a lot of this could just easily be prevented by using the right tools at the right times and it's like a great example is like okay you're front squatting and you're squatting bearer foot and you don't realize like what you get to a threshold like your torso is dropping so much that you can't physically move efficiently a weightlifting shoe could actually help prevent all that allow you to perform to your fullest and then you could also just implement any form of other squat variation and leg variation with a flatter foot position so you still get to train in that range of motion or whatnot. It's crazy to think I mean you can be it's really the repetition that catches up to you. If you're going day in and day out or week over week over week for a matter of years right and maybe you don't have the best ankle mobility or maybe you know your to your point you're not able to maintain the best spinal position or or even you know posture position within the catches or within our squat specifically that 0.75 inch can do so much for you just by investing in a pair of shoes that hopefully at least in all in the Olympic weightlifting shoes that I've invested in will last you for years you know it's not similar to running shoes where you're going through a couple hundred miles and then you've got a throw in the trash to get new ones right this really is an investment that that should if you're buying the right pair last you for many years. I really loved what you said about looking at shoes as going into your toolbox for the activity that resonated with me so clearly because it makes sense like I have my running shoes I have my weightlifting shoes I'm not my all-y lifting days are well behind me but I have my strength shoes I'll call them right for my general squat, deadlift, etc. days I have the pair of shoes where I'm doing a little bit more of my explosive and agility work and I have the cross trainers and then I've got my super cushion comfy shoes when I ran 13 miles a day before and I want to offload my foot the next day so shoes really are an important accessory to keeping up with the demands that you're looking to point onto your body if you're somebody who really is continuing to push the limits no matter how old you are but then also just helping you stay safe which I think is probably the bigger take away here because let's be frank you know as people age you know their days of the Olympic weightlifting and you know pushing themselves as hard as they may be used to in CrossFit classes will start to decline but they're going to still move their bodies and you know picking the right shoe where it can set you up for success there 100% I think one of my favorite examples is sometimes I get comments and it's like why can use my running shoes for this and bubble a lot and I'm like that's fine and you can for sure you can wear whatever shoe you want to the gym and they'll work until they don't and that's where I think understanding to your point like where those thresholds exist to where that gets more important is really important for the longevity of it. It's preventative 100% you can get away with you know training whatever shoe you want but once you start moving enough weight or you start doing a specific type of activity like a CrossFit or a hit class that has a lot of multi-directional work that is where that is going to matter more and it's like on the spectrum of specificity similar to how we approach most things in life as you get more specific that's where it's going to need to get more dialed in. Yeah I agree you mentioned barefoot training before and I want to I want to specify this one I want to give it its own moment because it did have its own moment I feel like in the in the fitness culture for a number of years and it still does right I still see I still go into the gym on a daily basis and I see people popping off their shoes to to crank out some dead lifts so is it over and and if we're over it why did it end let's talk about the rise to its fame and the science behind why people were going barefoot training a lot of this came from well let's break the mold of the over cushion and really develop that foot connection with the ground right but we like always we humans tend to go overboard on thing so let's talk about kind of the the problem that started it's it's rise to fame and then let's talk about why we're a bit more conservative with it today. Yeah I think barefoot training and just barefoot shoes in general really started the game traction and being on the rise with the ideas that we should be you know allowing our feet to spread and display and move and sometimes shoes will take us away from that and when you're wearing a certain type of shoe for so long you are kind of like almost like putting into a cast might be a little bit dramatic but you are kind of putting your foot into a position that's not allowing it to do its natural thing and so is it in the decline I don't think so I think we're actually seeing the biggest boom of barefoot shoe use and barefoot training that we've ever seen and I think it's because we're finally starting to get more mainstream coverage of barefoot shoes and the benefits of training barefoot and when we talk about its rise and like why I think it caught fire it's because it just makes a lot of sense once you do take off that shoe when you start training and you're like oh like this actually feels awesome I'm moving and ranges the motion that I didn't even think about my foot and ankle actually feel great now the chain like my knees actually feel a bit of my hips feel a bit of better and it's because you're giving narrow yourself an exposure to ranges of motion and like it's strengthening intrinsic muscles that you might not have been hitting when you were wearing the certain type of shoe for so long and so all that to say I think a few things to keep in mind with like the boom of it is number one just getting your foot and ankle into different positions and really allowing those intrinsic deeper muscles to strengthen that might not be strengthened in shoes has been really important in the sense of why people are adapting this type of training number two I think just the appropriate set of elements of feeling the ground below the feet can be really powerful for folks when they feel it for the first time I feel so balanced I feel so stable like this feels great like my dead looks I've never felt better and I'm dead lifting barefoot and everything else and then there's also just the component I think of folks looking at it from like this bigger holistic picture of okay for my mindset of like using shoes as tools I am a huge proponent of barefoot she isn't training barefoot even if you like cross training she's running shoes etc because you're exposing your body to so many different ranges of motion that you're basically taking all these boxes you're like okay I'm getting like the best of all these worlds here I'm building my feet and ankles but still not necessarily only training barefoot and training barefoot shoes because I recognize that I do like way lifting shoes for my squads etc and I think people are starting to finally realize like okay like this is actually just a tool and it means to an end to give me like the best performance possible and to build just dynamite ankles feet and lower body in general regarding just my health and integrity of the tissues and everything else where do we teetor the line of going overboard with barefoot training and opening ourselves up to the increased risk of injury yeah and this is always a very complex topic and there are a lot of strong opinions on this on the internet but I think where we get in the trouble is when we create almost this boxed-in mindset of this type of footwear and we only think we can use it for that type of thing and that's like the only thing we can use for health purposes because it's interesting too because I have a couple of friends who do PT and they're starting to actually like because I talked to them a lot about like footwear choices of their clients and stuff but they're starting to see more folks come to them with issues with their feet and ankles from using too much barefoot shoe usage too fast like this is a type of footwear that you have to acclimate to the way you're going to feel the ground below your feet when training especially when doing plyos and running is going to be very different there's going to be a lot more force going through those joints and so you want to make sure you're really strategic with it and I think where we get in the trouble is when we create an identity and a boxed-in mindset with this type of footwear and we don't allow ourselves to be more objective with okay is this the most productive thing I should be using in this moment or am I trying to force it and at the same time like at what cost because now like I have like a stress issue or some other issue going on and I think that's where we can get in the trouble and I think for folks too it might have some abnormality with their movement I think at times barefoot shoes they can be really useful for helping that but equally they can also exacerbate that for example like if you have any form of tenderness on your heel and you're like afraid to put weight on it and you're wearing a barefoot shoe that's going to be felt a lot greater and so then you might actually buy as your movement more and so I think just making sure that you're objective with your choices of footwear based off of what's going to allow you to objectively perform and feel your best on paper not with what you want to do or what you think you should be doing because social media told you to that's where we need to really focus in and hone it on. I think I agree with everything you just said I think we have to remind ourselves how delicate our feet are right just because we're on our feet all day long where you have to be conscious of how much force to your point in explosive movements and running we're putting on those meditarsals if we're feeling tenderness in the fashion running up to the Achilles which is a huge injury that no one really wants to experience right impacting that Achilles um I think what we often see we see plenty of stress reactions and stress factors already in regular shoes from people going too hard too fast and ramping up their mileage far too quickly I mean if you're going from zero miles you signed up for your first 10k race let's say you go from zero miles to your running 15 miles a week I mean something's going to get there right you have to be slow and your progression up towards running the mileage that you need and I think the same applies to barefoot training right you know if I'm working with somebody and and they don't have the best you know foot connection with the ground or they're they've just historically wore very cushion shoes or maybe it's something who wears heels all day right they're often some of the worst when it comes to understanding how that foot should actually perform in a stable spot when they're strength training right maybe they've never strength trained so you know be conservative take things slow start with body weight movements like master a body weight squat master a kettlebell deadlift right before you start ramping things up and certainly before you start introducing explosive moments and anything you know a little bit more impactful on the feet and a bear foot or in a bear foot shoe yeah and you bring up a really good point and I think for anybody considering bear foot shoes and bear foot training don't fall victim into that mindset of like UC comments of like well this is how human should be moving and look at this person they did 100 like they're not you they can't mend it at exactly I think that the the lack of the multifactorial nature of bearfoot shoe usage and just training histories pass injuries like these are all things that should be considered just because this guy can go run at marathon with awesome form bear foot that doesn't mean I could ever do that but that also doesn't mean that I can't use bear foot shoes for running it just might look different and to your point I think that's where we get into a lot of troubles when we start letting these other opinions who say like this should be it or this is how it should be or like we're like think of these like case studies look at them do it that's not you and it's similar like we we talk about all the time of training right where it's like oh well this person is not you in the sense of how they've grown how they move etc so why are we doing the same thing with bear foot shoes it just doesn't make any sense and so scale it back acclimates slowly remember where the context lies of your experiences background etc and then go from there to your point yeah to high heel cool you've shortened your Achilles for how many years and now you're going to go squat with three going to go to a boot camp and just bounce up and down and a flat foot yeah people forget that the tissue takes time to acclimate and yeah if you if you have been wearing running shoes longer for example you might need more time and that's totally okay and how you acclimate there are so many ways to do that and we could totally unpack that probably at a hold of their three-hour podcast but all that to say I love that point and I think you drove it home with you have to remember where you are when you're starting to implement this because it's going to look very different than somebody who's been doing it for years and they're already used to it and a fair warning I mean you by all means can blow it off and go for it and try it by yourself but the feet take a really long time to heel and I'll shout out my friends at bespoke physical therapy who we've had here on the podcast before um not a lot of blood flow goes down you know into that area to to heel so if you find yourself with a stress reaction with a stress fracture with plantar fasciitis it's going to take some time so just do your due diligence set yourself up for a success with the preventative measures because when you do experience a foot injury it's going to take a bit for for that area of your body to heel you know the most humbling type of rehab that I think I have have had included exercises like towel drags with like towel scrunches with your toes and you just put a you know a small hand towel on the floor take your socks off be barefoot put your foot on top of that and try to scrunch that towel closer and closer to your heel just by using your toes and see how quickly the arch of your foot starts cramping on you another one is picking up marbles with your foot in placing them from one spot in the room to another and just using all those muscle fibers and those small muscle stabilizers that you really never isolate um again very humbling so don't sleep on on foot strength don't sleep on you know showing your feet the right love that they need um and if you've had a long day on your feet you know sometimes the better thing to do is just rest and not push the limit so show your feet some love 100% so Jake your wealth of knowledge when it comes to foot where especially for activities why are you now shifting your e-commerce efforts uh to a brick and mortar experience and how are you planning to stand out against the rest? Yeah so when I look at that fit friend from a top level down I think the community and everything that it's been built with with the sense of folks who are just really interested in shoes has been awesome and I think the the way to take the brand next for me personally is to add another level of connection and I think being able to not only review the shoes but then also being able to sell them to the site and give you all the context and info you need blended with that review content is gonna be really important but then also potentially exploring brick and mortar so that's where I'm at now and the reason for that is one the connection element but too when we think about cross-running shoes with latin shoes barefoot shoes like where do you go to try those on there's nowhere few stores will carry some sure like dexporting goods they'll carry like the big nightkey the undarmer where do you go to try strike movement the rad one the tier the born primitive so many smaller brands that arguably make better shoes than these big brands but you can't try on anywhere in sizing is always a pain and that's the main of my existence as reviewers trying to give sizing recommendations but all that to say I think building this store that is really fitness focused with the footwear that it's gonna have is needed there really isn't a store that's doing that right now at least at scale in the sense of where to go in this city where to go in this city and where do you go to find like okay the proper sizing or like the proper information for hey I do this type of training like what should I go to you go to dex shore and you'll get like you know your baseline okay this is for cross-training but like what type of cross-training if you got that by Nike Metcone 9 for example for cross-training but you also like to run that's who's gonna be the heck out of you so where do you go to find that and that's kind of idea behind where I want to take everything next is connection but then also be an outlet and a resource for folks who want to try stuff on before they buy that you just can't find anywhere and I think being able to do that and aggregate that sizing data and just provide better information for folks will hopefully then help bring down return rates better for the environment better for the company better for the consumer all these things that could be nice little wins with this type of vertical well Jake we wish you the best of luck when it comes to this endeavor and bringing this to life it's certainly certainly gonna be a journey for yourself I want you to to lead the listeners with a good way to follow you and that fit friend on the journey that you're taking on yeah so the best place to reach me is either on YouTube or Instagram that fit friend and then if you ever have questions on shoes drop a comment reach out to me I literally answer every DM every comment honestly I feel like most days it's like a blur because I am answering so many questions but I try to hit everybody back and that's really important to me so if you ever have questions always feel free to reach out you hit me on a personal Instagram Jake underscore BOLY I will respond to you there too so there are a lot of different ways you can reach me if I ever don't respond just hit me on another platform with that oh I'm so sorry like I totally forgot and I will hit you back the man is accessible everybody.
