Glutamine is an L amino acid or like it says L, good mean and it's involved in various aspects of metabolism and it comes from bacterial fermentation and glutamine is unique and that is one of the very few amino acids that has a slightly sweet taste so it's very easy to mix into water and it has a pleasant sweet, naturally sweet but no sugar taste. Glutamine is used as a fuel in large amounts by the intestinal cells and by the immune cells and so actually you can support immune health and intestinal health. A number of studies is shown that intensively training competition can actually be partially or favorably responded to with good-been supplementation to help accelerate the immune recovery after intensive exhaustive training and that will be a very nice way of supporting immune health. When you're looking by a gluten supplement, almost all gluming products are in a powder form sometimes in capsules and they're usually by themselves and if always the L gluming form there is no desire the undesirable than have the D-glutamine so you'll always see the L but the dose here perhaps is the most important thing to look at. So depending upon what you're trying to achieve, a dose could be up to 10-15 or 30 grams per day, especially if you're trying to support intensive training or you may be over training to support immune health and immune recovery. Glutamine because it's used in large amounts by the intestines and covered into the citronine you can combine it with citronic cells or stack it with it and also combine your stack it with argining. Therefore you'll get a three-pronged approach to driving nitric oxide synthesis in the body through different pathways. That also could perhaps improve the bios response to an argining dose because you're not giving it too much argining one time you're approaching with argining through citronine and for glutamine. The other thing you can do is combine glutamine with virtually any other product that you want because they're don't appear to be anything that it would interact with, they would reduce its absorption or its utilization by the body.
