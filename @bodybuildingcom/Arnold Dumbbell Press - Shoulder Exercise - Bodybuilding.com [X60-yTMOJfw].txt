While sitting at an exercise bench with back support, hold two dumbbells in front of you at chest level with palms facing your body and your elbows bent. Your arms should be next to your torso. The starting position should look similar to the contracted portion of a dumbbell curl. To perform the movement, exhale and raise the dumbbells upward while rotating the palms of your hands outward until they're facing forward. Continue lifting the dumbbells until your arms are extended straight above you. After a brief pause at the top, slowly lower the dumbbells to the starting position by rotating the palms of your hands toward you.
