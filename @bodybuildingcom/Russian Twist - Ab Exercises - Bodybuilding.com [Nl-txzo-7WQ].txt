Lime the floor and place your feet under something that won't move. Your legs should bend at the knees. Elevate your upper body so it creates a V shape with your thighs. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you and perpendicular to your torso with your hands clasped. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and twist your torso to the right until your arms are parallel to the floor. Hold the contracted position for a moment. Then exhale and rotate back to the starting position. Finally, using the same technique twist to the opposite side.
