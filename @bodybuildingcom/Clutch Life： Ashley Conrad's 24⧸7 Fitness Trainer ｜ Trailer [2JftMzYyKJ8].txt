This is for any person that wants to dramatically transform their body and be able to maintain 365 days a year. This is our last exercise of this circuit. You should be getting as many burpees as you possibly can. All of the workouts are shot in real time. You've got 30 seconds of this. She's got her elbows nice and tight to her head. You can follow along at home with me and the clutch body shop athletes that are doing the program. We are making it so that you can choose whether you want to shred that or build muscle. Last that a pull-up to go is fast as you can. Every workout is 30 to 45 minutes. This is our last round you guys. Make sure you're pushing it. You need little or no equipment at all to complete these workouts, which makes it super easy. It's really a no-excuse approach to getting your results, getting you in and out of the gym, and making it something that you can maintain no matter where you are.
