With the pad of the calf raised machine at the appropriate height, place your shoulders under the pads and position your toes facing forward. The balls of your feet should be secured on top of the block with your heels extending off of it, push the lever up by extending your hips and knees until you can stand up straight. The knees should always keep a slight bend and should never be locked. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible while flexing your calves. Ensure that your knees do not move and there should be no bending at all during this movement. Hold the top contracted position for a brief moment, then inhale and slowly lower yourself back to the starting position.
