Life flat on your back with your feet flat on the ground or resting on a bench with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle. If they are elevated on a bench, place them about three inches apart and point your toes inward so they touch. Place your hands on both sides of your head and keep your elbows in. Be sure to press the small of your back down on the floor to help better isolate your abdominal muscles. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and slowly begin to roll your shoulders off the floor. Your shoulder should come up off the floor about four inches while your lower back remains on the floor. At the top of the movement flex your abdominals and hold for a brief pause. Then inhale and slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.
