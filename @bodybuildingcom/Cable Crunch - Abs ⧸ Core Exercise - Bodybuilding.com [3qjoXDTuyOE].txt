New below a high pulley with a rope attached. Grasp the cable rope attachment and lower the rope into your hands or next to your face. Flex your hips slightly and allow the weight to arch your back. This will be your starting position. Now while keeping your hips stationary, exhale and flex your waist as you contract your abs. Your elbow should lower toward the middle of your thighs. Hold it the bottom contracted position for a moment, then inhale and slowly return to the starting position. Make sure to keep constant tension on your abs throughout the movement.
