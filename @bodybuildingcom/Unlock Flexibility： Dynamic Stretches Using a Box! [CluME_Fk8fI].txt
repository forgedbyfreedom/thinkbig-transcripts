Boys and girls as time for some recovery so we're gonna do a bunch of stretches that you're gonna use a box for This is the cash stretch on a box really good for opening up that hip flexor Stretching out through that quad I would like to say you want to probably maintain about 60 seconds to two minutes in these positions gonna help a lot This one is also one of my favorites. This is really good at opening up the triceps and the lats Just making sure your ends of your elbows are up on the box From here I love an outstanding upright pigeon pose getting stuck into those glutes and a little bit of that lower back as well Make sure you don't feel any knee pain here if you do just decrease the range From there guys, I'm gonna go into a bit of a salaya stretch So getting through that ankle trying to increase that range so we can get deeper down into our squats This is a really good one one of my favorites. It just takes a pressure off if you would like to increase the stretch Intensity you can use one of these kettlebells just to increase that stretch here Now we have another one we're going through a little bit of lower back and hamstrings This one's really really good for just lengthening out a little bit more But don't use a heavy weight if anything Go lighter than what you expect. This is really good for just lengthening out and creating some space One of my favorite ones is one from there guys We're gonna go into a bit of a upright struttle Falancing ourselves on that box getting stuck into those the duct is one of my favorites as well enjoy
