I was 19, lost in my neck, broke it, up for the disc, right-man's hit into my vertebrae, set about two years. I lost all my weight, got to press. I'm John Meve, 26 year old bodybuilder. I work full time, I take care of my house, thank you everything I got into. I still find time to get it done. Some days your tire, your feet down, you don't feel like doing it. That's when you've got to push on, you know? If I can come back from this, you can come back and do anything. I don't think I'm super mine, I'm super down and I'm always there, fly right down, cause we always care, shine that light, I'll be right there. Cause I know that you need me, you see that fit alone, I go solo, anyone wants a hop-up, go on whatever I got, push them a little in it, like I push myself every day. So we're disfossilting here when they got such a chance, just as my life, and if you hope to play high, I'll save you when I'm so cool, but for everybody that saved the world. When you were close, got you there, I don't think I'm super mine, I'm super down, yeah, I always there, you can tell me a thousand times, but I never gonna leave, I'm always here, cause I know you need me, so you can stop me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, you know, world, nobody's gonna hurt my girls, if you knew I was a butcher, go from the pages, see you smiling, but the music beats up, not super man, but I am just lacking, cause I got my life, and if you hope to play high, I'll save you when I'm so cool, but for everybody that saved the world. You're the way that you find it, but for all you can do, and you're fun, just you never, you feel like you're all feet down, and you want to quit, so that last breath. I need to teach you, you can do.
