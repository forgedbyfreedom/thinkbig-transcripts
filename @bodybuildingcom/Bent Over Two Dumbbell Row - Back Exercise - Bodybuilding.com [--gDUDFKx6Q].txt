Start with a dumbbell in each hand. Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward. Keeping your back straight bend it the waist until your torso is almost parallel to the floor. Try to keep your head up as well. The weight should hang directly in front of you as your arms will be perpendicular to your torso in the floor. This is your starting position. Now a keeping the torso stationary lift the dumbbells to your side as you breathe out. Bring your elbows close to your body and use the forearm only for holding the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause. Now slowly lower the weight back down to the starting position in hailing as you do. This is a very technique oriented exercise and you want to make sure you practice perfect form before attempting to use heavier weights. If you have back issues, you may also consider doing low pulley rows instead.
