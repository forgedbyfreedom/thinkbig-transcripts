So this just looks absolutely amazing. Looks good. It's quick, it's easy and of course it's gluten free. I'm your food and my team. Hello and welcome to the bodybuilding.com kitchen. I'm Kendall Lushment Athletic Edge Athlete and today we're going to be making my gluten free mustard-crusted pork tenderloin. This recipe calls for a pound and a half or 24 ounces of pork tenderloin. We're going to begin by checking a half cup of our balsamic vinegar and covering our pork with it in a large bowl or dish. Roll it over a few times, make sure it's well coated and we'll allow the pork to marinate in that while we prepare the mustard crust. For our crust we'll be mixing the remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Starting with a half teaspoon of dill. Two tablespoons of rosemary. Two tablespoons of thyme. Two tablespoons of black pepper. A fourth of the cup of dried minced onion. A fourth of the cup of minced garlic. And a quarter cup of brown mustard. So we'll mix all these ingredients together. And it's going to form a thick paste. We'll place our tenderloin, smack dab in the middle. And then any balsamic that's still left in your marinating dish or bowl will just pour on top. Once your tenderloins in the dish we could take the crust we made and we'll press it on top of the tenderloin. Just right there with your hands. So as a person with silly act disease, I obviously love this recipe because it is gluten free. But in addition to that, it has tons of flavor. It's something to really mix up your lean protein, give you something different in your diet. And it smells and tastes incredible. Perfect. Really, it's really good.
