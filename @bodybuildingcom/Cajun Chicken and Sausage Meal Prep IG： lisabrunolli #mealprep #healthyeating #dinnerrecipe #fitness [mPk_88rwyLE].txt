I love a quick and easy meal prep that is full protein and with 40 grams of protein and only 360 calories. These cagin chicken and sausage bowls are just that. You're going to stir by placing two tablespoons of uncooked rice into each container. I like to use minute rice because I feel like it cooks really well in the oven and then you're going to add one fourth cup of bone broth to each container. Bone broth is a great way to get some added protein to this meal and then you're also going to add one fourth cup of fire roasted diced tomatoes. You can use any brand you want. I used the Trader Joe's brand and then you're going to add a teaspoon of cagin seasoning to each container. It's sort of really well. I like to do this before I add the raw chicken into it because that way I can taste it in a just a seasoning as needed and then you're going to add your vegetables of choice. I chose yellow bell peppers and red onions. I did about a fourth cup of each one in each container. Now of course we have to add our protein. I found these chicken sausage links at Trader Joe's and I cut up two of them and divided them evenly amongst the two containers. Try to find chicken sausage links that are around 160 calories and have 16 grams of protein. I also cut up a pound of chicken in bite-sized pieces and I divided that evenly amongst the containers. I mixed it up really well and then of course I topped it with my favorite seasonings, a new powder, garlic powder and then I added a little bit more of that cagin seasoning on top. Put them in a preheated oven for 45 minutes during halfway in between. When they were almost done I took them out and I actually topped each of them with two tablespoons of cheese because why not? Jesus life it makes everything better and it adds extra protein. They came out so good. You guys gotta let me know if you tried them.
