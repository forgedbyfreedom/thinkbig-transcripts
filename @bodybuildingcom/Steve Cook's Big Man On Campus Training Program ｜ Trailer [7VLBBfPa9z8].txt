Warning. So ut. Close your eyes. You gotta move your head to the helicopter. I went to Russia and I thought you don't ya? It's always there. Remember that one other day? When the hats go up, when the party's over, at the start of your new life. The iron is there. Ready to teach you. Its weight doesn't change. Its lessons are timeless. Its a lifelong friend. One of the best. When you're ready to quit, the iron will tell you. One more rep. When you're on the brink of cheating, the iron will tell you. Do not give in. When you're about to fall, the iron will whisper. This is a plan. Confidence. Power. These are the things I have given you. Take them everywhere. To class. Work. And life after. Listen to the iron. The iron will teach you. It will make you strong. Better than you were before. The best self. Could ever be.
