They call me the pro creator. I've helped 13 Olympians. Last one transformed from impressive to legendary. FST7 is my masterpiece, Vashas Dretch training. Hold it. You can substantially change the shape and size of your muscles. Come on. It won't be easy. It will hurt. That's it. Come with me. Finish your set and stretch your limits. Come on. Now you're working. Let's go. Come on. His honny ram bud. And now I'm in your corner. I'm honny ram bud. I'm here with Jeremy Bondia, 2014 Men's Physical Input Champion. And we're here to train Chess and Biceps, FST7 style. Let's go. Forward, forward, squeeze it, squeeze it, squeeze it, squeeze it, squeeze it. FST7 stands for Fashas Dretch training. The seven is the amount of sets that you do at the end. The expansion of the Fasha is what's going to help trigger the growth. So that when we go in there and we work for that ultimate pump, you're going to end up getting really good round muscle bellies with maximum separation. This workout shall last us about 45 minutes to an hour. And what we're going to do is we're going to focus on the heavier exercises earlier in the workout. And then we're going to do our FST7 set towards the end. Jeremy's going to be going through all the exercises with the proper technique, all the form, all the intensity. What I'm going to bring is the coaching aspect of the workout. So follow the street this. So what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and warm up. These had issues with the shoulders in the past where he'd heard it last year. So what we're going to do this year is we're going to just take our time, warm up, and then go heavier as we see fit. All right. We're going to do two warm upsets. Just take your time. Minimum 12 reps. Good. But what we want to do is we want to warm up the chest. Make sure we get plenty of blood in there. And we also want to warm up the handslary muscle groups like your shoulders so that you don't have hurting your glotator cuff or anything else. Good. That right shoulder is a little tight. How tight? It's the other warm up set. So if you loosen up, you're going to use like three or four sets and make it nice and warm. Why don't you go ahead and grab a ten and just warm up that rotator a little bit too. So what we're doing is we're going to warm up just his rotator cuff to make sure that gets plenty of blood in there. The last thing we want to do is cause an injury. There you go. I'm going to jump 70s. All right. Yeah. As long as your shoulder feels good. Come on. Let's go. I feel it out. Take your time. Good. Good. Good. So what we're trying to do is we're trying to focus on that chest. So what we're doing is we're keeping the range of motion a little bit shorter right now because he's keeping the constant tension on that chest. So we don't want to go so far up the ends up getting me giving out and his triceps before he gets that on his chest. Good job. How'd that feel? Easy. Good. So what we're going to do right now is we're going to do two working sets. We're going to do eight to ten reps. I might throw in some partials depending on how he's feeling and depending on how the weight feels in regards to is it light. Is it heavy? Want to go to 90s? It's quite a lot of it. Come on. Now it's time to work. Oh. Good. Good job. We want one tenzer, one twenty. One twenty. Okay. So next step we're going to do is we're going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit. Good job. We want one tenzer, one twenty. One twenty. Okay. So next step we're going to do is we're going to go up to one twenty. It's one hundred to we're easy. If he ends up really getting through the next set really easily then what we're going to do is we might even bump up up and do a third working set. As we move up in terms of the amount of weight we're using, we also increase the rest time. If you don't take enough rest what's going to end up happening is you're going to fatigue before you can go to failure. Come on. Check. Go. Go. My way. Go. Come on. Come on. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. All the way. Driving. Go. Drive. Drive. Drive. Drive together together. Slow. Slow. Yeah. Take it. Drive. That's it. Good set. So basically what's happening now is he's feeling out the weights. Hundreds. Easy. 120s. As he got through the groove he went more and more reps. He didn't stop at the eight or ten. He's trying to take that intensity to a whole other level. Now we're going to decide, you know, how do you feel? Do you feel like he wanted to go to one 30s and bring it down to 68 reps? Because if you're going to do that, this is the set to do it. He's okay. Let's do it. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Come on. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Easy. One more. One more. All you. Finish it. Two. There you go. Good set. Good set. Four. Buh. When I come in and have a strong 04 sets like that, hey, those 130s like that, six reps is pretty strong for me. Kind of gets me with a groove to rest the work out, so that's the easy stuff. So the lighters are doing more of the concentration stuff and really focusing on contraction. So we're going to bring it off into that and you should really really the bread and butter of our training. So we're going to move on to exercise too. Exercise too is incline dumbbell fly. Again, we're focusing on that upper chest because that seems to be the weakest point on almost every athlete. So what we want to do here is start off with about 40 pounds, do 10 to 12 reps, and then we'll work our way up. And we want to do warmups and then two working. So three sets all together. Good, good. Turn that pinky. Good. We want to get that maximum contraction. So he's going to turn his wrists as he comes up. There you go. You see those fibers just start to really fire. Good, good. Come on, keep going. Keep going. Good job. Good say. There you go. How that weight feel? It's light. Light? I want to make sure that he really is volumizing, putting in some of the BCA glidamine mix, and then sipping that through the rest of the workout from the middle on. 50s? 55. Come on, Jeremy. Let's go. Test. Control it. Control it. Good. Like you're hugging a giant barrel. There you go. Mmm. That's it. Turn those pinkies. Turn those pinkies on the way up. Good. Keep going. Come on. Two more. One more. Squeeze all the way up. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Good job. Easy. Hope. Easy. Oh. Hands together, squeeze. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Oh. Good. Right. So what we're going to try to do now is we're trying to get maximum contraction in between the sets. So what we do is we actually pose. So posing the muscle, squeezing your chest, especially doing those most muscular poses, really helps fire those extra fibers to be able to get that growth. It makes a huge difference. I guarantee you'll end up being much more sore and get much more out of your workout by being able to flex in between sets. How's that pump? It's good. Good. Good. Good. All right. We're going to do one more set. Exit 605. No. Five pounds. So they're with 60. All right. Let's go Jeremy. Oh. Oh. OK. Good. Good. Good. Good. Squeeze. Squeeze. Good. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Good. Keep going. Good. Come on. Keep going. Come on. One more. One more. One more. Hold it right there. There. Keep going. Press this. Press this in. Go. Two. Three. Four. Yes. Good job. Good job. Good job. Come on. Stand up. Squeeze it out. Let's go. Squeeze it out. Forward. Squeeze it. Squeeze it. Squeeze it. Hold it. Go. Right. There you go. That's how you do it. Really just pushing that threshold. Every set I'm doing right now. I'm pushing the failure pretty much. I don't ever leave anything. I'm on table with any set. Every set I'm trying to push towards I can. After we finish the set, flexing afterwards, I just really feel the volume is really forcing that blood into the muscle. I really encourage you guys to try it because you guys will see a big change in your way you feel the next day. And over the course of a few weeks, you'll see a lot more volume in your chest. Well, I think you have to find different types of intensity multipliers. So whether you're doing drop sets or you're doing partials, you have to figure out ways of being able to do things on a whole different level without sacrificing your safety. Increasing your intensity is the key to growth. You want to increase intensity. If you have a workout partner or a trainer, obviously, that's great. If you don't, you've got to find ways whether you're doing partials or you're doing really slow negatives to be able to increase the intensity. And that's what's going to get you through those potatoes. Okay, so what we're going to do now is we're going to go from fly to a third exercise, which is going to be flat, presses, but what we're going to do is we're going to use, was I call a power grip where your palms are facing each other. So we're going to be doing 8 to 10 reps, 3 to 4 sets, 1 to 2 warm ups. Oh, oh. Good, good, there you go. Good, good, good. I just like to put my hands right on the peck so you can be able to get that maximum mind muscle connection. Good, you feel that? Yeah, good, come on. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Yeah, stretch and dry. There you go. Stretch and drive. Good. Keep going. Come on, Jeremy. Come on, squeeze. Good. Good. I give you partial. Give me five partials. One, two, three, four. Good job. Good job. There you go. Good. Good. Hold it. Hold it. Good. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Relax, relax, relax. Relax. Good. When he's warmed up and he feels good, then what we do is we can, we can sit at a first working set. So we're just do one to two more depending how he's feeling. We got to get pumped right now. Eight to ten reps, five partials. Let's go. Make work. Good. Good. Go. Good. Go. Good. All the way to top. Squeeze. Good. Good. Good. Squeeze. Good. Squeeze. Good. All the way. All the way. Good. Give me partials now. Two partials now. Five. Two. Three. Four. Five. Five. Two. Good set. Come on. Squeeze it out. Squeeze. Archer back. Archer back. Hold it. Hold it. Archer back. Archer back. Just up. Just up. What I see a lot of people doing is they start to go back into a standard press motion. Because it's a little bit easier. What you need to do is make sure that your hands are still parallel. You don't want to drift outward. So as we're pressing, we're keeping it in and what we're doing is we're pushing together. We want to get that really good chess contraction. So if you see yourself going back out, it might be a little too heavy for you. Lighten it up by the ten pounds. Good. How you feeling? I mean, the trash can. Last week we did. Yeah, we got to keep this close by. Sometimes some of these chess workouts can get pretty intense. Last week, he ended up throwing up all over the NPC workout to deal with. Jim and Pitzway might equate it up myself. So what we're going to do now is we just got finished doing that flat press. We're going to go into our FST 7 set. And we're not doing standard FST 7. Standard FST 7 is 45 seconds rest doing a fly machine doing a pec deck doing something along those lines. Today what we're doing is we're doing a super 7 set. And what a super 7 set is basically is you're super setting a fly with an exercise. So we're going to go a fly cable fly to an incline pushup. This is my favorite thing to do. I love it. I love FST 7. Since I've been working with you, you just advanced everything and made me understand it a lot better. So my gym IQ is gone up significantly. And that's huge. It's a big deal being in the gym and understanding what you're doing in there. A lot of people can go in the gym and go through the motions. You're not getting anything out of it. But if you're in the gym and you understand what's going on physically in the body, you're going to get someone's morale of the exercise. By understanding all of these things, it's really brought by physique up maybe a better athlete. You know, more just can't even come the better, you can't get it. Good. Keep those hands open. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on. Keep going. You got one more. You got one more. Good. Come on. Keep going. Good. Now press it. Now press it. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Good. Keep going. Keep going. One more. Squeeze. Good. Good. Feed up. Exhale. Good. One. Two. Three. Come on. Five. Come on. Six. Come on. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Two. Two. Two. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. There you good. Good. Good. Awesome. Good. You're on the clock. So we're doing 45 seconds rest in between sets. We're doing seven sets of this. So basically, it almost turns into a triceet. Because we're doing this a fly. Seven to ten reps. Then he's going into a press. Anywhere from five to ten reps. Then he's going into a inclined pushup. And he's going to be doing anywhere from five to ten reps. And then we're doing partials at the very end. And again, this is to be able to maximize breaking through those plateaues. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Hands open. You want to get those hands open. There you go. Five. Five. Six. Control it. Control it. Oh. Hey. Can I press? Oh. Go. Press. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. One more. Good. Good. Good. Let's go. Go. Go. Good. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Nine. Partial. One. Two. Three. Four. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. So what we're doing also is you'll notice I'm having him open his hands. So what we're doing is he's trying to do is he's trying to get that really good flexion. It gives that extra inch or two. We'll end up getting you that soreness that you want to get you that growth that you're requiring so that you can end up having that rounder fuller chest. All right, buddy. Let's rock. Let's rock. Let's go. Let's go. Set three. Set three. One. Two. Little higher this time. Little higher this time. Little higher this time. Three. Slow down a bit. So down a bit. Come on. Good. Three. Come on. Five. Come on. Squeeze. Poo. Poo. Poo. Poo. Poo. Keep going. Four. Three. Two. One more. One more. One more. Poo. Good job. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Partial. Five. One. Two. Three. Four. That's it. Good job. Good job. All right. So people ask why you have your athletes wear a belt. The reason why I haven't wear a belt is number one because it really helps with keeping the stability of your core. It also helps you with breathing with all the liquids you're taking in with all the extra food that people take in during contest preparation and trying to grow all those extra calories. So having that belt on and allowing you to keep that tighter waist because you're learning to breathe with shorter breaths and not breathe with your lower out of your body. Breathe with your breath with your updraft. Updraft. So therefore I am I prefer athletes wearing a belt throughout the whole workout. How you feeling? So it's all about right here. So we're three sets in. We got four left. Yep. It don't get any easier. Just get harder. So just suck it up. That's it. You know. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'll try. Control it. Control it. There you go. Use momentum. You don't want to use momentum. All the emphasis on the chest. Use momentum. The shoulders kick in. I want that. It's round. Chest. Good. Open those hands. Come on. Two. One more. One more on the fly. Now go to the press. Go into the press. Higher. Higher into the press. There you go. There you go. Come on. There you go. Now you're working. Now you're working. Let's go. Come on. Good job. Let's go. Come on. Maria. Feed up. Come on. Go. Two. Two. Three. Five. Six. Seven. Three. Nine. Ten. Two. Five. One. Two. Three. Go. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Let's go walk it out. Good. Good. Good. So every person has their own level of intensity that they have to work up to. So what I call all this is controlled chaos. And what that does is it allows you to be able to break through plateau's, push the intensity level higher. Not every person is going to push the same way Jeremy does. Which you might do is do a couple of force reps. You might do a couple of partial reps. But what you don't want to do is go outside your means where you're going to get hurt. It's very, very, very small likelihood that he's going to end up hurting himself with the higher intensity. Because what we're doing is we're controlling the chaos by making sure that if anything happens, his just arms are going to give out on the pushups. If he gets tired, he just puts the weights back. And this is one of the reasons why you select your eyes to quit meant for FST7 sets. Sit. Let's go. There you go. There you go. Good. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Come on. Come on. One more. One more. One more. One more. Now press. Now press. Press high. Press high. Chin up. Press high. There you go. Keep going. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One more. Good. Let's go. Some of the things. Come on. Come on. You're taking the long route because you're trying to get some extra air. Let's do this. Finish your set. Come on. Two. Three. You own this. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Partial. Two. One. Good. That's it. If I have to give one tip to people out there, they always ask me what is the one thing that they should do during a workout. It is to make sure you're drinking water through your whole workout. If you stay hydrated, you'll get a pump. If you're dehydrated, you'll be flat. So make sure you've hydrated through the whole workout. Six. Let's go. Six. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Keep going. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Two. One. Two. Two. One. Two. Press. Go into that press. Two. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. One more. Good job. That's it. Feed up. Let's go. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Two. Five. Four. Three. Three. Three. Two. Two. One. Good job. Good job. Good job. You got a little extra in you. All right. So what I'm doing is I'm actually increasing the weight. We want to bring down the reps a little bit because he's getting a little far out of the range. We're trying to hit that 10, 12 rep range and all together we're hitting closer to the 20 rep range. So what we want to do is we want to increase the weight a little bit to bring the reps down. And what we're going to do is we're going to do our final set with that. Two. Two. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Come on. Nine. Press. Oh. Go. Press. Press. Press. Press. Press. Press. Press. Press. Press. Five. Four. Three. Two. Good job. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Don't stop. All the way through. All the way through. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Nine. Pursals. Pursals. Okay. I think we look so weak. I'm so good. I think that's a good workout. That's a good workout. Come on. Squeeze it out. Let's go. Hold it. Hold it. Good. Shoulders wider. That was wider. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Good job. Fuck. That. Yeah. Yeah. Workout is an over yet. Now we do biceps. Good job. All right. What we're doing is we're going to do three sets. Ten to twelve reps. And he's doing a alternating at the very end of the number of reps that he does. He's going to end up doing it both together. Someone considered that a super set. I don't go. One. Two. Good. Four. Come on. Three more. Good. Up. Up. Up. Up. Good job. Good set. Good set. Good. Still hurt in the chest. Yeah. So what we're going to do is we're going to take about a minute, minute and a half rest. Then go onto the next set. That seems like a pretty good way. How does that feel? Good. Because we don't want to go too heavy. Because if you go too heavy, the shoulders start kicking in. And if the shoulders kick in, you're not going to get any emphasis on that bicep. Let's go. Two. Three. Come on. Three. Good. Good. Four. Four. Keep going. Five. Five. Six. Seven. Not too fast. Five. Five. Five. Five. Six. Six. Seven. Not too fast. Five. Five. Seven. Eight. Five. Eight. One more. One more. One more. One more. Five. Five. Together. Ah. Come on. Good. Go. One. Two. Three. Keep going. Ah. One more. Ah. Huh. Partial spine. Five. Five. Five. One. Two. Three. Four. Good. Good. Good set. The reason why we're combining chest and bicep today is because traditionally in the past, he's always done to chest and tricep. And to be able to break platos, you have to actually go through and change up your workouts. So what we're going to do is focus on biceps for the next two more exercises after this one. When the, ah. That's right. One more set. Let's go. Two. Two. Two. Two. I have him facing parracing forward. So he keeps constant tension on that bicep. Hey. Hey. Good. Good. Hey. Good. Come on. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Together. Together. Together. Good. Three. Two. Partial. Five. Four. Three. Three. Good. Good. Good set. Good set. Good set. Good pain. This parrace was really hit that lower part of my bicep. So the next exercise we're going to do is we're going to do standing double bicep. So we're going to do is we're going to hit 10 to 12 reps and then in between those sets we're going to pose. Do a couple reps. Feel the way to. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You want to put maximum tension on that pinky and ring finger. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Full range of motion. There you go. Good. Because we have constant tension, we want to go all the way. That's the nice thing about pulleys. It allows you to have constant tension. Good. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Good. Good. We're partial now. That much. That much pain. Yeah. That's just a fire. Let's see if front double bicep. Come on. Hold it. Super neat that wrist. Get those peaks to fire. There you go. Boom. Good. Good. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Okay. We're doing two things right now. What we're trying to do is he's posing the muscles to be able to really get the muscles to really flex. But he's also doing is he's opening up his lats so he can really work on opening up. He's going to have to do that when he poses. So it also allows him to create conditioning for that. Good. Can I get trained you? Yeah. Next time. Good. Two. Good. Two. Three. Good. Five. Come on. Three. Three. Three. Four. One more. Watch out. Good. Ha. Keep going. Keep going. Ha. Harsals five. Ha. Two. Three. Four. One more. Watch out. Sit. Perfect. Now hold that. Three. Three. Three. Four. Three. Six. Good. That was okay. Let go of that a little bit. Right there. Let me push. There you go. Like that. There's. What he's doing is he's curling up this way and I'm pushing against it and he's trying to hold it with his bicep. Basically, we're just doing a native. And those negatives are what are going to help you grow in the next 24 to 48 hours because you're creating more muscle damage. All right, the last exercise is going to be a reverse curl. This is a finesse movement. What we're trying to do right now is we're trying to work on that outer bicep. And what we want to do is we don't want to go too heavy because if we do that then again, the shoulders will kick in. So keep the elbows to the sides, bring it up all the way and we want to do a higher rep range. We're going to be up in the 20 rep range. How about we going to thumbs underneath their thumbs over the top? Underneath. Good. Do a couple of them. Let me know how that way this. Put your own 20. Keep those elbows back. Keep your shoulders back. Breathe. Can you partial. Can you partial? Can you partial? Chest up. Two. Three. Four. Five. Good. It's a little heavy. You're starting to get a little too much body English on that. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drop the weight about 10 pounds to get proper form. Good. If there's ever a movement that you do not want to cheat, it's this one. Your shoulders will kick in your chaps will kick in way before your bicep. Break your alice does. If you don't do it correctly, keep going. Good. Partial. Keep partial. Keep partial. To my hand. Go. Good job. Hawk man. I was having more of those. My fucking form for done. Good. And I just dropped away. My foot. Did you really? Yeah. Oh, Jesus. That was the first workout in the FST7 bodybuilding.com series. The other two workouts are shoulders and triceps and backed by itself. If this is the first time you're using this type of FST7 training, what I recommend is doing it once every two weeks until you can get used to it, then move on to every week. So if you have any questions for me about FST7 or any of my training principles, check me out, Instagram, Facebook, and also Twitter, Honny Ramba. For more FST7 workouts, we're content like this.
