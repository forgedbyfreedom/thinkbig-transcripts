We'll eat all the meat we've talked to many times about what makes a champion a champion. And it's really, it's his mindset. There are certain types of people that would challenge himself every day in life. And they don't have to be driven. Because it can't be only to be held back and those who be patient with the leaders. And there's kind of people that are just the followers that just go with what people say, just kind of fall along and just to tell them what they're like. You know, this is why we chose way lifting or body building or whatever we choose. And people take the path of least resistance, interest is inshrening, it doesn't really ever make sense to me. I mean, the whole idea for doing it is to challenge yourself to be better, to be stronger in every way possible. So, squatting every day is just another way to challenge yourself. You know, I truly believe that squatting every day is not really going to build character, but it's going to reveal your character. Like you're truly going to find out what you're made of. Can you get up? Can you go to the show? Can you get on to the bar? You'll get tired if it's teagued and you can still earn your work. But guess what? Here's to live. You get up to next day, you do it again. And if you see things in your life from a point of necessity, that point of desire, you'll be way more successful. The people have become world champions of the mindset. You can't beat those people. You think you can't themselves know option for filling. One of the things that I've told all my lifters when they come in the gym is whoever can endure the most pain will be the best lifter.
