The Numbers have drawn me on wildest expectation Yet winter is nearly upon us when a city could hold us now That is one of the four with future victories and the blood of Christmas We'll make vital stand against Rome many of us will fall so that all may live free Whatever happens to my people it happens because we choose rent we decide our fate Hey everybody building Dr. Omits Liam McIntyre from spotter cuz war of the damned here to tell you about the guy that changed my life Change my training changed my shape. This is Tyrone Bell tell a little bit about yourself. I am the official spotter Katrina and I am the man responsible for what you see here When Liam got picked for the lead role he was what they considered Absolutely super talent on in front of the camera They weren't 100% happy where his body was and neither was he so they brought me an early What we call pre-production and we started training with him probably about six weeks out and that was a mass building face I didn't care about cutting up anything like that. We had to pack mass on as much as possible in that six weeks Because after that six weeks here to go through what we call boot camp It's fighting its gymnastics. It's getting him up to fight speed and that's basically cut him up And then we had to start the high purge for phase again throughout the season We fit workouts and we can production try to schedule as much as possible But it may be throwing you know they might finish us seeing early and then it's like turn you got half an hour And that's where I guess we had to develop a efficient workouts that would fit into time slots And that's where it came up with a specific thing because the average workout we were had for 20 minutes long So I developed these 19 minute workouts and heavily high purge for base just the guys had to look big We're gonna blow up arms today. This arm workout comprises of a number of super sets We're gonna be working these super sets with compound and isolation detailing exercises We're gonna have our mass builders in there like the easy bar curl. I accompanied with some detailing extensions And you're gonna find that format the whole way through this workout finishing off with two exercises And I'll take you to absolute failure, but the most important piece of equipment to this workout is this the stop watch Every second is accounted for one thousand one hundred and forty seconds So as soon as you walk in that gym So grab your soap watch. Let's get ready here we go First exercise easy bar curls Dressing extensions with a chain the first super set is gonna be 10 reps 10 reps and what you're gonna find This is easy bar our reps are gonna drop while I reps on the extensions climb I actually came on and season one button sand I came on is the Kricks of Stunk Double jump down Start learning the fights and it wasn't long before I actually ended up helping with the cast within nutrition They're training mixing I was in charge and and forcing everyone's nutrition and training Immediately no rest jump on here. You got to hit 10 on this as well I just spent so long training that out pop up and who probably at the time very rightly was like more is more Just work to you can't work anymore and for where I was at was really good Mine state to get myself into because like all right So if you want to grow some muscle mass we're gonna have to change this thing and I'm like, but no, no, no, I've got this worked out I know what to do. I'm I'm gonna just gonna lift more. I know I did you don't know let's move Okay Set one done we've got 45 seconds rest What you're gonna be finding in this super set is the weight is gonna increase on the easy bar curl But your reps are gonna drop well this one here your extensions The weight is gonna go down and your reps are gonna be coming up We're gonna move apart from each other, but the working back to back so you're gonna get a mean pump through the arms All right, let's load this weight because I've only got 25 seconds left All right, this one here. I'm gonna hit eight this one here. I'm gonna hit 12 The reason we're doing this is so we're getting that heavy high purtrophy on our biceps this one and working in a high purtrophy range with our triceps They're a little higher on this Okay Okay, my 45 seconds starts now remember tempo is extremely important with all these exercise back to back every seconds account Or four we still want their two seconds up one second down and this one here one second up two seconds down It's loaded up because I'm gonna six reps on this now. I'm gonna lighten this and we're gonna hit 14 reps The hard part for me every day was looking at you training huge weights that I was always trying to like match You can really have this not experience body that's great as well And all the people as well you had that goal somebody you know you follow and might not be the training partner But you were training videos these guys and you know that's what I want to be this stuff But you know you had that in the corner every day This exercise one super set duck our biceps just went through a heavy mass face Which means we're working the low high-pitched free range or triceps We're working in the higher rep range for high-perature thick and they're gonna swap that up next exercise It's gonna be our triceps We're gonna be working in the low range a biceps the room high range the reason for that is we've only got one workout a week There were hit our arms 1,142 seconds this all comes from working with the car's about this in particular Liam and when you give a 19 minutes to train him you've got to be on par so I want the same from you guys account every second follow this to a take and you'll get the same results Welcome to exercise two it's our second super set What we're gonna find here is our bice and tries the rolls are now reversed our triceps Be working in the lower rep range of high-perature feet and our biceps are in the higher rep range of high-perature feet 10 reps here 10 reps here and then we're gonna work away from each other So let's get this underway we're gonna be doing some skull crushes for the trice we're doing some cable curls for the biceps The common misconception we use say we're gonna be training 19 minutes and we're gonna put muscle on it It's no it can't be done. It's not enough But it is the proof is in the pudding you look at these guys and they've packed lean muscle mass over time Especially under the workload that they've got It's a long-term game because unlike near the end of war the day and they started to go you know what I do see what you're seeing And do see the change. Yeah, you know I could it had been happening for a long time But I didn't want to believe it because I was used to being the other guy Have I thank you for that? Yeah Use that 45 seconds rest to load your weights up use some common sense make sure all your exercises Close with in each other in the same area So you don't have to be running from one side of the gym to the other this one I'm looking at eight repetitions here my biceps We're gonna go up to 12 This also works for the everyday folk. There's people out there that are super busy family life careers If they follow this they're gonna get the same benefits that these people who are shooting on Spartacus with workloads That are crazy the news Okay, one more sit to go. This is the failure one. So let's get to it Last set this entire arm workout used to be Liam his favorite workout one of his body parts that he likes was the triceps This exercise was our main mass filter for the triceps Ties the the master of hypertrophy training I suppose the hard task master of hypertrophy training and I'm sitting there going he's massive So it's gonna work out great. You actually change the way I look at training and change the way I diet and change the way I live my life Straight away on TV at 14 to play the We had to be training the entire time throughout the seasons here Which was a lot of the time frames we were given for training the workouts not only had to be effective They had to be very very time-climbed You got to find failure feeling different on each component of the superset here You're failing under heavy load here you're failing. I'm the electric acid build up is so great So it is quite a different feeling you may feel sick especially with the high rep ranges This is where you cowboy up and keep going through this move on to a final superset This superset is doing two exercises that are more focused at detail on the tris and the boys We're gonna be doing reverse grip here for our triceps. I'm gonna be doing cable curls for our biceps here instead of working in a pyramid We're gonna be working 10 10 10 the whole way through The Spartacus world is these gladiators that have to be aesthetically pleasing They have to have the right combination of lean mass and you know a size as well You Again the same format of everything you've got 45 seconds rest in the twang the nature of these exercises You have to lift that much you've blowing your arms out from the previous heavy exercises these ones we're just going for detail Keep in mind guys tempo every repetition is about three seconds long two seconds up One second down exposed through the hard part one second one two every second is accounted for In the duration of the actual repetitions. Do you take too long or too short? 1000 40 seconds it's gonna be out of whack You're not gonna get this workout done in 19 minutes You You need to enjoy that 45 seconds rest this is over real quick By the end of it, everybody will just like minding up like I started off there and they're like are you turning it with fire? Okay, sure we'll have a good time. I'm going down to my gym by the end of the for more of the day Everyone's taking another take a little bit Good news Super sets are over We got two standalone exercises that we're gonna go to failure on each one, but it's max So we're looking super high reps Okay, guys, we're approaching the end of our workout all the super sets are done We're now concentrating on two exercises two standalone exercises one for the tries one for the boys A little difference here. There's no rep range. You're gonna max them in failure The first one we're gonna do is try set bench dips We do this one first because the reps that you hit you set the mark for your biceps Because then we're gonna pick a weight that we're gonna fail around the same rep range I want to at least hit over 20. I want to blow my rep range out same tempo though It's the only one 19 minutes There's a little bit of leeway Because I don't know how many reps you're gonna do here. I don't know how many reps I'm gonna do here So it could be a little bit under a little bit over the 19 minutes You're pushing this huge the important they have to have the right amount of proteins And they've got to have the right amount of carbs at the right time to pick for the workout and trigger recovery as well Supplementation is really really big. I am a firm believer in supplementing without glutamine and Vc doublease Fill in the muscle Laptic acid is building up. This is where tempo goes you just get it out you start pumping Make that one count you set gladiatom mentality. This is the one I used to push really really hard on in fact This is the one I made him throw up on himself and stool maintenance keep going Bench tips I've got about 35 reps out there now I need to take that number they're 35 transition that over into my bicep curls I need to select a weight that I can know that I'm gonna get around about their 30 mark So you're gonna be lifting lighter than what you normally do so check your ego We're going for maximum failure in a high rep range. It's what I call pump curls One Two To train these guys has been absolutely epic. We've become a family we've been four years together training to put these guys through their Paces every day and we built a bond. This is the only one from the start The tempo has gone out the window So your last exercise time doesn't let it out I'm excited for you to be able to do this workout with somebody's people for what? I can't wait to show yeah, I mean these are the actual workouts that's I made you do yeah, just it takes discipline But it's a realistic life change. Yeah, I think that's what they're asking what you bought me And I appreciate that so much so you're welcome. I'm not a bad man and then is the end Of the 19 minute gladiator arm workout remember this is only one of the 19 minute workouts in this program format But the key principles they transfer over to all of them is time management each workout is one There's 142nd long and every second is accounted for for the full Spartacus program check out the page below It's also a chess workout back workout shoulders and legs as well as the arm workout that we just did Training is only one part of this supplementation and nutrition are the key factors to making this work Now if you've got those in check you're gonna get the results a living testament to that is lamb over two seasons following this Exect workout exact nutrition again over 20 pounds of muscle now if you've got any questions Check out my personal website champion nutrition dot net dot in z book for more Spartacus content check out bodybuilding dot com Final stand against rose number all male Prepare the men for much have a press towards Spartacus Whatever happens to my people we decide our fate I
