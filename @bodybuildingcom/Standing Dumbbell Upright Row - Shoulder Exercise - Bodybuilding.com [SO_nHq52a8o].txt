Grab a dumbbell in each hand with a slightly less than shoulder width overhand grip. The dumbbell should be resting on top of your thighs. Your arms should be extended in your back straight. Keep the dumbbells close to your body as you move them up and the elbows should drive the motion. Continue lifting the weights until they nearly touch your chin. Slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
