The walk-up that abortied annual Mr. Olivia. This is a sport of individual achievement and the men and women you will see here tonight represent the best of the best. I think it's like I never thought in my life that I was going to be able to stay but it's like this and women 7 only get titles. I miss it when I'm being a title that's not my fan and I'm still dreaming. I've got to write books. What do you think? I will tell you this guys never give up on your dreams. I hope I was able to give you guys something to smile about tonight.
