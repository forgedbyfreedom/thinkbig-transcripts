There are various implements that can be used for the farmer's walk. It can be performed with heavy dumbbells or short bars if other implements are not available. Begin by standing between the implements. After gripping the handles, lift the implements up by driving through your heels, keeping your back straight and your head up. Walk taking short quick steps and don't forget to breathe. Do for a given distance, typically 50 to 100 feet as fast as possible.
