So the reason we're going shoulder with a part is if we go too wide we won't be able to pull down low. So I want you to stay exact how you're not, but lift your chest up and keep your elbows tucked in. And I don't want you to move it all. How I want you to drive your elbows directly lower in front of you, focus on contracting right here. And lean a little bit forward as you stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, now pull back down, drive elbows to low. Because we want to try to focus on contracting here because even if you're moving up, you're already hitting upper lat. So we want to try to drive as much fucking blood right here keeping those elbows tucked close to your body. Stick it for one second, chest up the sky at the bottom of the squeeze, good, come on.
