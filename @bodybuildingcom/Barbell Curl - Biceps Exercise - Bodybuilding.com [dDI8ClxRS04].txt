Stand up straight, holding a barbell with a shoulder width grip. The palms of your hand should be facing forward and your elbow should be close to your torso. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and curl the barbell upward by contracting your biceps. Keep your upper arms stationary while raising the barbell until it reaches shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a moment, then inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position.
