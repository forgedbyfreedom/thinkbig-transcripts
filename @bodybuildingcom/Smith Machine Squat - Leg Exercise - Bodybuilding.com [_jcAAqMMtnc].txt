First, set the bar to a height that best matches your height. Once you've selected the correct height and loaded up the bar, step under the bar and place it on the back of your shoulders. Hang on to the bar with both arms at your sides and the palms of your hands facing forward. Unlock the weight and lift it off the rack by simultaneously pushing with your legs and straightening your torso. Position your legs in a shoulder width stance with your toes pointed slightly out. Be sure to keep your head up at all times and maintain the straight back. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and begin to slowly lower the weight by bending your knees while maintaining a straight posture with your head up. Continue to lower down until you form around a 90 degree angle with your upper legs and calves. Be sure to not let your knees pass your toes while lowering the weight. Finally, exhale and raise the bar back to the starting position. Use the balls of your feet to press the weight up while simultaneously straighten your legs as well. When you're finished, lock the bar back on the rack.
