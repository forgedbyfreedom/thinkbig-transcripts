Hey everyone, I'm Lai Stallion, NLA for her athlete and today I'm going to show you how to make my favorite peanut butter banana protein pancake. So to start we're going to mix all of our dry ingredients. First half a cup of oat flour, half a cup of any gluten-free pancake mix, and one scoop of NLA for her vanilla cupcake flavored protein powder. Next we'll mix our wet ingredients. First we'll add half a cup of almond milk, one whole egg, and one tablespoon of coconut oil. Next we'll blend the ingredients into a pancake batter consistency. This will heat a nonstick pan and spray it lightly with coconut oil spread. Now we can pour in the batter. This recipe should make about 3 pancakes. Once your pancakes are fully cooked, serve them and top with one tablespoon of peanut butter and half a banana. What I love about these pancakes is you can top them with pretty much any topping you like. The step I step guide and macronutrient breakdown for this recipe can be found in the article below here on bodybuilding.com.
