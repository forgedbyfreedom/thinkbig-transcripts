How many times have you heard somebody say, man, I look so great the week before the show or I look so great that they have to the show, I look like garbage on the show day. What happened? What were it wrong? Hey guys, this is Lane Norton. I'm a pro natural bodybuilder for the Ph.D. in the traditional science. I'm going to use my experience in knowledge to walk you through one of the most important aspects of your contact prep. And that's your final week before the show, often referred to as P.C. We're going to go through what needs to be done in terms of your nutrition, your protein, carbon, fat intake, what you should do in terms of manipulating your water and sodium if at all, your workouts and cardio, we're also going to look at your posing. And what needs to be done on show day, like tanning and stage presence, I'm going to talk to you about the right way to do P.C. the science-based way.
