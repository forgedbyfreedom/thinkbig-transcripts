To begin, first set the bar in a rack slightly below shoulder level. Rest the bar on the top of the deltoids, pushing into the clavicles and cross your arms while grasping the bar for control. Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time, straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with your toes pointed slightly out. Keep your head and elbows up at all times. This will be your starting position. Now bend at the knees and set your hips as though you are sitting in a chair. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90 degrees. Keep your knees aligned with your feet by consciously using your abductors to push your knees out as you squat. Continue to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel or middle of your foot. As you straighten the legs again and return to the starting position.
