I touch a rope to the bottom pulley of the machine. Grasp the rope with both hands and extend your arms with your hands directly above your head. The palms of your hands should be facing each other. Your elbows should be close to your head while your arms are perpendicular to the floor with your knuckles aimed at the ceiling. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and slowly lower the rope behind your head while keeping your arms stationary. Then you lowering the rope until your triceps are fully stretched. Then exhale and use your triceps to return the rope back to the starting position.
