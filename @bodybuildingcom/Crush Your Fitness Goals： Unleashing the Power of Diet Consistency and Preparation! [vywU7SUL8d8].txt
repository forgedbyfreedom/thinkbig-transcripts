See this? I want to give you guys the best nutrition advice you have ever heard and what it is is you need to keep it simple so you can never fail to prepare. Everyone wants to follow a diet and get amazing results eating super tasty food. And yes, trust me, you can do that but sometimes it's just easier to sacrifice all the amazing taste and keep it simple so that you can stay prepared. Because the number one reason people fail with their fitness goals, they fail with the extra food they're diet and they always have cheat meals and just stuff comes up is because they are unprepared. They do not have their meals ready to go. So if you want to set yourself up for success, make your diet or make the meals that eat simpler so that you can mass cook everything to then have it in meals ready to go. Because I guarantee if you take like three to four hours one time for a week to prepare your entire week worth of the meals, I guarantee your progress is going to start becoming much better. Anyway, there's no excuse as to why you fail besides you just didn't do enough to get it done.
