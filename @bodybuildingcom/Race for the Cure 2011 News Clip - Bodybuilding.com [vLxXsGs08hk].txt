Son, how much money did you bring by saying you were at the team? I like to know the same thing. Do you know? I think I'm doing this for three. But it's for a cause and obviously you wouldn't do this being a bodybuilding.com guy. You wouldn't do this for anything. Would you? I do it for friends and a good cause. All right. There you go. You know. We're going to congratulate your responsibility for the $5 billion. The number one fundraising group here and you guys, what's the use for a proposed? I need everybody to strike a proposed.
