Being elite isn't about to close you where the car you drive or the lifestyle you live. Being elite is about the mindset you possess. It's about your ability to get back up when you get knocked down. It's the undying passion for pushing limits and striving for the next level. It's about running towards your dreams when everyone else stop for air. Being elite isn't in your genes. It's in your heart. Get out there and prove it. Welcome to Elite by bodybuilding.com.
