Dirty, the bear in me I'm still alive I've missed me the pain gets me hurt Since when my life left him am I Dirty I've been in this industry for a long time I've trained, learned from and taught the best And all through the sweat, pain, blood I've created the largest legwork that you will ever do Uncriscat in, bring your balls, aren't a f*** up and let's go This legwork came from years of training Like I've been training for 14 years now So I have to keep on thinking outside of the box To make sure that each body part evolves And legs be in a hard body part to continue to involve I've had to kind of extract pieces from myself And people that I've trained with such as Douriniates Branch Warren, Gary Strider, Neil Hill, Flex Lewis and a tighter, you know, Attach each part into my own sort of method And every now and again, like every eight weeks ago I'll do a workout such as this It's high volume, but it isn't endurance workout We only train for like 45 minutes So I just throw that in there and just shop the system Every now and again and it works It's the world's toughest workout for me for sure And for anybody else who tries to push themselves Beyond the realms of what seems natural This is unnatural what we're doing in the gym And you know, it isn't an endurance workout by any means But what makes it really really hard Is the intensity of it Like we're only taking like 45 seconds rest In between the sets So you're going to be sucking a lot of oxygen Especially if you've got more muscle Which requires more oxygen And you're going to be dragging ass in there And we're leaving no stone unturned We're hitting our Type 1 muscle fibers Our Type 2A's Type 2B's We're really knocking the central nervous system At a whack And you know it's going to knock your head about It's going to knock your body about And if it seems easy You're just pushing it hard enough with the intensity All the way We're going to be using a various techniques Tunis workout We've got our straight sets We're going to have drop sets Throne in there We're going to have partial reps Throne in there We're also going to have super sets Throne in there as well So you know we're going to be hitting the muscles From all types of angles Just to make sure that we're shocking the system And we're not allowing the muscles Specifically the legs Now get adapted to its environment We're going to start off with leg extensions We're going to get nasty, grimy and dirty in this We're going to get work up to 100 reps And you may think it's going to be a lightweight But it's not going to be a very heavyweight We're going to be doing a drop set In order to get out 100 reps But before we do that We're just going to do a couple of warm upsets Just to make sure that we get the side No real fluid in our knees And the blood within our muscles and the cycle head up All right, and then between the sets Just stretch out the quad quickly Pull the stretch for about 10 seconds Because it takes about 10 seconds At least for the muscle to stretch out And then we're going to increase the weight a little bit And just do another warm up Of around 10 to 15 repetitions Again just activate the muscles Get them firing and get the brain activated So for this workout we're going to start off with 100 reps on leg extensions Now this is going to be a drop set What you should be doing is starting off with the heaviest weight That you can possibly push on leg extensions After you've done a couple of warm upsets Obviously I'm going to put the stack on it And probably probably go through about 20 or 30 repetitions Before dropping it down Every time I drop it I want to get out at least 10 reps So I may do 20 or 30 now I'll drop it, grind out another 10 Drop it, grind out another 10 And keep following that theme and pattern until I get to 100 repetitions Once I get to that 100 repetitions I'm going to put it down on the stack again And just knock out some passports I'm going to be aiming for anywhere between 15 to 20 reps Before dropping it, 15 to 20 reps So I'll do that three times then Stray at the end of this 100 reps drop set So I don't 100 reps now I'm going to put the weights all the way back to the bottom of the stack For my passports I'm going to pass the weight back to the bottom of the stack From my passports I'm going to do a little bit of that I'm going to put the weight back to the bottom of the stack From my passports Make sure that you lean forward on this now Don't lean back To choose a weight for your passports for instance It's going to be trial and error I don't know how fast you fatigue, how much you have How to cast it, that you have how many type 1 muscle fibers you have over type 2 So you'll have to trial and error If you're doing a lot less than 10 reps before reaching failure Then you need to lighten it a little bit next time Again, if you're doing more than 20 reps Then you need to make it a little bit heavier So just trial and error Make sure that you chart down what weight that you used Until you find the right weight we're year Which is very round 50 to 20 on those passports Okay, so we did 20, 40, 60 Repetitions there on the passports As you can see it was only like a 2 to 3-inch movement Very little movement What you'll find is that it really targets the quads Right here right around the knee Right on the rectus from our us there If I lean back on the seat I'll find that it works a little bit too much of the flexors So it's really isolate the quads right around the knee Right there We lean forward when we're doing the passports The muscles are just absolutely gorge-dried blood man So to target the quads even more now We're going to superset leg press with scissy squats To start off with the leg press We're going to start off with our feet at the bottom of the platform With heels about fist distance apart To slightly pointed out And we're going to start off with 14 repetitions And then you're going to rest for five seconds without racking away And then you're going to do 12 repetitions again Rest for five seconds and then do 10 repetitions And then we're going to continue that theme with 8, 6, 4, 2 And then that set is done Are you superset onto the city squats then For some people, I've trained with They'll do with 100 reps on the leg extensions and the partial reps And that's how it worked out done They're on their way to the rest room and they're throwing up But you've got to be conditioned to this I do a lot of cardio remember So my cardio-verscal endurance is pretty good So I can hit the high reps Someone like Branch Rowan would you believe Has got pretty good cardio-verscal endurance as well He trains very intense And he's a big guy so if he can do it a lot of other people can You just have to be conditioned to it So it takes a lot of experience But it takes a lot of mental focus as well Okay again straight into the 60 squats now Always unstrat my knees Now I don't feel too much stress Within the knees on 60 squats And I want to get the blood flow Back around my quads and my knee area We're going to start off with 20 repetitions Hold in the dumbbells Going down to just a little bit further than a parallel So your hand string should be just a little bit further than a parallel Once you've reached failure with that You're going to drop them go a little bit lighter And do another 20 repetitions Now you may reach failure before the 20 repetitions But that's fine You just rest pause until you get to the 20 again When you feel like there's nothing left in the tank You drop in the weight and you go and add it again And it's a great sense of achievement But it's a great sense of just being the bully And the gym, you're just pounding yourself Pounding yourself, pounding yourself Until you ain't got nothing left Until you get back up next on, do it all over again Shit, that was tough All right, so Once we're super-set it onto the Susy squats as you can see I was using a dumbbell As my counterbalance To lean back Keep it back a little bit more upright So I haven't had not lean in too far forward So I'm still getting a lot of pressure through the quads Not much pressure on my back And I only come up three quarters of the way Because I want to keep constant tension On the legs at all time Nothing on the joint All on the muscles You cannot stop until you reach You're a quiet amount of repetitions Which is 20 repetitions In this case, just do all day You've got to do it, you've got to accomplish it You have to achieve something every time you go to the gym If that's a goal that you set you make sure your damper set you're going to achieve it Okay, even though I made a breath It's time for set two where we're going to bring the legs up A little bit, a little bit wider Same with the Susy squats we're going to take slightly wider stance Now to hit the abductors Which is the inner part of the thigh So leg should be in the top of the plate now Close to the shoulder distance apart And about shoulder distance apart Honocity squat Let's hit it I don't like to rack the weight on the leg press In between my five second intervals between the 14 reps and the 12 reps or whatever Because I want to keep the mental focus in that set the whole time If I rack it, I feel like that set is over with I want to keep the stress and load on the muscles I don't want to relax and go out again Because I feel that it's going to take too much mental energy Just to get back into it again So I prefer to keep that tensioner, keep the intensity in there Because this workout is all about intensity and that's it for me So I like to just keep it un-racked and just keep knocking it out Not going to get out Okay I'm strapping in There's no pressure on the Susy squats on the knees So I need to get the blood back into the area That's a sense you'll be following these sets Take a few deep breaths in few nose Get the oxygen to your brain, clear the head Of any outside distraction And get your head into the set Because not just quantity, we're looking forward to absolute quality When I come into the gym, I think about nothing else for that This workout and I'd be thinking about it for maybe 24 hours before I'm pitching myself going through the motions You've got to, you know, psych yourself up and put yourself into that dark place as well If you want it bad enough, you will accomplish it A lot of the time I should sleep more than what I should But sometimes I feel good if I'm slightly sleep deprived Because I'm a little bit more pissed off And I'm a little bit more cittat to get through workouts like this And so reason being that's why I do it A second set absolutely mulled me But it's good, I felt no strain on my back and my knees Just my cardiovascular system and we're supposed to work right through the quads So I've experienced a lot of back problems with the conventional squats And a meal hill actually taught me this movement Which really blitz my quads just as much Without the stress and load on my back, of course I still squat And I do recommend squat Just I don't make it a common part of the workout on a weekly basis Okay, so we're done with that superset now We just did two sets, that's all we required from that We're going straight on to the next exercise Now we're going to do what's called hills squats With one leg, superset that With a variation of the lying hamstring curl Which I'll demonstrate for you Once we've done one leg on the quad and hamstrings In the superset fashion, we'll do the other leg In the superset fashion And we'll cross back and forth for three sets in total All right, let's get into it So the next exercise is a superset with hills squats With a variation of the lying hamstring curl Single leg on each one Now the hill squat is something that I learned from Neil Hill, hence hill squat So what we're going to do is with our single leg of the hill squat We're going to do 20 repetitions holding a plate Once we've reached failure at 20 repetitions on that same leg We're going to superset on the lying hamstring curl That variation that I demonstrate Once we've finished 15 repetitions on there We go straight back to the hill squat on the opposite leg Of 20 repetitions And then superset that with a variation of the lying hamstring curl For 15 And then we go back again on to our beginning leg of the hill squat 20 repetitions superseted back onto the hamstring curl For 15 And we just keep going back and forth until we've done three sets in total of each superset on each leg So there's no rest here You know it's going to hurt us going to be hard You're going to be lightheaded and you're going to feel sick But you know this is an assistive work out you know I'm sick of seeing people with big built up a body and skinny legs If you want to get big legs with cuts with separation You're going to have to get with a big body So let's get straight into it So remember when you're doing this The hill squat We're doing 20 reps on here and we're doing 15 reps on the hamstring curl When we're doing the hill squat here We're only going down All the way but only going up through quarters away That's three We're going to 20 So when you're doing the hill squats your leg should be supported on a box or something That's about knee height Any lower than that you're not going to get the full range of motion You're going to have to go down as far as you may or you might find that you're going to have too much stress and load on your supporting legs So from the ventral box of knee height is about adequate Bring that supported leg up right high So we can isolate the leg as much as possible Keep your legs arms locked, stay upright You won't be able to use much weight on this It's private We're going to 15 On the hamstring curls you'll notice that my range of motion wasn't fully extending The knee so the leg was never straight Because I want to keep the tension on the hamstring at all times And not on the tendons or the joints There's always tension on the belly of the muscle at all times Keep an at stress and load on there We'll allow you to reach failure faster as opposed to using the full range of motion And it's going to have less chance of injury as well I really enjoy workouts like this I thrive off the pain because pain is pleasure at the end of the day And not only that, you know, I get motivated by people telling me what I can't do And what isn't correct Specifically goings on the forums that I hate is And they say you can't do this meal frequency doesn't mean shit And you know, high reps you ain't going to build muscle like that Well, instead of having their noses in the book Maybe that it should be bleeding right here in the gym Because half the time I look at these cats and they're like fat pieces of Omebas or you've got like skinny rakes Tell me what to do, you know? Just check out the results that I'm able to attain All the ones of my clients and then talk to me You know, because otherwise you ain't standing next to me If you can't stand next to me, go talk to someone else in ways to breath You know, because I'm here to evolve and move forward Wow All right, that's our three superset stone With Hill squats and hamstring curl again No rest in between those sets or three single sets at all It's just back and forth, back and forth You will be blowing there, you'll be trying to suck in oxygen It's going to be tough, but you know, you've got to fail to succeed You leave everything here in the gym, you don't take anything with you right the door Then you do it all again next week, but tougher and harder As I said, if you want unnatural results You're going to have to do unnatural things in the gym So guess what, we're going to go straight back To our first exercise on leg extension We're going to do the same as what we did when we started this workout My hamstrings and glutes are really fried From this exercise, I want to fry the quads again So again, we're going to start with the first exercise We're repeating it exactly the same 100 reps drop set, followed by the triple drop of the passports No rest, let's do it So our final exercise is repeating our first exercise Leg extensions, 100 reps drop set Identical to the way we did it before Start off with a heaviest weight of around 20 to 30 repetitions I did, but you've got to do a minimum of 10 And then once you've finished your 100 reps go through the drop sets We repeat the passports again When you feel like there is nothing left But to drag your ass out by your lips Hitting those passports just totally, you know, wipe the floor with you Because you're not only just hitting some passports You're going back to the weight stack that you started with You're heaviest weight when you legs are totally fatally So you're just draining that last bit out Just think about getting your ass not out in the ring for instance And then someone dragging you by your face out of the ring That's what it feels like And you know, doing something to shock the system Or always shock the body So that's it for hamstrings, quads and glutes So I did a drop set then until I reached 100 reps It doesn't matter if you do Three drop sets, five drop sets as long as you get to 100 Reach in failure with every drop set Starting with the heaviest weight possible Just to totally fry whatever is left in the quads It is now dead, remember when you come into the gym It's your chance to be the bully You can kick the shit out of yourself, you know And it's legal So you just keep on adding, keep punching it Punching it, if you feel this some life left And you punch it some more So let me ask you, you're going to come up with an excuse Or a commitment, you have to do what you fear And not fear what you do If you fear something like this, do it Because that's the only way that you're going to progress But if you've got any more questions for me Hit me up on body space, my name is Caged Muscle And for more of my training programs You can check out the 12 week hardcore video trainer Or my 4 week DTP trainer And for more content like this Go on to bodybuilding.com
