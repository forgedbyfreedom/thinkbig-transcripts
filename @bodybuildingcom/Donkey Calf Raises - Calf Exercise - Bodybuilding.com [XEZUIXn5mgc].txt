To perform this exercise, you'll need a training partner or a specialized machine. Begin by bending at the hips and holding on to a bench in front of you. Your feet should be at shoulder width apart with your legs slightly bent. Your feet should be directly below your hips. Your partner should carefully position themselves above your hips and hold onto you for support. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and raise your heels by extending your ankles as high as possible while flexing your calves. Then, hold the contracted position for a brief moment, inhale and slowly lower yourself back to the starting position.
