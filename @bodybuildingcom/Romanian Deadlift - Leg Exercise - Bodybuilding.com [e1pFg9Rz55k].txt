With a barbell in front of you on the ground, reach down and grab it with a shoulder width over hand grip. Now stand with the barbell. This will be your starting position. Keep your head up in your back straight and begin to lower the barbell by pushing your hips back as far as you possibly can. Your hamstrings should feel very tight as you do so. Lower the bar slowly to a point just below the knees. Your chin should be up, your butt should be back and your chin should be vertical. The knees should be only slightly bent. After a brief pause, drive through your heels as you return to the starting position.
