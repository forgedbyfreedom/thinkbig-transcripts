Kristen, welcome back to the pod. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm happy to be back again. Today is all about the moms or moms to be and rightfully so as this episode debuts on Mother's Day. Kristen, you yourself are expecting your first and less than two months now. So we're not only going to have a professional insight but real life personal insight here based on what you've experienced in experience yourself these last seven months or so. So team today we're walking through movement guidance for all three trimesters. The do's, the don'ts, the cautionaries as well as returning to exercise postpartum. This is exciting one for us. This is definitely a gap in the educational field that we're looking to fill. So I'm excited to jump in Kristen and I want to kick it off with topic one which is trimester one. So you find out your pregnant right and where do we go from here? Oh boy. Yes. So trimester one. I mean when you're early on in that first time so it's like one to 12 weeks is trimester one. You don't really have to change too much of your exercises. You can keep pretty much your same routine. But that being said usually women are hit pretty hard with nausea. You get lots of different hormones kind of coming in fluctuating so your energy levels are going to be definitely different. And if you're working out too on top of that you need to be able to fuel yourself appropriately to kind of recover from this thing. So you may not need to change too much of your exercises but you kind of want to take into account your changing energy levels and start a mind shift of okay I'm pregnant now. I'm going to have to kind of step away from what I've been maybe used to doing and start taking like different steps for each of the trimesters. So honor your energy systems if you're really nauseous you're not able to get enough food in probably like tone it down those first 12 weeks of your pregnancy and then the second trimester is okay and do and that usually feels a little bit better. So in terms of explicit movements you know are there things we should be avoiding? Are there you know kind of risk factors that we should be decreasing now that you know we're starting our pregnancy journey? Yeah I mean the major one is risk of falls and the injury to the uterus so like high impact sports boxing kind of things that would maybe cause some injury in that area can be detrimental to the pregnancy. So we just want to limit those things so if it's a high risk factor we can kind of just take that down. So obviously you know we want to consult with our doctors and we're going to treat this as a case by case basis but for you specifically Kristen you know give us an insight give us insight into maybe what your program look like you know prior versus what changes you made when you had it to try master one. Yeah so when I was pregnant I was still training kind of power lifting style and I was doing heavy deadlifts heavy backscrot heavy bench press I was actually going into a strength block so I was looking really forward to lifting really heavy and I could do that up until six weeks and then my nausea hit so bad that I was living on white race and soy sauce and I would go to the gym I would do some movements but I just could not output the same amount of strength that I was before so I had to take that strength block and had to like really tone it down and honestly do warm upsets just to get my body moving and kind of motor planning still and making me feel better but if I needed to rest that day I took a rest day. Yeah and how are we kind of you know meeting ourselves where we are right as you said earlier in the intro you know how can we still get the blood moving what are some low impact low stress activities that we can do we're not feeling the best we're not able to get our full new tritian and we don't have the energy levels to expand we don't want to set ourselves up for injury you know what does that look like yeah I mean that could look like some people are doing yoga some people are doing Pilates if you're a weight lifter like myself that's going in the gym in doing maybe body weight versions of it or instead of loading the barbell to even like 60% in your loading it to maybe 20 to 30% and you're just taking more rest breaks in there so you're just taking your time with each movement to kind of check in with yourself really trying to get that core activation and really good warm ups so you're spending a lot of time doing mobility you're spending a lot of time activating your core and so those are some ways that you can kind of meet yourself where you are. Yeah decreasing that intensity factor and just yeah 100% matching the energy so let's head into the second trimester all the same questions apply here you know maybe as you said maybe that nauseous decreasing you're overall feeling a lot better but when it comes to movement what are kind of the the bumpers that we're looking to instill here yeah although like you are feeling better and you're like oh I can go after it now you do need to kind of check yourself a little bit you won't we when you get pregnant you got to leave your ego at the door so you can't be like ego lifting during pregnancy it's not about this we're trying to create a nice foundation for your postpartum recovery and also a lifetime of athleticism so in that second trimester what you can do is definitely sorry I'm out of breath it's like pregnant everybody very pregnant is very hot but during that second trimester what you if you're starting to feel better you can start adding in some more load and more intensity you're just you're dialing back just a little bit from what you used to do in the first trimester or before pregnancy another recommendation is to your body is also changing so that baby is probably now bigger and your center of gravity is going to be changing and you may feel some heaviness coming into the pelvic floor and so we start looking into pelvic floor considerations during our second trimester even in our first so we're looking for signs of diastasis or like a coining in the front which is too much pressure into that linear alba we're looking for pressure down into the pelvic floor if you're experiencing your anary or fecal incontinence or you're just having musculoskeletal pain so this is kind of when peak relaxin happens is between 12 think to 15 weeks of your pregnancy so you can imagine your ligaments and your bones are just starting to shift to allow for this pregnancy to progress and for that baby to grow bigger so you're going to feel things more than you used to and you might be experiencing pain that you didn't experience before so this is a great time to just kind of like dial back seek help from a physical therapist I would usually recommend in the second and third trimester's kind of setting up the pelvic floor PT so you can have continued care throughout your pregnancy and postpartum where how can we start to understand kind of what the level of pain is well maybe I just need to move my body a little bit more during this time or hey maybe I need to back off right we know kind of a lot of the common complaints live in that low back during pregnancy and around the general core area where this is happening kind of we've got a self gauge then how do we know when it's time to reach out for help I mean if you're experiencing pain for more than a week I would say you should reach out for someone to help because during pregnancy your body's only going to keep changing so if you can kind of get on top of that beforehand you can mitigate a lot of those issues later on in your pregnancy so if you're experiencing low back pain excuse me in your second trimester already that's a great time to check in with a PT see if you're actually engaging through your core properly and you're still maintaining nice hip stability and for you how did your program evolve adapt etc during the second trimester well I really started writing my own program is at this point so I added in instead of more heavy barbell work it was more like kettlebell work so I was trying to get some conditioning of myself through there so in my second trimester what I was doing I tipped back on barbell I added more kettlebell I was doing like kettlebell swings I kept some of my main movements but I brought my intensity down to about between 60 and 70% of my red maxes and I just monitored for those symptoms so any mesquids go to pain any pressure into my pelvic four any dyes dases are cony which I do experience so I have to be extremely mindful of it and then I'm looking for just like overall how am I feeling day to day yeah I want to talk about cardio for a brief second here and this this isn't specific to you know for a second a third or really applies to all I think a lot of people you know we've seen the videos of of pregnant women running we've seen them deadlifting 400 pounds off the ground and we see the comments that come along with that but you and I have had the conversation of if this is something that you have been doing for a number of years at this point you know it is okay to continue to agree this act during your pregnancy so kind of where do we start to understand you know someone who's been doing this for a very long time versus somebody picking up running for the very first time in their second trimester let's talk about that a little bit yeah I mean if you were able to run through your first trimester amazing what if you're able to run through your second trimester and your body is feeling good and you're feeling really stable and you're not having any pubic synthesis pain any urinary continents you can continue those movements it's great for like your mental health and mental well being too but when you see these outliers of these women who are trained athletes and so they know their bodies really intuitively they're also probably have a team behind them being like okay yeah let's try this today this looks good your form looks amazing you're not showing any changes in your biomechanics and so let's continue doing these things but for the majority of women they you usually do have to kind of step back and take it down and if you're asking yourself can I yes you can should I maybe not like what's the reason behind why you're choosing to do these things and so what do you expect to do also postpartum right yeah maybe your second trimester is in the best time to do your first crossfit classes probably not anything that one but if you're an avid runner for the past eight years and you want to keep running you feel good and you get that clearance from your doctor then all the more power to you absolutely third trimester and let's break that down okay third trimester is fun that's where I am right now you can I'm pretty much my training program is to do the same I'm just kind of toning down the weights and I'm seeing how my body is feeling on the day today if I'm feeling a little bit more fatigue so sometimes you just start to slow down the baby gets like real heavy and you start to feel kind of bogged a little bit more what we want to focus on in the third trimester though is really learning how to connect to your pelvic floor because we want to yes have that contraction support our pelvic floor kind of get those kiggles and things like that but it's more important in this stage to find that lengthening aspect because when you go into labor your pelvic floor needs to move out of the way it needs to not be contracted it needs to lengthen and stretch and move out of the way for the baby so understanding how to get that contraction and then full relaxation and third trimester is really important so we're adding a lot more mobility into this area so we're doing a lot more hip mobility we're doing a lot more pelvic floor mobility just to help engage that baby into the pelvis and we're learning mechanics on how to push which is a little bit it's not intuitive for a lot of people so belly big belly hard use your diaphragm to push down and you're thinking about opening your rectum and so that that type of almost like a bearing down but release that we practice throughout the third trimester but you can keep your exercises going he may be more winded in your third trimester so you just may need more breaks and we're also looking at probably you're changing your squat because the belly you need to accommodate more space for the belly so if you're doing dead lifts I moved from conventional to sumo because I couldn't get past my stomach and then I moved from a regular back squat to a box squat because it wasn't able to maintain my pelvic control like as well as I was doing more pelvic tilting and then you also want to think about if you're putting too much pressure into that linear alba so doing like a bench press on flat my back was seeing more co-neing so I just elevated it I noticed it with planks kind of elevating my planks and my pushups and modifying there so we're reducing too much tension into the front here to kind of decrease our risk of a continued die status and to postpartum yeah and Chris has been putting out a lot of great pregnancy modification content on her Instagram which will share at the back end of this episode but really helpful tangible takeaways for users so Chris and we're going to spend most of our time here this is postpartum so we've we've gotten to it we've gotten to the the the big day you're it's coming up for you right so this is the neck of today's discussion because there's a huge gap in terms of how women can safely return to exercise post birth obviously we're going to have to navigate this differently again based off of a type of birth vaginal verse sees actions so let's consider both options and to let's talk about recommended timeframes order of events progressive overlords and things of that nature so I mean let's start day off right babies here I want to start right there and progressively work ourselves up into the weeks and months that would follow amazing and I have my patience and clients start day zero with some movement and some breathing techniques so you set up a great foundation during your pregnancy we practice all these skills during pregnancy so that you know how they should feel postpartum because now that that baby that was inside you creating all this tension like in your abdomen is now outside of you and that is feeling a little bit loose and a little bit more squishy and so harder for you to engage so day zero what is happening regardless of birth regardless of a cesarean or a vaginal birth regardless of tearing um what you're going to be doing is diaphragmatic breathing so you're going to be taking nice deep breaths trying to expand through your abdomen 360 degrees around and then you're trying to just gently engage through your transverse abdominis which is your deepest core and your pelvic floor now you may not feel it the same way you did during your pregnancy and even before pregnancy you got to trust the process that when you do that exhale you're getting those gentle lifts and so you just progressively do that over the first two weeks how are we navigating cesarean versus vaginal birth obviously to completely disruptions here so kind of breakdown both yeah so if you happen to have is cesarean birth that's a major abdominal surgery so they go through seven layers to get to that baby and then they'd suture you back up and we have to be now mindful of a surgical wound during that time so usually the timetable gets pushed about two to four weeks depending on how you are doing during that recovery so instead of a vaginal birth we'll be just a little bit more time maybe in that first phase of rehab during a seaside section okay and how does that impact returning to sport returning to movement I want to say not everybody's returning to a specific sport but they do want to return to an active lifestyle what considerations are taken into place in terms of rehabbing there based off of type yeah so we have to be a little bit more mindful early on with movements when it comes to a cesarean because of that surgical site we want to sort of preserve any sutures that have occurred there and so we don't want to we want to avoid like excessive we don't want the wound to open so we need to be more mindful of rotation load and recovery during that time opposed to a vaginal birth let's talk about when we start reintroducing movement so maybe we're doing things on the table on the floor except our learning how to reengage our core our our patience is lacking mom wants to get back to the gym or the road over whatever it is for her when do we start reintroducing some of those movement patterns standing them up on the floor and getting some strength back yeah I mean you're doing a lot already with the baby so you're picking them up you're squatting down you're bathing them in the tub you're doing tons of laundry you are doing a lot of the movements that you would be doing in the gym now you're just doing them in real life so what we want to think about is we use exercise to complement the things that you're doing throughout the day so that you feel more stable and more controlled in those positions and have less pain so what we're doing the breathing in the transursive dominance and the key goals kind of in that first half of the like the first two weeks you should start to start feeling a little bit more connected to your body and then we're moving into body weight exercises so these are going to be movements that you're really familiar with this is including bridges squats and we're also adding some postural movements because in those early weeks my main complaint is actually from breastfeeding so it's like that hunched over neck position so we do a lot more postural work lot more mobility in the stage and we're adding in banded work here and so you'll get back to doing movements that you're familiar with just body weight versions within the third and fourth week postpartum and then from there it's just we progressively overload it. What is the general timeline Kristen this is again I say general general general here it's going to be case by case and you have to get this clearance with your with your care team but let's say day one to 90 or maybe day zero to 90 as you put it right those first three months how are we bringing new moms new parents back to a consistent workout routine when are we picking up weights I mean it's it's very similar to a recovery protocol from surgeries and injuries right that's how we're approaching this yeah I mean you can be really systematic about it and then you can modify as needed for each person so really the first two weeks is that early rehab stage and then weeks three through six we're kind of adding in more of those movement patterns are really familiar with doing body weight six to eight weeks is usually when you get doctors clearance to resume activity and what does that mean it means your tissue is a field so if you had any tearing with a vaginal birth your c-section scars is healed so you're able to go through the movements you are not at a point where you can take on the same amount of low that you did during pregnancy because the postpartum body is more vulnerable than it than a pregnant body and that is because fatigue and now you you're breastfeeding or if you choose not to breastfeeding you're so recovering from those nine ten months that you were pregnant so that takes a little bit longer than the six weeks that the doctor is recommend but six weeks is when your tissues are healed so we can start adding load them and this is like small amount load so baby cannabels yeah like let's add a goblet squat let's do some lunges let's do a step up or step down and so that's in our six week around eight weeks is when I start to try introducing just some plyometrics really light plyometrics so like pogo jumps static mountain climbers just so we can get more core engagement more hip movement and then at like that eight weeks to about eleven weeks were progressively adding more plyometrics into it so if you want to return to a higher impact activity like running jumping anything that involves you kind of sprinting on one foot we I usually say we we eat till twelve weeks to kind of really introduce that but we're building up strength from day zero to those twelve weeks and so it's really systematic about that in the night twelve weeks we do like a return to run program and so you're back that's already three months there at your twelve weeks if we're just getting back to baseline over you were pre pregnancy probably you've been feeling stronger because you've been really slow and committed and intentional about your movements and how you build your foundation you'll be able to get back to most full sport probably around between twelve to twenty four weeks now Chris and you're an outlier and the sense of everything you've continued to do you know throughout this time let's talk about motivation for expecting moms and then new moms to you know speaking real for a moment movement isn't in the top of their head I mean their lives have been turned upside down for the better right but then there are also things like postpartum depression just thing through and more the mental health aspect of it so I mean one you know how do we find the commitment to stay movement stay moving during a pregnancy and then the second part to this question is you know how do we motivate new moms to you know put their health in their bodies first again as they're adjusting to new life I always say movement is medicine and it's like the analogy when you're on a plane and you have to put on your mask first and then help someone else so if you're not taking care of yourself you're you're not going to be showing up for your baby a hundred percent and so there's a lot of mom guilt sometimes when I'm like talking to people and they're taking that hour to to work out or get some movement in and but at the end of the day I'm like that makes you a better mom because now you can show up more fully and so I think moms just need a reminder of that a lot of times of like you can't take this time for yourself because this is what's going to make your time more more valuable in the in later points but the easy way of like adding movement back in kind of working through either baby blues or if you're dealing with postpartum depression of course we need to seek help for for that and you need to talk to someone but I love movement snacks so like exercise snacks throughout the day because you don't necessarily have to do the 45 minute workout you can do the 45 minute workout 10 minutes throughout the day and that's like four to five points of your day that you're doing some kind of intentional movement and you're getting the same volume and load that you would if you just did it straight through but it's more manageable so adding things like a band next to your breastfeeding or wherever you are feeding your baby like on the stand or in the diaper bag and just doing like a couple banded pull parts when you finish putting a diaper on that and putting them down so just making it more accessible throughout your day I think makes it a lot easier for moms to start creating a program and being more consistent for some you are about a month and a half out from me near little one not two months right so seven weeks seven weeks yeah what's been the biggest learning lesson for you during this period oh boy I mean I really did have the tone it back and so I had to check my ego a few times and it's fascinating because I feel like I've I've coached pregnant and postpartum moms for years now and now going through it myself I'm like I have a whole new appreciation of what that fatigue feels like like your body feels like how sleeping just sucks so bad it's like a cruel joke of you having insomnia during pregnancy and then knowing that you're not going to be sleeping postpartum it's like oh god so I feel like I've learned a lot going through it myself and I just I I like to think of it when I'm in the gym and I'm moving myself intentionally and I'm working out that this is a real privilege that I can do this for myself and I'm doing this for my baby so I'm like setting up a good foundation for her so that I am hopefully going to recover a little bit faster so I can show it for her every day you said a public gender reveal on the baby's home podcast excited to be having a girl Kristen we were thrilled to have you back on today thanks for all you do for women seeking more
