Stand up straight with your feet at shoulder width. Hold the barbell in front of you using an overhand grip. Your hands should be a little wider than shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position. Now, exhale and raise your shoulders up as far as possible. Hold the top contracted position for a brief pause. Then inhale and slowly return to the starting position. Your arms should remain straight at all times.
