To get in the starting position, hold your body above the bars with your arms nearly locked out. Then while breathing in, lower yourself down more slowly with your torso leaning forward less than 45 degrees. Your elbow should flare out slightly until you feel a slight stretch in your chest. Once you feel the stretch, use your chest to bring your body back up to the starting position while breathing out. Also remember to squeeze the chest at the top of the movement for a moment to get the maximum benefit of the exercise.
