Grab the bar using an overhand grip. Stand straight up with your legs spaced about shoulder with the part. Your knees should be slightly bent. This will be your starting position. Now keeping your knees stationary, exhale and lower the barbell over the top of your feet by bending at the waist. Keep moving forward as if you're going to pick something up from the floor. Continue this movement until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. And inhale and start raising your torso back up again by extending your hips and waist until you're back to the starting position.
