Alrighty guys, so here are four of the most common mistakes I see made in the gym when it comes to the cable lap pull down. So number one is going to be swinging our bodies back and forth on the machine. Using momentum to pull the weight. Remember we always want to be in control of the weight. We don't want the weight to be in control of us. Number two is going to be having an uneven grip on the bar as you perform the exercise. It's very easy to favor our dominant side. So remember to set up an even grip to avoid creating in balances. Number three is leaning too far back. This turns our lap pull downs into a rear-delt row, which for this exercise we don't want. And the fourth and final mistake I see is going beyond the appropriate range of motion. Pulling the bar all the way down to our belly button is an indicator that the weight is too light and you're not using the desired muscle group to move the weight. So now that we've discussed how not to do your lap pull down, let's have a look and see how we should be performing this exercise. First, we need to make sure that we have an even grip on the bar and our posture is in the correct upright position. Then, instead of pulling the weight with our hands, we want to think about driving our elbows down behind us, bringing the bar to our chest. Keeping control of the weight the whole time. Remember to focus on your mind to muscle connection, and if you ever lose this, light in the weight and double check your form and tech.
