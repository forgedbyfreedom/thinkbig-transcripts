I need him as Harry Vargas and I'm a bodybuilder with a dot com master coach. I'm a certified personal trainer and I focus on running and string-think conditioning. I was a delivery guy and the active part of the job, that was the only part of the job that like I liked. Movement is how I connect with people and how I connect with myself. Everything else felt like work, fitness just came naturally to me. Bodybuilding.com is a community that just really wants to help people become better versus themselves and I'm excited to be part of this next chapter. I built my body in order to develop the mental fortitude and discipline that it takes to be successful in life. I want to be ready for whatever life throws at me. I like to keep the bar eyes. All the bodybuilding.com build your body, build your mind, build your life.
