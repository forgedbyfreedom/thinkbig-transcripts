Alright, so this squat variation is the front squat with no belt. I'm still wearing a heeled shoe so I can get the proper position. You're going to set up with your pinkies right on the rings or thumbs a little bit off the smooth. Now, one thing you want to make sure your conscious of is creating that shelf with your lat so the bar can sit on it. So, when you come up under the bar, flex your lat's hard. Take the bar out and force your elbows high as you're going through the movement.
