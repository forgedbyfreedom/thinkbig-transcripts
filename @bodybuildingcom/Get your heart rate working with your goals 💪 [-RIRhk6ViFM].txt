Five trainings owns five heart rate train zones, right? It's only one two three four five zone one is like 50 to 60% of your heart rate and zone two 60 to 70 70 80 90 greater than 90 right? And then I'll show us what your exact zones are. So for you, you let's say your zone one you want to work on fat burn. That would be your zone one. So it's tell you the exact goal standard numbers of you need to be between this heart rate and this so X and lot, right? Zone two same thing. It gives you that nice, you know, breakdown of whether it's 110 to 120 heart rate, BPMs. It's showing you where you need to be for your endurance. So zone two would be in some endurance or in increase in cardio output. Zone three would be kind of that middle feature so that middle man that would just have that Viotimax increase zone four, which is higher intensity is more aerobic. So if you're from ProVian aerobic and then zone five is max. So for zone five, not a lot of people get to. It's more for power output in max and a lot of leave at level athletes get there because you're heart rate so high. So you're using that Viotimax. You're seeing how you consume action, how you use it efficiently and then giving you gold standard data of what heart rate zones you need to be in to start working those different systems. So it's a great way for endurance athletes. Air day athlete just to work on what they need to work on.
