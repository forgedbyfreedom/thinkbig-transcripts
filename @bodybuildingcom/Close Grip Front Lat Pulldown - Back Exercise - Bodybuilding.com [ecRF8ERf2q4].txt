Sit at the pull down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure you adjust the knee pad to fit snug against your legs. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the weights and allow you to perform the exercise correctly. Grip the bar closer than shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing forward. Both arms should be extended in front of you holding onto the bar. Lean your torso back about 30 degrees to create a small curvature in your back and stick your chest out. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and bring the bar down until it nearly touches your upper chest. Draw your shoulders and upper arms back to do this. Once you reach the bottom contracted position, concentrate on squeezing your back muscles. Your upper torso should remain stationary during the movement and only your arms should move. So make sure to use your forearms only to hold the bar and not to pull it down. After a brief pause at the bottom contracted position, inhale and slowly raise the bar back to the starting position with your arms fully extended and your lats stretched.
