Hey guys, Sean Stafford here, just want to say a huge thank you for registering on the true strength student challenge brought to you by the guys at Optimum Nutrition and BodyBilling.com. Because this is the first ever transformation challenge we've run for students only, here are some tips to help you stay healthy and fit through the school year. Number one, get yourself a plan. If you don't know what you're doing in the gym, log on to BodyBilling.com and pick one of our trainers that is you to follow and they're great. Number two, get yourself a workout partner. For that time when you're not feeling up for the gym, you can need someone that a drag you. Not only a drag you do the gym, but push you when you're in there. Number three, and you're not going to like this guys, try and get some sleep. Pull yourself away from the bar that hour early and get that extra hour in bed. It's going to help you push harder in the gym the next day and it's going to fuel your results. And last but not least, try and cut down on the booze and watch what you eat. This is an eight week challenge guys. Put your head down, work hard and best of luck.
