music Commandment number seven angles are essential to grow what the fuck are you talking about Steve T. What do you mean to angle the angles all our bodies are different? We are unique that's the way to get Lord Mades. Your insertions where your muscles connect are different than mine. So therefore we can do the same fucking exercise. You'll fill it at the mid range if you buy a set and I'll fucking fill it at the bottom of my buy set. When we're doing exactly the same dynamic size wide can we're fucking different?

Do that motherfucker is that simple?
