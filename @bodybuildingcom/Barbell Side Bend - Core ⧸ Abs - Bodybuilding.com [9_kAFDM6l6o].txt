Stand up straight while holding a barbell on the back of your shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position. Now while keeping your back straight and head up, inhale and bend at the waist to the right as far as possible. The rest of your body should remain stationary. Return to the starting position, then bend to the left and hold for a moment before again returning to the starting position.
