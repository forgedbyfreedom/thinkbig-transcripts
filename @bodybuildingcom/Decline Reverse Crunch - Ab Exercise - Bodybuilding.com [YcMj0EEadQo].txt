Light back on a deep-clined bench and hold the top of the bench with both hands. Hold your legs parallel to the floor using your abs to support them. Keep your knees and feet together. Your legs should be fully extended with a slight bend in your knees. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and bring your legs toward your torso by rolling backwards to raise your hips from the bench. Hold the contracted position for a brief moment, then inhale and slowly return to the starting position.
