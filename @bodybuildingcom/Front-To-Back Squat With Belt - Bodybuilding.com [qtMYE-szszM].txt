This variation is a one to one ratio of a front squat right into a back squat with a belt. As soon as you're done performing the front squat, you're going to immediately rack the weight and then perform the back squat. Once again, you're going to be wearing your heel shoes. You're going to add your belt, pull it through, get it nice and tight. You're going to obviously be pushing in the belt with that thoracic pressure. When you set up for your front squat, pinkies on the rings, thumbs off to the smooth. Put that bar up on that shelf so you're creating with your lats, take it out, perform the front squat with some speed. You're going to do that. Rack it, immediately set up again, pinkies in the same spot, get up under the bar, squeeze shoulder blades, walk it back, air in, push out in the belt. Then rack it.
