Sit at the butterfly machine with your back flat on the pad. Adjust the arms of the machine so there's a slight stretch when you grasp the handles. Your upper arms should be positioned parallel to the floor and your elbows should be slightly bent. This will be your starting position. Now, exhale and push the handles together slowly as you squeeze your chest in the middle. Then inhale and slowly return back to the starting position.
