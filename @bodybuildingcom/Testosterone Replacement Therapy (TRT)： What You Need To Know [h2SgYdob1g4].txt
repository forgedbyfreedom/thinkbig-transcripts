I think a lot of our negative connotation comes from the 70s and the 80s and the 90s were guys. I mean, this is the term juicing where they're high alpha antibiotics, steroids, stuff that we don't even prescribe, that we don't even have access to. And there's a whole black market, even though TNT exists legally. But the key differentiator is there's a dangerous low end of it spectrum, which we talked about hypogonatism, secondary hypogonatism. There's also a really dangerous side on the opposite of the spectrum. Where guys are taking antibiotics, steroids, well beyond what even a lab core or quest test will pick up. I mean, that's 15, 16, 700 nanograms per decilator. You're running risk on both sides of that heart disease, autoimmune issues, cancer, stroke. And that's why you're seeing in the body-bidden community, guys are dropping. In some cases, like FIs, and they're not taking what we consider replacement. And that's the key word. We were replacing what we think should be there at a healthy level. We're incorporating labs on a significant basis. Yes, about how often guys should get labs. When you're on a therapy, it's even more. For me, I'm getting anywhere from four to six comprehensive labs a year. Sometimes when you're in your first kind of round of treatment, it might be six to eight. You've got to be measuring things outside of just testosterone. PSA, your estrogen levels. There's so many things that go with that.
