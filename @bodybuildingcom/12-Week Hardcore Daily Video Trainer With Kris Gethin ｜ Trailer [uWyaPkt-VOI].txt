My name is Chris Gettin and I am here to help you achieve the body of your dreams. I lost about 35 pounds during the whole transformation. He's kind of like I said, the no-nonsense, no frills, you have a goal, you stick to it, and that's pretty much it. You know, don't wind, don't complain. You see, I know what it's like to be trapped inside an unhealthy body. My severely injured my back. I was depressed. My asthma, my back was getting worse, and I sunk to a personal low. It was this low point, was my transformation trigger, to change my habits for good. But I didn't do it overnight, and I didn't do it alone. And you don't have to either. Workout plans, nutrition advice, motivation and supplementation, you'll get it all right here. If you have somebody like Chris behind you and know what he's talking about, or just lose weight, or better feel better in your experience change life. So what's unique about this program? I'll be doing it right alongside with you. I'm going to be there with you every step of the day. In the gym, and on a non-training day, it's given you all the info that you need to have a successful transformation and be a winner at the end. I'm going to be there with you. I'm going to be there with you.
