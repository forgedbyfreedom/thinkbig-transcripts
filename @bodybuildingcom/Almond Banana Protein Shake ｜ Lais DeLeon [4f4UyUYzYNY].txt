Hi everyone, I'm Lys Delion, NLA for her athlete and today I'm going to show you how to make my almond banana protein shake. To start we're going to add one cup of almond milk to our blender. Next we'll add two scoops of NLA for her vanilla cupcake flavored protein. Then we'll add one tablespoon of almond butter and one frozen banana. Last we'll just throw in about a handful of ice. Then blend. And four. For this recipe we use vanilla protein powder, but you can use any flavor protein you like. This recipe is great because it's quick and easy and portable for when I'm on the go. The step I step guide and macro nutrient breakdown for this recipe can be found in the article below here on bodybuilding.com. If you have any questions for me you can find me on Instagram at Lys Delion or on my website LysDelionBitness.com. For more free recipes and articles like this keep coming back to bodybuilding.com.
