Place two dumbbells in front of a flat bench. Sit on the end of the bench with your legs together and the dumbbells behind your calves. The palms of your hands should be facing each other as you pick the dumbbells up. This will be your starting position. Now keeping your torso stationary and forward, exhale and lift the dumbbells straight to your sides until both arms are parallel to the floor. After a brief moment at the top contracted position, inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
