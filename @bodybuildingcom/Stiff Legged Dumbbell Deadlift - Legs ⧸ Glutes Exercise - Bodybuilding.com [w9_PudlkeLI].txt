Hold a couple of dumbbells by your side. Stand up straight with your legs based apart about shoulder width. Your knees should be slightly bent. This will be your starting position. Keep your knees stationary and back straight. Now exhale and lower the dumbbells over the top of your feet by flexing your hips and setting your butt back. Keep moving forward as if you're going to pick something up from the floor. Continue this motion until you feel a stretch on the hamstrings. Then inhale and start raising your torso back up again by extending your hips until your back at the starting position.
