Arginine is an amino acid that can be converted into or are incorporated into proteins, and sometimes it's called a conditionally essential amino acid. It's actually made via bacterial fermentation and then purified and you'll find it as L-Arginine Hydrochloride, sometime Arginine base, which means nothing else has attached to it, or Arginine attached to other organic acids like Arginine Alfakita Glurane. Arginine actually is used as a direct precursor by the body, especially blood vessels, to make nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a little gas-like molecule, or a gaseous molecule that opens up blood vessels. That can increase muscle blood flow that can be experienced before during training, and if you want to try it after. Arginine has been shown in several studies to actually increase blood flow and may in certain circumstances that in some studies improve performance. It also can raise insulin if you take large amounts of it, which itself can improve nitric oxide and increase blood flow just through the insulin release from high dose of arginine. Duster for Arginine can be up to 6 grams and some studies have taken up even to higher dosages, but with respect to supporting nitric oxide synthesis, perhaps 1.5 grams, 1 to 2 times per day, and divided doses, or even single doses would be adequate to raise blood arginine. Because Arginine is extensively metabolized or broken down by the intestines in the liver, you don't raise blood arginine as high, so you could stack or combine it with citrine, which gets into the blood and raise blood arginine much higher on most twice as high and Arginine itself. And then you can even go once further and add in glutamine, which actually can be used to convert into citrine, and you get a 3-pronged approach to raising blood arginine through arginine, citrine as a precursor to arginine, and glutamine as a precursor to citrine.
