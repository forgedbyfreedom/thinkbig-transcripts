First of all, what is testosterone? Yeah, it's a human hormone. It's a hormone that is very, very vital to master hormone for both men and women. And it is a sexual hormone that does so many, so many amazing things in her body, whether sexual function, physical function, building lean muscle mass, helping a brain fog. We talked a little bit about metabolic health. If you're metabolically unhealthy, it's almost a guarantee that you're going to have a low T symptoms. It's another epidemic that we're not talking enough about just insulin resistance, just metabolic health. And it's something that 50, 60 years ago, we weren't talking about because we've changed. We have said in dairy lifestyles, we have an obese population. We're living in a world full stress, both micro and macro. We have these things, these phones that we're constantly on, that we're constantly getting these cortisol release, the emergence of processed foods of changed testosterone levels. And I think in order for us to start adjusting to it, correcting it, optimizing people, we gotta start talking more about it.
