Add weight to one end of an Olympic barbell. Make sure that you place the other end of the barbell in the corner of the wall or under a heavy object on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backwards. Then forward into your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as possible and keep your knees slightly bent. Then grab the bar with both hands just behind the plates on the weighted side. This will be your starting position. Now pull the bar straight up by bending your elbows. Exhale and continue pulling the plates up until they nearly touch your lower chest. Be sure to squeeze your back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold at the top contracted position for a brief moment. Focus on only moving your arms and not swinging your torso during the lift. Then slowly lower the bar back to the starting position. You should feel a good stretch on your lats. Be sure to not let the weights touch the floor. Be sure to not let the weights touch the floor.
