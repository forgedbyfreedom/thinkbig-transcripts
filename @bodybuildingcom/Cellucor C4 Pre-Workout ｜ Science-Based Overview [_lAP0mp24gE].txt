My name is Chrissy Kendall. I'm the Science Editor here at BodyBilding.com. I received both my Master's and my PhD in Exercise Physiology from the University of Oklahoma. And in today's product review, we'll be discussing Celia Cores C4. C4 is a pre-workout that contains a combination of ingredients to help energize you through your workout, but also help with building muscle strength and size. This product contains beta-alony, creatinine nitrate, arginine alfakita glutinrate, and an energy complex that contains caffeine and the accruing. So when Celia C4 formulated C4, they put together a combination of ingredients to really help you in the gym. Beta-alony helps to delay fatigue. It's great for interval training as well as high intensity resistance training. There's also creatinine nitrate. It helps with increasing muscle strength and size, but with the addition of the nitrate group on the creatin molecule, it helps it to dissolve better in water, so you're not left with any sort of sand or gritty taste at the end of your drink. Also, the nitrate group works really well with arginine alfakita glutinrate. These help to increase blood flow to your muscles, which will give you your muscle pump during your workout. The blend is great because it contains 150 milligrams of caffeine per serving, but it also has the accruing. And the accruing is a stimulant similar to caffeine, but has less of a tolerance issue. So it's still going to help give you energy and focus in the gym, but less likely to be habit-forming and won't disrupt sleep at night. So C4 costs about $1 per serving and comes in really unique flavors, like pink lemonade, strawberry margarita, and my personal favorite orange dream cycle. And that concludes my product review for CeliaCore C4.
