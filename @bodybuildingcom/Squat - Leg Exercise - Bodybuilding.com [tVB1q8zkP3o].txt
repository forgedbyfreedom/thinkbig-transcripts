To perform this exercise, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the bar is loaded up with your desired weight, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders under it. Now lift the bar from the rack by pushing simultaneously with your legs and straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs to a shoulder width medium stance with your toes pointed slightly out. Keep your head up at all times and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and begin slowly lowering the bar. Sit back with your hips as though you were going to sit on a chair. Maintain the arch in your back and keep your head up as you descend. Continue lowering the weight until your hip and knee form a line parallel to the floor. Now exhale and lift the bar back to the starting position leading the movement with your head. Push the floor with the heels of your feet as you use your abductors to push your knees out so they stay in alignment with your feet.
