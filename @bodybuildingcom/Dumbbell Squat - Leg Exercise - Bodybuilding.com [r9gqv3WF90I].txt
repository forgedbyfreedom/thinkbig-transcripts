Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell in each hand. The palms of your hand should face your legs. Position your legs in a shoulder width medium stance with your toes pointed slightly out. Be sure to keep your head up at all times as well as your back straight. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and slowly begin to lower your torso by sitting back with your hips and bending at the knees. Continue down until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Once you've reached the bottom contracted position, exhale and raise your torso back to the starting position. Push the floor with the heels of your feet as you extend your hips and knees.
