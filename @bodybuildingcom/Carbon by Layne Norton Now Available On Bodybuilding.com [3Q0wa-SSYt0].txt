My name is Lane Norton. I'm a BS and biochemistry and a PhD in nutritional sciences. I'm a competitive pro-natural bodybuilder and powerlector. I formulated the carbon line of supplements because I saw the need for science-based products with effective ingredients that were properly dosed and no proprietary blends. Every ingredient in every product in the carbon line has a specific purpose to help you reach your goals. Now I've made a career busting bro science. And what I saw in the supplement industry was quite frankly a lot of bro science. A lot of products with ingredients that weren't backed by any science or ingredients that were science backed but way underdosed. Further, the idea for proprietary blends drives me nuts. You as a consumer should know exactly what you are getting in each product with each ingredient. So you can pick the best supplement to reach your goals. I'm a BS and biochemistry and biochemistry.
