Stand up straight holding a dumbbell in your hand with the palm of your hand facing your torso. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and bend at your waist to the side as far as possible. Be sure to keep your back straight in your head up. Hold for a second at the bottom contracted position, then exhale and slowly return to the starting position. Now change hands and repeat on the opposite side.
