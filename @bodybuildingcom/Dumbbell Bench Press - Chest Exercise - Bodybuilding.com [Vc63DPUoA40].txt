Slide down on a flat bench with a dumbbell and each hand resting on top of your thighs. Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells. Lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width. Once it's shoulder width, rotate your wrist forward so the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position. As you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest. Hold for a second and then begin to come down slowly. Ideally lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it. When finished, don't drop the dumbbells next to you as this can be dangerous. Instead you'll want to return to the seated position and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. To do this, simultaneously push with your upper body while slightly kicking with your lower to provide the momentum needed to help you return to the seated position. From this position you can safely place the dumbbells on the floor.
