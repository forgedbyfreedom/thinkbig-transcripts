Life face down on the pad and grab the handles with your upper chest at the top of the pad. Lift the bar off the rack and extend your arms in front of you. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and slowly pull the weight upward. Keep your arms close to your torso and squeeze your back at the top of the movement. Be sure to keep your upper body on the pad at all times and do not use your biceps to lift the weight. After holding the top contracted position for a brief moment, inhale and slowly lower the bar back down to the starting position.
