Stand straight up while holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides. Place the balls of your feet on a sturdy and stable wooden board that is around 2-3 inches tall. You can point your toes in different directions for different emphasis. Your heels should extend off the back of the board and touch the floor. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and raise your heels off the floor by contracting your calves. Hold the top contracted position for a brief moment, then inhale and slowly lower your heels back to the starting position.
