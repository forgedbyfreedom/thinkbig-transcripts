Stand up straight while holding an easy curl bar at the wide outer handle. The palms of your hand should be facing forward and slightly tilted inward due to the shape of the bar. Keep your elbows close to your torso. This will be your starting position. Now while keeping your upper arms stationary curl the weights up while contracting your biceps, focus on only moving your forearms. Continue to raise the weight until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the top contractive position for a moment and squeeze the biceps. Then inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position before repeating.
