My name is Jacqueline Castellek, team optimum nutrition. I'm also a 2010 body space spokesmodel and acrossfit box and a national level bikini competitor for NPC. I got started in fitness at a very young age, I used to watch my dad work out when I was probably three years old and he had his little garage gym so I used to sit in there and watch him and then as we grew up he always said, oh you guys need to get into fitness and we didn't really know what that meant until high school I did a weight training class for P and my gym coach noticed that I was strong for a girl and that kind of motivated me I like to be strong. When I was in college it's kind of when I really picked it up so I had to start you know kind of making sure that I was staying motivated so I started hitting the gym really hard. Then I started meeting people that were really into competing and bodybuilding and figure and stuff like that and so that's how I you know originally started. I had a very traditional training regimen and I would go about five six days a week and split it up I would do you know my legs my upper body back just the basic bodybuilder routine is what I started with. I switched over from the traditional bodybuilding routine in 2009 and it was because I was training for women's tri-fitness event. Women's tri-fitness is an obstacle course in bench press box jumps a lot of running one of my friends had mentioned to me that oh that sounded like CrossFit I said what's CrossFit I'd never heard about before and so she told me about her gym that she went to and said I should go try it out I was hooked instantly from that first day because it reminded me of being an athlete again of you know running track running cross country very competitive so I fell in love with that first day. A lot of people think that if you lift heavy you're gonna all of a sudden become this big and bulky person and we're very small petite person so you know I like to show people I could lift heavy and do bikini shows it worked well for me because I don't have to spend you know three hours in the gym doing weight training and cardio I get all of that in one session I'm there unless you know less than hour so it worked well from me my schedule. What's nice about doing the CrossFit is that we're doing a lot of stuff that you would do if you were an athlete in a sport it's such a high intensity and we're doing a lot of intervals and stuff like that that for me and my body it works better I burn fat, weight quicker I stay lean all year round and it's much more fun than doing two hours of cardio. I opened up my own gym CrossFit and rivaled and we started with 20 members and most of them were women and now we're at about 130 and probably half and half male and female and it's been amazing and very busy but I wouldn't want any other job in an entire world because daily I get text messages from my clients and they will send you before and after photos and they're just like I can't believe how much changes I made you know in three months, four months it's amazing they're always thanking me and it just feels really good to be able to help people and so I'm actually trying to constantly motivate people that hey you know we're getting older we're not getting any younger here you guys need to kind of take charge of your health and take charge of your fitness and do something about it because I do on a gym obviously I like to preach doing CrossFit and the time that you're saving by doing it because a lot of people have jobs, lives, kids and they have a hard time and everybody's main excuses I don't have time that's the main thing that I hear for them not to work out so you know I always come just go try it, try it out and CrossFit is fast you're gonna be there and done with an hour so there's really no excuse because it's not really that much time out of your life My training approach is CrossFit and what CrossFit is is it's hindsight's the functional fitness we do power lifting we do Olympic lifting we do plyometric workouts body weight a lot of running pushing pulling everything that we do is a compound movement so it's gonna combine multiple muscles and multiple aspects of fitness and we don't do the same thing every day we're always changing up what we're doing the only time we ever go back and do the same workout is if we want to measure our strengths if we you know we gain strengths or you know endurance or quickness in a workout just so I know that my training is working with me with CrossFit we have a quad and that's the workout of the day I program that for our gym and every every gym runs differently so every gym is gonna have a different quad for that day for my gym specifically everybody's gonna come into my gym and I take everybody through a group warm up and we want to reduce that risk of injury and then we're all gonna do the workout together and we all start it together so it gives you a push because everybody else is doing it the same time with you if you look over and you're resting and the person next to you is working you're gonna say a crap I need to get up and do this because they're working I can't be lazy so it gives you that extra push you know when you're doing your workout just to make it work a little bit harder make it work a little bit faster I train usually five times a week but if I can get six and I'd like to get six in but because I own a gym and I'm really busy it's hard to get six days in we have a bunch of workouts that are named after military or firefighters or police officers that lost their lives so those workouts are gonna be really hard like compared to a normal quad there's one that's called Merff he died overseas his favorite workout was to go run a mile and then do a hundred pull-ups two hundred pushups three hundred squats and then run another mile that was his favorite workout so now that's like a big crossfit workout we do it on Memorial Day me and one of my girlfriends we decided to do the weighted run and so we had 15 pound weight of vest on and then we went into that workout and it was probably 90 degrees outside it was horrible but when you do workouts like that those hit they're called hero odds when you do those workouts you kind of have it in the back of your mind why you're doing it because you know somebody was protecting us overseas and they lost their lives so it kind of motivates you to get through that pain and that suck I followed the paleo diet it's a grain free diet it's also a dairy free diet however you're gonna see different variations with the dairy because if you have dairy when it's raw it's healthy for you when you have dairy when it's overly processed at the grocery store it's not that healthy for you because you're not really getting all the nutrients and stuff that it says that you're getting you don't absorb the calcium that it says you're getting because of how overly processed it is I'm gonna say I'm like 90% paleo because a hundred percent paleo you're not gonna have anything artificial and I do take protein powders in ways that do have artificial swaners in it but when I'm eating my foods I just eat lean meats I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables I eat lots of nuts and avocado's just really healthy fats sometimes I eat the raw cheeses and I'll have raw milk one of my clients actually she owns a farm so she'll bring me fresh goat milk which is really good sounds kind of weird but it's really good and then as far as regular milk in the store I will have it every once in a while because my husband drinks it so I'll put it in my coffee but if that's the case we do like organic whole milk when I go to the grocery store I really try to find anything that is hormone free I like to go with the grass fed if it's not ridiculously expensive and then getting everything fresh really fresh that's my favorite thing is like the fresh fruit and vegetables however I know that stuff goes badly fast so I do still do a lot of frozen vegetable stuff like that that way it can last me some time and I do a lot of eggs eggs are my favorite thing to eat because they're so quick and so easy and a lot of chicken and a lot of fresh I usually four to five meals a day and it just depends on when I get up I try to eat every three hours sometimes it's like two hours a two and a half hours because I'm hungry all the time I eat a lot of food and then the way that I plan my meals is protein a carbon a fat every single time that I eat. Let's say my favorite paleo meal is anything I make in the crock pot because I don't want to spend too much time sitting around cooking I just chop everything up and throw it in the crock pot but I can think I'm like my exact favorite I put chicken in there frozen and then I stick a can of coconut milk in tomatoes and broccoli and then I do sea salt pepper and then Italian seasoning and I just let it cook there for about five hours or something and it's amazing it's creamy creamy goodness me my husband like to have a chimeo at least one time a week and our chimeo will be completely not paleo because we both love pizza and we go for the Mexican food so we'll go have that like usually on a Friday night or Saturday night if I'm trying to get ready for a show or an expo or a shoot I just cut the chimeo out so I won't have anything that's a non paleo food so no Mexican food or no pizza for me but what I eat on a regular basis I don't really cut out much other than my fruit that night and that's pretty much it. When it comes to supplementation I believe that less is better and taking stuff that is you know more natural I try to stay away from things that don't have a lot of ingredients so when I when I go for supplements first thing I do is I turn it over and I look at the ingredient list. On the front label it might say one thing but when it turned over on the back there's a lot of other stuff in there that you wouldn't know so I always make sure to look at those I take a post workout protein shake in the morning I take a fish oil a vitamin D3 and then a calcium supplement probably twice a week before workout I'll take a pre workout energy drink but like I said those usually have a lot of artificial swaners and them so that's why I only take them a few times a week. If I feel like I'm a training extra hard or maybe when I'm adding in those extra strength training days I will take XMA at night because I really like that as far as recovery goes I sleep a lot better when I do take that stuff and my schedule is crazy so sleep is really important for me but I do notice that when I take XMA supplement I'm not merely a sore. My supplementation stays the same just throughout the year I don't really change anything up I use to a long time ago take a fat burner for competition but within the last few years I realized that I actually like just drinking coffee better for that so I took that out of my diet completely and I mean that's really it I just stay the same I stay consistent I don't feel like I really have to ever change you know what I'm doing. Plains come in that they're you know their brand news that the whole working out in nutrition they do ask me a lot of questions about you know what they should be eating or supplementing so I do recommend to take protein shake after they work out as far as like vitamins and stuff I usually tell them to take a multi because most people don't eat enough fruits and vegetables so the average person definitely needs to have that you know vitamin supplementation everybody always asks me about a pre-workout drink so I usually will recommend them you know to just look at the ingredients find something that you know that's minimal you don't want to go crazy with that kind of stuff so that's it for my training nutrition and supplementation and if you guys have any questions you can go ahead and find me on body space at Jack Will & K.
