So we're doing a cool stretch like this, you know, locking out of the top. When your shoulders go up and in like that, that way you're not doing that last third of the movement, which is mainly try steps. So you're going up, boom, like that, boom, all right, perfect, two, three, four, hey, two more, nine, ten perfect. When you do this, you normally go down a panel or just below, you're going to get a bit of stretch. Where it felt comfortable, man, don't overstretch, you know. Usually just bring down touch the delts and you go back up again. I don't normally go in, I normally go straight up, yeah, I'm sorry. If you're not there, you're kind of taking attention off the ladder and that bit's try steps to the top. You know, it's all just keeping on the delts, I don't need to lock out of the top. All right, big Chris, come on, you know, I need to spot something this one, man. Okay, oh good, two, strong man, three, four, all right, six, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Okay, good, drop them down, man. All right, this is the one, man, ah, get them up, boom, those are one. Okay, line them up, man. First one, first one. Okay, let's go now. Two, three, four, all yours. All yours, come on, up, up, three, two, three, two, three, go, now, good, six, man. Good, good, six, strong man. But there's nothing wrong with pre-existing on shoulders. Do that course first, do your presser second. You don't always have to stick to exactly the same script. You know, I know it's a train thing too much because I like to keep a track on the Power Rangers and exercises. If you're going up in your workout weights then you're doing something right, you know. Stand down, up to parallel, keep your palms down. Good. Two, three, stop the swinging, the body still. Four, eight, two more, up, nine, and again, up. Okay, your body movement down a little bit, you got a little bit of a bad habit of doing this. It's a lot less than I normally do. I'm ready for that. All right, come on, man. I'll rock and roll them in. Trying a little bit in front of you. All right, let's go. Yeah. Good, one, two, three, four, it's good, come on. Five, it's good. Six, nice, come on. Seven, give me tight, eight, two more, keep tight. One, and again, up, and halfway, now, halfway, up, come on. And again, one more, up, good. Good, just another way, we're going to be on failure. Half reps, three, quarter reps, just to take a bit on failure. I'll give you a little tip on the last couple, but it's hard to spot the on that. Yeah, everything you've got, yeah, everything. Up and squeeze, nice. Roll the negative, good. A body still, man. Oh, let's better. Five, good, come on. Squeeze, six, and again, up, squeeze, seven, one more, up, all the way up, all the way up. Okay, slow it down, now, slow it down. I'm taking it to the top, up, slow. Last one, everything, try to stop it, try to stop it. All right, maybe not. What's that form, yeah? Good. Two, strong one. Three, nice. Come on, come on, come on. All right, that's yours, in again. Squeeze, one more, everything, everything, squeeze it up, squeeze it up, slow it down. I'm going to take you up, hold it there. One more, hold it up. That's it, nothing left. Once I've done a couple of four, stretch, and it's got no positive strength left. Then I'm lifting it to the top, and it's just trying to control it on the way down. Once you're kind of control it, then it's finished, game over. Let's go. Fremming it up goes forward a little bit. That's good. Six, four, seven, and again, pull, eight, two more, pull, nine, again, half reps, go, one more, go, good. It's so much harder when I fold my elbows forward. Yeah, because if you come back, you're using your legs. It's just, it's just, it's just a small muscle, man. You know, so if you come and straight out, you work in more real delts, you don't need to use as much weight. It's already done in the lats. You know, there's no point duplicating what the world is done. Yeah. So try and isolate it on this one. You don't need it, it's on a way. As soon as I said that, and you started pulling that to the side, you can see your red arch. Really? I like it. I feel like it back to 20 pounds heavier as hell. Real delts, come on, think about it. Good. Good. Perfect, round three. Four, keep that form. Five, up. Six, good. Seven, and again, all the way up. Eight, halfway. And one more, squeeze. Great. Top done, man. Top done. Squeeze. Squeeze. I see his other. Thank you, man. So we're going to come from here, yeah. Albo's stuck by your sides. From here, lower chest. A lot of people do this. Push out like that. One is to keep it, Albo's both sides. Come out here. Down and in there. Get a much better contraction at the bottom. Bring it in, cheer legs here. Wow, it's a huge and triceps. I'm keeping this locked in. Letting the weight come out to there. Down and in. Much better contraction at the bottom. Right in, the bottom of the squeeze. Good. Three, four, five, six, seven. And try that negative a little bit more, yeah. Good. I find it easier to balance if we've got one leg forward and one leg back. Instead of like staying like this in your waltz and about. You don't want to start leaning in and letting your elbows come out because then it becomes a pressing movement. OK. I'll feel it to bring it right in there and squeeze it out a bit. Two, three, four, five is good. Six, keep it tight now. Come on, keep it perfect. Seven. Look at this. Eight, keep tight. Nine and again. Push. And two more. Drive it down. Drive it down. Drive it down. One more. Keep tight. Come on, push. Horse, all the way. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Good. OK. Good set. From here, help. From that position, I want you to angle back here. So from there. We're going back to there. Yeah. Let the weight go behind your head. Bring it back up, but don't bring it over. Just keep it on. That way is more on the triceps. Let's train on the tendons. Yeah. Yeah. Sting arms out. Go. I'll go it from there. No, don't pull it over. I'll pull it over just to extend it. Go down. Up. There. That's it. OK. Now you've got it. Two. Three. Oh. Screw it, man. Come on. Eight. Two more like that. Keep the force. Nine. One more. Squeeze. Got you. Well, now, try to put all the stress on the triceps without overloading your tendons. You know, a lot of people get tendons and I just go into heavy on this one. Come on. This is the one that counts with Chris. Come on. The grip. Can the angle? Everything's tight. Yep. Squeeze. Good. Two. Three. Four. Five. Come on. Six. Good. Seven. Come on. I'm watching you. Tied. Eight. These are the ones. One more. Squeeze it up. Squeeze it up. Squeeze it up. All the way. Lock it out. Try to say. You're going to do something directly overhead now because to really activate the long head, which is the biggest head of the triceps, you've got to kind of get a stretch on and get overhead. Got it. I should try then. All the way down. All the way up. Good. One. Two. Three. Four. Eight. Two more. Big squeeze. Nine. And again. These are stuff. I got it. Yep. Good. Go back. Drain. Chim below. One. Two. Three. Four is good. Come on. Five. Squeeze. Six. That's work now. Last exercise. Never. One more. Come on. Push. Push. Good. Good. Good. Good. If you want to try it, say. Look at that. I don't worry about the burn. I can do J. and Fonda classes. You want to get a burn. As long as the muscles go into failure, it doesn't know how much is on the bar. The weights are tall man, the weight is a tall, just to put stress on the muscle. You don't have to take a lot of time between sets in order to stay at the same weight as if I was doing 100 pounds. That's called pacing yourself. That's exactly what I want. It's a big mistake. You don't have to face yourself. Man, just go to failure and get the job done. Get out of the six sets and three of those are warm ups. Three work in sets. You're dry sets.
