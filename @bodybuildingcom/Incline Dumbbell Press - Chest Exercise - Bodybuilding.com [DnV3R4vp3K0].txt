Light down with your back on an incline bench and a dumbbell in each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Use your knees to help bring the dumbbells up and with an overhand grip hold them out to the sides with the elbows at about 90 degrees. This will be your starting position. Extend your arms and bring the dumbbells together above you so that your arms are perpendicular to the floor. Exhale during this portion of the motion. After brief pause, return the dumbbells to the starting position as you inhale.
