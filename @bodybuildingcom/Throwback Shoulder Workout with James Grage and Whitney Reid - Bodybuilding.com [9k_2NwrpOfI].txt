You know, when you grow up, you grow up in the gym the same way I did. You know, we grew up in gyms like this. They were small, there was nobody in 3,000 square feet old, no name equipment. I mean, half the stuff was made by probably people at the gym, you know, they iron workers put the stuff together and you know, it wasn't totally different than anything you see today. It wasn't like now, you know. Now you've got access to so much information, you've got bodybuilding.com where you can get on and you can research all these different workouts. I mean, have that. You know, we had had the magazines and then you had the old big dude in the gym. And that was the guy that you went to for all your advice. You know, when I started training again and you know, it's been cool for me to, you know, to put some intensity back in my workout. We're going to go through a shoulder workout today. This is a crazy shoulder workout. This is one that you can't do all the time. I don't recommend doing this. This isn't like an everyday shoulder workout. This is something you come in and you do once a month to just really blow it out. We're going really hardcore. We've been, we've been hitting this, you know, off-knowing for the Pascal for months. And that's been great. It's been great. It's my fancy gym bag. I like that. Let's do it. My lead off. Yeah. I guess I have like a blue collar work ethic. And in my opinion, that's what it takes to be successful in the gym. You know, everyone wants fast and easy. Fast and easy. Show me the nutrition plan that's, you know, fast and easy. Show me the work I plan that's fast and easy. And there is no fast and easy in building your physique. It requires hard work and it requires patience. But emphasis on hard work, you know, everyone wants to, you know, they want the latest scientific discovery and nutrition or the latest breakthrough in training. You know, show me the university study. Oh, I don't want to see the bro science. Right. You know, it's, it's real simple. You come in here and you work hard. You work your ass off. You put some effort into it. Like you go into the gym now. You see these guys in there and, you know, they got their shirts cut all the way to the side. And so I see him like, you know, they'll do the like, pretend to, to wipe the sweat out of their eyes so they can flex their abs in the mirror for the girl next to them. There was, there was no Instagram picks back then. Oh, dude. Now you go to the gym. I mean, it seems like there's no the main concern is getting a good, good picture. I can have a cool filter for Instagram. Well, for us, we didn't have cell phones. But if I would have brought a cell phone and taken a selfie, I think I would have got a selfie. No, no, no, no. You said where your guides can't use that word selfie. I think I would have got back here. Shoulders. Shoulders and traps are those body parts that no one wants to train. It's like nothing exciting about them. It's like, that's the coast day. What are you doing? Shoulders abs calves. It's like my easy day. But actually be the day you go in and just kill it. Because nothing's going to make you look bigger than having big shoulders and big traps. You wear a shirt. You go wear a sweatshirt and still look big if you got big shoulders and traps. And cool thing about this, the single arm dumbbell presses. You can't cheat. You know, seated dumbbell presses. You can kind of slide your butt down and use some upper test to press that weight up with this. There's no cheating. There's no hiding. Do I think there's another great thing about having a train partner? There's no better way to get stronger and bigger than by training with someone who's stronger than you. So I like train with it to stronger than I am. It pushes me. It slips out.. Don't think about it. It even rockets super claustrophobic...大哥! It's okay, I'm gonna relax the turn it hurts so Barton isКА mejor. for the health slap I'm gonna have! ahhh. Ahhh. Ahhh. Ahhh. Ahhh. Ahhh. So he can get 10. I could eat. I could easily. Push out and say he's. 50 pounds heavier stronger but. That's. See, manage to train with someone bigger and hit and strike bigger. I feel muscles. That's what it's all about. Ahhh. Oh. Oh yeah. Good set. You set. That's how you build muscle. I want to fill you there. Hold it. Pop it now. So full ball movement here. Oh. That will get you hard going right there. You don't see this much anymore. This is a total body workout. He is having explosive hips. And that strength to power up. There you go. That's better in cardio. You know, he look around here. There's not me machines. This bench is. No. His free weights. This is good. Most machines are just a different way to try to make you feel like here's something that's hard and making it easier. This isn't supposed to be easy. No. It's supposed to be hard. He's supposed to come in here and work your ass off. Grab a bar. Put some steel in your hand and move it. Why make me look bad with you? You're making it look too easy. Oh. Make him look like a superstar. You're not going to struggle. Let's go. Nice. Close. There you go. Looking good. Almost done. Nice. I'll put some cows on your hands. Look at that. That's a good one right there. I'm going to save that one. I'll put that in my pocket. I'll go my scrapbook. That's it. That's it. Easy. There you go. There you go. And a couple extra. Oh, that's so good. Now that's just be the day. Let's go. That's it. That's it. There you go. Get up. Come on. Give me some presses. How many did you do? Four. Four. Did you? Four. Let's go. Come on. There you go. All right. All right. All right. Only did. Three actually. Yeah. Just for that. That's the lead book. That's the lead work. Peppies. Oh shit. I got a bunch of it when it comes to gym. Oh yeah. We can go down the list. One. Not rocking your shit. You know. Look, it's again, it's about respect. You know, you do late press. So what, you're the man, you can go in, sack 10, 12, 14 plates on each side. But what about the 125 pound lady that comes after you that wants to do leg press? You're gonna make her on rack of thousand pounds. You're not the man at that point. Have some respect. Take care of the gym, have some respect for other people. So that's a big one for me is just respect. Here you go, squeeze it at the top. You don't need to go so high, just stop right there. There you go, squeeze it, squeeze it. That's a, I said, it's a hell of a pump right there. All that lateral, that little, little baby, baby, weight right there, so much weight. No. It's not about, you know, how much weight you live like? I can't tell you how many times I'll go pick up something off the dumbbell rack and some dudes looking at me. And whatever I pick up, he'll want to pick up five, ten pounds heavier. He's over there swinging it. Looks like he's having a convulsion. Trying to get the weight up. MUSIC You could give me the lamest workout on the planet. And let me do it for a couple of months, and I'll get results with it, why? It's not about what you do, it's about how you do it. It's about how much effort you put into it. It's no magical workout routine. All right, that's hard work. But I say come on. It's a little bit fun to me in my shoulder. But there's a lack to cast it, and then there's just pain. I can't hear where it's most bored. And we're only halfway down. No, come on. There you go. Ah! Come on. Ah! Oh, yeah. Brute delts. It's just the past couple years. I've really been working on that. And they're really isolated. I feel like you need to do a number of movements to get the blood in there. And I think it's more about that. It's not putting you weight on his forehead. He's only doing it just to maintain his body position. Start putting weight on your forehead. You're going to start tweaking your neck and your back. So don't lean on it. And if you feel like you got a lean on that bench to get the weight up, drop down and weight. Most people in the gym think I'm a dick. And it's not that I'm a dick. I just, I'm focused when I go on there. I'm there for a reason. Oh, good. See that angle he's pulling back. You're a delt poppin' up. Oh, my god. Let's go pull it. Let's go. One way. Squeeze it to top dude. No elbows. Keep those arms straight. Oh. All right. Just 12 reps there. What do you think about weight on those upright roasts for dumbbells? I don't know, but could you pick up something heavier? She's, you got it. Come on. Come on. There you go. See a lot of guys doing upright roasts. And they get real narrow on and they bring their elbows up real high. You don't have to bring your hands to your chin. Get your elbows right parallel with your shoulders as plenty. Come on, wait. I straight arms. You know, she's squeezing it back too, because your traps just don't bring your shoulders up. They also bring them back. Don't do this weird roll. You have to hear and something. I have to see this weird, like they're rolling the boat or something. So it's a bit of a move. Yeah. Just squeeze back. What'd you do? Who's 21? 20. Oh my god. Take your chair. Come on. Pull it. There you go. Drifting on floor. There you go. There you go. Nice. See this way I have a train partner. Counts, because once you start getting tired, you'll say, That's good enough. I'm good. I got a pump. I'm good. Big traps. You're big traps. You trap some of those muscles. I remember as a kid watching the original incredible Hulk watching Luke for a ignore. Do most muscularness. Oh, yeah. Tras popped up. Oh, I don't want to look like that. What a little kid. Don't you know that. Always the first thing they do is try to push their next floor. Look at my neck is. Nice. The other vans have a train partner. You got someone to rack your waist for you. Last one. Pull it. All right. So we will finish it off with the pressing movement. This is another one that I'm not too familiar with. The best way to think of these. Instead of a shoulder press, where you're not just using your delts, using your triceps, this is almost like the same as doing a chest fly. Difference between the chest press and the chest fly. So this is the equivalent on shoulders. So imagine keeping your elbows at 90 degrees. You're going to go down and you bring them up. My elbows don't move. What a push chest start with. I'm good. I'm good. I'm not going to come from that. What do you think? 30? What do you think? Do I wouldn't go any heavier than that? I would even start first set. 25? I could. I'd help me out with these. Got it. There you go. You go really turn these up here. Thumb down and you peek you up. And then drop them down. There you go. That's a good stretch. There you go. I'm telling you these will burn. These are nasty. Don't go too heavy. You want to use good form. And you don't want to drop the dumbbell on your head. You don't need much weight. It's a great way to finish your shoulders off. Yeah. Is that over the top of the floor? Yeah, you like that? Yeah, that's how I turned it on right there. Oh, I just turned it on. Come on. And if you don't know what movie over the top is, then you're a lot younger than us. Yeah. I just stayed with them. Yeah, I'm going to stay with these. I got a good pump. Oh, man. I tried to get not only that controlled and centered, but at the top of the range on motion really squeeze it. Nothing's going to make your muscles burn and sore the next day like a good squeeze. All right, let's go. Come on. Come on. Up. Up. That's seven. You know, I can easily just quit here, but not pissing off. You're going to shake it off. I'm going to finish it off. There you go. Squeeze. There you go. I'm not doing that. Sure, just because I quit. Nice. Come on. There you go. Oh, come on. There you go. Is that three? Is that two? That's two. That's two. That's much more than two. That's two. That's two. That's two. That's two. That's two. This is the spot you. That's good. Oh, boy. Good work. How far does it don't spot each other? They got to get to the way. What am I going to do? My job to lift it for him. How's he going to get stronger, fellow? It's just way. Nice. Nice. Yeah. It's music. Let's go. So that's it. We've hit our traps, blasted, hear your delts from front to back. It's just, that's an all around killer shoulder trap workout. So like you said, this isn't something you want to do. It's a fairly every week. That intensity was really high. Took us about 35 minutes to knock through that entire workout. Go on to the gym, work hard, show some heart, put some effort into it. That's what gets results. Hard work and consistency. Guads can't use that word self-esteem.
