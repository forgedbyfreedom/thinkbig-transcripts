Hi, I'm Sonia Bechorelli, I have BB bikini pro model and personal trainer. I have been personal training for six years and I treat anybody from the stay at home mom to the fitness competitor. We're here at the gym and we're ready to do back and bicep. We're going to be doing super sets and the super sets are going from one exercise to the other with no rest. I like super sets because it can smell heart rate up, it burns more calories, especially with the skinmy season coming. I really want to get those calories burned and the last time on the treadmill the better. We want to do three sets of 10 to 12 reps with one minute rest between each super set. The first super set will be doing lot pull downs with the seated incline bicep curl. Now we're done with the lap pull down, we'll head straight over to incline bicep incline curl. I will be doing the bicep incline curl. You'll see that I'm doing a little bit different on the way up, I'm having my palm facing up and on the way down, I have my palm facing in. I do this speaker that works both the bicep heads, so a little bit harder for me and there's a full extension which makes it harder for me to work my biceps. We're on to our second super set, seated cable row, super set with the cable bicep curl. Our last super set is the reverse script barbell row with alternating dumbbell camera barbell. There we have it a complete back and bicep workout. It is really important to train every muscle group at least once a week. I recommend that you throw this back and bicep workout in every other week. A little spicy and creative every day never hurts.
