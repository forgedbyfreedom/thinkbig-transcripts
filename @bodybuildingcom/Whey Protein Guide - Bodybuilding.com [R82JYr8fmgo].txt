MUSIC MUSIC Herschlihe hydrolyzedway actually takes milk protein or actually milk, flu-milk, and fractions out the way protein, and then digest it with enzymes or acid or both, to chop up the way protein molecules into smaller fragments. Herschlihe hydrolyzedway actually may be ideal for the person that has problems in that justing rager-intact proteins as they're called because the partial hydrolysis process which makes smaller fragments or peptides may make it easier to be digested in their forgiveness to chance of a food allergy reaction to the way protein. Also, people want to have a faster digesting and absorbing protein. Herschlihe hydrolyzedway may actually afford that benefit. Herschlihe hydrolyzedway would be a great product for people that would like to absorb protein faster, and get perhaps get more into the blood because of the smaller peptide size and several studies showing that maybe more quickly absorbed and raised blood, amino acid concentrations faster and higher than intact or whole way protein. The most recent research shows that about 20-25 grams of protein after intense resistance training is the most the muscles can use for an animal response. Even if you're a large size person working out with intensive resistance training, above that any additional protein is burned as a fuel or actually could be used to support fat storage if you have excess calories. So about 25 grams of the good target, the other thing to consider is that if you're consuming it after training and some people do it before with a fast digesting, fast absorbing carbohydrate, you could also combine it with for enriching, branch chain amino acids or even pure elucine by itself.
