Start by standing in front of a loaded barbell. What keeping your back is straight as possible, bend your knees, then bend forward and grasp the bar about shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position. Now while holding the bar, start the lift by pushing with your legs and simultaneously raise your torso to the up-right position as you breathe out. In the up-right position, stick your chest out and contract your back by bringing your shoulder blades back. Then slowly return to the starting position by bending your knees and simultaneously leaning the torso forward at the waist. Keep the back straight and breathe in as you execute this portion of the movement. When the weights on the bar touch the floor, you are back to the starting position and ready to perform another repetition. As this is a very technique driven exercise, you want to practice perfect form before attempting heavier weights. If you have back issues, substitute a rowing motion in place of this exercise.
