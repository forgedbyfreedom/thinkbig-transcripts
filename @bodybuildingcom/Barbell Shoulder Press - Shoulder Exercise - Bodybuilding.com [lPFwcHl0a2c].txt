Sit on a bench with a barbell position to interact that is set to a height almost above your head. Grab the barbell wider than shoulder width and with the palms of your hands facing forward. Unwrapped the bar and hold it above your head by extending your arms. Maintain an upright posture. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and slowly lower the bar to shoulder height. Then exhale and press the bar back up to the starting position.
