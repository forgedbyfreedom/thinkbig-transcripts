Hook an ankle cuff to a low pulley and attach the cuff to your ankle. Face the waist deck and stand a couple feet away. You'll want to grasp the steel frame of the machine for support. This will be your starting position. Now while keeping your knees and hips bent slightly, exhale and contract your glutes to slowly move your working leg back in a semi-circular arc. Raise it back as high as you can comfortably. Now full extension, squeeze your glutes for a brief moment to maximize the contraction. Then slowly return your working leg to the starting position.
