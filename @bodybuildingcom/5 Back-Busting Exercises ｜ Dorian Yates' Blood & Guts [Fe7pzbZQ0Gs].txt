We're doing a full overs first because it's isolating the latch with that bicep involvement. Usually the weak link in a latch exercises a bicep is going to give way. So we're just trying to work the latch without having any bicep involvement. We had a pull over machine that's ideal because it's full range all the way around. Where a dumbbell is only a half range, but we're working with what we got. That's what we got today, so we used dumbbells. Good. Good. Good. We're going to have a good turn. We got you couldn't have best turn, that's 11. 12. Okay, I'll do it with him. Yeah? I'll do it with you. Good on you. Okay, boy. Hey, boy. This is the same dumbbell. Yeah. Nice and tight though. Good stretch, quick pull. One, two, three, four, five, good. Good, good. Good. Thanks, strong. Biggest. Seven. Good boy. Great. Great. Big pull. Oh, nice. One more. Last one. Oh. Big. Yeah, I got it. We're going to use a pull down with it by steps to come into play. I stretch, spring down, squeeze. All the way down, man. There. Squeeze, yeah. Pause at the chest. Good. Pause, good. Keep the body still, man. There. Good. That's better. Nice. Two more. All the way down, squeeze. One more. All the way down, squeeze. All right, it's nice. Nice. Arch of the bottom, man. Because if you pull down and you like this, you're not getting the contraction instead of me. Right there. Right. Right. There are 225 people that go, man. Stretch that body movement. Stretch out the shoulder go, bring down, squeeze on it. Good. And squeeze, nice. Two, good. Three, nice. Come on. Just look. Rats. More. Five, good. Come on. Please. Six. Arch of the squeeze of the bottom. Go. Man again. All the way down. All the way down. Squeeze it in. Squeeze it in. One more. Stretch and pick up. Squeeze. Squeeze. Good. One knee on there. Other leg. Out and back. Because you're going to be pulling it towards your waist. As opposed to no. If you're pulling up here, then that's going to be more traps and run boys. Rats. Pulling. I'm traveling close to side like that. Into your waist. And back down again. So, up and back, getting the rats with this one. Easy. Right. Right. Two. Six. Six. Right. Six. Right. Six. Six. Six. Six. Six. Six. Six. Six. Six. Six. Six. Six. Six. Eight. Six. We're going to do a bike throws. We're going to do that like this. So we're going to go up there now. Run boys, traps. For the first few exercises, we're pulling in here. We're working on rats here. Working on rats. The elbows, arms. I'm traveling close to the body here. Pull down. Go. Those are latin movements. Now, elbows out. We're going up and back. Of course, the rats are still involved. We're pulling more emphasis on the upper back, which is. The lower traps, the rhombides, the terries, and so on. That's why they have a grip. We're bringing the elbows out. Nice. We're in there, yeah. Three. All good. Five. Six. Don't you reason to use them is if the power of my latin is greater than my grip. You know, it's my grip's going to give away before my back gives away. Then I'm going to support my grip, but if it's not necessary, I'm not going to use them. Because if you keep supporting your grip all the time, it's not going to get stronger, you know. All right. So, take a mic. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Three. Three. Three. Three. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. All right. Cool. It's good. Four of that. Six. Right back. Four. And again. Four. Come on. Four. One more. Four. Four. Four. Good. Good set. So we do it. Five. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. I just do it in the initial one from the floor. Then I'm just going here. So if you got racks, you can just do it from there to start with. Keep the head up. Give me a back flat. Yep. You never want to lift with your back rounded like that. You're putting it back in a very vulnerable position. I like to do it in front of the mirror. So I can watch the form. Oh, the initial lift from the floor is more quiet than the glutes. That's why after he's lifted it from the floor, I'm just going to midshend and kick. So we're just keeping it on the back. People are tensioning on the back. Good. Up. Two. Up. Three. Four. Excellent. Up. High. Up. Big. That. Maybe just a tad higher. You know. Better to ask them to go. I'll see them working more lace. These are new work here, legs and more ones. You get out of the bottom. Just like midshend, kick the nice and tight. Just keep it on the back. Alright. Hold on then. Here's the strap down here. Nice and tight. Just do as many as you can where the form is perfect. You know, if you start breaking the form, that's toned for it down. No risk on this one here. Alright, spin it still all up now. Then all the whole back. Yep. So strong. Good. Okay. No. Except seven. Two. Three. All is good. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Four. Six. And again. Four. Seven. Five. Eight. Two more. Stop. Four. Perfect. Perfect. Muscle growth is an adaptation to stretch. You give your body stretch that is not used to. It's going to try to adapt in some way. And in this case, we're looking for a more muscle. So you've got to go beyond what you've done before. That's the idea. You're certainly the reps that you really struggle on. It gives you the growth in it really. When you're training, you're not just stretching that muscle group. You're stretching your system as a whole also. And legs and back. So attacks in that. Try to schedule loads with a day off afterwards. So you've got overall recovery as well.
