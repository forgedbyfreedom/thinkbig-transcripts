A calorie deficit doesn't just mean eat less food. You know that, right? There's only two parts that go into making a calorie deficit. The calories coming in that you eat and drink each day. And the calorie is going out that you burn each day. But the problem is when most people think about creating a deficit. They only focus on the first part of that equation, which is to eat less food. Or by thinking that the only way to increase how many calories you burn is to spend more time exercising. But that's not necessarily true. This is your TDE or a breakdown of where you burn calories in a day. And to most people's surprise, exercise is usually the smallest part. With the majority of what you do burn, coming from places that aren't the gym. So yes, you could just work out more or starve yourself. But that's probably not the smartest way to do it. And it would make a lot more sense to focus just as much on the bigger pieces. To create that deficit. Like your non-exercise movement, the other 23 hours you're not in the gym. The calories you burn from digesting the food you eat. Like eating more protein, which burns 3 to 10 times more calories being digested than carbs or fats too. And other factors that play a role in boosting the biggest part. Your BMR, like building lean muscle mass, your sleep and stress. The point is a calorie deficit isn't just if you exercise more than you can eat. It's if you're in tired life burns more than you eat. And once you look at it that way, you don't have to eat nearly as little as you think you do to make progress.
