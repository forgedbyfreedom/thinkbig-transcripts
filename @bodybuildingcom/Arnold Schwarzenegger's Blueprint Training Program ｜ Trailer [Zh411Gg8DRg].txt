Not every legend is a myth. Some are flesh and blood. Some legends walk along us, but they don't belong, they're built. Legends are made from iron and sweat, mind and muscle, blood and vision and victory. Legends and champions, the grow, they win, they conquer, as the legend behind a lead legacy. There's a blueprint behind every legend. I'm on my choice, I will. This is my blueprint.
