Come on, man. Number nine. Obsession. It's not just a fucking word that I like to use. I don't care. What it is that you do. I don't care. What is it that you do? I don't care. I don't care. What is it that you do? I don't care. What is it that you do? That you do. If you want to be the absolute best day, I don't give a fuck at the St. Pancakes, Washington, Windows, cutting a fucking grass or taking out the goddamn trash. If you want to be the best daddy, mother fucker is nowhere around it, you must be obsessed with. Why see? Because I'm fucking sad, so that's why. Obsession is any's edible. Ask any fucking champion. You dream that shit. You sleep that shit. You eat that fucking shit. You breathe that fucking shit. Obsession is fucking dead. It's dead. You can taste it. Without obsession, your ass will never be great. It's impossible. Fucking obsession is an absolute must to greatness.
