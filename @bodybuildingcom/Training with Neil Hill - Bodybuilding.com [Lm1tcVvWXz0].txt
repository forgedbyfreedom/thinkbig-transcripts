Hi, I'm Neil Hill. I'm here with bodybuilding.com. I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm an ex professional bodybuilder, trainer and nutritionist, Gus Barri TV and also writer and communists for either publications. He had talked to you a little bit about training, nutrition. You know, the importance of supplementation, how to bring your body to the next level. I actually got involved with bodybuilding really just by chance when I was 19 years of age. It wasn't a sport that I inspired in a sense because where I live back in the UK it's in the middle of nowhere so bodybuilding never really existed. But I sort of met up with a guy one day, went to the gym, I'm a straight away, I got the bug. I consistently trained heavy because that was the way that I felt was the way forward to build muscle mass. But what I found is I consistently picked up injuries and it wasn't due to the fact that my form was incorrect or sloppy. It was just the fact that maybe my body from mechanics as an athlete were maybe not in the same way foundation is maybe a power lift or weight lift for for instance. So what I actually have to do is I had to reduce the weight that I was lifted and actually increase the rep range just to try and buffer the injury that I was carrying and maybe a shoulder injury that I picked up upon bench press for instance. And by getting away from the ego lifted and even though my form may look perfect to the eye what I wasn't doing is contracting and squeezing on each repetition. And by dropping the weight down that I was finding that those loads of stress that were going directly to the muscle that I was trying to hit. What I actually did then is I played around for a number of weeks and months, I started forward and what I felt was what was right for my body. I know a period of about 12 years now with my experiences of an amateur athlete, a professional athlete and the athletes that I've been helping over the last 16 years or so that I've come to formulate my history too. This is something that I've had to myself probably for the last seven years. I didn't bring it out to the open because obviously like any training, you're tristness, you want your athletes to be better than your competitors. As my database of clients became greater, I had to make sure I treated all my athletes as equal for instance. There's some athletes who will never be professional bodybuilders. They may never even actually win a state show but if you can actually help them to become beyond their genetic potential and you give them a protocol or a program or a dietary or supplement program which is going to enhance them and bring them to the next level. Obviously that's exactly as a training trick and is what you should be trying to do for instance but it doesn't just work for a bodybuilder. It can work for every person, every sort of man, lady involved with any sort of form of physical exercise. Now you know a little bit more about me, let's touch space with that training. The view of that Y3T is very much a three-dimensional workout. In my eyes it's the only three-dimensional workout which is out there and there's a lot of people trying to jump onto this because they do see it's the new revolution in training principles because they said in week one you go heavy. You'll just like you would be in hit basically the old Dory 8's methods. You the rep range would be anywhere between six or eight reps but even when you're doing those rep range it's important that you squeeze and contract the muscle. When you squeeze and contract the muscle those lows will go directly to the muscle and they'll get taken away from attachment points and bone compounds and the reason why that takes place is because even though it's a compound move and it's heavier week one for instance because your squeeze and contract and you will never be able to lift the same kind of weight if you didn't squeeze and contract within the same week for instance. So week one is compound week two is compound and isolation movements. As your rep range increases your number of work and sets has to decrease slightly as well. Otherwise you could go into an over-trained mode on week two and as you increase your rep range in week two you could say it becomes like a two-dimensional workout and then week three when you implement three week three where you're actually doing more rep range for instance that's when it becomes more three-dimensional. What I found is that it increases your heart rate increases the fact that your body is losing body fat, your cardiovascular system is recovering your body so much quicker because you're getting more oxygenated and ricks blood flow around your body and then week one you go back to compound again week two it increases week three it increases again and then you go back to week one again it's normally be a sort of a nine-week period so you do week one week two week three week one week two week three week one week two week three and then you take anywhere between five and seven days of training and find that more and more athletes have spent a more and more time in the gym as a professional athlete as an amateur athlete I only trained four days a week. I saw I did why did I train four days a week because my body needed to rest that needed to recover. You don't grow in the gym you grow out of the gym as a athlete or a bodybuilder people want to be three dimensional they want to be turned from in their quarter turns where you see very few weaknesses where their intricate tie-ins or muscle groups are attached better you get more flare in for instance and that's a beautiful about this type of workout it brings all those three things into play and what I find is my athletes they're excited about going into the gym is because they're not bored this challenging it's easier to get under a squat rack and if five or six plates if you're a strong bodybuilder but that bodybuilder jumps into that squat racks and let's buy six plates on squat rack for sort of six to eight repetitions with much prefer to do that then put three plates on the bar and try to do four to your 50 repetitions it's more challenging and if you think of the philosophies behind it all those loads and stresses are still going to go directly within that muscle and because the weight is greatly reduced risk of injury is greatly reduced even when you're used perfect for even when you're cautious in the gym you can pick up injury you know tender nights is a very very common injury with all athletes from you know from tennis to baseball to basketball for instance and sometimes those injuries are just there's no logical reasons why they actually take place for instance especially with weight training I think the most important thing is what I would say is definitely gets a good rehab you know sports massage in my eyes is a must you know I think people are seeing the real benefits of sport massage sports massage will really be able to help break down those information in those key areas the ligament and tendon attachments for instance try to be sensible when you're in a gym don't lift with ego lift with sensibility now you know a little bit more about the training follow the page below let's talk about nutrition nutrition is very much the key success for any athletes I was actually a high level international swimmer at the child I swam for my whole country which is Wales back in the UK from the age of eight right up to the age of the 60 I also played a high level sports including including rubby soccer and also I was a very high level surfable lever on not but what I what actually was never sort of implemented to me when I was actually doing these active sports and nutrition really was an important you know to eat one two small and nutritional meals was no different to maybe somebody who wasn't doing any form of physical exercise it wasn't an education which was forced upon us for instance so I started by magazines I did a little bit of reading look the pictures that these athletes were eating certain food princess and obviously that then in myself told me I have to change my eating habits around what these athletes were doing I believe just like my training you have to be three dimensional exactly the same to train in and nutrition you have to be three dimensional that means you want to try and get as many key ingredients vitamins minerals trace elements carbohydrate proteins healthy fats from a array of different forms of food for instance because if you consistently put every meal is chicken your body though it would digest it over a period time it's like your training it becomes bored it becomes stale your body doesn't break down those protein bindings and the same way it does when it when it's not used to that food for instance it endorses it draws more nutrients out of that food for instance the thing I do want to touch on the most this is what I feel is the most important reason why I see games with my athletes is because we eat in the night even while they're dieting they eat in the night I mean though this will actually speed up your metabolism and even when you're taking really good slow release proteins into your bloodstream before you go to bed I wake you up about three or four hours in the evening which you should anyway because obviously the most vital sort of part of your life is water and I would definitely advise anywhere any athletes a relevant what type of sport they do to get a good five liters of clean water in a day get another night time and need to them little night to me it increases your metabolism straight away it allows your body to sort of really capitalize on those nutrients and you know your body is producing growth hormone your body struck your recovery everybody knows your body doesn't grow recover in the same way in the gym even if you put the right supplements it grows out of the gym it grows at nighttime for instance so if you've got a bed at say 11 p.m. you get up about two three a.m. in the morning you can have a protein shake again make sure it's a time release protein shake you could take a small form of complex carbohydrate in maybe you know some oatmeal for instance mix it up eat it and then go back to bed I'm a big huge advocate on cheat meals even when my guys are dieting for shows they still get cheat meals that doesn't necessarily mean they get in bad food for instance like burgers or fries but they do get bonuses for instance because I need to make sure they get rewarded for their hard work on a weekly basis for instance and again as I said I keep basing on to be three-dimensional it's a three-dimensional lifestyle then you don't have to be this sort of athlete who doesn't think about anything other than eat sleep and training to me you eat meals you forget about training you're only think about training until you get to the gym try to be a normal human being get your life when you mind away from being an athlete and only think about it when you need to think about it now we've gone into nutrition click on the page below to go into my entire program now I'm going to talk to you about supplementation if you're about supplementation is that when you take it your body can newly absorb those things quite instantly because they've already been broken down from their key say ingredient for instance like if you were to look at the chicken breast it's high in protein, high in amino acids for instance but your body's got to break that source down and actually digest it and put it into the bloodstream it can be a little hard on your body it can take an hour and a half it can take two hours it can sometimes take long of certain types of food to be broken down and utilized by the body the beauty about supplementation is because they've already been broken down into key elements your body can absorb those things very very quick into your body you're maximizing everything like you're trying to achieve and now it's obviously maximum performance bringing your body to the next level for instance the supplementation as the benefits of getting into your digestive tract and causing you know very quick results very very quickly after training you've got an open window you've got about 45 to 60 minutes of a window which is open to you as an athlete capitalise on getting as many key elements in your body as quick as possible to put yourself into a very very antibiotic state and that will happen straight after training the reason being is because in a sense your body is going into a very negative position you know your mental state is negative your immune system state is negative your your muscle density is being greatly hit you know your amino acid you glue to him in those key areas are being damaged in a sense and the beauty about is to open window is your body can absorb more more nutrients in that one hour after training any other time of the day so I would advise a good 50 to 60 grams of fast act in way isolate protein or some kind you know another thing that I'm also a big advocate you're in is making sure you get a really good multi-bit minute because even though when you're reading balance you can see this consistency balance going on there the diet is three-dimensional for instance the right supplement do taste great they should taste great you know people want to see buy something which works but actually buy something which tastes nice far as any fears concerns is that when you use a brand and you look at studies which proves that these supplements work you've also got the guarantee that these supplements are actually healthy for instance there are some in crepe key ingredients in food which are in the supplement anyway so in a sense there's a certain amount of nutrients in food which are in key elements of supplementation and when there's supplements are taken in moderation at the right time for instance it is only going to be healthy for the athlete it was expected what type of sport they do you know what you're finding now nutrition peak performance it's gone way beyond where people thought that this would go within any industry for instance not just bodybuilding as I say we know we're hitting on track of field even the military you're pushing there you know they're so just to make sure that they're using supplementation to get the best performance out of them for instance you know it's it's so so so important it's vital to make sure that you do make make maximum games peak on that given day get the best of your work out so allow your body to work better grow it it combines everything together if I had to name my top top three then for instance and I would definitely say a good quality time release protein powder best definitely another one would be a good quality isolate protein powder and I would say the next thing would be definitely a really good recovery sort of into work out drink which is obviously sort of helping your body you know slow down the breakdown and muscle tissue slow down the fact that you be in anabolic in the gym and it's also slow you start to allow your body to recover either as well so that's what I would say my top three is but in ideal world you could probably throw 10 or 15 different other supplements in play but if you touch on to the fact that making sure that your reach in quality food different type of food sources you get they get lots of different vitamins minerals trace elements different compounds of protein carbohydrates so that will have an effect on tying everything in together. I get my full training nutrition and supplement program follow the link below click on the program I hope that you get a lot of educational material from this to bring you as an athlete irrespective of what type of sport you do to the next level you know you can do it and for more information like this click on bodybuilding.com
