Good evening Columbus 25 year anniversary. What do you think of that? This was my pro debut and it took me 10 years to get you to shake my hand. I did the stairs, I did the lunges, I did my cardio and I just let it happen. Fantastic. I just stay focused every day, every week. I do what I have to do and focus on my hand results which is my goal today.
