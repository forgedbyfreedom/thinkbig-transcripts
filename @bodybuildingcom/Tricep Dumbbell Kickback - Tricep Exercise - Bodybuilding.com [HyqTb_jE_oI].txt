Start with a dumbbell in your right hand facing your torso. Place your left knee and your left hand on a flat bench. Keep your back straight with a slight bend in the knee and bend forward at the hips. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor. Make sure you keep your head up. Your upper arm should be close to your torso and parallel to the floor. Your forearm should be pointed towards the floor as you hold the weights. Your upper arm should be a 90 degree angle formed between your upper arm and your forearm. This will be your starting position. Now while keeping your upper arm stationary, exhale and use your triceps to lift the weights until your arm is fully extended. Focus on moving the forearm. After a brief pause at the top contracted position, inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position.
