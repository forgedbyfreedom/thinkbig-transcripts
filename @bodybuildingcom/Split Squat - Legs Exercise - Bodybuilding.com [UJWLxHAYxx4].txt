Position yourself into a staggered stance with the rear foot elevated and the front foot forward. Hold a kettlebell or dumbbell in each hand letting them hang to the sides. This will be your starting position. Begin by descending, flexing your knee and hip to lower your body down. Maintain good posture throughout the movement. Keep the front knee in line with the foot as you perform this exercise. At the bottom of the movement drive through the heel to extend the knee and hip to return to the starting position.
