Set up in a power rack with a bar on the pins. The pin should be set to the desired point, just below the knees, just above or in mid-thigh position. Position yourself against the bar in proper deadlifting position. Your feet should be under your hips, your grip shoulder width, back arched, and hips back to engage the hamstrings. Since the weight is typically heavy, you may use a mixed grip or a hook grip or use straps to aid holding the weight. With your head looking forward, extend through the hips and knees, pulling the weight up and back until lock out. Be sure to pull your shoulders back as you complete the movement. Return the weight to the pins and repeat.
