Sit down at the pull down machine with a bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure you adjust the knee pad to fit snug against your legs. grip the bar with the palms of your hands facing forward. Both of your arms should be extended above you holding onto the bar. Lean your torso back slightly to create a small curvature in your back and stick your chest out. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and bring the bar down until it lightly touches your upper chest. As you pull the bar down, squeeze your shoulder blades back and down. Your upper torso should remain stationary during this movement and only your arms should move. After a brief pause at the bottom contracted position, exhale and slowly raise the bar back to the starting position with your arms fully extended and your lats stretched.
