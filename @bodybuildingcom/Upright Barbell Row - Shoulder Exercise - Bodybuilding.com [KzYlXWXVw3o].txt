Grab an easy crowbar or barbell with an overhand grip. Use a grip that's slightly less than shoulder width. The bar should be resting on top of your thighs with your arms extended and a slight bend in your elbows. Your back should also be straight. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and use the sides of your shoulders to lift the bar. Keep the bar close to your body as you raise it. Continue to lift the bar until it nearly touches your chin. Your elbow should drive the motion and should always be higher than your forearms. Remember to keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement. Now inhale and slowly lower the bar back down to the starting position.
