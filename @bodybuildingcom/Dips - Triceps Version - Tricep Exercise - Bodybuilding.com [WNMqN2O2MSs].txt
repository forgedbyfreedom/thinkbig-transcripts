To get in the starting position, hold your body at arms length with your arms nearly locked above the bars. Now inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there's a 90 degree angle form between the upper arm and forearm. The next inhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position.
