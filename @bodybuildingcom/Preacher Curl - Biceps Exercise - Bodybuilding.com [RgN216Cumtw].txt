Position yourself on a preacher bench and grab the easy bar from the front barrest. Grab the easy bar at the close inner handle with the palms of your hands facing forward. They should also be slightly tilted inward due to the shape of the bar. With your upper arms and chest positioned against the preacher bench pad, hold the easy bar at shoulder level. This will be your starting position. Now inhale and slowly lower the bar until your upper arms are extended and your biceps are fully stretched. Then exhale and use your biceps to curl the weight back up until your biceps are fully contracted at the starting position. Squeeze the biceps and hold for a brief moment at the top contracted position to get the maximum benefit from this exercise.
