We love that. We're not, you know, surprisingly it's a brief one, so thanks for keeping it short and sweet on you. Guys, today we're going to jump into no surprise learning a bit about our guests. We were talking about topic one building Anthony. So, start out by telling us how you got here. What's your background and health and fitness tells about the journey that brought you here today professionally, personally, and beyond. Yeah, so the fitness journey started kind of as a kid playing soccer competitively, started in my local hometown, and then moved into club ball, club ball, playing academy ball, and then from academy ball into college. And I think once I kind of saw the cusp of my college career coming to an end, I feel like all the athletes out there, you kind of know when you know. I was like, oh, what do I do post-grad? And that was the biggest thing that I was struggling with because I didn't know what that exit was going to be. And you know how it is if you're an athlete, you exit college and you're like, well, what else do I have to offer? So, move to the city, like every single fitness person I worked at Equinox, which I think everybody normally does way back in the day. And I started my career as a trainer, but then I would sell a class there called Abla. And I think it's now called like best abs ever, whatever it is. But I did that for like three months, and then I had a friend who worked at berries who was like, hey, you should come and work at berries. And I was like, I don't know anything about group fitness, but let me go try this. Fell in love with the culture of berries. I think what I loved about it there was it was super accepting and welcoming, but also right in my energy source of like fun engaging group fitness. So I departed Equinox and took on this challenge of berries, or this next step at berries per se. And then I think it was like four months later, rumble was opening. I met with somebody there and they were like, hey, we're opening this gym. You've got great energy and you boxed. Would you be interested in potentially coming onto the team? We're looking to add like two more trainers to kind of this like founding after the founding five this kind of like next wave of people. And I was like, yeah, sure. So that was madness. If you know the rumble OG days from like 2015, you got like just the Bieber coming in and Jason Derulo and David Beckham and young Anthony, I'm like, I'm from a small town in Jersey, so I'd post in my Facebook and people would lose it. They'd be like, I photo with David Beckham and his kid and people would be like, who are you? What are you doing? And I took a moment for those like, I would say that three-year gap there where I was meeting so many individuals because so many celebrities were coming through that door that I was like, this is craziness. And then I took a moment to reset because I kind of burned out from the group fitness space. I actually worked at WeWork at Brise by WeWork for a little while. I was working on more of their consulting of their group fitness opportunities they had there. So they had a bunch of different studios and I would kind of go in, teach, take and then kind of review and see like how can we build out these class models to be a little stronger so that the people upstairs were going to soul or berries or other studios. They could just kind of stay in the building and use that rise by WeWork space. And then I met a great guy named there, Kurt Ellis, Kurt Ellis shout out, if you guys don't Kurt Ellis, he's a rock star and he was at performance house and he was like, hey man, I think you would do great here, you have a good following, you have a lot of clients, you might want to explore looking to go into that space. So I met with Eric and Matt and Devon back in that day, popped in there and then of course I feel like it just happens in these stages like the next year like, it came around and they were like, hey, you have all this experience we're building a gym and then pandemic hit. I feel like I'm going a little bit of a tangent of a pandemic hit and then from there I kind of built out my connections and that's where I was able to work with other brands like Aqua bag, got him with light sport and then got him with Aqua Fit Club and because I had this background experience that kind of led me to a place where I could consult and then invest and then grow with those brands. I feel like every story starts at Equinox within this city specifically and I've been there, you've been there multiple of our guests have been there, that's that seems like the starting line of the New York City fitness scene and it's cool to see. You've essentially been a part of every major, let's call it boutique, you know, fitness, class, gym, franchise, etc. in New York City. Do you think that there was a synergy between all of them and what kept drawing you from one to the other that you, you know, were really excited about being a part of? Yeah, community. I think I would walk in and take class and see how connected people were from the start and I'm an empath so I was like, oh, I resonate with these people right away. I think what always struck me as a kid, I kind of noticed it's too before the podcast that, you know, I was one of the first people in my family to graduate college. So I come from a very like empath, we're all family, we want to grind, we want to grow but I also come from a place of wanting to learn and I think that's what kind of got me from Studio Studio Studio was like there was a new spark, there was this new kind of creative twist on fitness that I was like, oh, I can learn something new from each of these different studios and that's where I kind of got to where I was exploring these, you know, Studio Studio. Yeah, I mean, you mentioned a blue collar background as well and just kind of being able to get your hands dirty and the want of getting your hands dirty, if it's a founding trainer, that's not, that sounds glamorous but that's typically difficult no matter what brand your founding trainer is nice and theory but usually means you're creating something from the ground up so do you think there's correlation to your personal background and to the willingness to have that in your professional life? Yeah, I think even at light sport, I give them like the biggest credit, I've been with them for about four years and I'm like a cowboy there and that's what I love about being a founding trainer or being a part of those like starting from the ground is that you have this energy to win because you have this underdog mentality the whole time and I think the synergies there because every single time I walked into a space outside of berries, I had that kind of like I got to prove myself, I got to prove myself and that's a little spark that lets that like small impact have intentions behind it. I love that. What's been the why behind movement becoming the epicenter of your life and now career? Well I think I found a lot of clarity through movement, I think like we know it before with soccer and stuff and when that came to a close, I kind of lived in that like I don't know what to do next. I think I come from a home that is a little more, I would say, stoic from time to time with emotions and feelings and so forth so I think movement was that ability to find release so I think that's why I became my why because I'd be able to vocalize about it and then I would see somebody in class do it and I'd be like oh you're putting in the same effort in this class into your relationships and your friendships and your family and I was like this is the science is that like if you put the same effort that you're putting into punching a bag into your relationships you're going to find progress. That's great you know I feel like you've now you've now been the athlete you've helped people become more athletic in multiple modalities across New York City and beyond especially with the digital explosion that occurred during 2020 and beyond you're able to reach so many more people during that time. How did you instill an inject community during that timeframe specifically? I feel like we all and I was in the health and wellness event business during that time as well. It kind of turned us all on our heads a little bit and made us think differently so how did you how did you deem yourself as successful in terms of building community through a screen and through a through a digital platform? I this story is kind of crazy so I will try and keep it as short as I can but it was while the day that the world shut down the next day I went on Instagram live and there was like 10,000 people on an IG live workout and I was like I've never seen numbers like this. Yeah it's usually like 82 on a good day 50 on a good day. This is like pre IG live being anything. So everybody was home and I did this like hour long workout on Instagram and everybody was like oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god I do this from all that day I hit up seven people who taught different modalities I was like here is my Instagram login and they taught different classes that were 30 minutes each so there was a dance class a Pilates class a yoga class a strength class a boxing class everything and I ran there for three months and that's what grew my social out was I just gave people options all in one place and then from there we kind of were like do we want to do this on a platform and so forth but then also at that point it was like music copyrighting was like they were getting strict on that things were gently starting to open so you could do distance based workouts with masks on and stuff so I wrote that first wave hard of like the first three months during the lockdown I was running probably eight classes a day on IG live that moved to zoom and then from zoom to in person and then obviously with light box or light sport I started moving into that space where they had hardware and that was where the audience could go to as well but that space was I mean you probably know that she would like go on Instagram there was like 20 people doing an Instagram live it was wild yeah no it was a wild time for sure and I feel like we're now we've talked about this in the podcast before as well with previous guests or now entering this era where it's awesome to see that stone that was flipped over during the time period and help people connect and move their bodies and get healthier through the digital format and that exists today at the same time we're now in this aggressive other side of the spectrum where people want to connect in real life again and this has been a huge part of our dialogue it's part of our strategy going to 2025 as a brand as well getting people together in real life how are you how are you doing that in your career and bringing people together how are you doing in the brands that you work with Tesla a bit about that so more than miles has been the easiest part of it so I started this race collective is what I like to call because we we don't want to be just another track club or another run club we say that we're race collective so what we do is we have these unsingcion races like go on throughout the year and we use the funds that we raise from that to allow people who can't afford the ability to race the ability to race people show up just for that because I just want to support somebody who might need it we have a race tonight funny enough but through these races people have kind of been flooding out because they want to meet people they want to connect with people it's not necessarily like you have the son of for a 5k a 10k or a marathon we have races that are run the hill right so you run directly up a hill and then we grab a beer or not alcohol beer after whatever people prefer and that amount of social link I think is great for people community runs that are not super heavy at a super fast pace we allow walkers and runners who come out and then group fitness classes like I've been back in that space I think what the digital space has done in a great way is provided options right Mike our client at light sport is jack in the back with three kids right works a long day he's about to go out the door to go get his work out in and then he's got a cook dinner or he's got to help his partner out or whatever it might be so can they pick up and do something at home that gives him some kind of accountability data and so forth that they have that option you are now transforming gym franchises into studios I feel like I could be seen as a level up I'm sure it's seen as a level but it's also a whole another layer of work added to the whole different yeah so tell us more about that how it started what feels the success and more about the spatey book spaces that you're building yeah so gym rescue started with my business partner Aaron in Montreal with rebel union Aaron and Lessa they are the absolute best humans I know and I met Aaron through aquabag so when the world kind of shut down aquabag was planning on going into this digital space so what I would do is people be like I want to box at home and I would be like cool I'm going to essentially part of with aquabag you can buy an aquabag with a sensor in it and you can track your punches it was just really cool format that we built with them the technology never kind of took off to the masses but I did meet Aaron through that and what I started doing with Aaron on a small scale was consult he'd be like hey man I have no music I need music to like when he comes to New York he's like this is the greatest fitness experience I get to have and then he goes to Montreal and he's like it's almost there but I need something help wise so I consulted for a while and then I was like why don't why don't we just partner up on this like why don't I come in and start doing fractional work and see if I can use my knowledge of musicality in the room to training trainers but then also like how do we retain members on different membership packages the big thing they were doing in Montreal was they had packs they were selling five packs and ten packs can we bundle a membership that gives people enough that they feel like they're getting a true value so I started with rebel union and we've been now working together for almost two and a half years and that's been great they have been skyrocketing in Montreal they've added a string studio there've been talks about expanding from there into another brick and mortar and then I kind of crossed out of that into consulting for different franchises that were opening up through something like an exponential right so somebody would be like hey you worked at that gym back in the day we have one in the suburbs can you come in and Anthony Phi the trainers or can you come in and just give us perspective on what is a client success journey from the first 30 days to 90 days and how are you tracking their progress how many classes are they taking per week how are you following up how are you hitting their touch points and then with alpha that was me coming in as a franchise owner and that's when I learned build out costs L.O.I.s I learned H.V.X which are a beast inside of itself but I learned all the nitty gritty side that I didn't get from before which is front facing right it's talent it's music it's membership now I'm doing the other side where it's like build out labor costs overhead P&L all that kind of stuff so I'm grateful that I had the opportunity I'll say in the last year to really get a full perspective because next year that's going to be a little more of the pushes really leaning into that space of hey if your gym is going to a tough time let's create a roadmap for it it's not me coming in and like John taffering it it could be but I think more the goal is a lot of people have the dream and the vision they're just too busy and what I can do is kind of offload those hours and concentrate them so you can find success so essentially partnering with the owners the managers the team that exists there not only on customer engagement though it seems like that's our member engagement rather seems like that's the course in which it started to fall on reimagining what the space can look like feel like right because I think we're entering we've already been in this era for the last couple years as people have returned to gyms and whatnot they are looking for a very uniquely different type of experience as of in comparison to what we saw years prior so the classic big box gyms they're dying in a way right and we are seeing the rise of boutique fitness and one off locations that maybe have the potential to franchise but maybe also that's not their goal yes I'll speak to I'll speak I'll give a shout out to a never in Long Island city which is our home home great fantastic there are home gym where we're shooting with our founding trainers right now and it was just there was thought and love put into the build out of that gym and the way they continue to run that is the community first mindset so I think the big players in the games I won't call anybody out on the podcast but the big players are starting to realize you know what they are missing and comparative to some of these one off gyms and you know this too once you sell to the masses right you sell your company then they can franchise it out loses the value right and I mean that respectfully but it loses the value because not saying the name of it but like ten years ago right it was a crime telecrime and then when they sell and then there's hundreds of them they lose that little spark of what they had and then I think what happens more less is you've got these privately own gyms that are franchising out but they're still private so they still hold the core values and they still kind of maintain this brand presence throughout so there's never that like things slip through the cracks I think what they're doing in Long Island city that's really great is that you could tell they put a lot of TLC into it but every single time I go on their page and they're doing events everybody's engaged from the wellness side of it to the strength side of it to the conditioning side of it that gym is packed in a great way yeah I totally agree I hope we continue to see more of it yeah I think that's really where the masses are starting to to flock to yeah let's talk about modality flexibility so you yourself going into topic topic too Anthony you yourself have have explored and continue to explore a variety of modalities so boxing running soccer consistent string training throughout all of those how do you feel you benefit from a classic cross-training regimen and versus going all in on one specific movement well it's a funny question because right now I'm doing it right like I'm in for everybody watching I just ran the Berlin marathon I run New York City in three weeks and then I do hierarchy Kaggle right after that so you think about it though it's like very different it's similar but it's different training I'm struggling right now because I'm running so much that my strength I feel like it's taking a back seat even though I'm prioritizing unilateral work it's still at that point where I'm like oh I don't know if I'm going to be strong enough for this hierarchy competition that's come up I know conditioning wise I'll fly but strength wise you got to push that's let you got to have that posterior chain to pull that weight as well I think cross-training has been super beneficial I came from when I was in that boxing lane that's all I was doing I was boxing four five days a week and I think there's pros and cons of it right when you're in it so dialed in you fall in love with the sport because it's all you know and that's all you're doing but at the same time I go to lift the weight in class and but that doesn't move the same way as it used to I think we talked about marathon training as well right I started my marathon training probably like 15 weeks ago for Berlin is when my first my first wave went out and I've lost 18 pounds in 15 weeks and I'm eating everything in sight so I think cross-training is super beneficial I think where I'm finding the hardship right now is you want to pour everything into this one modality because you want to find success in it and it's really about being smart with how you attack that because if you're not you're going to put so much load on your joints and then in return you're going to do more harm the good yeah and that really is the fast follow question here how can something like a well-rounded routine really lower the risk of injury that we say it's so often here there is no such thing as 100% injury prevention but we can certainly lower the risk of obtaining those injuries so you know how do you say you know when you're training for your marathon you're training for a high-rexor whatever event that you have on the schedule because we we do preach here it's important to have something on that schedule to work towards but how do you work towards that while keeping cross-training in mind and you know keeping your pre-hab routine alive stretch sleep recover I like I use that simple but that's it it isn't it isn't I mean I'm I'm the prime example right I work a nine to five and then I screwed out to all the different gyms that I have to fill in the gaps so I have a nine to five and then a five to nine what I found really successful was I do these 15 minute routines in the morning where it's going on my foam roller just gently get my you know body moving I'll do a little bit of trigger point stuff with a lacrosse ball and then I just actively stretch your out the day until night I will tell you this my body has never felt better since I started stretching and prioritizing stretching so I think leaning into as you're going through these moments of how do you improve your body how do you feel strong how do you continue to grow if you prioritize the recovery side as well that the possibilities are endless because you know this as well I used to be 22 years old Anthony in the city I was trying to be in the thousand pound club I looked like this I looked crazy and I think at 33 years old I am now I feel like I'm the best shape model I agree I'm with you I think there's a maturity that comes into play when it just starts to click mentally and you start to just take a step back to understand what makes you feel your best like right today ups and salt that's a really helpful for me they just draw out toxins they help my muscles feel really good sauna is huge for me and sauna on coal plunge I know it sounds cliche but these small things on a consistent basis add up stretching the same thing like throw tiana night I sent on my floor with my cat and my dog and we're catching up and playing fetch but in the middle I'm doing just like some yin yin yin yin type of flows and just like holding them for two three minutes just stretching out the fascia that really hasn't gotten that love so all these things are just a kind of a culmination of definitely learning lessons let's say over the last 10 or so years you know I've had the the fractures I've had the overuse injuries we all have so I think with with each of those you know hopefully you don't have to go through an injury to learn the lesson and you can kind of just understand that your body needs rest your body needs physical care you know sometimes you need a hands-on body massage just to get into some of those places and then sleep is huge how do you balance sleep with such a crazy schedule and having your hands and so many things you schedule it right like my my whole day is Google meetings like I schedule my lunch breaks everything inside of that so I think I hyper prioritized sleep because if I didn't I wouldn't know what to do my also thing is like you know there's like I work in talent development but I also do a lot of production stuff so sometimes I'm editing late at night and I know that I have to log off at a certain time because if I don't that can go into the wee hours of the night to circle back really quick though with recovery I think one thing to note is the accessibility to recovery that's something that's not talked about a lot I ran with a lot of people in Berlin and a lot I talked about my journey they were like I saw you going to get dry needleing and and massaging and stuff like that like that looks super expensive and I had to take a moment to be like yeah like that is an investment inside of itself so I think what I would love to see more of is either educating people on making recovery accessible or finding alternate options right like if you can't afford a place I'm making this up but like the cold punch lounge or the sauna lounge how do you find that at home you talk about absence of that so right so like giving people alternatives I think is something huge hopefully can happen down the line it's like making recovery accessible for all I totally agree something that we're actually debuting in our new fitness app that's coming out later this year or slash early next year we'll have a whole accessories tab whole accessories library or snacks as we call them and they'll essentially be pre pre or post accessories that you can do just for that purpose I mean some of our coaches are going to be walking you through foam roller just for your thoracic spine or upper body taking you through foam roller lower body sessions taking you through you know a tech neck you know series where if you were on your computer all day what is something that I can do you know to loosen up my cervical spine to get my shoulders out of that rounded position to loosen up those those wrists so that we don't have carpal tunnel at 30 something years old but we we purposely and strategically injected this into the app with a specific emphasis on people just taking the 10 to 15 minutes even if it's not both by the way these don't have to be before or after you work out this could be at two clock in the afternoon when you come an hour in between calls or you're on the go etc you just drove for a while whatever the case may be but just holding people accountable and helping show how truly seamless it can be by just taking 10 minutes I'm giving your body some love yeah I think I it's funny you talked about the word snacks I gotta give him a small shout out if I can I think with Joe Holder did with exercise snacks and what he did just in the community of allowing people to get information at an accessible point or provide assets and these like you know kitchens and stuff that he does and these like shops that he puts up with the I think it's like the vegan kitchen or vegan whatever he does he does this incredible thing where he pops up into different pantries and essentially puts you know fresh food for people who might not be able to afford it and that's what I talk about accessibility in this industry a lot is I think I didn't even realize it until I started running outside of this country of like wow a lot of these things that we are doing are not accessible to a lot of people so I'm excited to hear that you guys are doing that because you're going to provide a lot of information and and give people a lot of accessories that they can use to you know improve their performance yeah absolutely and we're excited to have you involved in the future as well going to the 2025 and I couldn't agree more I'm we're not going to go down the health care conversation here because we only have a limited time this studio here ladies and gentlemen but fitness should be accessible just just plain plain flat fitness should be accessible we're on a mission to do just that you know you you don't need a $300 gym membership every month to just gain the basic necessities of how to take care of your body and how to live a longer and healthier life 100% I want to talk about more than miles this feels I feel like this is your baby right now I feel like so so I it was definitely deemed worthy of having its own topic today so you are the founder of more than miles breakdown how the idea came to fruition what the mission behind it is just give us some context of what this is yeah so my co-founder Alfonso Spoli we met in October of last year he works for on he's an incredible human he was going through a really tough spot in his life I was going through a really tough spot in my life and he funny enough for a while could not run because he was going through a medical condition that was limiting him movement wise of what he could do so he was doing with all this pent up energy through a really rough time I was kind of working in a parallel at the same time of not being able to do something and we when we were able to be cleared to run we went on our first run and we excelled and we said wow that felt good we got everything we need to get off our chest and we did that by just going on a jog and having conversation and kind of like naturally venting and then our other two co-founders Mike Riley and Muhammad Bader came with us on this run and we kind of all started clicking and we all come from different backgrounds right very diverse founding group but I think the conversations that just started happening from it I was like oh there's something here and we started just running and it wasn't for time it was just like hey let's just like run and have a conversation so I would for people then 10 then 15 then 20 and 30 and 40 and now sometimes 50 60 people but what we do is every corner mile on our community runs you switch where you are on the run so you have to meet somebody do and have a conversation with somebody who you might know or not know and it kind of forces you in a great way to being a place where it's not that deep but just be able to find clarity through movement and it's been this really great thing because like we talked about before it's like we are the no time run club or the new time movement collective like we could care less about time we care that people are not sitting at home and they're moving their body like the demographic for anybody out there who might be listening to this is like if you're a couch to 5k person or you've run 10 marathons it doesn't matter there's a place for you at more than miles because we just want people to be people through movement I feel like we need t-shirts that say no time run club no time run club I want to be the first one I get satisher that's good so you now hold the vents regular events for this where you hold in them how many people are coming to them how did this grow over time on a run we like I blocked out I literally was like I had no idea how to happen we in Hoboken we ran on one of our community runs we passed the hill at Stevens College and I was like huh imagine we sprinted up this hill today so we did got to the top and I was like hoof I'm exhausted and I'll fawns is like okay do it again and I was like all right so we started doing it we're like there's something here and then our friend Mike if you ever see Mike right like he's like this tall very buff man who's like Nick bear 2.0 shout out Mike he ran it and he was like oh I got to get somebody we got to compete and I was like okay so we started doing this with our internal group which was just more of our community and then kids from Stevens College would like hop the fence and be like hey man can I run and we're like yeah sure and then it's sort of becoming this thing where people would show up and then from there brands wanted to get involved and we really I say this all the time more than the miles we are not like a brand focused run club we do these events and like if you want to pop up and have some cool stuff they're great like at the end of the day the whole mission is always anything that comes in we kind of put into the small fun to be able to allow people who can't afford to run the ability to run so the race is kind of took off this year because run the hill did well and then me as a creative I was like great I want to do this mid-day mile where it's like your fastest mile in Hoboken this will come out on October 27th but we're doing a race called Pintapin which I think will be the most unique race we do it's 20 people five teams of four each person is driven to an undisclosed location they're given an envelope that has a pin and they have to run two miles so their teammate everybody is running to different pins and they all finish at the same pin so it's just really cool kind of like capture the flag obstacle course kind of set up but that's where we started thinking differently outside the box of like we are this like unsanctioned movement collective and that's where the race came from yeah gave me a fun game of finding I mean it's like school yard recess again right exact that I'm I'm having the time my life seen some of these newer run clubs pop up but you know you guys and many others bendest run club comes to mind they're doing gosh I don't even know how many they I think they had four clubs to like 400 500 people should open and given nine the need of police escort the the important thing here this is not just runners these are people who have never run a mile in their life this is bodybuilders you know quote unquote bodybuilders are people maybe who just spend most their time on hypertrophy lifts these are people from all different walks of fitness in life who are just so desperately seeking the connection in the community and these run clubs are making it one accessible to your point but two fun yeah like you game though you just give the perfect example of how you're game of finding making this something enjoyable versus just okay we're gonna go out every Tuesday night and run the west side highway and do the same out and back every single time whereas I feel like our on clubs are evolving so quickly at that point where even that type of style is already it's in the past it's not yet well I think you got three sectors in it right you got your track clubs which are really dialed in runners like I first seen comes a mind is like Manhattan track club Brooklyn track club whip it's all those like premier run clubs I would say track clubs and you got run clubs who are more of kind of like the social hey we got a couple friends together and we're gonna build this out and it's gonna kind of just be like out and back and we run marathons but it's kind of like whenever we feel like it varied that middle ground and they have training cycles we're okay this New York City marathon crew we're gonna meet et cetera so they're kind of working towards these goals but a little less serious than the first group and then I would say you have this kind of separate sector that we're nowhere near OSR but I always shot them out I think OSR 100% and Darcy from take the bridge like those people paved the way for what we do I think there's this other sector though of people who are community for us I'm gonna give a quick guy shout out named Dar Sean from Chill Town in Jersey City I think what he's done so well over the last five years is his motto is why can't we all get along I know it sounds so cliche but in this running community it can sometimes get really either time heavy or like you ran here last week and now you're running there like that's the last thing we want but that's why I think our demographic is different our demographic is could be the bodybuilder could be the first that first time ever running our mile midnight mile quick little example fastest time was at 4449 and then we had people who were running over a time in a mile and everyone stayed to support and that person around the 4449 runs in a track club in the city he could have left but he stayed and supported and sheared people on and I think that was the moment where I was like oh this is something different this isn't just like when your money and get out it's people are coming together yeah it's non-alietice and I think there's a time in a place for the elitist that's fine because there is a demographic for that and it's the no BS people who just want to get in crush miles get out right there's this there's one particular that comes into mind I see them out where I run almost every weekend and they are just they got the sunglasses on the hats are real low and they are charging forward and they don't care if there's a stroller in their way that's it right and then there's you know the ones out there similar to what you guys are doing more than miles and like the pace is easy the conversation is light they're laughing they're dealing they're having fun so I think it's a really cool time for running I think it's exploding I don't think running is as exclusive as it used to be I think it's much more accessible and I think you're seeing a very diverse group of people participating and run clubs across the country yeah I think you can note this too I think the creative space in running is also exploded where stories are getting told that weren't and I think now you're finding another shout out we run up town like Hector you're watching this massive shout out he's built community over like 10 years in the heights and like those stories are getting told and those people are getting their flowers with which they very well deserve circa 92 those guys over there like miles miles miles miles in the Bronx boogie down Bronx like those run authentic run communities that weren't highlighted because they didn't have X accessibility are now getting highlighted by these major brands and it's refreshing because now you're seeing all different types of people at the forefront of these campaigns you know I agree and you know obviously Nike has been doing this since the 80s and 90s probably earlier but I'm gonna recount what I remember as a kid too I mean sitting there watching YouTube video it's just getting goosebumps and chills because of how compelling their copyrighting was on the commercials that they made but now they're along with many others both being in small the brands are putting story telling at the front of their strategy I think tracks met those are really great job not only gorgeous imagery and photography and content altogether but injecting those stories if I think more locally I think band it does a really great job right like so all of this to say we're gonna stop geeking out for a second on run clubs to say running's having a moment it's not just for quote unquote runners and I think it's here to stay I think it's good to continue growing yeah who is your dream guest for more than miles this is this is like the question if you could choose a dinner party dead or live who do you have this is your version personalized for you yeah I got to go with Ned Brockman we talked about him before the pod I recently stumbled across him and I'm shining him out because Renethous Miles ran raise 2.6 million dollars for charity I think what I fall in love with more than anything with people through these more than Miles docs that we do is their why like why do you do this why do you take these feats of strength per se to do it and there's nothing for them in the reward it's not like they're winning first place they're doing it at the kindness of their heart so Ned sticks out I think I'll go back like I think Hector from we run uptown is another person I'll give to really quick but I think Hector does something with community that is undescribable and I think what he's done for so long is he's just been a great listener for people and from that he's built so much trust and I think those stories and somebody like Hector I would love to run with Hector if you're watching this I'd love to run with you and be able to share his story a little more awesome stay tuned in
