Two more. And rest, make sure you get a nice soft landing when you're doing these jumpsquats. Take a breath. You got two more rounds. Do you want to grab some dumbbells? We're doing front squats next. Ooh. I need a breather. Let's get those legs primed. They're going to come into that squat position again. Explode off, land nice and soft. Do you turn with me? You got this. Last one. And rest, awesome job. We got one more round. Okay, guys. Get your breath. Grab some water. Don't rest too long. Really trying to get our legs to be explosive. Get that power. All right. Let's go back in. Ten more. This is your last set. Make a count. Last one. And rest. Awesome job. Okay. We're going to go toward dumbbell, front squat. Grab some light or moderate dumbbells. Catch some water. Breathe a little bit. Me and me back here. Whoa. All right, team. This is your dumbbell, front squat. So you're going to bring the dumbbells up to your shoulders. Try to keep that core nice and engaged. You're going to squat back. We have eight reps here. Quot. Control that back up. Exhale as you stand. Two. Half way. Two more. Last one. And rest. I love this movement. Especially in that rack where that front squat position. Because it's going to pull the weight forward. You have to use more of your core to stabilize. And it's a great way to fire up your quads. And so when you do that front squat, you gain a little bit more abdominal work. With this movement, we got two more rounds of eight. That felt way too easy. Grab a little bit heavier. Grab some water. How off? Take a little longer if you need to. All right. Bring it up. Front rack position. Nice to be breath on the top. Exhale. Half way. Two more. Last one. All right. Be mindful when you're doing this movement that your knees aren't following in. You're really driving your legs through that floor. Keeping your core engaged. Or so in a more upright position. All right. We got one more round. You can rest a little bit. Take it out. Meet me when you're ready. You got eight here, okay? Down bell is up. Rack. Inhale. Engage. Half way. Two more. Last one. Awesome work. That was your three rounds.
