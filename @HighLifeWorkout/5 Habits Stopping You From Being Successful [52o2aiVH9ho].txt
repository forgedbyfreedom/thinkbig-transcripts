In this video, I want to break down the five habits that I stop in you from getting money. I'm well suited to teach you this because over the last few years I built several multi-eight figure businesses and I've coached literally thousands, thousands of entrepreneurs. Many of them went on to build seven figure businesses here are the things that I've seen stop in people from actually the accomplices and how you can prevent meeting the similar fate. If you do this it will swoow out the path that you take on your role to richest. Not saying it's going to be easy but it will be easy for you to avoid a lot of pitfalls. If you fail to follow these rules that I'm going to lay down, you're going to set yourself up for a great deal of misfortune, you're probably going to end up pouring alone and if you're not alone, you're going to be whatever woman or female human like creature who will accept your broken ass. In my experience the highest quality women don't like dealing with broke boys poor boys or men who are staggering around the poverty line if they don't have to. While me and the homies kick you with our high quality women you're going to have to deal with the leftovers. The creatures that I left over who crawl through the night should 50% of marriages in the divorces you have a 50% chance of this creature the voice and you taking your half your money and your children from you. I don't want you to end up in that bait so follow these motherfucking rules. The first habit is stopping you from getting to the money it's a waste and time. I am astonished by how much time the average person weighs and because you waste time you waste your potential. The average person is walking around so much potential this untat and it will remain untat because they're not using your most valuable resource with this time. You'll learn to master it and use it to your advantage. In every week there are 160 hours. Everybody's got the same 168 hours but a lot of you guys aren't using them effectively because you're squandering a lot of your time with bullshit as opposed to deploying that time against your goals. The majority of time is filled up with vices, arguing, smoking, drinking, chasing hells just all the vices. So the first thing you need to do to get more time is to eliminate the vices. It took an eliminate the vices. You're going to have way more time to deploy against your goals because a lot of people would be like oh I don't want to work hard because I still got a spintile with my family or I still got enjoy life right but these vices are not helping you enjoy life they're limiting your potential and you will never ever reach your full potential at these vices are monopolizing your time. So the first thing we have to do is eliminate the vices because you have more time and you have less distraction right you have more energy and more mental bandwidth because you have these vices taken up your time. Make a list of all the vices that you engage in that are preventing you from accomplishing your goals and it's very important you have to eliminate them right it's not all through sometimes I do it every once in a while no that's bitch shit you got a draw line in the sand when I stop drinking I'd say hey not drinking them more 10 years ago when I stopped smoking weed I said hey man get shit is slowing me down stopping me from reaching my potential and I just stop 100% not sometimes without a special occasions not on fucking for 20 or Bob Marley's birthday or when there's a school be do marathon or whatever you guys decide you want to smoke weed I just quit 100% and the reason quitting is better than doing it sometimes is because when you engage in this thing sometimes it increases the cravings because now you tease yourself with this shit and now you want it more it's not like you treat yourself sometimes or you everything in moderation doesn't know what happens is you actually give up right and you have to start over you were doing great you were on the path and then you got off the path now you got to get back on and it becomes more difficult but when you quit it's like after a certain amount of time the cravings go away right how do you stop drinking you just stop it's going to be difficult at first and then you get used to it and the cravings go away same thing with smoking weed same thing with any other biases that you're trying to have staying from right I don't do any recreational drugs then it'll bullshit if I do it once I'm a had that craving again and also it depletes it dopamine so you need dopamine in order to attack your goals right dopamine gives you energy but it is is when people say this a dopamine spike that's not really accurate way to assess it really is you have an available pool of dopamine thing by this is like your dopamine trough for some shit right so you got all this dopamine and then you use your dopamine on devices devices to bleach your dopamine but what happens is after you engage when these devices you end up with less dopamine than you had before and that's why after an all night rager for whatever the kids are calling it right it's more difficult the next day to do something boring like if you were out smoking weed getting drunk fucking random people all night you're going to wake up tomorrow and do accounting for your business right you're not going to have as much dopamine to do it right it it dopamine fuels ambition but you have less of it because devices cause those dopamine spike and then you left below baseline dopamine will replace with rest and time however what happens is people keep engaging in these devices cause they're addictive right and they never get their dopamine levels to go back to baseline and this is where people end up lacking motivation this is why vices are so sinister they waste your time and then they rob you of your motivation right i have a whole video I wanted to check out about dopamine but it's very important you got to manage it dopamine levels and you can't be spiking them especially with with unnatural vices like drugs and alcohol so first thing you're going to do is a quick your vices it does 100% to stop doing them and this is delayed gratification if you wanted to do this shit like way later in life after your rich and successful and it comps your goals hate us like and if you do it you can get a better version of it for example if i wanted to slow weed now i can get the best weed available own earth cause i'm rich and i got the next is i can get the best weed that said it has shit with sticks and seeds the jaws smoking but one of the good drug i drink and palm a sign or some fucking cheap alcohol i can go get the best shit you know it's somewhere where i don't drink right a better example was you know when i was first really on my grind to make my first million i stopped watching like basketball i watched the sports and i love basketball the football you knew that cause i was black and i stopped watching it and he is a concentrant i needed to vote that time towards my goals now i go to basketball game i go to games and when i go i think work side my boy he's got season tickets at a sweet so we put up to the sweet can have a better version of it was your successful if you've been delayed gratification you have a better version of if one of your vices is women do you think you can get better women once you accomplish your goals you can't even get it around the fucking hottest women in the world if you broke yeah you can fuck a new jersey 7 if you broke but you want to be out of fucking Miami 9 the 10s you ain't even got access to these holes unless you got a certain kind of status unless you accomplish something what you make it you can fuck better bitches if you've been delayed gratification but you waste in your time and you're dopamine on six is man does another part of wasting time is you actually have to use your time more effectively now remember people say i don't want to turn but there's a hundred and sixty eight hours and every week probably not using it time more effectively so you got to plan every hour of your date in your calendar let me show you what my calendar it looks like because i got some really aggressive goals here's my calendar every hour of every day is accounted for i got my wake up time when i'm a dude soon as i wake up all my workout but when i'm a dude every hour it ain't like look at today that right now picked a result podcast i'm right here but there was only like a little bit of white space in the calendar now live out my calendar and this white space here is gonna get filled up tomorrow morning when i plan my date third of days already book third of the friday seven days already book now imagine if you live like this how much further you can get if you use your time more effectively dry i have whole videos on how to use your calendar more effectively but this is a cheat code in life this is how i became successful if you take one thing for me it's planned out every hour of every day in your calendar and use that hour and deploy it against your goals use that time to change victory this how you start laughing motherfuckers you do this shit for a year i promise you with motherfuckers with look at things like you a different person and you can plan everything it doesn't have to just be work the beauty of the calendars and can choreograph your whole life so i got time with my girlfriend and you're got time with my son and you're i got time with my friends i got sleep time i got anytime i got my workout everything this important is in the calendar some people think it's weird to plan time with your family or to plan time with your friends or to plan time with your girlfriend it's uncommon and maybe it is a little strange but it is for me i think the number of it's in my calendar because it's important this shit does not in my calendar is not important call a duty mobile it's not in my calendar you're saying smash bros not in my calendar right because it's not what important the important shit should be in your calendar and the beauty of it using your calendars you can choreograph your life maybe you don't want to work as much as me even if you just want it more time with your family starting to use your calendar plan out every hour every day you'll find more time to spend with these muffins i can look at your calendar and i can tell you future and most of your shit is blank and that's why you ain't never gonna be successful and it's not weird what you get to different levels once you get to high levels like my millionaire friends when we want to do some of the gather one of us is going to send the calendar in bite almost all the time it seems normal to you because you and all your friends are poor boys you ain't out getting yai millionaires but at the high levels this is what it looks like my boy Jeremy he makes like a million dollars a month and we were talking about going to dinner get let's get the girls and go to dinner like his girlfriend and my girlfriend was all gonna go to dinner together right he's like win all like i gave me some times it worked for me and then he said where you want to go all like smash trolls you know again you know my favorite restaurant and then i got a calendar invite from him like bet i was excited to get that it's normal what the super high levels tell you this is how you set yourself apart and here's the thing we want to talk about in the mid-80s and vices right you don't have to go through fucking no crazy whoops oh should i do a dopamine detox or a ayahuasca retreat whatever the motherfucking nerds is telling you to do fuck that shit bro just crowd it out right look at my calendar when am i gonna do some bullshit i don't even got time to chase no holes if that's the type of shit i was on when i'm a smoke weaning get high you just crowd it out you don't even have to do nothing exotic to eliminate vices just crowd it out replace it with other shit and you do it over a long enough period of time the cravings go away and this would become normal anything you do is have it for me one more thing you can do to get more time is to actually buy time so i'm in my boy damn or tell he was on a podcast he wrote a book called buy back your time and i was telling me this is a philosophy that i've been implementing my whole life and people were clowning me on it right because i would say that i pay people to do things so i can get more time back i guess once the white man comes out with a book about it everybody thinks it's cool right then then it's fine now it's a best seller when he talks about it but when i say it i get ridiculed but there's my boy so i'm glad the mess is getting out there you can buy time first thing your business but also in your personal life like dance book is about buying back time your business i think you should start with your personal life you know let's say you're making you know you're hourly rate from your business so you're side hustle whatever let's say you're making $50 an hour from your side hustle that's your hourly rate boom right you want to clean your house it takes you two hours and now you could do it yourself right but what if you paid someone to do it this is a good clean your crew for $30 an hour cool man she got some reviews the man people would do this if it's cheap man so we're gonna go with this chick now let's say instead of paying her $30 an hour to clean your crib you clean yourself how much money did you say think about it some of you are thinking oh i say $60 no asshole loss money because if you make $50 an hour it can someone else to clean it it's $60 right but instead if you pay someone $60 an hour right and you work during that time while they clean it that's what i do i'm gonna have a of fucking team of immigrants in here cleaning it tomorrow because of big crit and i'll be working all the time and pay $60 but you make $100 an hour right boom that leaves you with a net of $40 boom you bought some time you made $40 you if you know it yourself you lose $40 these numbers get big let's say your hourly rate is a hundred dollars an hour then the number start getting crazy right but you can make $200 to a no $2 boom now you make $140 right so if you did it yourself you wouldn't say you fucking $60 it would cost you $140 that's what i'm saying by time i did this before i was rich right i was doing a little more story my father committed suicide when i was 24 it was 2007 was right before the recession started in 08 with lemur brothers and on a shit crash we had record unemployment people with massive degrees was working at Starbucks so i couldn't even get a job even though i had a college degree so i just started working mad hours per day 80 hours a week right i woke up at 4 a.m. training people morning then i shouted in the gyms went to the protestor worked at the protestor for eight hours then i worked from my boys moving coming after it right and then on the weekends i would train people in morning and managed uh barbecue restaurant and queens it was on style way street those years all just because i was working i made fucking six figures two years right i had to buy time i still had to clean my house i still had to prep my food i started online training while i was doing that so i needed to buy even more time so there's only so many hours that age day because when i talk about working a lot people would be like oh man put what about fucking food and clean and then all this shit what about using the bathroom is like shut up first about you know you're in the fucking bathroom 20 hours of least shut up right but you do gotta do other shit you gotta clean let's say you gotta cook so you gotta do what laundry you gotta wash dishes listen none of this shit makes you money right none of this shit is helping you accomplish your goals right if you start making some progress and you get your hourly rate to a point the first thing you need to do is stop doing laundry this is one of the first things i did it to him i just hit up and there was this fucking Asian place and in queens and chinese do will come pick up my laundry and bring it back it was better than what i would do because he would fold it you know when i was i fell under where my life probably not right here before it and the socks would all match they do a better than me but i can work why this motherfuckers doing my laundry i stopped cooking boom you can get meal prep you can order food tell man people's been so much time cooking i stopped cooking and i stopped getting groceries right and groceries i needed i just had it delivered they had fresh direct was the first people doing that shit but the grocery store about a cred means to do it i had it delivered and i can work during that time i didn't cook i did meal prep you know little shit that i would need motherfuckers i don't know man cheese or some shit it would be the sardines all means i had that shit delivered then i would have a meal prep boom being stopped doing this is this when i was starting out and i had other people doing this shit right i didn't watch dishes i just bought all fucking paper and plastic shit we're about the environment shut up all right we're trying to get rich you fucking washing your fort ain't saving the wheels stop playing if you really care about the fucking wheels make some money and you can do whatever you want me and save all the wheels man i stopped watching dishes and i stopped cooking and i stopped cleaning when i was task grabbing it was even cheaper and queens than it is in Miami because it's based on location i was getting this shit for like $20 an hour and now i bought time back it only works though if you use this time to go after your goals you could do it to spend more time with your family right whatever you want to do you just don't need to be doing the shit that's not helping you towards your goals right all i want to do is make money and spend time with my friends and family there's all all things i really want to do everything i do in needs to be in pursuit of those objectives and cooking fucking cleaning groceries you don't have to do that you can pay someone else to do it you might say you lazy no dumbass i'm doing it so i can work more even now when i was in Manhattan New York i didn't drive because i could work in the Uber i closed deals and over people would make fun of me for that man but you know my son lived in queens and i lived in man it would be like 45 minutes drive each way maybe hours is traffic fucking two hours i'm gonna work those two hours and just take a Uber i'm netting normal money even though i spent money to buy it time i'm netting money and you support naughty people man the chico cleans our create man she has her own company and she hires a bunch of other chicks and she's got a family you know i'm saying like we help support our family we help support the economy right these people go after the delivered the Uber eats sort of groceries or do the laundry bad we support these people man you have to say like you support the economy you help it other businesses you help other people out and do it yourself to save money poor people focus on save the money rich people focus on saving time because we know that time is more value the next thing this holding you is you're not tracking your income and you're not tracking your spending so here's how you get rich you make more than you spend and you invest the difference and over a long enough period of time you will get rich that's what i did i made more than i spent for but in almost 10 years i don't know exactly when i made my first million dollars i remember the exact date because i'm oak but it was my early 30s i started grinded like this at 24 after my follicular self i made more than i spent right watch my old videos i wasn't aware of which are meals cardier brace i was wearing a apple watch some Jordan's and some joggers and i did that shit for fucking years oh back watch some know was i'm living in the small department in Queens and when i when i started making some some real bread i moved it to the upper west side but i was still living well below my means right i was a fucking million there when i moved to the upper west side right so fucking i was living in Queens when i was grinded and let me just show you the power it is so this is the cop-out interest calculator let's say $2,000 a month the say star with two grand and you invest $2,000 a month how do you get $2,000 a month remember i said man fucking work man work more work more by time do you can work more right you do just sit for a fucking 20 years just s p five hundred nothing exotic what's her on s p five hundred is about ten percent do you do that for 20 years when you were milling there if that you was a million air that year eighteen every so much i do an example some dumbass is what about inflation shut up a million dollars a million dollars even if it's not worth as much fucking 20 years from now you will be happy you had a million dollars and if you're so concerned about inflation it stands the reason you really need to make more money dumbass that's for your dumbass comment you would think about leave and go fuck yourself i hate you all right that's more than it's not even like real money what i want you to do is to really track every dollar you make it every dollar you spend i just ask entrepreneurs how much money you make last month and they don't even know bro you you'd be surprised how many on the how much money you spend last month more fucks it be like i don't know i used to use some shit called mint dot com i got videos from ten years ago talking about using mint dot com where i track every dollar i spend and every dollar make now mint dot com closed down the we use um monar we track every dollar we make every dollar we spend and we make sure we cut in the bullshit and we make sure we we track in our spending because we get measures he's managed if you can't measure you can't manage it listen i ran one entrepreneur through the shit and we found this is more for six thousand dollars on bitches in like less than a year and not like prostitutes like flybitch's places going on day it's the end by it's shit he didn't even know he spent that much it's super eye opening when i run entrepreneurs through this bayway and once you had that set up then you're going to use a was called NBA accounting the reason i don't know exactly the forward year i made my first million we knew we made a million but when i looked in my bank account i didn't have a million dollars in it i knew i had made a million dollars in revenue but it wasn't in my account like we're not a money go and i was like fuck i need to be on a better way so i read a book called profit first and that talked about how to fix things for my business but i needed one from my personal accounting too and this is what it looks like you want to have five accounts so you have account number one which is your income so a hundred percent of your money goes in here and it doesn't matter what the sources are from you can be from your job side hustle you got different side hustles you know for me i got different businesses i got different revenue streams all of them going to say in my account this is what money gets collected there's no on a man who pay me coming out of his account there's no debit card associated with it is just the collect at the money then you distribute that money into four other accounts and these accounts are your investment account remember you got to make more you spend and invest a difference so you got to put that money aside then you have operations right this is the account you live out look this is where you have your automatic payments or you do all you spend and it's out of here then you have one for taxes because Uncle Sam won't get that money you then you have one for baller i'll explain what all these is so investments whatever your investment vehicle is remember to get rich you got to make more than you would spend and invest a difference so we got to put that money aside first this is going to be 50 percent of your income goes in here you may be thinking damn i can't make that much shut up you'll be working 80 hours a week i'll explain how that works unless you got like 30 kids or some shit i didn't tell you to have all the kids should use the kind of tool for you now all right just give up anyway 50 percent of your income gets invested this is why it's called NBA account in South Britain never broke again if you invest 50 percent of every dollar you make you can't go broke that operations 30 percent so we're going to be living off 30 percent of your income i can't do that well with dumbass you're going to make more money and you're going to be tracking all your spending so you can cut the unnecessary expenses you fucking dumb in taxes taxes are going to be 15 percent some people say men as too low right no i'm in the 37 percent tax bracket and i let New York state to evade i mean save money on taxes right you see this while living in those bathing come tax for my federal tax about 30 percent but what you have a business you get a lot of right also you got a fire as a counter like me you make it more if you want who is a right then baller account 5 percent this will you go spend on dumb shit you got a reward yourself well i can't you buy this when you buy self buy self watch get you a coaching belt get some Jordans shit you don't need you know i'm saying what it is this makes you fucking work harder if you add doing anything after pernourio because damn you can only live off 30 percent of your income so that means what you got to make more money every dollar you make remember you put in more side investments that's what what how you get rich and then you're covering IRS and then you can buy in kosh is so let's say man you want to buy you fucking kucci belt is 400 dollars and you can get yourself the kucci belt man just know that you have to make $8,000 to afford it and that's okay 400 is 5 percent of eight thousand so you got to make $8,000 to buy that kucci belt no problem but the beauty of that is you end up putting $4,000 in your investment so when you do that so this is a vote of motivates you to make more money and now check this out and maybe thinking man i can't do this i can't do this yes you can nika let me show you so the average american makes $50,000 a year it may be changed by the time you watch this video right but the average american also works less than 40 hours a week like according to actuals bureau of labor statistics there's that say that the average american works about 37 hours per week we're going to work 80 hours a week remember we talked about using a calendar and by and time you may be thinking man i can't work 80 hours we're going to buy a time you're going to use your calendar let me show you how this work so listen asshole there's 168 hours in every week you work 80 hours a week you still got 88 hours left but of course you got a sleep if you sleep 8 hours a night i'm not telling you to set the right sleep that's 56 hours right boom we should check that from the 88 boom now you are left with 32 hours boom you still got time to fuck around play grab ass you know do whatever you want with those 30 hours i don't give a fuck what you want to do man what about sleeping what about fucking grocery resources i told you a Domace to stop doing this it early you're right now you can you can spend all those 32 hours with your kids if you want or your family you won't focus any spending 32 hours a week which kids now i know that unless they fucking babies you not doing it now fucking kids got asleep like 10 12 hours a night like cats then they go to school then they got homework after school programs sports their own fucking friends they don't want to take you with your OS like that you ain't got 32 hours to spend with your kids now it even if you did they wouldn't want to spend that much time which would they got shit to do kids is busy man my son just got his second belt with his with the numchucks hang out time to be fucking around he got roadblocks to play he got school after school programs hey you got shit to do he he got 32 hours to spend with with me you know and that's good you should be busy he out here balling for a little kid yeah he got legos to build i mean we be built and legos together don't get it fucked up me and we be building shit all tights just sit you could never dream about naked anyway spend as much time you still got 32 hours do the do whatever you want it's just mad but that and that's where the calendar comes in fucking planted here's your calendar if your calendar no look like mine shut the fuck up man you don't even know him stumbling you have if the average american is working fucking just 40 hours a week making 50 is stay as a reason hey you work 80 you should be able to double that shit now we go to that cop-out interest calculator let's put in some fucking real numbers you the double that shit six figures that's what i did during the recession after my father killed himself i just worked mud the fucking labor jobs fucking security working from moving companies managing to rest around sometimes i had the fucking cooking clean we at the fire motherfuckers you know i just did that shit in person training i made six figures you can dork a recession you can do it too motherfucker in you invest half of it full one six six right boom calculate that shit oh shit 20 years you were fucking multi millionaire also real shit you made your first million and ten years and that's what fucking modest returns average returns if you invested in something like your business you could really fucking turn this shit up but whatever let i'm being as modest possible that's what it takes right you really want to get rich it's gonna take it like ten years unless you do something super risky you you know that's what i did you want a ten years now i'm rich make more than you spend in investor difference the more you make above what you spend the more you have the invest the more profit you have the longer you do it the more money you make that's how you get rich anyway can do it the third thing to stop and you from getting this money it's focusing on short-term results right you guys are too focused on short-term you want everything that happened now but sometimes things just take time like some of you got discouraged when i said ten years ten years is not a whole lot of time it makes feel like a lot of time you've year 20 because it's 50% of the life you live so far you probably don't even remember half of that time right so it's like when you have short-term focus you do things for immediate gratification or you do things the rush time or you make bad decisions and almost all cases things that you enjoy now are typically bad for you long-term and it things that are good for you long-term are typically less enjoyable now right i just say work eighty hours a week and make more money than you spend in the best half of it for ten years long-term you'll be great i gotta prove it right for short-term it gonna take what sacrifice in a lot of times and young people are just not willing to sacrifice what they want now for what they want most if you now willing to sacrifice for your goals that's fine just gotta understand that your goal comes sacrifice what is the sacrifice either way you could either sacrifice momentary pleasure dope a me or you sacrifice your potential right you got it aside and sometimes when i say so like this i get comments like oh you're wasting your best time you life in your 20s no one with a fucking my dirties would have best time in one life cause i was rich and i was in great shape and i was still looking young right my 40s i look at like they gonna be even better i'm 42 now they look at like they've been better if you're in great shape man so i'll do it if you if you take care of your body if you healthy the your 20s should not meet a best time of your life you have 20s at a time when you have the most capacity to work hard and deploy against your goals history is brittle with people who are in the 30s 40s or you're in the 50s who just look back and regret man damn i wish i didn't waste all that time cause they'd be set up and said there's fucking struggling struggling to pay bills and now they can't fucking go hard because now they got a bunch of responsibilities they got a wife they got a bunch of kids they got sit going on and they just don't have as much energy i'm super energetic more energy than you but less than when i was 20 fucking 5 you know saying you wasting your prime energy on bullshit as opposed to deployed it against your goals to set you and you set you in your family up forever right if you can deploy that energy when you have the most energy and when you have the least amount of responsibilities and you're able to take risk you can really set yourself up you and your family for the future right had i not done this in my 20s i wouldn't be able to take care of my son the way i do right i wouldn't be able to take care of my niece and nephew when they're dead died two years ago i wouldn't be able to be a real man right now the man's supposed to protect and provide i wouldn't be able to do to provide in part had i not sacrificed the momentary pleasure in my 20s instead but i didn't look into the sacrifice i have like man i got all this energy i got all this time i got all these resources man i can deploy them against my goals and then in the future my future self would thank me and i do i think that little nigga all the time put it for granted like that but you also build habit so now i still weren't any hours a week but it doesn't feel like working or because i worked hard and now one i love what i do i enjoy it so it's another scene arduous and i built the habit so it's easy for me to put in that kind of work you want to start working hard when you 35 get the fuck out of here no motherfucker you're going to be changing diapers and dealing with some bitch who's yelling at you for anything and stay it when you could have been fucking setting yourself up for the future bro it's a fucking big problem all this enjoy life shit some of us enjoy life by focusing on building up our potential some of us enjoy life by seeing how hard we can push ourselves some of us enjoy life by trying to be the best we can be instead of trying to chase as much dopamine as possible because in waste all those dopamine all that dopamine on it the evictaries man chasing his whole parties by says drugs and evictaries and you want to be fucking my age 42 with nothing to show for but a bunch of fucking funny stories that's all you're going to have to show for and you're going to fucking wish you listen to me today focus on long term goals because if you're not willing to sacrifice for your goals then your goals become the sacrifice it's a sacrifice either way don't think you're not making the sacrifice you are sacrificing either way do you want to sacrifice momentary pleasure or do you want to sacrifice victory those are your choices i wish i would end it video right there cause i fucking killed it but i got two more tips to tell you let's see if i can match that same level of all synonyms with the next two the fourth thing to stop being from copsy your goals is being fucking negative man i'm not one of these guys telling you just be positive be positive i'm saying don't be negative is it difference you got to really watch your language because your language just just your thoughts verbalized i was feeling a little sleepier earlier today because i'm old getting old i'm getting up there okay right and instead of saying i'm sleepy i said i need to get more energy it's just something i want to buy it and it's expensive i don't say man i can get the money for that right now i was saying i got to get some more money i don't even say i'm hungry i'm like i gotta get something to eat like i'm super kind of sitting on my language and let me show you what i'm important there was a baseball player but his name was Bill Buckner and this guy had one awards i think he won s the sai young award or the water paid the war or something i don't know maybe i don't know fuck a baseball right anyway you want a bunch of awards he was a good baseball player and he was going to be the world series this month for the bill but you said the dreams are that you're going to have a great series and win the nightmares is that you'll let the win run score on a ground ball for your leg things like that happen you know is just fake that's what happened i saw you this month of the book exactly what he said was going to happen i'm not saying he manifested it i'm not saying bill bugger is professor Xavier when i am saying is that yo listen when you speak negative it imprinted on your subconscious mind when you talk negatively for example whatever you think about you're going to feel and you're going to notice more right this is how it works there's a part of your brain called the reticular activation system it's located in your brain system and it's the part of your brain that's responsible for what you observe right because there's so many sounds and colors and textures and things going on in the world there's no way we can pay attention there everything and you're already as the sides on what you will notice otherwise you go crazy just too many sensations going around all the time here's how this has happened in your life and we've all had this experience you or one of your friends gets a new car you start seeing that motherfucker everywhere right but you're not an X man you didn't attract it it was there all the time you just didn't notice it but soon as somebody gets it it activates your reticular activation system and now you see them all the time but they would do it all the time and we just blinded to them because they weren't there so this is why language is so important because if you say I can't afford it you're going to see more reasons why you can't afford it right but if you say I'd have to make more money you're going to see more opportunities to get money and both things are true you can't afford it and you need to make more money both are true but when you sound like a fucking bitch waving the white flag given up the other one you sound like hmm I'm gonna go iron get it I need to make more money let's go who would you bet all the guy who said I got to the money what a guy who says man need to get more money just hold your bet all who would you want to get corner if you were trying to accomplish a goal you got to beat that person all the time I don't even let people say try around me because try implies that you know my win or my lose you have is he was in it was in rapies like a door in my culture program it's somebody says yeah I'm trying to get what I say what use the T word around here don't use that profanity around us don't bring that negative energy here right we don't say try man we not try babies we don't do it we don't do it we're not oh yeah I just don't know of course you don't know them up because you a bitch and you keep talking like a bitch say you're going get it we don't say try we don't say no no we're not try babies we going after it because if you try if you say I'm a try you're gonna put some foot you're gonna half step right ain't no half step all right we're gonna go all in right and if you go all out you will accomplish your goal I've never seen somebody go all out in fail everybody I know fails is something pussyfoot and when I say all out talking about hey where's your calendar middle like how many hours did you put in there did you do all you can do took up to that goal all you can do every day that's not working hard that's not hustling that's not working hard because you can work hard it's still not all you can do and it's like yeah going after sometimes I'm putting in a lot of work that's not a lot of work I said all you can do each day did you do that mother fucker no you did not and that's why you failed if you did that if you did all you can do each day that's not fucking trying that's determination that mother fucker's gonna win most of you motherfuckers have never done all you can do each day to accomplish one of your goals because if you did that you would have fucking got it I've never seen somebody do that in fail you may be thinking oh yeah season one do it and they fail no they would did not do all they can do it every day they did a lot sometimes they might have worked hard sometimes but working hard is not doing all you can do I'm talking capacity all right you motherfuckers were fucking around doing another shit everything in moderation go to have balance talking all that pussy shit you've seen that man pit all you can do these days are you go with that there it all like you want some Batman shit are you on your Batman shit or not no and that's why you ain't fucking hitting your goals right that's why have you when you try not try babies watch your language you never say you can't afford it say I got to find a way to give more money let's go let's get it you never say you're fucking tired if your tired you might as well be retired you want to say man I need to get more energy because you'll find ways to get more energy right I didn't take it that even though I didn't have as much energy as I wanted I don't even want to say I was tired right you know I didn't have as much energy as I wanted so I found some ways to get more energy I did some wind-hawft breathing I fucking got on my exercise bike I jumped on my trampoline took some caffeine then I got after it as you can see I don't look tired to you motherfuckers both things are true I'm tired and I need to get more energy but one sounds like you're going after the other one sounds like you got to give up waving white flag like out this what you need to do don't be negative this also means you got to stay away from negative people right because emotions are contagious remember you your home you got the new car and you start seeing that car everywhere what happens when your boys start talking bullshit about all his problems what are you going to see fucking problems let's say your boys talking about business opportunities might ways to get more money what are you going to see if he can get a fucking car and then you start seeing the car everywhere what do you think happens when he talks about his problems stay away from negative people it or don't let people talk like that around you like I just don't let people talk about what I'm trying to do this what do you try baby oh man I got to do money hey don't say that everybody I know they know that they say something to me and they're talking bad about themselves I say hey don't say anything about yourself you don't want to be true I say it all the time my inner circle they they know the best the fifth thing the stopping you from composing goes is you afraid to take risk man you can afraid to try you scared to be an embarrassed you scared of failure but you need to understand if failure is necessary failure is actually a part of it I talked about this in another video and read down the old book you talked about to a couple of goals it always looks like this almost no one succeeds at first first you set goals read down the old one at a rich as a man in the world he started the largest hedge fund of all time bridge water capital a wrote a book called principles that I suggest you are read you set goals then you fail he said it was actually a part of it it's a part of the process once you fail you learn and then that learning that's when you start the cobblestone and then you set more goals this part is critical the failure in the learned so yeah you might fail but failure doesn't last forever and then you just keep doing his loop that's what success looks like a series of failures follow about success so don't be scared to fail no you're going to fail no you're going to encounter hardships anything worth having is not fucking easy stop being a bitch can you never heard about somebody just fucking going after the goal and everything was easy it was an unbroken boulevard of green light Steve and he just hit success that's you don't even happen in Hollywood here's the thing the failure it makes you story better the reason in game and and if they need to work so good is because they fail right that's what made the movie good they just beat Thanos's ass in the first 10 minutes in the movie it wouldn't have been the highest gross in movie of all time the failure made the story better what kind of story are you telling your story is all man I saw someone wanted but I was scared that I might lose so I didn't even go after it that movie would suck you're the main character in the movie of your life you write the script are you writing the fucking script work for watch it or you write some fucking wax shit and it's okay to be scared you don't need less fear you need more courage because courage means even though it's scary even though you might fail and you will probably fail you'll probably have to fail a few times to get your goal that's okay what's not okay is being a bitch because one day you're gonna tell your kids all you can do whatever you want right and they're gonna look at you and they're gonna think damn dad is this all you want it you say I could be anything is this all you want it until he's not gonna believe you can do anything and you want to teach generation or pussy foot you're gonna be breathing bitches you want to be grucking growing a tribe of bitches because he's gonna learn to pussy foot from you no matter what you say he's like an mimic what you say he's gonna mimic what you do and if you grow up to be a bitch he's gonna see that and isn't that what you say to him he's not gonna believe he can do it because you a bitch if you tell him he can be whatever he wants to be gangled believe it because you didn't go after what you were dishing what you wanted day I noticed wasn't your dream he's gonna know you can't bullshit him however if you went after your goals if you really went after your dreams and you were cognizant and you say that oh then then it means something you could make a bigger impression on a little motherfuck make he'll believe in himself more because this fuck dad did it and what he fails you going as to be able to tell him to keep going because you failed and kept going and you'll tell him to story and he'll be inspired and he'll believe that he can keep going and he doesn't have to give up and he doesn't have to quit and now when you raise a champion but you got to be one first if you single your dream girl I would have managed he doesn't want a guy like that a guy who cowers in the face of adversity that's not the guy she's dreaming about therefore you're gonna have to settle for the woman who's willing to settle for that type of motherfuck cause even force in five don't want a bitch motherfuck you but they know they got a settle for him so now you've made an appropriate match that's what you'll mate with if you're watching this it's a lot of you guys want to make it in the fitness industry because that's how I made my first
