I made this strategic fapping. I said this on a podcast. Yeah. And but I think that you have also said something on the podcast. Yeah. Yeah. That was like, Profat. Is that a no-fab? I am. Yeah. I get it. Yeah. All right. You want me to fill in the gaps? Or you want to fill in the gaps? You want to fill in the gaps? No, I'm not going to say. Brandon, of course you want me to say Profat. And fill in the reasons why. And let me tell you why. All these no-fab nerds. Their whole identity is connected to the fact they can't get their dick at their hand, your nerd. First of all, you need to spray some of this on your pee pee. Oh, yourself. Yeah, on yourself. It's our drinking it. Your hand is a thought. Yeah. Yeah. But look at it mathematically. Come on. Make the same point for prostitution, mate. Yeah. Now, I'm not promoting that. No, are factoring. But let's talk about the math. Let's go. Let's go Profab no customer. Mm-hmm. Okay. That's the category we'll deal with. Okay. It's six o'clock. Yeah. Let's start with the streak of horning a set you cannot control. You can't control. What is your next move? What are you going to start texting thoughts? Yeah. Then she's going to say, okay, cool. I'll be there at seven. Yeah. Now, let's not act like from six to seven. You're truly focused in your work. Yeah. No, you're thinking about her getting there. Yeah. You know, you're thinking, actually, my pews. Do I need to clean my paws? Yeah. But I need to take a shower. Yeah. All the bullshit. Right? Now, you know, she's an hour late. Come on, mate. You know, minimum. minimum. If she shows up. Yeah, right. The means. Right. She shows up. Right. She gets there. Yeah. Then you got to act like you hang an hour. Yeah. Yeah. And you got to watch the fucking movie or watch the piece of a movie. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and like, it needs to act like so. It's got to feel a certain way. Yeah. Then you spend depending on how bad you laugh. 15 minutes to four hours. Haven't sex you lying. Yeah. All right. It's not over because you can't just act like, you know, you wanted to just have sex with her and kick her out. Yeah. You got to act like you really haven't interest even though you don't turn the movie back on. Yeah. And talking. Yeah. And hanging out and all this other stuff. You know, some some places walk the girl down. I don't do that person. Yeah. By the time that bullshit is over, we are in at least a five hour to seven. Come on, process. Come on. You could have. Come on. Tell them. Just go ahead and fact it out. And then it's. Yup. And got your work. And got back to work. Got back to work. Come on. Let's start traces. Like you should do. Yeah. When you become the big big geez. Yeah. Yeah. Then it's a lot easier. There's not as much of that bullshit. Right. But it's still. Come on. Man. Look. I'm not promoting it. Math Maddock. Look at the numbers. Economically. Yeah. Just as if you just haven't worked anything. Yeah. I can see the argument for pro-fab twice a week. Yeah. Yeah. If you're ever. If you can't get it out your hand. Yeah. If you pay for any kind of premium membership. Yeah. Website. If you buy and board. Yeah. Yeah. If you're watching some shit that should be embarrassing. Yeah. Yeah. You've slipped into some of the categories that have adjusted your mind a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. If you can't get a rouse by a woman. A woman. I think that's a great test. Remember that time in our lives. About 15. Yeah. When a girl could just sneeze and class and make a noise in your dick. You remember the days? Well, I used to, I remember I was star freestyle in my head. That's how I did. That's how I did. That's how I did. That's how I did. That's how I did. That's how I did. That's how I did. Yeah. When you get it for no reason. Yeah. No reason. When you stop waking up with it. Maybe you're fap two months. Yeah. Maybe you went to a, I do think the no-fap community is a little overboard. Right now. Look, you dead now. I didn't shake your hand. You know what I'm saying? I'm looking people in the eyes now and shaking their hands. I'll walk around with confidence. Yeah. The fuck's that have to do with your mind? Yeah. It's going to change. Yeah. When do a person, I stopped massing the man. My shocker, I enter my power is moving. I shut the fuck up. Then they try to do the bull in heel. Yeah. I'm stoic. Shut the man. Oh, man. There's a lot of that shit that goes on. A lot of that extra saw. They put some of the shit on. Ooh, shit. Somebody's mental thing. Yeah. I said this recently. And that's why you always had to repeat yourself so much on subject. If I had time to write it, put it in the right order, cut the words, made it guess. Tite as I could. I could explain to you manhood in about 20 minutes. Yeah. I think there's a lot of that bull shit going on. Yeah. Like a course you want to be stoic or when you're upset or you want to, you know, not me beat and you're dick all day. Mm-hmm. But I don't think there's a reason for a course around it. Yeah. Like, what are you going to do? You don't have to fucking be ceremonial about it. You don't say, you don't have to fucking. Now, maybe if you like, it depends on where you come in from, right? You know, like if you're this guy, if you're doing it too much or you're going on days with yourself like candles and shit. Yeah. You're taking it. You want to, you want to romantic move you by yourself. Then yeah, maybe you should chill. You know, but if you just, all right. Yeah, but if you're doing all that shit, you can't get pussy anyway. So like, what are we talking about? Yeah, yeah. Maybe we don't understand it because we're speaking from like, the position of privilege, right? Like, you know, we don't have a problem. You know, I'm saying, so maybe the guys who have a problem, and they're scared to talk to women, maybe they need more to, maybe I don't know this is what I was saying. This is what I was saying. Then you need to go become that motherfucker. Yeah. Put your dick down. Come on, man. Go become that dude. Become the guy that girls will do the growth. Yeah. That's another thing I'm not really big into pick up courses and how to get women. Yeah. Because we already know get women. Yeah. This gets your money, muscles, game, right? Come on. Get that right. Become somebody. Come on. Become the guy that they want to do. Now, I'll say this because I know for a fact, you do need to understand female nature. But how are you going to get that? You're going to get that through experience of dealing with them and study. Yeah. And that's going to take some time. So you're fapping strictly because you can't get it. Yeah. Now you have a problem. Yeah. Have you ever real problem that you need to handle? I mean, dude, go ahead, beat your dick. But also work out. Yeah. You should do, man. I'm not going to like not sleep because I mean, right fucking arbitrary rule. Right. Exactly. Exactly. And so I just think people, they take it too far. They just take it too far. It's too serious. Yeah. When they're walking around talking like they had alcohol problem, I've not fapped in 47 days. Dude, I've beat my dick twice since I've been here. Yeah. It's annoying, man. And I think a lot of your men get misled over it. Yeah. And the number one thing that the world uses against your men is guilt and shame. And you got to get there, shit out the way. Yeah. I'm not saying go do it, especially if it affects your life at a negative way. Yeah. But I'm not going to sit here and tell you, that's a secret sauce of being a success. Yeah. That's like that shit. That's the thing. Yeah. If you could just stop doing that all your hopes and dreams will become because it's not it. Because ultimately think about it like this as well. It's like, okay, what if you do go become that guy? Yeah. So what's the difference between you have in sex with a bunch of women and beat in your day? If body doesn't know the difference. If body doesn't know the day. Yeah. If no fat is far as like not actually ejaculating as a thing. Yeah. Then I am public enemy number one to know that. And I was like, it's just stupid. It's dumb. Yeah. It's dumb man. And so it's like give yourself a break man. We know one big part of success. I don't think people talk about the ability to stop ask yourself, do I really need to feel guilt and shame over this? Mmm. And the ability to forgive yourself. Yeah. Did that weight off of you? Yeah. Yeah. And you can go back towards a goal again. Of course I believe in discipline. Yeah. Of course I believe get your dick out your hand if it's a problem. It is a problem. What people are missing is that if you could just put down your guilt and shame for a second I understand that you're flawed and then work on that in whichever direction you need to, it'll give you the space to allow yourself to do it in the first place. Yeah. There's a lot of these guys that get so fucking buried in the I'm a piece of shit or I'm not going to win because of this. I have this thing that some dick head that can't get pussy in the first place on the internet. Yeah. He's not fapping and he's doing ice baths all by himself. Yeah. That dude's a fucking nerd. Just do what you need to do, what you know you should need. What you need to do. Yeah. That's my thing. The reason I'm against the no-fab shit is the same reason I'm against astrology, right? It's not because it's not the thing that's going to make you successful. Like you put all this energy into shit that doesn't move the needle. Right. Those aren't the things that make you successful. But it stops you when you have to carry the weight at a guilt and shame over it. And you're focused on it. I never read autobiography or biography of a successful person who can't get a successful person who credited no fab. Yes. It's like one of the, that's when everything changed. You should, we should write a book. Yeah. This is not, somebody's autobiography is a lot of books of the law. I don't read any fiction. All non-fiction mostly about success and accomplishment goes right. Not one of these books. His whole library has a chapter on no-fab. I think you can go and read this talk about sex, trans mutation. But you know what else I think about that particular thing? Yeah. And you're talking about feminine energy and he's talking about the power that you got from His wife. Yeah. You can speak that into her. Yeah. Baby, you think is good now. Wait until 18 months from now. Now you're saying that into the world, into her. Yeah. And it's coming back to you. Yeah. You're responsible to it. So you've tied love to a person you deeply care for and want to to protect and survive for it. So by saying future pacing her and talking to her, that to me is probably one of the pure forms of sex mutation. Yeah. You're telling a person that you love, just wait until this. And then I'm going to win again. And then I'm going to show you this. And every time you win you bring it to her. And it creates this compound, a flywheel of winning. And it's like, you can't wait to tell her you want to get it. Yeah. And you don't have to worry about FAFORN. You just get your dick. Yeah. And then you're saying, come on. Come on, man.
