Summer is almost here and some of you guys may be thinking hey, it's too late for me to get in shape I'm gonna show you how you can get in shape. This is the fastest way to get ripped for summer But warning this will not work if you will or This is gonna be the most difficult fat loss protocol You've ever went through and most y'all ain't tough enough to do it. You're gonna talk shit in the comments Oh, this is too much for me. This too much blah blah blah blah Can't do this for whatever reason. I'm a If you see somebody in the comments talking that super shit I want you to shame them mercilessly. I'm gonna show you how you can get ripped within like two weeks But it's gonna be very difficult. I don't believe in sustainable fat loss I think that's stupid. These Fitness influencers if fitness guys, man, you need to do something sustainable It's such a B***t up Because the loose fact you have to be the glory deficit which is a mild form of starvation What a f*** you want us to stay in starvation? How about you stop being a b***? And you should get ripped as fast as possible and then sustain your ideal way Why would you want the diet to take longer than it needs to? This is gonna be an aggressive cut and I came over this protocol back when I was a fitness model back when I was young and beautiful My 20s. I'm old now. I'm 42 but in my 20s I model for Nike pooma Brand Jordan Adidas and a bunch of other shit Sometimes the agency would hit me and say, yeah, man, you got this shoot. It's like two weeks from now and I'm like I'm not in fitness model shape right now because I used to drink in party and at crazy back then So I was like oh shit. I got a Did a shake them two weeks and for through trial and error I came over this protocol. I've also ran hundreds of people through this protocol Matter of fact. I want to show you an example. This is right. Look how f*** fatty was two weeks later He looked like this. We had him do Dexus scan before and a Dexus scan after and you can see but he's with all 6.3 pounds in two weeks A fact why not lose muscle at all and that's because he did the protocol on about the share with you now To be clear this is going to be the most difficult protocol you have ever went through You can do this to get in shape for summer you can do this to get in shape if you have a vacation You want to go on in two weeks or if you got a photo shoot like I used to have to do I used to have to do photo shoots And I need to be super rip in two weeks or two weeks from now you just want to flex on the haters It's done on the host Corries one of my students why teach have a girl all not been as business He wasn't making as much money as I went and I was like that's because you kind of fat you need to get a little Embedders shape and I put him through this protocol and then after that you got super rip and he started making way more money Here's the protocol. It consists of a ton of cardio which you might have imagined and the worst diet You'll ever go through the same look some 12 week love yourself diet You know this ain't some shit that you're gonna enjoy you're gonna hate every moment of this shit If you want some diet plan or workout plan that you would enjoy then go find some like skinny white girl Is the grand by her protocol you and the mark and go through that this is gonna be Car core the first part of this is diet So what you're gonna do is you have to track your Calories and macros we're not necessarily worried about the calories as much with the calories I'm gonna be super low. I want you to focus on protein because we want to retain as much muscle as possible during this time you're gonna get 1.2 grams of Protein per pound of lean body mass how do you know how much lean body mass you have you're gonna go to Chad jippity they're gonna upload a photograph for yourself You want to say the Chad jippity as to mate my current body fat percentage is better if you go get a dexus scan or If you know how to use the calibers you can do that or if you have an in body machine Little inaccurate, but it's cool enough. This is fine. I'll blow the picture yourself which is shirt off and ask Chad jippity estimate your current body fat percentage you put that in there blah blah blah It estimate between 68% range which judge for this picture Yeah, probably you look at the side abs though bleaks damn I'm buying his head alright then you're gonna sing you're gonna have Chad jippity do Math for you. I weigh 200 pounds. No one my body fat percentage. How much lean mass would you estimate? I'm holding and boom if you 200 pounds 68% body fat lean body brace all the formula now whatever just give me the number and it's gonna estimate is between 184 and 188 pounds of lean body mass I usually as a calculator What's 186 times 1.2 boom all right so it is how much protein I need per day that's it you want to get it's close to zero Fat and it's close to zero carbohydrates as possible this is based off something called the protein Sparing modified fast this was a diet protocol that was evetted by doctors when they had to do operations on Super obese Like big fat will There's like god damn we can't cut away all this The lumber so they will put them on the protein sparing modified fast. It was invented by doctors This is modified a little bit for bodybuilding because we want you to retain more muscle so it's higher protein and normally But it's based off that it really works the problem is with the traditional protein sparing modified fast You're gonna lose more muscle, but with this protocol with the protein so high you're gonna retain a lot more How do you get that much protein while keeping your carbohydrates and your fats as close to zero as possible again? Like I said before you should is not sustainable So think so this is just gonna you should up somebody's thing to type in that just shut the F*** up you only do this for two weeks dumb ass you can you can smell crap for two weeks and it won't be harmful to you long term is what you do her bitch you will eat the accounts right? We're gonna do this quick this is gonna be two weeks no more if you smoke crack two weeks You're probably gonna end up doing it two three years maybe two decades It's habit for me. This is not so how do you do that? What do you eat so here's some some of the things you can consume What you're gonna be in is Leem meats we're talking turkey breasts. I know gross skinless chicken breasts egg whites, you know some fish Like to Lopia a most seafood is really good is mostly protein most seafood lobster crab Just don't dip it in the butter and shit when I do this I really leaned on way Isolate protein mixing a water way isolate not way protein, but way isolate right because it has Zero carbs and zero fats is just all protein, but you can also have unlimited Green leafy vegetables so you can eat as much asparagus as you want you can eat as much broccoli as you want Colleen flowers except those not green, but that's the exception to the color rule Benage as much as much as much kale as you want the problem is you can't put salad dressing on the shit You can't put oil or butter on the shit right because we want to keep our fats as close to zero Sposable without the fat is gonna taste gross. That's why it's diet is so difficult It means really really difficult most people can't make it through it But if you can you will read the rewards you can use condiments like a hot sauce has no calories Vientagers Stivia you know most artificial sweeteners with moderate because some of them have some calories and Spicy mustard has no calories fucking salt and shit right has no calories and as far as liquid is concerned I'm sorry you can drink as much water as you want watering. I know fat you can drink coffee You just can't put sugar in it or cream teas if you British all right Diet soda pre-worked out so far and you feel pretty work as you're gonna need a lot of them if you want you can add bread Shaino me though assets exogenous ketones all that stuff as long as you don't have calories you're good And that's good diet that alone will put you in a deep deep deep Colloric deficit that's the main point It's gonna be a two week long protocol, but you're gonna have one refeed day in the middle of it All right so you're gonna do it six days Do you have a refeed day The reason you want to have a refeed day because your calories are gonna be super low and if you do that for too long Sometimes it can take it not your hormones out of whack here's how you're gonna do the refeed day You're gonna keep the protein exactly the same and we're gonna increase the calories with fat on your refeed day You want to take your body weight in pounds multiplied by 15 that's how many calories you want you want on your Refeed day keep your protein the same rest of the calories will come from fat right so this is the day you can eat fatty meats You can put butter on your shit you can put sauces on your ship, right as long as it doesn't have carbs You still want to keep our carbs as low as possible because what's gonna happen is you're gonna be in basically In ketosis and we want you to remain in ketosis What happens when you're in ketosis your body is using fat for fuel right, but Benefit it because ketosis that's a pertain to this diet ketosis is is when your body is using ketosis for fuel see on a traditional Western diet when you are Consuming carbohydrates your body Virtues carbohydrates in the glucose or glycogen and that glucose is the fuel your body runs on and the absets of glucose Your liver was so we create something called ketones where it's converting fat in To fuel and that's the new fuel your body runs on when you are in ketosis your hunger levels dropped dramatically And this tons of studies to prove this But it's gonna be beneficial on this diet because your calories are gonna be super low from it Does that make sense so we want to even though you're on your refeed day We want to stay in ketosis so we want to avoid carbohydrates Your basic and be doing keto on this day Then you're gonna go and write back to it to the main protein-spirium modified fast after this you're gonna do that on day seven and then you get right back into this Should on day eight that's the diet is pretty simple, but it's super difficult I'm telling you most of your eyes aren't helping up the duty so you can't handle it You be creating something in your mouth all the time like your mind But if you're tough enough to withstand those cravings you'll reap the benefits now We've already put yourselves in a deep deficit with the diet. We'll take it up a notch Matter of fact a couple notches with the workout so week one you are going to walk 20,000 steps a day. I know what you're thinking how to one do that You go to gym in the morning walk on a treadmill for 90 minutes maybe two hours you're gonna walk You know when I did this shit I used to walk around New York 72nd street all the way down to like one world trade center and back in our walk in the morning You know and that walk is over 200 blocks, but it was cool to walk in the city. It was a bike path The whole time so I'm just walking on a bike path on the Mixed river or I done it through central park you know I've walked from ground central park me You don't know on the west side you can walk from diamond to the lower east side But if you live in a nice city where you walk it then walk outside if you don't then get on a fucking trip It'll just walk for hours. I'll get my iPad out don't let's him you two. I'm watching shit Just walk for hours you can track your step in the iPhone all you gotta do is open the health app Until you have many steps you walk for day. It does it automatically if you don't have iPhone Merrard and joy would do it too. I have a Samsung phone I think my Android do it, but if not I'm sure it is apps that attract your step, right? You can also track your steps with you to app watch or the Samsung watch also if you got the Samsung watch Throw that away me You know but you ever got you wearing a sample Sun watch Pussy repellent right there though none dry up with a giant as fast as in a Samsung watch if Johnny Samsung is watching this you pay me the money. I'll say that shit is dope. I got both. I don't live a life of scarcity It's kind of like people ask me what you like ass or titties and I'm like what my girl We're got a fat ass in some fat titties. I don't live a life of scarcity now. I hear picking and choosing Get both play a your first week 20,000 steps a day is gonna take hours of walking one thing I used to do when I had this is if I had I had a treadmill desk While I was working taking meetings. I was on a treadmill if you don't got this shit man Fiverred out my f*** I said this was gonna be difficult and you can get your kids involved get your family involved you can walk it dog Love being outside you walk with your kids make it a family thing you can walk your girlfriend like downgoedy now We too you're gonna step it up. We're gonna walk 40,000 steps a day I know what you think it and you're right that is very difficult but you will burn a tremendous amount of calories You'll put yourself in a deep deep the glory deficit and everyone was saying you can't do it We've done it. I did it Brian did it. I used to sell a fitness course called the Terminator 2 week diet And this was the protocol and hundreds of people did it 40 day have steps a day some of them Tiny women is shit tiny white women tougher than you maybe if you over here crying about walking Then probably you were tough hate you that's what you've fat now. That's how you ended up on this video Faboy now that's just the cardio the reading when I do in high intensity cardio You can only do it for a certain amount of time if you ran a mile you only burn like a hundred calories on average But how many miles you gonna run you can walk for longer? You can run and in the long-term you will burn more calories. How many calories does the average person burn if they walk 40,000 steps thousand steps can burn a significant number of calories But the exact amount varies greatly depending on individual factors. Here's a breakdown Oh man, I wish that would have just got to the point. I'm a skip to the end Stafford First World burn between 16,000 and 24,000 calories if they walk 40,000 steps That's a lie because you got remember already in a deep deficit and you got to remember for every pound of fat You want to lose you have to burn extra 3500 calories. This is Burn like 10 pounds into weeks, right? It's not sustainable. Now that's just the cardio There's no way you're gonna do high intensity cardio burn over it Like thousands of times a calorie calories and even if you did you won't be able to do millenels that day But if you do this man you burn more calories You could do it every day without getting sore without harming your joints You're not gonna be running miles every day, bro Unless you David Gogg is and you've been training for it I should you will need new sneakers last time I did this I needed new sneakers after week one like there was a hole in my sneakers And at about another pair of black air force ones for week two and then after week two those sneakers were dead too Don't do this shit wearing your nice sneakers don't do this shit wearing Jordan's a shit Did you some black air force ones? Let's get it in now what about training you want to maintain as much muscle as possible So what you're gonna do is you're gonna do two or three full body workouts per week and you're gonna pick one Maybe two but one is enough if you still inclined pick two compound exercises per body part So we're talking about chest hit bench press back bent over rows or pull-ups Show the press boom legs hit the squats front squats back squats low bar high bar on the Four leg press who gets a shit then you hit the the only isolation Exercising on do you maybe you do some curls try to have extensions Cavraises that's it man and you're gonna do four set set that shit till failure to keep the rep range relatively low Six to eight reps Let's heavy because when you lift heavy and encourages your body to retain more muscle Lift heavy keep the rep range relatively low go to failure even keep rep range six to eight Make sure you cannot do nine nine should be impossible with good form you might be able to nine if you cheat or some shit You do in bed press you start doing all this shit Or you start curling you doing all this shit Turn in curls into back instantions and that's basically it man. That's that's the protocol If you do that I promise you you will get an amazing shape Here's the weird thing about this shit something changed in metabolism after it is I can't guarantee just what happened to you I did this before a summer it seemed easier to stay ripped that summer my boy brand That he said the same thing. It was like he kept losing fat even though he wasn't trying to and for me It was just I started bulk enough to this but I stayed super lean I'm not saying that I happen for you but some people have reported that including myself I'm not trying to sell you anything I'm giving you this for free now here's the thing you're going to need some supplements when you're on his diet And it's critical if you don't take these supplements you're going to fuck your shit up the mandatory supplements Sodium right because our carbohydrates are going to be so low you have to increase sodium magnesium and potassium Where we have to have our electrolytes way up see the main reason people say man I'm so weak when I did keto when I cut carbs like a week the main reasons because you need to up your sodium intake Well, happens is when your carbide just allow you start flushing a lot of water weight So you're going to lose water weight too on this protocol and that's not insignificant You will look better with less water water weight. This is why bodybuilders dehydrate themselves before they go on stage Shit right for sodium you will get somewhere between 5 and 7,000 milligrams of sodium per day every other time you try to cut the carb the life you feel like shit is because you didn't do this Right you have to really increase your sodium potassium you want to get between 1,000 and 3500 milligrams of potassium daily you might take a potassium supplement if you want a sodium You can get a lot of it from hot sauce or put an extra salt on your food You have to increase magnesium you need at least 300 and 500 milligrams of magnesium a day You could just drink multiple Elementes that shit superman be selling on this podcast he paid to sell the shit I'm just telling you this easy way to get you electrolytes they don't pay me I'll take the money if I listen it you give an almani to youtubers you ain't given them an old black people is your racist? I don't know I guess we'll find out if you give me some money everyone who's saying you racist What happened shut up now? I don't know if anybody's missing they racist until just now But now they are it's out there we can't put that cat back in the bag you just got to prove that you're not racist by giving me some money The next up of you team it's fish oil It's actually a helps with a lot of things one to two grams Official oil per day and then you want to take any multivitum those are mandatory like if you do not do this It you will feel like trash the most important thing is the electrolyte you got it They're electrolytes elementing they don't want to pay me then you can get some liquid IV if they don't want to pay me body armor It's got some new shit you understand we'll see how much money they got for me or any Electrulite company that wants to give me some cash now. Here's the non mandatory supplements This is where it gets fun Warren somebody shit it get you kicked off your NCAA basketball team You understand if you were pro athlete you might want to check the regulations first is caffeine I love caffeine you're gonna have lower energy on his diet not because you're cutting cars But just the calories are gonna be so low and you're burning so many calories right so your energy is gonna be lower caffeine will help with that so you want to take two to three hundred milligrams of caffeine two to three times a day That might sound excessive to a lot of y'all. I do that shit just cuz I enjoyed on this protocol It's gonna really help you and caffeine is proven to help you you burn fat because It actually gives you more energy to move more right so you'll burn look at if you take enough of it It might approve you move too much you get that cocaine energy like me I took 300 milligrams of caffeine before I started filming this that's why this video so great the next supplement you want to take something called a fedra back in my day in the 90s when I started working out every fat burn is supplement Had a fedra in it because it's a potent fat burner. It's one of the few supplements is actually proven to burn fat Fat burn in is a two-part process is Lepolicis and oxidation so the policies when your fat cells break down in the fatty acids oxidation is when your body uses those fatty acids for energy and this tons of studies prove that a fedra Speeds up the rate of lipoluses meaning speeds up the rate that your fat cells are broken down in the fatty S and then with all the cardio you'll be doing you'll be using those fat cells for energy but it also potent hunger suppressant if you take enough of a fedra you'll you'll forget the like the hunger hunger won't be your problem And it gives you tons of energy in fact so much energy is banned by some sports leagues Like I said they used to put it in every body of the supplement people died or some shit I don't know some happen to somebody and they they made it illegal to put it in body But supplements you can still get a fedra you don't need a prescription go to the pharmacy go to the shit behind the counter the pharmacist Give it you're gonna have to give your ID make sure you're not breaking bad and you say you'll give me this stuff called Bronc aid Bronc aid is basically as my medication, but the main ingredient in it is a fedra It runs like two to three bronch aid pills per day take it with the caffeine You will be Why you'll feel amazing and you won't be hungry the next Supplement any sort of ketone supplement so exagent is ketones My favorite one is this one called ketone aid it tastes like Piss bro. I never tasted piss, but I imagine this what it tastes like you know what I imagine it tastes like you know You ever see a dumpster and there's like some juice coming out the side dumpster juice That's what it I imagine it tastes like it tastes awful you have so much energy if you take a ketone Supplement and this is very important that you take this because remember when you're in ketosis your body is using ketones for fuel as opposed to Using glucose for fuel, but it takes a little bit of time for your body to acclimate it at right? That's what someone some people cut carbs they get they say they get the ketone flu Lot of it is just they don't have enough electrolytes most of time is that but what what helps is if you are taking Exagents ketones why your body is adapting to no carbs and you're taking the magnesium Then you want to worry about the ketone flu right you'll have more energy you'll feel way better and it's also another Hunger suppressive it doesn't necessarily help you burn any more fat not directly like it doesn't Milt the fat of your body, but it makes you less hungry so you'll be able to stick to your diet easier So ketone aid is my favorite if you want to get a different sort of ketone supplement That's why I recommend ketone aid so we have bronch aid and ketone aid and get the caffeine for many source you want you can take caffeine pills you can take pre workout Pre workout like I like this one called total war because it got some shit in it that makes my fucking eyeballs tingle Back my ball start to twitch Mmm, that's the stuff that's what I need it right if you don't want your eyeballs to tingle Then you can get this this other pre workout that I like is called woke AF I like it They got some good flavors when I have my sublimit company. We have the same manufacturers or any pre workout as long as it's got enough caffeine you know Selfie is only as 200 milligrams of caffeine light work So you want to take all little together two to three times a day after you know this protocol If you are at the weight you want to be and you're gonna lose food they could just do maintenance for the summer for your maintenance Calories I'm a moth play you a body weight times 15 You want grandma protein per pound of body weight that's maintenance if you feel like you need to do this protocol again And somebody could do it, but just don't do it like back the back like give it like two weeks off at least for you Good back on something like this.
