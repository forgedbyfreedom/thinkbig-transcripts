I've been in business for about 14 years and over the last 14 years I've made 10s of me He's a dollars. I built several multi eight bigger businesses in this video I went to break down the lessons I've learned over 14 year career in business All right the ups the downs. I hope that you guys can learn things that you can apply your current business or any business You will start and you can avoid a lot of the pitfalls, you know, so you'd like to learn these things Somebody sings the hard way the way I did because Experience is the best teacher, but it doesn't have to be your experience Are you gonna learn from other people's experience and how to make the path easier and you can hit your destination faster And some of these lessons are gonna be straight business lessons for somebody's gonna be more Personal development lessons as you ascend up the ladder of success You're gonna have to become a better person not just as a business person, but you know a lot of business problems That people have are really just personal problems They manifest themselves in their business But also a tactical personal development stuff that will help you a sin to greatness if you don't learn these lessons You will learn them But you'll have to learn them the most difficult way to young and experienced I don't want you to have to do that. Let's number one consistency is key progress is made through consistency over time You know a big problem I see with would be entrepreneurs is they want to make things happen fast Right, they're always looking for some shortcut or they're trying to rush things You want to think of your business growth the same way you would think of growth of a child Is there some kids in your family? Maybe you only see them in Van Rereen or something? You see them maybe once a year Everyone's wild. He's like whoa you grown so much, but the parents might have noticed it They made little improvements every day nature handled that so it was easy right the amount you improved from day to day Oftentimes is negligible and it looks as if you're not really making progress at all But if you take a longer review which you'll notice is you made a ton of progress if you've been consistent every day If you've ever made a fitness transformation right put awesome muscle and or loss fat It happened gradually like you worked out today You don't see any results today You might not even see little results tomorrow. I'm going to but over a significant amount of time You'll you start to look like a different person, but it happens very incrementally every day So here's a problem. I see a lot of people the white eight sugar would be consistent is because they're focused on their big goal Right, I say this is a goal. This is gonna be my visual representation of a goal All right, this is which you want you want to accomplish this goal This you at this mount top is a visual where a visualization of you accomplish in this goal All right saying if you sit at haters you got man money, but you may look at that from your beginning stage And that might make you kind of like say Oh, man, I'll never get there or you'll see other people there and you might be oh, man You get this you get discouraged that's what happens to you when you look at the goal from the bottom right all you need to do is focus on What's in front of you for example for a weight loss goal was that when it lose 10 pounds of fat and I got 10 weeks to do it easy Again every pound of fat you want to lose you have to burn 3500 calories So if I'm in a 500 calorie deficit every day All right for a week 500 times 7 is 3500 calories So I'll burn the pound the week if I'm in a 5-in-a-calorie deficit each day So all I gotta do is focus on today if today is a victory I just focus on today right boom did I do it again the next day and the next day and the next day and then I You know if I start string stringing together perfect days But do that seven days in row. Oh, man. It's probably week. I start stringing together perppy weeks and this is perpping month I start stringing together perppy months and it's a perfect year and if I have a perfect year then you're me You know, don't focus on the big goal. I've been taking photos on the big goal I think that could be a mistake because it can it can be discouraging because you're not making progress every day But if you just focus on today you know you're making progress every day you can understand So which we have to do is break your goal down into the daily habits that you have to abide by each day and then just string together perfect day Number two track the inputs right if you track the inputs You don't have to worry about the output. So for me a perfect day I know what it for it with my goals. I break those down into what has to happen every day And then I just track it I'll put a link in the description where you can download this template Let's just focus on the the diets stuff right boom. Did I track my macros every day? Yes, you see it's a total hundred percent how much protein did I get every day in grams on average? 120 grams perfect right how many calories is that kind of soon under under three thousand each day perfect How many calories did I burn boom? Three three thousand I tracked it with my ordering right and was my calorie deficit Total man so I was cutting them up so you can look at the inputs each day You know what I lose fat you know I did more rip right if I'm burning more cows as I consume every day You would know with certainty the doubt would happen right? So the beauty of it when I'm looking at the inputs each day I just make sure I have a perfect day. Then I know we give me copies to know I will accomplish my goal And then I track other inputs like you know I'm you know growing social media. So okay if we did if we posted you to Post the IG posted it how much did he read and I can see where I'm fucking up work and improve It wasn't me the person who who posted on my Instagram He wasn't posting every day. He got fired. I knew he was gonna get via social media. Hey listen You're gonna get fired Pretty soon The person who does the take-out you think you still working for me. That's right. Yes The person who does the YouTube they used to working for me. Yeah, probably edited this video Right boom practice gets are you know I got a little bit better practice I'll do some other things practice manage. Oh, I only practice Spanish Your blah or unbiquito as spanish. Oh, but you guys do what I'm saying like oh you got to do is track the inputs But this is why tracking the sole board because you won't have the guess if you're gonna accomplish your goals You'll know if you're on the right path and that because you'll be able to see it every day Right and that only do you do this your personal life, but you do this with your business of course Right you got to track the KPIs the goals and you got to go over the stuff you track with your team on a regular basis to make sure Everybody's on on the same page right tracking is is one of the most important things if you wanted to download that habit tracker We'll put the link in the description as a template the next key to accomplishing your goals There's more of a person to develop in one We'll get into some hardcore business stuff as this video progress is sacrifice is the next lesson Right, you're gonna either sacrifice momentary pleasure or you're gonna sacrifice your goal You got to make decisions no wrong decision. You got to know your making decision and make it so for example When I was first trying to make my first million you know It makes your first million is gonna take almost everything You know it's that's what your goal is and I had to sacrifice a lot You know I didn't watch any TV you didn't watch any football or basketball and I'm black You know a difficult it was for me not to watch the basketball, right, but I didn't do it You know and because I just knew if I wasn't with the sacrifice for my goals my goal was become a sacrifice As if not watching these shows are gonna make you rich as little because of what I was doing instead of that You can understand I was working on a business Wait when everyone else is watching TV and fucking around and but now here's the thing when I go to basketball games now I either sit courts eye with the homies or one of my boys He has a skyboss so we go and we hang out there's a different experience It's better now. I'm gonna do the more you can delay gratification the better will be I quit smoking marijuana I never went back to smuggle marijuana, but I quit smoking marijuana when I was trying to focus because I knew I was in at my best when I was Get out now if I wanted to smoke weed I could get the best I don't want it now But I'm just saying it can be better now right now you guys are running around getting distracted by like girls This war like five's and six But it would actually come up put work on building a muscle money mindset you put that aside for right now You can probably get a better girl You probably get a hotter girl a girl you like better because and you won't have to have a bunch of risk If you are like the man it'll be easier right the more you sacrifice now You can still enjoy those things later on if you can delay gratification But you can get a better version of them later first million it's probably gonna take everything Like if you want to make you know 10k a month or you know low six figures I don't want to say that it's easy, but it it won't take everything all right You can probably mess around a little bit and party and you can probably still indulge in some vices and make that much Right, but if you want to make over a million here in your business 80% of businesses fill within the first five years All right, and less than five percent of businesses make it to the point where they're making over a million dollars a year All right, so think about how difficult this is this is undertaken it might take everything Everyone I saw Avengers if in you and at the end Thanos is talking to his daughter He killed and like the dream world or some shit and she was like yo, did you do it? He was like yeah, she said what it costs you he said everything and I was like I like I felt that because the bigger the goal the more you are gonna have to sacrifice and again If you're not willing to sacrifice with low that's cool You just need to make peace with that and know that your goal will become the sacrifice Right, so it really might take everything now You've got to think about what you will sacrifice the witch and not, you know it gets a little easier to go from one million to two Then it is from zero to one million. I money gives you leverage where you could actually make stuff happen But it might set it might take a lot of seconds for that's wise it's more difficult to get rich when you're older because you got more responsibilities and less things That you'd be women to sacrifice like time wicked or your relationship or you know But ever else you got going on like you get more responsibilities as you age All right, so if you're gonna do it, you know you really that's why you don't want to waste your 20s This why till guys will work so hard in their 20s so they don't have to sacrifice So they can get successful before they have the fucking kids issue because it's gonna be more difficult And as you get older right and just have to be willing you know Some people it need to realize that maybe millionaire multi million years not for them not because they can't do it Just because they then that woman to put in that sacrifice you get them then and that's okay It's always you make peace with it where I'm not telling you it was right or wrong and maybe making you know Six figures or high six figures somewhere that range is cool You got to design your own path, but you should know what you get into if you want to make a million dollars A year that first million might take everything anyone tells you is easy life Here's the next lesson the fact that you want it to be easy is what makes it more difficult because I see a lot of people Looking for the easy way to accomplish the goal. I see a lot of people Venteen about how Arduous the task is how stressful it is for them to accomplish their goals But now they have to deal with the difficulty of the goal and they have to deal with this mental pain Unfilfield expectations right because they expect it it to be easy or they desire it to be Easy however, right if you can reframe your brain and think I'm glad it's difficult because the fact that it's difficult It's one of the reasons why it's worth having this me my willingness to accept It's difficult to get worked through it and work through the pain is what separates me from all the people who will fail and give up Right if you just keep that in mind right it's not supposed to be easy it's supposed to be difficult And if it ends up being easy and that's like oh cool, man That's great. Let it be a surprise not an expectation. You know if you find something easy Because you don't want to have to deal with two pains Right it's already difficult, but now you also have to deal with that Expectations not be a myth or your your preferences not be a myth you understand what I'm saying like you if you could just reframe your brain To be excited when something is difficult. Well something is difficult. I can't get excited I would like okay, this is where most people will quit and this is why I'm gonna beat them This is why I will succeed in they will I think about that all the time and if you can start adopting the attitude Over time it starts to excite like I'm I'm kind of fucked up Because now every someone's the one somebody sees me to see me like weighing my food at a restaurant I bring a skill with me and weigh my food at a restaurant. I know it's extreme extreme success You want to stream results you gotta have you gotta take extreme actions right and people say man I can never do that man. That's man. That's some was discipline. I can never do that and that's what I'm thinking Yeah Fucking right. I don't say that but in my mind. I'm like yeah, you know it's not every but I say something nice But I'm really thinking that's right on the fucking tougher you need to understand that man away better Maybe that better than you but definitely tougher because you think punching numbers and the app when your phone is difficult I'm gonna do that shit no matter what or like you know working 10 12 hours a day every day You the man I can never do that man's too difficult. I'm like fucking right you can't you'll never meet a big dog I don't say those things. I just think I be like oh man you know a man you gotta do what it's gotta do you know a man different strokes different folks Man what it makes me happy brother but I'm that's what I say but I'm thinking you know you start to enjoy it Once you reframe it like this is why you're gonna succeed use another key confidence comes from confidence I see a lot of people certainly young kids, you know there Sometimes they come in with a lot of confidence or or they feel like they it's something that you could tell when it's fake It's not right it with a fake confidence a bravado and I like man how do you know you're gonna succeed Man, I just want to real bad just like all right cool, but you know confidence that's a comfort confidence only You gotta be good as I'm just like I can't just say man. I'm the man and then like do my own plumbing I'm not a Mario brother so it would be it for me to think that I was good It's just be confident about my ability to plumb that would be delusion you gotta be have Competits confidence has a comfort confidence now some people they miss to screw that and they say maybe she's just Be confident you should just be confident yourself and I think they confuse confidence with self love Great like loving confidence are are different things Right like for example I love my son right, but I don't I don't have confidence him cooking his own dinner Man, he's certainly making it to school by itself without my help right You know as they end like you don't confidence the companies are two different things I love him just fine. I love him more than anything But I don't have confidence in his ability to do a dog to do much of anything is a kid right Nor city or the same same thing is my um I remember grandma she died when she was passed away when she was 96 we all love their but you know We can lead a lady alone by herself at all man. She couldn't even ship by herself towards the end You know like we didn't know confidence in her but like we love their right They're just two different things confidence has a comfort confidence and you know Listen when you start doing things every day that actually move you in the direction of the man You want to be you start you give yourself a reason to like yourself like inner self confidence Right, not just confidence in specific tasks, but they say over all self confidence It'll come from keeping the promises you make yourself doing things to make you proud of yourself Right, and also helps you deal with criticism when you do that because people ask me how do I do? What criticism that's the next lesson you're gonna have to deal with criticism as you succeed Nobody gets you random is praise right they kill Jesus Martin King Abraham Lincoln those guys were better than me. You know they they I'll probably never do anything as cool as him Especially Jesus he was the man right so they can't get unanimous if the haters got them of course They go come after me too. I just think about that that's one way to deal criticism But also here's the key to deal this I got people making you two videos about me everyone's love And I know it's probably good for them it probably helps him with the algorithm They probably get a lot about a bit right in a in this cool, but you know I just kind of laughed it off man because I'm so good at what I do and I like myself so much that the criticism sounds kind of absurd It would be like if you said brandy you look like a Chinese late And I would just kind of like laugh at you man I would like a man if someone was wrong to you know not wrong being a Chinese lay I'm just saying the only way to like yourself that much It could be so for reason like yourself that much and can't just do it all the people just love yourself just like you So if you have to give yourself reasons all the time to like yourself everything you do is you cast an evoke on the kind of person you are Well even if no one else knows you know this shit you do behind closed doors You know if you are following your diet You know what time you wake up, you know even if no one else knows you know and a lot of people walking around with like this shame It is security they bullshit and they do it all types of shit behind closed doors or By themselves that they not proud of and they noting that proud of the cast and boats of doubt within themselves every time They take these action, but every time you do that things that you're proud of you moving the other direction Right and what you stop doing the things that you're not proud of and do more the things that you are proud of over time Criticism just sounds ridiculous because you know what kind of guy you are inside It's somebody called me lazy it would be like ridiculous because I know where my day is like I know what time I wake up, you know I know how early it is I woke up I know I only you've had to say not just like I'm You got a little disappointed only you know even if you don't tell nobody you know you can't bullshit yourself You can I'm saying like you can you can I'll carry me time to look yourself in the mirror and say you were Ashena if you don't put on a space suit Climbing a rocket and leave first atmosphere it's bullshit, right? So if you say you're the man you are doing shit to prove to yourself that you're the man It's bullshit and you know it's bullshit you can't bullshit You're not to prove to someone else, but you have to prove it to yourself because we can all tell how you really feel about stuff You have an energy about you have an aura and we can feel the bitch in you do you ever be around somebody You just you and you feel like you could accomplish anything with this motherfucker like this motherfucker's the man You feel the he don't you have to say nothing that's cuz he's proud of himself He's doing things on a daily basis to making problems Self and he's not doing as much fuck shit as you right and when you're doing that fuck shit What is doing your fucking chip in a way to accomplish you make yourself believing yourself unless you and you like yourself less And then so you will compensate with a bunch of fucking boy I'm the man you gotta fucking this gay business You need to get drunk and hide some more because you can't civil with yourself because you don't like this So you gotta you gotta get all this external validation But once you really like it so you just sit by yourself be like I'm that man And you have proof you don't have to just say it like damn I really am then they think it is Even if you don't accomplish your goals yet just the fact that you're moving when you start stringing it These perfect days like I showed you like imagine if you had a list of things you weren't doing every day and you looked at your your Habit tracker and you saw fuck is stringing a fucking perfect days or a month How do you think you'd feel about yourself versus how you feel about yourself now when you know you are Fucking around not accomplishing it and not going after you Yeah, you wouldn't have to say no mother fucking affirmation You've no risks up the next lesson is your calendar is the key to success So I want to just want to show you what it's like to really be serious about cops So check this out man every hour of every day is a count at four right and just like that every day That's what it looks like it really be successful right so if you it was gonna happen is you'll get more time each day We all get to say them out of time, but you're using more effectively so you'll get more out of that time Right as the hundred to six eight hours in every week Does four things the man has to do you have to you have to sleep you have to work you have to work out It's been so much a family the long four things a man has to do everything else is optional I know so if you really be worried about doing dishes with about going to the bathroom listening I'm talking about the big thing. Sorry and then you still got a poop right everybody I read my son a book about it like if you're in a bathroom for like 30 40 hours a week Then you got problems there be on a scope of anything if you really write down how many hours a week Are you's been in sleep and if you sleep eight hours the night and you sleep in 56 hours of Most of you guys have worked 40 hours a week right if you work out an hour of eighty seven hours I don't know I'm gonna sign me you're supposed to find me that's just you this a personal thing But it's been as much as you want and what you need to do and subtract that from a hundred and sixty eight That's how much time you have left to go after your goals. What are you doing with that time? That's the time where you were accomplishing you get ahead of other people most of some doubt I'm doing using it more effectively because you do it I mean I plan it out each day every day so if you took it my days each day is choreographed I know exactly what I'm doing every day. I got you know, yeah, I know you need to shower I put it in the and the thing I need to eat my meals are in here, right? You know, I know what I'm gonna do everything all right everything is in the calendar I know what I'm gonna work out. I know what I'm gonna do all types of stuff everything is choreographed Right, so I'm not Guessing the plan gets moved around I have to move stuff around throughout the day in the school But I get way more done each day than most people do you're not gonna get in the mountains up today It's gonna day by day All right, but the more you can get done each day the faster you could actually climb that mountain and the other way you do this by using your calendar You just follow the plan now. I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and I got a game plan I know when I'm gonna wake up boom I know what I'm gonna do soon. I'm gonna wake up You know, I got a whole game plan. I just follow the game plan I'll have to think I just execute because I planned ahead it's time and I get way more done each day done now It doesn't go according to plan perfectly, but I move things around this thing change. That's okay. I can move stuff around It's not a sudden stone There's only a few things I said so on the stuff to sit red right everything else. I can move around if I need to and here's the thing Everybody in the who's really rich Yeah, he's like that my boy Jeremy he's super rich man. He makes like close to a million That's a lot. Yeah, I hit my boss like y'all. Let's go with the girls to dinner, right? He's girlfriend my girlfriend and he was like what time is I cool? I was like what place he said? Let's go to the masterals. Boom. I get a Google calendar invite immediately right this is normal at the high level It sounds crazy to you because you only kick you with broke people But all the multi-millionaires I know do this except for it like the pro athletes and entertainers like they don't do this right Then I make a money in business started making money off entertainment right so it's a different game They're playing we're not playing that game now unless you are renowned though watching this you probably You do this by the little broad James his calendars like that I heard other people's almost it's serious like that How you get more done these days the calendar is a cheat code I have a whole video on how to use your calendar there. You should check that out here's another key volume solves almost all Prop or you in fitness and life everything you know calves have been one of my week points traditionally So what I started doing I bought a calf machine for the crib I have one in the in the York and I started to wait eight since the cast per day my Caz got bigger now people say I'll make you cas got way better. Thank you Right volume solves almost all problems bro. You need to make more money amen do more sales do more hours to get more leads Right do like way more volume like few things happen with volume when you turn up the volume you taking more action and then that action And then you get better at it so you improve your skills right and then the you want to improve those skills more Now you get better result because you're better right and that gives you more more confidence and if you have more confidence It might be easier to take more action But you need to take that action you got to take that action first and the more and the more you improve it It starts to look like this so you get you take that action boom take some action you improve your skills Right now your skills get bigger right so your results get bigger boom So your confidence grows right now you could take a bigger action more action that you take more because we have more confidence That that action you're gonna get way you're gonna just skill set is gonna get bigger faster boom the results are gonna be bigger Boom Give you more confidence you take a bigger action This is what I call the big-to-recyclo All right, we're all going through this everything you do you get better at it or worse and the the thing is At the easiest way to get better as something is to do it more do when you take more action You get better at the thing so you're results improve but also if it was the action Improves your business or helps you the kids you close through your goal even if you didn't get better at it Just doing more of it will get you close to your goal right because the action gets you close to your goal If you were salesperson to say you were half as good as everyone else in the sales team like your clothes rate was 25 and the best clothes closer was 50 right so he's twice as good as you but if you took twice as many calls when you could make the same amount of money If you took three times as many calls as him with this with a worse clothes rate You'd still make more money than the person with a better clothes rate But it wouldn't stay to say what happened is not only would you make more money if everything stayed the same? You'd get better because of the victory side call like volume saws almost all problems Seriously almost all problems you better relate to the problem You need to do more of the stuff that you're spouse like you were you having problems with school Hey man just study more dummy right you want to be better or something do it more But the thing is you want to take it to an extreme man go super hard and don't leave it to do that Put it in your calendar right because most of you won't feel like trying to get around this shit But she's not gonna get around this you're not gonna get around this you're not gonna find time you gotta make the time Times going high from you man you gotta go. We got a grab it putting your calendar So I'm going right which leaves the next point you can actually get good at anything with enough effort and enough time You can do good at something as fast as you want to do good at it. So I'm gonna bring something up All right, so this is something I call the skill acquisition matrix It's like you can get good at anything fast a lot of you guys have heard that 10,000 hours each of you went into the best in the world This was made popular by Malcolm Gladwell and his book Outliers the people who are world class Something that you've got 10,000 hours of practice by think there's levels to this You don't need to have 10,000 hours of everything because you don't need to be world class at everything for my experience And skill like was it should be in a coach for a long time and just getting good at a lot of different things a hundred hours Making that bad you're not great. Which is not bad for example when I first started playing guitar around 90 days I was like not bad. I wasn't good right, but I'm not bad I think mufflers ain't laughing at the 90 days of practice in an hour a day a thousand hours not that's when you get good We get a thousand hours of training some okay this muff up is good 20,000 hours making really good That's when you're impressive people are like oh shit this muff up is the man five thousand hours makes you amazing 10,000 hours obviously one of the best now 20,000 hours. I think this makes you one of the best ever These are like world champions these are people who win the living metals that should most of us will never be that good at anything How fast you want to get good at something remember volume cells almost all problems just check it out the hour Day you get not bad three months right Let me you can get not bad at anything in three months right two hours a day that it gets you not bad and like under two months Three hours a day this would a magic starts to happen You can get not bad at anything in one month and 25 days if you do four hours a day Let's say you want to get good at something like here's what is going to say one hour a day is going to take you You need to send the three years two hours a day is going to take you a little bit over one year three hours a day You can get you can get it something in one year four hours a day you can get good at eight months That's what starts to get magical when you start putting in a lot of hours Let's say you want to be really good boom I'm not going to go through this whole shit where you know you can pause this take a screenshot or something right But this is what it takes now is the thing something you may look at this and get discouraged Especially young people young people have a skew perception of time if you're 20 years old a year sounds like a long amount of time It's what it makes sense because that's 5% of the time you've been alive You know, so if you could start thinking in decades you can get good at anything in 10 years You know you can get really good at it. You know you could accomplish the light, man Don't get discouraged first of all. Just know what takes time But also it should be encouraged. It's what I do is that anytime I'm trying to acquire a new skill You might as well practice on my calendar, right? Because there's something that I'm trying to I'm working on getting better at but it's mapped out I know when I'll get good at it if I find myself getting frustrated like I'm man I'm not good at that. I just try how many hours I spend doing it But oh, I'm not supposed to be good. Yeah. I don't have enough hours and I actually make me feel better And some of you will feel because I try something to what's and I man I'm not good at that and then quit not supposed to be good at it So nobody's just good at nothing like even people who say I've naturally good singers I never met nobody like that everybody knows good at singing like really good at singing They grew up in the church. They had a bunch of practice. They sang with their families They had like practice even though it was not informal They they've got like hundreds or if not thousands of hours you have to put in the time to get good at some But beauty if you can get good at anything within reason if you put it in that the hours and this should be encouraging You saw my track of sheep. I had hours of practice how many hours of practice stuff how many hours I worked on so this is why you get them See that I I'm keeping track of because I know the man like life is just man This way similar in August we talked about it before like lack of confidence can keep you from coming up If you don't like yourself lack of confidence can keep you from actually making moves But over confidence can take you down I've seen over confidence take a lot of people down because web is as you start accomplished in things And you stop doing what got you there and web is is you start believing that you're the man And you can do no role and then you know you start fucking around fucking up and doing a bunch of Fuck shit and people fall all right they start believing that they better than they are But for me I just believe in the process I don't really believe that I'm like that great. I don't believe on better than you I just believe you just don't know how to be as dope as me yet and that's why I make these videos But I believe in the process. I'm only where I'm at because I track the inputs I plan out every day of my calendar Discipline and I know that anybody can do that anybody will get some success over a long enough period It's out if they do the same things you get a band like so I don't believe it's me I don't get to cocky but when you see people getting cocky web is this that's how you get people like you know Pete didn't man, you know He didn't start off doing on a wild shit, you know and you would if you Grammys you you built a multi Million dollar record label clothing line alcohol brand marketing agency make a few billion dollars I can see I might get to someone's Then you probably thought he was so good he probably thought it was him you know And then he starts thinking he can do anything But for me I always remember no it's it's the process that it helps me achieve things is not me I'm not better than the process nobody's better than the process Nobody's better than the inputs because when you ignore all the inputs you start seeing people fall up I'm not gonna name names but just think of anybody who rolls the gray heights all most 100% It's up it tells people what up they stop doing the things that got him there Sometimes it's the outside forces or who likes one events for food of most part is they stop doing the things they got them there So for example, maybe you're storing I grew up pouring the south side of Chicago, right and we were like super poor You know I guess why we lived on the south side you know what it's like and you know my mom didn't even have a car my dad was struggling and he was working in like super hard Like so he was working so hard. I barely saw him as a kid even though we lived in the same house When I was a real little kid like he was this is gone so much. He's working on building his business even though we struggled And you know mom didn't have a car she would wake me up at 5 a.m. and walk me to preschool and snow All right because we did have a car she had to go take the bus the work after she dropped me off and this is these are my memories right and then You know our group is Chicago public school system and I got a lot of trouble. I got set the way to military school And when it's time when I went to military school Maybe like a year or two after like mid-high school my dad's business started taking off and he started making money But this reminds you this is like buck and 16 years of work before I've 16 years of putting it in effort So much effort did he barely saw a son when he was a child Right remember it's finally started taking off this pre-inner in it and he started making a ton of money Bro we know a group or by time I graduated you ask him what dad was making three million dollars a year Adjusted for inflation that it'd be eight million dollars in today's money. It was like a hockey stick. It was almost nothing For fucking 60 years and then boom blasts Blanched off so I'm in college. I didn't experience any to wealth because I was a way military school So I did a really experienced what it was like to be rich But I knew he did it and I thought it was super dope. You know what dad really gets into gambling He starts in doge and right and in the fruits of his labor he starts you know In doge and advice is gambling staying out late, you know doing a bunch of you know Stuff that he wasn't doing before on the way up there right by the time I graduated for high school He had lost all the money. It was like I missed it like we were rich for a minute and I missed it Because I was a military school of college but I'm gonna graduate college. He was broke again He lost all the money and then he blew his brains out shut himself and hit it What happened? He stopped doing the things that got him there. He started indulging in the fruits of his labor He dodged too much right and that's the cautionary till and I Imagine I would imagine when you see these guys reach big heights and then they fall off Think it's a lot of the same shit, man. A lot of the same shit people started indulging right nobody's better than a process And that brings me to my next and final tip you don't do it for the money. Don't do it for the reward Anything you try to accomplish don't do it just for the reward because if you only do it for the reward You'll stop once you get the reward. I've been a trainer for over 25 years I've seen people get a shape and they stopped on what they did to get his shape and then they get fat again They couldn't live with their failure. We're that lead right back to me and I got a train them again Man, I got to help this motherfuckin get back and say and we do to shred over it over again because they're only doing it for the reward Yeah, you want the rewards you want the money. I'm a big fan of currency I really like that position of of currency I like that I can exchange if a good thing services, you know, just don't however It's not about the money. It's about what kind of man I can be right it's about building myself up I would you think about this on the multi-millionaire millionaires graph followers million users subscribers about half a million ticks Stock followers multi-millionaire six two single-digit body fat living them down time my aim if you were in that position Would you go to sleep at 930 in the night like I? To wake up at 430 and work all day because you want the gold you want the accolades You want the girls or you what the cars at a vice and stuff that stuff is cool I want to be the best version of myself. I'm trying to see how proud I can make myself I'm trying to see what kind of man I've become and then the money the results and all this stuff is just a result It's just it's just a by-product You get them saying if you because if you if you make it more about who you can become and have to see now How fucking bad ass you'll be out tough you can be then that journey never ends now you're playing an infinite game Which is better because sometimes people like man whizzing enough when you're gonna win it's gonna be enough I don't there is no another is no in game I'll never be as good as I want to be right? I want to be the best I can be I don't know what that is yet When is enough money? It's not about money. So the game of success is not Mario where does the in game you beat the balls and then you Futter retire none of the game is Minecraft you want to keep building your world and keep making it better And if you think about it like that then you'll never fall off and you'll world a keep getting better and It one day people will look back and you know that you would be like that man my grandfather really fucking set us up For generational wealth you do have seen I have another video There will help you adopt his mindset more go watch that video right now
