I used to be a broke ass M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M I've made tens of millions of dollars over the last decade or so And in this video, I'm gonna show you the things you need to stop doing If you wanna get rich too, if you wanna start making money If you wanna get successful Because everyone always asks me, What did you do to get success? What did you do to get money? What did you do to get in great shape? What did you do to get a girlfriend with big ass titties and a fat ass? There are things I do, but with some more important things I don't do Things you wanna take away that will actually add to your success In this video, I'm gonna show you what you need to stop doing So you can be successful Finally, take your foot off the goddamn break And start speeding down the highway of success You need to watch this whole video because the last one is one of the most important ones Without this one, hell you're as eminent And if you can't watch this whole video, then maybe one of the things you need to stop doing It's being a b*** Maybe that's why you pour surfing around the internet Looking for f*** videos on how to get rich Luckily you found a good one and if you taste some goddamn notes Listen to what a real mother f*** is saying You can come up here, man, on the mountain of success With us The first thing you need to do If you wanna be successful, this is critical Is you need to stop chasing holes It sounds like I'm joking But I'm dead serious Instead of chasing holes, you need to Chase victory 50 cents Want to sit on his album The Massacre On a track called Ride a Music And it's exactly 2 minutes and 30 seconds 50 cents You hustling backwards if you chase in a bitch Stupid chased the money they come with the shit True words have never been spoke Fielcher Want to sit Perk is said Mali perk is said Perk is said Mali perk is said Chase a check Never chase a bitch You motherf***ing be listening And my favorite quote along this line Comes from American rapper, designer And full time crazy person Kindly a Wes I don't know what's better Getting late or getting paid I just know that when I'm getting one The others getting away Think about it How much time you spend chasing these holes Trying to riz up bitches But if you just listen to 50 chase the paper They come with the shit I'm 42 and I know a lot of guys who are grew up with Who are not successful? These motherf***s are still broke And the number one culprit is because they spend too much time chasing bitches Going to the club chasing bitches Fying bottles Spin a money on fucking trinkets and Jewelry and shit to impress bitches It'll have nothing to show for But a bunch of funny stories Some illegitimate children Probably a few of them got some STDs But here's the thing If you get the money you can get mad bitches What how do you even try it? Check this out It's very important The main thing to help you get women is Looks money and status That's the the trifecta We're gonna put this in like three levels like level one like the top one percent of motherf***ers These are people who have maxed out either all or one of these right someone like Elon Musk He probably had a maxed out looks right but he's maxed out money right. He's the richest motherf***er Around just what he got a lot of baby mama's man every time what's on around He got a new baby mama or you can max out status This would be like famous people and be but but with with fame usually comes money as well right looks is like the least important one for men For women is the most important one but for us man you can go out here looks maxing if you want I'd rather you be out here money maxing do the best you can when it would all of them right I'm gonna put these in three categories the motherf***ing guys at the top of this graph and his guys in the middle it is graph These are average motherf***ers This average guys your your daddy was probably one of them you probably come up from a long line at ease my fucks And then there's people who are below average and looks money in status these are scrubs and I don't know about you man, but I don't want no scrubs sitting in the passenger side of his best friends right These are the categories you can be in right obviously they're gradients in this this is the divider divided by people who chase hose you Chase hose or hose Chase you now listen if you are a scrub you get no hose You just don't get no hoes not a one you got only fancy description Yes, well you spend your your money right no hoes chase you Hose on even notice you I hear whole say shit about my amnes like man in my amy nobody has jobs everybody just seems like they don't work I'm like That means you as didn't even notice though fucking waiter And this restaurant you didn't notice the bus boy you didn't notice the person working security in the building you living You don't even notice these motherf***er. They're not even people to you and that's what life is like when you are when you Scrup I know say you average if you average then you have average girls flaking on you flaking on you giving you the running round for your ass in the friend zone now if you average though big Slash Ugly hose once you big slash ugly hose once you let's say you went you get to this one percent right We're gonna show you to how to get to that to that top percent later in this video if you can manage to get here You reject more women than you chase some of y'all can't fathom that and then y'all man the knives and tens Who actually want you don't throw eights in there, man? It's a good number eight now the tens one you make sense of just get here Instead of chasing holes get here you and all that looks max in his shit like you can do it It's not as important for me. It's helpful for sure getting good shape Learn to groom yourself when I was young like you on 42 I grew up in the 90s I'm a South-Soch Kaga we was survive max We were survive max in man, but you focus on the money if you fly here money max And you'll be straight man looks max if you want get the status right, but that's the main The main thing right, but how do you get your fucking money up? You already stopped chasing holes you got to stop freestyling your days and you have to plan every hour of every day in your calendar Let me show you what a fucking baller's calendar look like I'm a bring my gun So check this out this is my calendar. I plan out every hour of every day in my calendar Right boom even from the time I go to sleep to wake up a whole fucking day is quarry grad This is even weekdays Sundays every day is quarry grad even today right you see there's no white space I plan to shit out this quarry grad I have my mean I got shit I need to do I trade every morning You know then I get my workout boom sales team meeting then you're spent some quality time on my girl Then I did a counting right now prep for the podcast then I did another workout Then I worked on some content then I did my meditation It's mother shit now I'm doing a pocket right and then even when I'm ago to sleep is on there You have to choreograph your day Bruce Lee said if you love life don't waste time because time is what life is made of if you are Not choreographing your day you're wasting so much time when I was broke It was right after my father killed himself and it was during the recession I couldn't get a real good job because it was the great recession of a way and record unemployment It was super bad and I just started working 80 hours a week I was personal training. I was working security. I was we get manager at a restaurant and I worked for a moving company all day every day Because I plan my schedule I still slept at my eight hours a night I still follow my diet and I still worked out because you can plan it you can choreograph your day I still work over 80 hours a week and I still have a great relationship with my girl I still got tons of amazing friends I still have an amazing relation with my son shit is dope because I plan my day To this for one week plan out every hour of every day Actually live out your calendar. I promise you you will get more shit done in that week than any other weekend in your life You guys out here freestyling a day is wonder and why you don't get shit done? Because you're not taking advantage of your most important resource time time is your number one resource And if you can finally take advantage of it you will start running circles around the people you surround yourself with people will stand in all Of how much you accomplish if you can do this for like 90 day If you did this for 90 days your whole life a change if you did it for a year People will fucking wonder what did you do to accomplish so much this year or palms you owe to this is my number one tip If I can never talk to the world again and I had to leave one piece of advice to help you be successful It would be this plan out every hour of every day in calendar watch your whole fucking life change if you're trying to you rid of any bad habits You don't have to do anything to you rid of the bad habits just feel your calendar up with this shit It's gonna help you conquer go look in my calendar when is their time to fucking gloom and play video game It's smoke fucking weed and get drunk Where where where when am I gonna do it? I guess I can squeeze in a goon here or there right? But like You have a whole fucking day full of victory and a whole week of victory the next thing you need to do quit doing is hanging out with mother fucking losers Losers will fuck you shit up you will become like the people you're around I know you heard all that shit, but there's studies to prove it I'm gonna show you here's the study that was done the researchers concluded that the more poor people have rich friends The more likely they are to become rich and they also said in the study the most important thing It when it comes to getting rich is having rich friends Economic mobility means moving across the economical hierarchy and they have a part two of the same study too Read at your own leisure Fucking nerds and it's called social capital part two So you can repart one or you can repart two why do you think having rich friends will help you become rich? I have a lot of rich friends all in ass friends and one of the things is that we pick up each other's habits because you will become like a people You're around this is the reason why people from different regions or different lands They sound they sound the same when you're in this the same region right? They dress the same little bit they use the same similar vernacular They weren't born with the shit. It's not an interdNA they involuntary really picked it up from people to around There's why they dress the same they have same habits a lot of time have the same religion You weren't born with the shit learning from people around you will become like the people around so if you're around People who are rich they probably have some habits that helped him get rich and you will naturally adopt their habits Don't believe you'll naturally adopt other people's habits check this out. There's another study This is about weight loss, but it shows that if you have a friend who's obese if one of your friends gets fat as fuck You have a 45% chance of becoming obese. This was a study published in the Wingland Journal of Medicine This I don't have to tell you guys about the New England Journal of Medicine I know you guys are avid readers, right? So I might be preaching so the choir a little bit right but the study also goes on this thing if a friend of a friend a third mother fuck But the fuck you don't even know if he gets fat you have a 20% chance of getting fat They took it a step further if a friend of a friend of a friend this person is three people removed from you You don't even know this other motherfucker and he this fat motherfucker if he gets fat You still have a 10% chance of getting fat and you don't believe you should read the fucking study Read the study, you know, I know you guys are always in the New England Journal of Medicine Right, so you probably already there right You become like the people you're around you become like the people the people you're around are around It's fucking deep so you really have to cure ages circle and if you around losers You gon start losing losing his contagious another study is from the Pew research center And this is divorcees contagious listen if one of your friends gets divorce you got a 75% chance of divorce in your bitch the voice is contagious, man your friends wife A second dick right he divorce her now you got a 75% chance of getting divorce because your friends wifeing second his dick right if you hang out with losers You will start losing but you hang out with winners you'll start winning more and here's another study saying the motions are contagious, right? If your friends are happy in the joint life you'll be more you'll be happier as well So 20 year study man you gotta kick the loses out your life. I'm not saying if one of your friends need help You don't help them like I'll help one of my friends for sure if my fuck's got bad habits and he's doing fucking bullshit You might have to disassociate yourself with them everyone knows this shit You all you become like the five people you're around right you motherfuckers don't take the shit into account with the women you date Yeah, I hit a nerve with some of you some of you motherfuckin women you're networking is your network But you'll stick get dick in anything and I get it when I was younger man I can't what kind of habit she had if the ass was fat enough I went through this shit so you don't have to man where you can't be out your stick and get dick and crazy a lot of you guys I've had this experience you get life is going great and then you start dating some chick and her life is a fucking chaos And then all this chaos comes in and you're like these are your problems now you like actually getting involved with her Right she don't get along with her mom. She always got beef with her friends, right? All these problems infiltrate your life and it's like a storm in a wave of negativity and the next you know shit in your life Starts going wrong as well. It's just taste this shit happens all the time A lot of y'all have been through it. There's a lot of women who are really beautiful But also really crazy so you got to really think about the kind of woman you're gonna bring in your life and your friends Me because if they got a bunch of fucking wild wacky shit going in their life You want to you want to keep your distance. It's kind of like when your friends get some new car You start seeing that new car everywhere don't you motherfuck that car you not a X man You didn't attract that shit you not professor it Xavier the fucking car was always there You just didn't see it but then when it brought to you. You start seeing it all the time Okay, so if that could happen with a car what the fuck do you think it happened? It's somebody has all these fucking problems and they fucking Bring up their problems all the time. What are you so gonna start seeing your life just like you started seeing the car everywhere You go you won't start seeing problems everywhere you go got stay away from losers, man And then the next one you need to do is stop buying things that don't increase in value or at least hold their value Which you need to start doing is buying assets so I learned just a long time ago when I read rich dad poured it by Robert Kiyosaki his rich dad poured it Right, so he had his po-de-it right this nigga was broke That's po-de-it right then he had rich dad use out here stun All in the shit right he was a G. Po-de-it would work to get money and then spin his money on Bullshit where rich dad would work for money, but he's spin his money on assets right these are things that make made him more money You real estate stocks things that happen nature well they would say bullshit just I'm saying just shit You know because now the rich dad was spin his money on assets and he was used to money from the assets to buy his shit And this happened for years and years every time you get paid he would buy more assets and he would keep doing that shit and then he had just way more shit Wait more shit to the point where he was making more money from his assets than he was making from his work The rich dad just kept my shit shit goes away assets keep making money so the rich dad was able to stop working and he would still be able to get the shit Oh dad stop working He died if you watched me over the last 10 15 years on social media for the vast majority of it You know I was living in small crib and Queens We're in the Apple watch some Jordan's some Jordan Track pants every fucking day I was I wasn't no flexing no no fucking no fucking crazy lifestyle shit I was just working but I was making money I was a millionaire at that time I was making millions still But I wasn't spending money on bush I was investing in assets the assets started buying me APs rich of meals Cardi A bracelet pin house apartments so now it's like I'm set up man I got investments if I ever die unlikely but if I ever do my son is set up man He's like he'd be a millionaire day one my dad wasn't doing this. My dad died. I ain't Nothing but a bunch of fucking problems that I mean is a soft my dad was like pole dad He was just been his money on shit and he wasn't investing when she went south He lost his business killed himself So that's why you got to stop spending money on bush to start spending money on buying things that are going to increase in value or Or even better even make you money because if you want to get rich Make more money than you spend and invest the difference if you do that over long enough period of time You will get rich is really nothing else make more money than you spend and invest the difference if you do that over long enough period of time You will get rich if you would invest just $20,000 a month and something conservative like S&P 500 index fund as an annual return I average annual return of 10% a year $2000 a month every month for 20 years you'd have over a million dollars You'd have well over a million dollars in 20 years if you want more money or you want to make more money faster Then you got to invest more money and or invest it in a vehicle They can get you a higher return the three things you can invest in are stock market stocks or crypto Real estate and or your own business your own business is going to get you the highest return but it's the riskiest the higher to return The the larger the risk the S&P 500 very low risk, but you know The returns are only 10% a year those are levers you have to pull more money or Avian go to get you higher returns. You don't increase your lifestyle You stop spending money on bullshit that you could take that extra money Now you start investing and you want to think of every dollar as a sea that you can plant in the motherfucking soil and it's going grow and start bearing fruit You might see me flexing, but you it took me mad long to get enough assets of flex with my assets If you flex with money to come from assets you can do it all the time You'll never go broke doing that right because the money is the money keeps replenishing itself The assets I'm making money for you for start flexing with money that you spent working then you got to go work again for more money There's a difference the first thing I invested in was my online fitness business That was the first business I started and I was one of the first people doing online training We had them venit back then right because nobody was doing it. There was no books No courses nobody was doing it all of us who were doing it at that time We had to invent it. We would have pioneers. You know, I was able to build that into a All-time million dollar business now. I teach other people to start there. We're on my fitness business too. I got a free ebook called the 10 Commandments of online training We're actually doing a free class a free training while I showed you out of go your online fitness business Two first-learn description join it's on but free class and we're bringing them exactly out of go You're on my fitness business. I answer all your questions anything you guys need I'm gonna make sure you guys leave that session with a game plan on how to really make money is on my train The next thing you need to stop doing is you got a quick wedding And you have to learn how to be consistent any time somebody wants to start moving towards the path It's success and anything the hardest part is getting started pushing yourself to start getting some momentum Start getting some motion once you get some motion, and what you get started becomes easier However, well if I can't stay consistent they stop and then they have to restart again But when you restart again, that means you have to do the hardest part over again Or you have to do the most difficult part over again and you keep this charade up year after year You keep stopping it starting and you keep having to do the most difficult part over and over It would have been so much easier if you would have stayed consistent or one of the main reasons People aren't able to stay consistent because they're focused on the wrong things Let's say you have this goal go you want to accomplish I'm a draw trophy. I'm a really good artist watch I'm amazing. I'm good at a lot of things All right, so that's the trophy that represents the goal But you way the fuck over here away from your goal you made look at this shit and you'll be like sad and shit Oh, man, I'm so far away from my goal. Oh, never get that. Oh, and you start crying like a bitch You know, that's not even how you look in man. You ain't got them my brows got these eyebrows Yeah, you a bitch and you might start a little bit and then you'll look at the goal and you be like man I'll never get there and you quit or you feel like you're not making progress or not making progress fast enough So you quit however there are a lot of actions you need to take to accomplish this goal If you were just a focus on the actions and the steps you need to take every day You'd be a lot more focused as you'd be making progress as you when you focus on the right shit When you focus on the actions you get excited On the things you need to do every day to accomplish any goal to stuff you need to do every day and if you just focus on the actions You wouldn't even have to look at the goal because you know you were gonna do it for example If somebody wanted to lose 10 pounds of fat easy game Every pound of fat you want to lose you have to burn 3500 calories So if they track their calories every day How many calories they burned every day with some sort of fitness tracker and they tracked how many calories they consumed every day Well my fitness power something then all they had to do is make sure that they was burning 500 more calories in they could soon each day if they do that every day and if 500 calorie deficit over a week They'll burn 3500 calories which equals a pound of fat only thing they would have to do with they wanted to lose 10 pounds burn 500 extra calories every day and if they just focus on that every day They wouldn't even have to look at the goal. They wouldn't have to look at it all because we would know to this Personal is gonna accomplish this goal and it's like that would all your goals and that's not even just me talking Right there's a study. It was published in the journal of experimental Social psychology. I know you guys read that all the time Right, but it's show individuals who focus on the process of achieving their goals Were more likely to persist and succeed compared to those who focus only on the outcomes This is Brooke fucking science nerds. They proved it with studies If you need the fucking nerds then the studies right there. I put together something to help you accomplish that I call it the victory vision planner and it's free right where's the habit tracker and it's shows you Had to break down your goals into into different steps and the different habits that you could look at that Which is supposed to do every day you could track it off and all you had to do to see if you were making progress Instead of looking at the goal. Let's look at your habit tracker and you'll know if you're gonna Accombat your goals or not and when you start filling up your fucking habit tracker You checking things off every day that you know Will help you accomplish your goals and you're gonna be more motivated if you focus on the goddamn Process you'll be more motivated and you're more likely to persist and succeed But if you focus on the goal you're more likely to fail on quit because you're gonna get all said because you You ain't there yet once you know what you supposed to do every day. Oh, you gotta do it. Make today It's the next thing you need to stop doing stop letting your mind control you you have to learn how to control your mind In the best way I know to learn how to control your mind I could control your emotions as we meditation here's a study It was done to show that just eight weeks eight weeks of meditation It shrunk the amygdala of the volunteers right the amygdala is the part of your brain It makes you a mother fucking spaz that's the fear center of your brain the fighter flight shit And when you start panicking your body has a bunch of cortisol the stress hormone That's when you start doing dumb shit and acting like a bitch a mere eight weeks of my fullest Meditation actually shrunk step part of your brain. Do you think it's the part of your brain that makes you fucking panic? Was smaller you think it'd be easier for you to control your emotions? I know it would be but also there's another setting that shows that actually after a few weeks of meditation Participants increased the region of of gray matter in your brain and a part of the brain called the Neal cortex this is a part of your brain that's responsible for logic humans have a bigger Neal cortex than most animals and then that's the reason why we can do things like create languages and vent mathematics Make you two videos where other animals traditionally struggle in those endeavors you get more density in that part of your brain After meditation so check this out. We got studies to show that in mid-year the part of your brain This responsible for logic becomes more dense with meditation and studies to show the part of your brain It makes you a motherfucking emotional spares starts to shrink when meditation can you see a change in your brain and Ever got our main help you with success yo getting rich is stressful you're gonna encounter a lot of problems A lot of things a lot of turmoil if you out here panic and you're not thinking logically It's gonna impede you ability to succeed meditation is only where I know that really just calm down chill man I've been meditating every day twice a day of 15 years now. I think my focus treatment because it's then is rain in or the And traffic I'm like motherfucking it rains all the time is been doing this shit your whole life Who you ain't made peace with that yet? Oh you went traffic today like you expected your fucking you just have a fucking Unbroken boulevard of green lights and death if you if you spas an over little shit man How you go handle the picture? How you gonna run a fucking big company? Are you know how many problems you had to solve when you got a big Successful business. I got 30 employees. That means every time one of them has a problem Let's my problem. I got to help them solve it all right motherfuckers uncle die It's he just smoking cigarettes see die lung cancer. That's my problem. I ain't tell him smoke cigarettes But I got to help him solve that problem. I had a figure shit out all the time It's like having 30 children not my video editors y'all cool. I love y'all y'all the best I'm talking about the other ones You guys say every stay calm cool cool is it man, but you feel you are espazin acting emotional like a child or a woman It's gonna be difficult for you to become more successful meditation is the only way I know become more calm level headed steady steady is a rock and you don't need that to succeed otherwise if you can't control your mind Your mind's gonna control you probably what has been doing up and sit this point I ain't got motivation. I can't be disciplined because your mind is controlling you And you ain't you haven't learned how to control your mind and meditation will help you with that the last thing you need to do Which is one of the most important is you have to stop being negative and I don't mean you have to be positive I'm not telling you to be positive all the time I'm not telling you to do that. I'm just saying stop being negative. I'll give you example. It was his doing name bill Buckner He was the man here won all types of awards and baseball. He was the man and he his teams in the world series Right before the world series. He was an interview. He said y'all the dream that you want to have a great series and win the nightmare Is you gonna let the winning Run score on a ground ball through your legs those are the things that happen You know a lot of it is just fake guess what happened world series man. That should happen Row it's like is that should happen you got to stop being negative man I'm telling you you I'm not telling you to be positive just don't be negative and I'm like that with everything I don't I don't I don't I won't say anything negative for example I never say I can't afford it. I say y'all I got to find a way to afford it I won't say I'm thirsty. I say y'all got to get something to drink all those things are Different sides of the same coin for example saying I can't afford it. It's time like waving a white flag You know you can't get given up. Yeah. I can't afford it. Okay What did you say y'all? I got to find a way to get some more money one is like y'all I'll give it up the other one is like I'm gonna figure out a way to make it happen I promise you if you focus you will find the way but if you give up mentally you just give it up if you tire Oh man, I'm so tired What do you say y'all I got to get more energy you're gonna start looking for ways to get more energy and I'm not even telling you to be positive That's something I'm not saying be positive. I'm saying don't be negative Sometimes all that positive shit is like lying to yourself I'm gonna tell you to fucking lie to yourself. I'm just telling you not to be a bitch because think about who would you bet on same guy in the same circumstance he said man I just keep feeling man. I can't find a way to fucking make it make no money or Or this guy in the same circumstance. He says y'all I got to find a way to get some wins Which one of those guys you're gonna bet on that guy is you motherfucking it's because it's gonna change the way you approach things Your words have power man. I'm telling you your words have power everything starts changing around Would you gotta stay away from negative people too? So I don't let people around me say shit like that I remember everything's contagious right? It's not it's not just cuz I want to help them is cuz I don't want them to hurt me I don't want that fucking language to rub off on me. I learned English on accident right just from here another month I could say it. I don't want to learn that kind of English from this mother fucking bitch nigga English Real nigga the English is focused on what do you try to accomplish? Words are powerful you'll start seeing different shit, man Just like that example with the car when you owe one of your friends get a car you start seeing that car all the time But if you start saying man, I can't afford this shit. I ain't got no money You gonna start seeing more shit in your environment to actually confirm that But if you say I gotta find a way to get more money you go start seeing more opportunities You're gonna start seeing more paths. I'm telling you your words are powerful and never say anything about yourself You don't want to be true right because it's gonna change the way your brain looks at the world And if you want to know more about it if that I got another video that is show you more about how you Could actually change your brain to become successful. I go watch that video right now
