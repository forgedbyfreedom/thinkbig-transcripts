We got a new president. There's a new regime coming in and depending on what side of the Al-U-R-U-R either super excited about that or your super devastated or if you'd like me You'd like, hey, I was gonna find a way to win either way. I wasn't really trippin. However, the market has spoken So since Trump was elected the market has skyrocket just on the news of him getting elected. So let's check this out Since the election we're gonna ignore the Dodge coin shit, but you know, look at all the stocks that are up But what I wanted to focus on is S&P 500 is up the dollar is up Small caps stocks are up the bank stocks are up Bitcoin is is way up volatility index is down 27% the market has pretty much spoken and there's got to be a reason why the financial markets have responded So positively to a Trump victory, right? Because they think it's gonna be good for the economy And this is not some political shit. I don't give a fuck about no political shit I'm not a Democrat or a Republican I have our rest days blue states I'm in a green state green state of mind. I'm all about getting there money. All right, so how do we capitalize off this in 2025? One of my boys he posted something on Instagram now take this with a grain of salt because he's a hardcore Republican I totally give you a heads up You got about six months to get your shit together and four years the capitalized on the fact that you took the next six months to get your shit together You see just a week after the election crypto back on fire stop market back on fire The fans are gonna adjust the inter-trade because Trump's already beef him with Powell They're gonna get the mortgage market dial back in They're already talking about putting mandates on credit card interest limits cash is about to be Everywhere once again over taxes lower interest rates These are things that drive an economy yet got about six months to prepare yourself and your business for this and you'll be able to write it out for the next four The six years assuming four does a breakout in the meantime You need to capitalize on this unique opportunity because we may never get this again We fumbled it a little bit before we fumbled it from 2016 keep in mind. He's a hardcore Republican You could tell that by looking at but I believe that right and the one reason I believe that is because Like the financial markets have spoken like just him getting elected, right? So I really believe we're about to be in an economic boom now This may have some ramifications down the line that we might pay four years later I don't want to get to political but when interest rates get lower like that and it's all this cash everywhere The way he says but that doesn't help inflation Right, so you're gonna have to pay for that at some point the interest rates are gonna have to go back up at some point Right, but now we need to capitalize while we got a window now windows about to open up I believe this in my heart trunk will do whatever he can to keep the economy roaring while he's president It's nothing else for his ego It nothing else so he can say he did it he doesn't give a fuck what happens after he leaves So we got four years to make this happen and I want to talk about how we can capitalize on this all right Here's the strategy I'm gonna lay out for you now I really do believe we're gonna have a unique opportunity What he said we may not get it again. I do believe that because I don't think the decisions that are made are gonna be good long-term How does the country make money taxes right and if the taxes are super low for significant amount of time Plus interest rates are super low, so there's a lot of money and I mean If you don't get rich during these next four years These will be a lot more difficult with a huge after these four years, all right, but anyway, right So the first thing you need to do is Control spending I mean my first million during Obama administration right I was a millionaire But if you look at those old videos when it's time I was still living in the small crib and Queens with a cat running around And I wasn't out here flexing I was wearing an apple watch no shirt some brand Jordan Joggers that I wore every day every video, right I wasn't flexing even though I was a millionaire Why is that the way you get rich is to make more money that you spend in an invested difference? It's kind of like if you want it to build muscle you have to consume more calories And you burn you have to be in a clorex surplus right it's the same thing with money I'm what you think about it that kind of way right you need to make more money You spend so we need to put a cap on spinning the next four years is not the time for you just to be flexing hard Right it's not the time to buy the landbows because the interest rates I low is not the time to increase your your living expenses I don't want to advocate austerity but I want you to be very kind to the inches about your spending during these years right because if you can Make way more than you spend in invested difference especially if you're an invested during these four years I really believe you're going to get some amazing Returns that I'm going to be astronomical but if you spend the money on on bullshit man It's going to be difficult for you to succeed in those circumstances right so first and we need to do is we need to start tracking Spending you need to we need to track or spending right so if you watch my videos from like a decade ago I was talking about tracking every dollar I spend with mid dot com however Mid dot com said now so now we use monarch you want to use monarch to track every dollar you're spending both in your business In your personal life and try to cut out everything is unnecessary I'm necessary subscriptions any bullshit really try to just cut spin I'm not telling you start clipping coupons or Bragging about making your own coffee right when I talk about like legit austerity But we are talking about putting a cat on how much we're going to spin right now right now We want to do hardcore investing straight up if you don't need it don't buy it All right, we're not flexing we want to track spending as much as you want to make sure you do not increase Lifestyle. I don't care how much more money you make how much you bought do not increase your lifestyle Do that shit in five years so whatever Create you live and keep living in that shit do not raise living expenses When what they do that really fucks people up? They start making some money and they immediately start increasing their living expenses and because of that They never are able to have enough to invest you want to keep your living expenses cat Right, we do not increase our living expenses We want to increase our stock pile of fucking money and we put that money to work Because that's how you get rich make more money than you spend and invest the difference I'm gonna say that maybe a trillion times in this video and then the next step we need to do we need to have six months of savings So basically you want to have enough money that you can survive for six months because anything it happened Well, there's something happened last time Trump was in office. It shut down the fucking global economy for a little while Right the C 19 what is some shit like to have this again? This is gonna give you a different kind of confidence. It's like your safety net Imagine if you have to walk across a tight rope if you don't have a safety net You're probably gonna have more trepidation than if you know you're gonna be alright no matter what six months to savings Right stack that up when I say six months to savings I mean you have enough money to cover your living expenses for six months and you do that when you track it So track every dollar you spend every dollar you make the next thing you need to do You might not want to hear this, but you want to work more. This is one of the reasons I don't know why I I would go viral if I told you move because it's an easy quick way to get rich But I'm always talking about hey man work 80 hours a week You know, it's not easy to market that right but work more why do you need to work more because the more you sweat Don't piece the less you bleed during war. I really believe we're about to enter a booming economic time a Bull market the likes of which we may have not seen in a while We need to have enough money to invest in it right a lot of you my fuck is missed the last bull market Because you were broke you do not need to stop until you right you need to make sure you're getting as much money as possible Right, so you need to be working 80 hours a week now This is where people who want to get rich right don't leave a comment don't make a reaction video talking about Man, life's not about that life's about this or that or that listen if you have other priorities outside of getting rich Then I want you to focus on those and be happy, man I'm super excited for you. Right if you found another way to be happy or you have something else That you want to do outside of financial abundance then go pursue that go this video is not for you I don't know why you hear you don't need to leave a comment saying you don't know where they are You don't need to make some reaction video. This wasn't a vice for you. You got the shit figured out obviously Right, this is for people who want to get fucking rich You know how many of you are rich not a lie So if you want to do something that most people haven't done you have to do stuff that most people aren't doing or aren't willing to do and One of those things is work 80 hours a week if you do that you should be able to double your income right according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics The average of work in worse between 38 and 40 hours a week so if we double that you should double your income How can you do that? Well, we got to look at the time exercise there are 168 hours in every week if you sleep at hours a night Right that's 56 hours right so that's when I leave you with 112 hours left all right now if you work 112 But those hours you want to have 32 hours left that's still enough time to you know kick it with your family Do whatever you need to do have fun play grab and who gives a fuck do whatever you want and those other 32 hours but you got time you actually just have to allocate that time better Right I have videos of on how to structure your time in Google calendar and shit at that nature right is very important If you do that you should be able to make more money you should be able to make more money and then you can start investing That's very important work 80 hours a week or we need one to do is invest half Your income at least half you may be thinking man I can't live off half my income you can't live off half your current income because if you're like the average American You're working 34 hours a week right. I'm telling you to double that right you double the work You should be able to double the income right. I don't care what you do get a second job get a third job drive Uber's after work fucking do door-dash after work I don't give a fuck what you do man work 80 hours a week and invest the other half what do you invest in? We'll talk about that later in the video, but it best have I believe it's gonna be a period of time You're gonna look back at it right and you're gonna be you want it two things to happen Like damn and that was the time I really set up my family and myself for life or you're gonna look back and be like damn I really fumble that opportunity That's what happened after the last recession in O8 everything was on sale And I didn't have money because I was broke because my father killed herself the year before and I was working 80 hours a week during a recession Starting my business and I didn't invest when things started to recover when we entered like a decade long bull market I wasn't investing not in the markets these house investing my own business and that worked out well for me But I wish I would have money in the market's back then you think Tesla was cheap last year Imagine what it was in in 2008 2009 you think Apple was fucking was cheap last year Imagine what it was in 2008 imagine if I would have put money in the back then Some of y'all missed the last bull market. I don't know whether that happened and I know some of y'all Maybe weren't even fucking old enough to invest back then right so you probably looking at your parents And you should you look at them like damn Well fucking you just missed that whole ship. What was you doing? What was you doing you don't want to kiss look at you like that when we hit this one? All right and best half your income and again in order to do more you gonna have to planning your calendar Because you still gonna have to do other stuff you still gonna have to work out You're still gonna have to spend some time with your girlfriend wife children Right and it's okay you can do that. I'm not telling you in neglect anybody I'm telling you to plan your life more you don't sacrifice your children You don't sacrifice your family you don't sacrifice your spouse You don't sacrifice sleep. You don't sacrifice your health What you do sacrifice is the bullshit right you do sacrifice the video games You do sacrifice clubbing you do sacrifice Born hub oh f or whatever the bullshit job fucking spending time doing You sacrifice the bullshit in service of your goals right don't sacrifice your family or your health I'm not telling you not to do that. I'm telling you to sacrifice the bullshit right just imagine imagine A virgin himself that didn't waste time that didn't fuck around Right that maximize every hour of every day in service of their goals if you have been doing that for the last two years Where would you be right now? Probably be a lot better off? Let's do that for the next 365 days out problems your whole fucking life of change if you fucking Really plan after time and squeeze as much success out of each day as possible For the next 365 days this time next year you look back to be a different person people will be like damn He got lucky like not man. I got fucking busy. I got the work so we're gonna control our spin And we're gonna work more the reason we're doing that what you get rich is you make more money You spend and invest the difference over a long period of time. Let me show you something So if we pull up the trust the compound interest calculator, so let's say you you got you got two grand All right, boom. Let's say you said you start making more money you spend you able to put aside $2,000 a month All right, let's say you did that for 20 years because it's a meaker right and you've visited it in the S&P 500 which has an average annual return of 10% Most conservatives should you can do we calculate this shit right after 20 years you have almost $1.4 million $1,000 right at year 10 you'd have 30 you know close to 400 grand. I really think that these numbers are conservative because I think over the next four years I think we're gonna see some dramatic jumps I think it's gonna be way more than 10% I think we had the possibility the market is spoken the financial markets have told us what they think about a Trump Presidency I think we should just listen to them because that's where most of the money in the world is But let's say man you fucking win we're super hard. Let's just double this Whether it happens our managed returns it still a lot more money, man Now we get close to three million and then you close to a million in 10 years I still think these numbers are conservative especially this one the amount of compounds All right, this is just the S&P 500 average returns right what if you could do better than that and that leads us to the third thing we need to do is We need to develop skills because if you can develop skills you can might you might be able to make more money Not just in the markets, but you know it's a hundred things, right? So we need to figure out some sort of high-income skill specifically for business if you started business or even fewer employee Right, you know if you want to have a job for example my top sales guy last year, you know He made I think around $400,000 last year, right? But he's really good at sales. That's a high-income skill if you know how to work AI that can be a high-income skill Neymas a video editor for a famous handsome YouTuber. That's a high-income skill You film you you need to figure out things that help you get more money during this, right? Because not only do we want to work more we want to get paid because if you could have a high-income skill Then you could work more and get paid more for the time you work, right? If you don't have high-income skills and you've got to do like labor shit low-income skills drive Uber Door dash fucking baggage claim on that this and those people don't need difference between them It's someone who high-income skills the person with the highest come skill took the time to learn it Right, then that better people or worse people is just other people get paid more for their time because they have the leverage of skills Right, so you need to get that too so you can so when you're working more you can get paid more for the time you work But that doesn't mean work less like sometimes people like me One that just get a job to pay more work 40 hours because we want to maximize our earned your potential We're not trying to see what's the least we can do we're trying to fucking maximize our earned your potential So we could take advantage of this fucking bull run that I think America is about the experience for the next four years Lees I don't know what's going to happen at that you develop that high-income skill in some ways you can learn your high-income skills You could take classes go back to college Coursera they have class it's like online college organization, right? I'm taking a class on Coursera right now. It's that's my own pace like right now This is some shit on AI. I'm always learning you can buy courses from other people you can join Masterminds mentor ships wherever you need to do the acquired skills is okay Roll back in college. I don't know whatever you want to do next thing we need to do is Invest in learning like I took I'm taking courses right now. I'm part of different masterminds This year was the first year. I didn't spend over a hundred thousand dollars on my own education and all the reason I didn't do it this year It's because I was a speaker at a lot of different masterminds I'm a board Jeremy he has a mastermind pretty successful in one with a lot of height That were people and I speak at that right, but I'm able to actually attend this shit too up until like this year I've spent over like a hundred thousand dollars on my education But I spent a lot of money this year too. Like I still buy courses I read two books per week I've been doing that for 15 years like whatever you need to do and best in learning even if just books Even if it's just fresh in online it that's all you could afford and do with that then you invest the time the next thing you need to do is Learn how to invest in Market when I say markets. I mean the real estate market stock market the crypto market You need to learn how to invest in these things. You can't just throw money at the shit If you don't want to learn to sit then you need to just buy index fund S&B 500 the individual investor can be the market Right the reason that headphone investors can't be the market because they are the market The market is moved by institutional investors not retail investors like you and I right So they're like playing against themselves. That's why it's difficult for them to beat the market We can because we're not moving billions of dollars around right, but you really need to learn how to invest if you work more In control of spending remember how do you get rich? Big more money than you spend and invest the difference right again And you invest it in either your own business real estate or the stock market I'll go crypto when there to right seeing this is survival right now All right, but in order to have you got money in the best so when you work more in control You're spending then you have money to invest when you develop skills and you work more that combination Then you make more money and then when you control your spending and Develop skills now you're in control right you gain control of your own destiny right right now You're in control because you got skills right so now you can kind of set your own path Right and you controlling your spending you have more real control over your your outcomes And I really think that's the role map to get a rich in 2025 if you got some goals that you did you're setting I got a free goal and habit tracker right that I help you with that the link is in the description down low depth When that now it's you don't have to put your email in or anything It's just a notion template to help you plan out your goals and Track your habits to make sure you're on the right track and if you want to learn a high income skill During a recession after my father killed herself I was working all those jobs But they were like mostly like labor blue collar type jobs like moving company's and she's security You know personal training low level jobs right I developed a skill of online training I was one of the first people to do online training I was in that class people pioneered it and that's how I really started making way more money And I was able to start investing in that's how I got rich if you want to learn how you could start your online fitness business I got a free ebook called the tank a man with one line training right and it'll put you It'll start moving you down that path where you could learn about it Maybe it's a viable option for you.
