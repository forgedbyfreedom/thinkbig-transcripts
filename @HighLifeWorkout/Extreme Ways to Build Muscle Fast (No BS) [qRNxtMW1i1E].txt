So you ready to put on some muscle, put on some size, ready to stop looking like a punk. I'm gonna give you some tips, a string waist, the build muscle faster. And you have it thought possible. And I've been a personal trainer for over 26 years. I've trained thousands of people, but I'm saying you, it's not just some f*** I made up or some f*** did just work for me. This is f***ed this work for a lot of people that I've trained. Right, this is me from the field. It's not just some f*** I read in a book. If you can't watch a short video how to make muscle, you don't deserve to put on any mass. Let's get into it. Now, again, these are string ways. So if any of you are saying some f***ed this too much work, I don't want to do that as why you are f***ing people don't like you. Why the f*** did you click on the video and said, extreme ways to build muscle? And then say, oh, it's too extreme. Why are you here? The first extreme thing you need to do to build muscle faster is full body workouts. I know a lot of people will tell you to do splits, different bros splits. I've been doing full body workouts over in decade. I was natural and people were saying that I was on a roi, that was making videos about it, me being on a roi. But you got to understand, I'm doing full body workouts and you knocked. That's one of the reasons. Let's break this down. Let's say we got two bodybuilders. Bodybuilder A does full body workouts. He's a cheap bodybuilder B. He's doing a split routine. Maybe he's doing one body part a week or like chest day, back day, leg day, shoulder day, and then arm day. The bodybuilder A, who's doing the full body workout, let's say he's picking for his chest. Say he's picking two exercises and he's probably going to be two compound movements. So he's doing something like bench press or bench press and dips, whatever, four sets for his chest. Let's just say he's doing some modest like three full body workouts a week. Every session he's doing eight sets of chest. Right? Each week he's getting 24 sets of chest exercise. If we spread that out over a year or 24 sets, 52 weeks, that's going to have him at 1,000, 200, and 48 sets per year. All right, keep that number up. Let's say this fucking bodybuilder doing the bros split and he's doing chest once a week. He do more sets per exercise. So maybe he's doing, because he has a whole chest day. Maybe he's doing like a bunch of different exercises. Total of like 16 sets. Right? He's doing bench press and climb bench press, cable cross over. But it totals like 16 sets, because this is like a chest day. You're going to do that like once a week, because you don't want to kill the muscle, right? Once a week. Right? So he only gets 16 sets total per week. Bodybuilder A, who was doing the full body workout, he was getting 24 sets per week. Over the course of 52 weeks, he's only getting 16 sets per week. His total set was 832. But the guy was doing the full body workouts. He's getting more sets per fucking year. You're fucking fucking around and get more sets. If you're doing a full body workout, it's almost twice as much. Before steroids was invented, everybody builder did full body workouts. People didn't start doing splits until steroids weren't invented. Because after you live weights, something occurs called protein synthesis. Basically a fancy way of saying muscle building. Protein synthesis lasts for about 48 hours. So if you're doing chest day, you're missing out on five days of protein synthesis. Because it only lasts for 48 hours. That change when people started to do steroids. Why? Stairroids and a bi-stairroids extend the length of protein synthesis. So what they found out that protein synthesis lasts for way longer when you're on Royce. So it is like fucking, let's just crush the muscle, let's kill it. They can get more gains. But they're on Royce, so they're going to get more gains anyway. But before steroids were invented, all bodybuilders did full body workouts. So if you're in natural, it stands the reason you should do what natural was did before steroids were invented. And plus you just give more sets. If we just look at the math, you'll get more sets. You'll get more sets more frequently because, probably since this is last for 48 hours. So after 48 hours, you train the muscle after 48 hours. You do another full body workout boom. Now you're consistently in a muscle building stage. Each muscle was in a muscle building stage consistently. If you're doing splits, then you miss down a lot of potential muscle growth. But here's another part of it. When you do full body workouts, you should only do compound movements. These are big body movements. Because compound movements could on the muscle. Comparing a movement can be classified as a multi joint movement. Bensh press is of compound movement because you can see you're using this joint here and you're using the joint here. Oh, a multi joint movement. Where isolation movement, something like be a single joint movement. It'll be cable crossover because you're only moving here. Single joint movement, you only move in here. That's the isolation movement. It's a fact. It's not debatable. Compound movements are better for putting on size. It's not up for the bake. You're doing full body workouts. We're not doing isolation movements. Except for arms and calves, right? Because it's at the end of the chain, right? So it's like you can only do one joint hit by a seven and try to set. But for the most part, we're doing all compound movements. So not only are you getting more sets for a year, you're getting better sets when it comes to build a muscle because it's all compound movements. If you're doing chest day, you're not doing it all compound movements. You're going to be doing a bunch of isolation shit as well. And that's okay if you're on a roll. Full body workouts compound movements. If you have increased protein synthesis and you get more sets, this is one of the big reasons people thought I was on steroids for so long. Because they were doing splits. Everyone else is doing splits because they got it from muscle magazines and shit. But these muscle magazines were made by and forers, steroid users. So when you structure your full body workout, you should pick one or two compound movements, her body part, except for obviously, for arms and calves, right? So chest type of movements include barbell bench press, dumbbell bench press, incline, barbell press, incline dumbbell press, dips, push ups, just like that. But if you want to build the most muscle, you don't want to fuck with dumbbells. You want to fuck with barbells. Barbells will put on more muscle than dumbbells because this was called a closed chain movement. So when dumbbells, you can plug in the bars move independently. You can do whatever you want when you bench press in, right? For barbells, hands are stationed. They can't move independently. The chain is closed as well. It's called a closed chain movement. Close chain movements will put on more muscle. I would focus on barbells, barbell bench press, incline barbell bench press, dips is the closed chain movement as well. For back, you got dead lifts. That lifts actually work your whole posterior chain. They work your back, parsley legs. It's a good back as such. Pull ups, chin ups, bent over barbell rolls, T bar rolls and we can throw in cable rolls as well. CD cable rolls. Showers, you got overhead press. That's really the main one. Over here at press, I do handstand pushups, free standing and handstand pushups. But you ain't strong enough for that shit. Where I say you're just going to do overhead press legs. Of course we got squats, back squats, front squats. I really believe if you want to put on the most muscle, you should do back squats. But low bar backs squats. Low bar will work your posterior chain more effectively. Especially if you're an athlete, low bar backs squats will help you with your performance more more than high bar. Dead lifts work your legs as well. I'm not the biggest fan, right? But lunges, leg press. If you want to work the glutes, let's say you try to work that booty. Hip thrust is probably the best exercise for that. Romani and dead lifts, sumo dead lifts. For arms, actually, bent is okay. This is kind of a cheat go for arm. You can do chin ups. If you want to work it, get bicep more. Lock out. When you go to the bottom and the movement. And then pull up. If you want to work your back more, you don't lock out at the top of the movement, right? Because your bicep will come into work. So if I wanted to work my back more doing chin ups. What I do is I would move my thumbs around here. So my hands are like hooks and I would not fully extend my biceps. If I want to do chin ups in a way that it works, my biceps more. Like it's a combat move from my biceps. I want to wrap my thumb around and I want to fully extend at the bottom. And then come up. chin ups is good for that. Dips. Same kind of thing. If I want to work my triceps more, I won't lean forward as much. I'll make sure that I lock out at the top. So I really squeeze my triceps. You can see it squeeze. If I want to do dips and wanted to work my chest more, I would lean forward more. And I wouldn't lock out a super underrated tricep exercise. Is close grip bench press. You get a bench press with the barbell. Close grip and then push up. And make sure you extend your arms. Like out the work your triceps more. And you're going to pick one or two exercises three to four sets. And a new study came out that I read recently. That showed that resting three minutes between your sets. Put it on more muscle than resting one minute. I'm somebody who I always time my sets. I'll try to put on much muscle as possible. After the set, I hit the Siri button on my Apple Watch set three minutes time. Now, to save time, opposing muscle groups, you can superset them. I can't always superset. So you can do bench press followed by bent over rolls. Right? Back and chest are opposing muscle groups. If I would do close grip chin ups, locking out for biceps, and then close grip bench press. But I superset them. And then I rest three minutes. Right? That's it. That saves a little bit of time. And I say you do three or four full body workouts. For a week, I do full body workouts every day. And I just take rest days when life forces be too. I got too much to go on. Let's get into diet. Nothing works without diet. So here's what I think you should do. The build is much muscle as possible. You can take the bodyweight in pounds. Multiply that by 20. And that's how many calories you should get per day. If you're 200 pounds, that means you need 4,000 calories. So I'm people who might be saying, that's too much as a stream. I told your bitch ass, this was going to be extreme. I already told your goofy ass we're doing a stream shit. I'm assuming you'm not that already. Like if you're skinny fat, you need to cut first. And you want to get at least one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight. I know your favorite fitness influences is you don't need one gram. You can get to a point eight. Studies so the point eight is all you need. Yes. Studies do show the point eight is all you need. But those studies were done under perfect conditions by laboratory nerves. We don't live in a fucking laboratory. We live in a real world. Man, we in drink out of beakers and test tubes. Just shit or whatever they had them doing. And in the real world, the FDA allows food labels to be off by 20%. So you get something that says it has 10 grams of protein. It might be 12 grams. It might be eight. I read you did one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight. Because that will make up for any mislabelance. Because the FDA allows labels to be off by 20%. So we make up for it by making sure you get 20% more. And if you get too much protein, it's cool. There's no negative ramifications for too much protein. What about fats and carbohydrates? Don't care what you do. It doesn't have carbs or it doesn't have fatty. But you need to pick one. You got to do either high fat or high carbs. When you mix fat and carbs, that's when things start to go haywire. And your body has different hormonal responses to that. Oaf work. Most important thing is calories and protein. I like low carbs. I bolt on keto with the same formula. It's worked out great. But people do high carbs and low fat. Most bodybuilders do low fat and high carbs. And there might be an advantage today because you get a higher insulin response and insulin is anobotting. So there might be an advantage today. I do keto for reasons outside of body composition. We have to talk about sleep. You want to get 8 to 9 hours of sleep overnight. If you naturally make it to such wrong and you're asleep, it would out sleep you won't grow. 8 to 9 hours of sleep and you want to get these series about it. Don't fuck around. 9 hours is probably what it's just true for to put on as much muscle as possible. Now let's get to the supplements. This is for natural. We're not going so extreme. We could get crazier. But we're not going to keep it natural. I think you should start taking high dose creatin. So you only need 5 grams of creatin to put on muscle. So all you need. However, high dose creatin has other benefits. If you take high dose it actually helps you with your brain function out. But it can help with depression. It can help with cognitive functions and it can really improve mood. I think 10 grams of creatin every day. I've been doing that for like 20 years. Everybody's taking creatin. Creatin is safe, effective. All ages. One of my friends Ben Bikowski. He was a pro bodybuilder. He never limits a little bit of it. But he placed it in the cage. He did well. He didn't get embarrassed. He did a good job. When my son was about to be born, Ben already has some kids and I was solving them. I was just joking. I said, so how soon should I put him on creatin? He said, they want it. They want it. Everyone wants to take creatin. Even if you don't work out. Another supplement that I find super help is Seattle. It's tons of studies to show that Seattle is actually helps build muscle. Because it's a vessel dilator. Meaning it increases a lot of flow. So it helps you get a bigger pump. If you put all of us together, man, do it for 90 days. I promise you you'll put on more muscle than you have in your whole life. And listen, let's say you already got a good amount of muscle.
