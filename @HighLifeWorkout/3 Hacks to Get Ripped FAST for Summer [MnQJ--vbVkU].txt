I will break down three best ways to get ripped this summer How ripped you get would depend on how fat you are right now? Right if you were a big whale M- you may not get ripped by summer, but you can definitely lose a ton of weight between now and some And that's gonna be great for you, but if you are just like a little fat 10-20 pounds of fat and you want to get Ready this is the best video you're ever gonna watch on a subject if you follow these steps I promise you you will get ripped this summer and the last one is the most important one Make sure you watch this video if you can watch a video about getting ripped and you you are destined to just be a fat boy Indefinitely and so you'll get worse as you get older and order you're gonna get fat or a fatter And then you have to find another big fat motherf*** mate with you then you're gonna have kids with each other and they gonna have childhood or be city Kids gonna make fun of them because they fat then parent teacher conference You and your fat ass wife gonna show up there and the kids gonna get made fun of because they got fat parents Man don't let that happen to you. I go to my son school kids want to touch my muscles and I say no I'm not Drake the first thing we need to do is you have to do the one thing that most people want to I hear My god, I've been trying to lose weight. I've been trying to get in shape nothing works I've tried everything no nigga you ain't did the one thing that will work You have to start tracking your calories. You have to track your calories in your macros this You're a work. I don't care if you're fucking paleo Vegan carnivore whatever is still calories in calories out the loose fat you have to burn more calories in you consume We need to track how many calories you're consuming now I'm sure you exactly how to do that but first I want to show you this study. It was done by a two-cune diversity and what they did was They had a bunch of fat boys track their calories for three months They didn't give them no diet. They didn't tell them to do my fucking snake diet kid All die nothing. They didn't even tell them to be in chlorodepsy. They gave them zero plan no instructions to say hey badass Just fucking track what you eat instead of putting everything in your mouth like a whore What you've been doing your whole life at boy guess what after three months on average? They lost five pounds, right? Some lost more of said But on average was about five pounds now five pounds for three months if that was one of my clients I'd be disgusted with them or like motherfuck you ain't even trying because it doesn't sound that impressive until you remember They did not give them any fucking instructions. They had no plan all they had to do was track their calories If you want to improve at anything all you have to do is start tracking and what happens is people will become more mindful of what they eat And they start to actually see how many calories there in each day by girlfriend You started tracking their calories and she couldn't believe how many calories she was getting each day I've seen this with tons of clients. They have no idea how many calories they're getting each day They think they're eating healthy. Oh, you'd healthy. Oh, you'd good. I eat this And then when we start actually tracking they're eating way more calories than anything they are You have to start tracking for every pound of fat you want to lose you have to burn 3500 calories. Let's put that in perspective if you were to burn an extra 500 calories per day or seven days or week into the seven days that's gonna equal 3500 you can lose a pound of fat a week And you can take that up right if you put yourself in a thousand calorie deficit every day Which is not extreme your burn two pounds right two pounds of fat per week is like normal Totally fine is normal right you have to burn seven thousand calories in order to do that if you're not tracking You have no idea what you're doing so we need to start tracking both the calories We can soon and we want to get an estimate of how many calories in a burning the way we get the estimate of how many calories Reburned is we have to wear we wear some sort of fitness tracker. I used the ordering the track Like how many calories I burn is they my total calorie expenditure per day You could also do it with apple watch it bit They're fine devices right now and not 100% accurate But it will give us a good estimate and then when you start tracking it what you want to do is You want to start tracking your calories and what I do is I use a spreadsheet Okay, so how many calories should you get each that take your body weight in pounds? Multiply that by 10 that's it's aggressive But that's how many calories should you get don't go over that so let's say you wait 200 pounds Oh, you trying to get ripped. Oh, all right, so we're gonna get 2,000 Pounds per day 2,000 pounds per day. No, that's prop That's that's probably enough to get you in the deficit right there But we're gonna take it up and not just later when I give you some more tips now how many calories you gonna burn It would not we're not even gonna get to crazy aggressive right we're gonna say 3,000 Which is not like insane you know let's say let's say less let's say you were lazy My fuck you right and you can if you have an apple watch This this data was showing your health app if you have the womb is gonna show up in the womb But I just total calories per day not just calories where you working out. This is very important Total calories you gotta wear it 24 hours a day. I never take my ring off I wear when I'm working out I wear it and we're in a gym I wear it and playing I wear when I'm having sex So it's always on we run a 500 calorie deficit each day right boom 35 hundred calories We should lose a pound of fat per week with that now you can alter this I change in the variables All right, we're gonna talk about how you can burn more calories per day later on in this But this is the baseline and the point thing is you track it, right? So I have a spreadsheet like this It's called the victory vision planted the link is in description or you can plant like all your goals And there's a habit tracking there and in the habit tracker section is a place where you can put your calories that you burn each day That's step one tracking your calories each day then two is we go and increase the cardio before I get into the Options the cardio is it's important you want to stand day cardio alone is not enough The diet is more important than the cardio. I've helped people lose weight without doing any cardio We just kept their calories low enough. However you're trying to get as ripped as possible by summer So we're gonna actually increase the cardio and make sure this happens right now you have some options If you don't have a lot of time you can do what's called high intensity interval training or hit cardio You do sure workouts 15 20 minutes Maybe even less their interval so you go you go you go you go super hard for for 30 seconds to a minute Rest for 30 seconds to a minute not rest but then you go you light work for 30 seconds of a minute if you want to know some good Options on hit cardio workouts you check my YouTube just so brand-acarter hit cardio right matter fact you should try this I challenge all of you guys to do this so this is this is this one right here This is a four minute workout, but it's so difficult is me and whiteboard brown We did this week that year we got this week we came up this workout because we both trainers and this someone's But look at look at look what we're doing by the end look at his body in Is it over we're fucking dying I can probably do it now because I'm more Train but this is so difficult this the most difficult exercise workout I've ever seen Try that when if you only got four minutes or you I have other 15 minute workouts 25 minute workouts Tons of them and they are like millions of views people love the beauty of hit cardio is even though it's a short duration of Training you start burning more calories after it because your heart rate is elevated So you burn calories even after the workout now I stop doing this as much because now I'm old I was 32 when I made that video right now I'm 42 and the joint's ain't the same Father the time is undefeated so now I do slow cardio so what I do is I just get on I like to Lip the cool machine the exercise bike I have several of those in house or or just walking But the cool thing about slower cardio is I can do it for longer and I can do other Shit while I'm doing it so I have a few desk bikes in the crib so it was a bike with a desk attack Stood I can work while I'm at the desk bike or die While I'm on the die I could actually be doing like slow cardio while I'm working so I can do other if you doing a hit cardio You're only doing a cardio that's where the trade-off is the reason I like slow cardio Because I can do it throughout the day and I can do it for long periods of time and I can burn more calories throughout the days You want to make sure you're burning more total calories without the day not just when you're working out or not when you're in the gym The reason why you want to do something called not exercise activity thermogenesis But when I'm cutting I'm always looking for additional ways to burn more calories without the death Whether it's walking more taking the stairs instead of the elevator if you're parking somewhere Get a parking spot this far get some extra steps in go before walk with your kids you can walk your dog You can walk your girlfriend you just always want to look for more ways to burn calories without the day the death bike is a cheat code for me Because I have a death bike I'm able to burn when I'm really focused on cutting I burn between 354,000 calories total per day That's because it's like hours of slowly pedaling right while I'm working while I'm doing other shit Especially if you sit down on day this is very important is something that will help you if you don't want to do any that just walk Go for walks go for a 30 minute hour walks a few times a day walking is great exercise Because you burn more calories, but it also you also will retain more muscle because You're not burning off glycogen in that really working the muscles a lot, right? So you want to aim for every day at least 20 k steps if you're serious about getting really rid Right you probably won't need to do additional cardio throughout that you can but 20 k steps per day It's fantastic now let let let's put that into the stop being a fat ass Let's say we're burning like way more calories Let's say we step in this up right we burn extra thousand calories based off what I just told you before Which is not unreasonable it's not crazy but the key to burning this many calories is not trying to do it all in one session You want to use not exercise activity thermogenesis mean you want to burn these calories throughout the day So what you're doing in other shit just think everything you're doing thing how can I burn more calories in one Is you play with your kids get active with them start running around with the kids I'm just sitting down on the bench like the fat dead If you would you grow for you do some shit we all got to walk and we're taking a two-anemusement park Take it to a museum where you all got to walk around right don't just go to the movies at the dinner Go somewhere where you have to be active right and see if you all have a sex man don't let her get on top You can do it cardio in her vagina You're not gonna burn enough to really take it to to to that level in one cardio session for example the average person only burns 100 calories if they run a mile right a hundred calories is nothing mess like a banana Handful and the a handful of nuts is more than hundred calories You gotta get tons of cardio throughout the day and only way to do that is to bake it into your lifestyle So you're burning more calories all day long now look at this. It's got burns the extra thousand calories Oh and extra thousand calories the top of the knees are already doing now He's burning that's like it's like three pounds of fat right as per week It's not crazy that step three is you want to keep as much muscle as possible right you don't want to lose muscle where you're doing this there's a few things you need to do to make sure you retain as much muscle as possible Number one you have to lift heavy honestly when I when I'm cutting I might take my reps down to like six or eight And I live heavy right so it should be impossible for me to do more than eight and that's gonna encourage you by Be to retain more muscle because you're showing it that it needs it is you're using it It's kind of contrary to a lot of advice you'll hear if this is your first year working out You will be able to build muscle during the cut but only if it's your first year working out after that If you've been training for more than a year like for real this is not muscle build in time All right, I have a whole another video on how to build muscle and burn fat Some things lean watch that video for more insight, but if you've been training for longer than a year You're not gonna build muscle this time. It's okay. We're not trying to build muscle right now We're trying to retain as much as possible Everybody loses some muscle on a cut. We want to just mitigate that as much as possible Fair first thing we have to live heavy the next thing we need to do is work as Difficult going to get one gram of protein per pound of body weight. I know that you know There's lots of studies saying that you don't need that much protein You only need about set 0.7 or 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight I believe all this if I'm not trying to say that's not real And I am saying is that those studies were done by fucking scientists and they were done in Perfect conditions. They had to add the conditions perfect for it to be accurate no matter how Accurally you're tracking it won't be as 100% accurate for us because the FDA allows food labels to be off by 20% in any directions So if you're eating some indices 10 grams of protein because of the at the A allows labels to be 20% wrong It might only be a grams of protein might be 12. You don't know. So we want to air on the side of caution to make up for the Potential 20% that the labels may be wrong. I'd rather you have more protein you need than not enough because if you don't get enough You will lose more muscle you don't live in the same laboratory conditions that those studies were made in We live in the fucking real world not a fucking lab, all right, so we want to live heavy one gram protein Per pound of body weight if you do that you should be able to retain a Significant amount of muscle and you're going to get ripped you're going to rip this head that's going to be more difficult than you normal Because you gotta keep your calories so low, so you're going to be eating high protein I like to do the ketogenic diet. You don't have to do keto, but one of the reasons we might find keto effective here is because There's three macro nutrients carbohydrates protein and fat we got to keep the protein high in order to keep the Calories low we have to either cut the fat or the carbohydrates or a combination of them the reason You might want to consider cutting the carbohydrates some people cut the fat whatever problem with cutting the fat is It makes the food gross, right imagine you in a potato you can't put butter on it Or you got to eat pasta with no sauce fucking gross the flavor comes from the fat is this might be personal thing It tastes better also fat is more satiated Meaning you will be less hungry if you consume more fat however Carbs actually spike the hunger hormone Gralent and leptin, right? So they are addictive specially simple carbohydrates like sugars every studies that show it sugar can be as addictive as Certain class they narcotics you could eat the carbs, but now you got a fight cravings if you're Fat is high and you're protein is high It's known to low hunger and the studies that show that people who follow the ketogenic diet It actually blunts hunger. You can do it every one. It's just a suggestion You don't need carbohydrates to live you do need fat and protein live. There's a central amino acids which are protein Essential fatty acids which are fats is no such thing as a central carbohydrate. It's not a thing I still eat vegetables like green leafy vegetables In each kale broccoli should of that nature and that way I still get the fiber as well All right, so now I'm getting fiber which is also filling and I'm getting fat which is filling is just a suggestion All right, you can do it every one. I've seen people get ripped in tons of carbohydrates and keeping the fat low You got to cut one of them. Here's the bonus tip no cheap meals during this time I'm not saying this because the cheat meals will negatively affect your process your your progress It's what you do with visually the count so if you fall off once it's not a big deal It is a big deal because it might not be just once after a cheat meal We've all had this have you noticed that you crave the foods that you cheated with the next day because You probably cheated with the shit you love the most the most tasty foods Right, and it spikes dopamine and now your body wants it the next day however If you were just stayed a path you did use it and all those cravings go away I noticed this when I had my last cheat meal in 2023 I just noticed for the like almost a week after that I was fighting cravings and I had to use discipline not to cheat again But after a while those those cravings went away I don't need discipline to stick to my diet anymore It's just because apps than this is easier than moderation this actually goes for anything you're trying to which staying from Apps than this is easier than moderation So if you just fully abstain from it after a while you the cravings go away I'm telling you this makes it so much easier I used to be a big proponent of cheat meals. I used to do a big cheat meal every week I've had epic ones I've had videos about it This is a new thing I discovered when I quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey lost a craving But drinking alcohol like 10 years ago cold turkey I had no cravings I can be around people they're drinking But you have to get there if I was had drinking every once a while, I would still have the cravings You also had to remember the contrast you never you never go somewhere as real hot and then you go into the air condition And then it's like fucking cold and you can use to the coldness of the air condition in this normal Then you go back outside it's like it's almost hotter And if you would stay in the heat you would acclimate it to it and it'd be okay, but the contrast made it seem worse That's what happens when you have a cheat meal you eat this delicious food that you go back to the shit you were eating before to get rich It's gonna be worse for you if it was with anything If you get fucking drunk you're trying to quit drinking you get fucking drunk one night and you have to go out I'm not gonna drink again. It's gonna seem less fun than when you were drinking because of the contrast You trick your brain into not liking it anymore It was like I'm going to a heat game tonight. I'm a sick Court side what do you think is gonna be like if I have to It's the next game I go to I'm in the fucking stands But if I was in the stands before or that I go to the fucking Court side is gonna be better right the master problem with cheat days It makes it more difficult for you to stay consistent.
