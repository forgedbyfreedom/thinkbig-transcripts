It's Min's mental health mass and this is a topic that really means a lot to me because letting a number of father took his own life when I was in my early 20s and also I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2. Unfortunately I'm really familiar with the challenges that are associated with mental health and depression. I wanted to take some time to actually give you guys advice on some things you can do to improve your mental health or give you some tools that you can utilize if you find yourself in the middle of any mental health challenges. These are things that have helped me get out of depression, multiple times in a dorm my life and things that I've seen help a lot of other men deal with their depression and actually get out of it. So the first one is exercise and getting them great shape. First of all exercise causes your body to release endorphins. These are feel good neurotransmitters that your body releases during exercise that actually cause you to feel better. They change your mental state because the emotions are really nothing but different combinations of neurochemicals going off in your brain. Like emotions are literally all in your head but they have a huge impact on your life so you got to learn to control them and when it's easy as ways to impact your emotions is to exercise. A lot of people don't think about it like this but from a neurological perspective your body actually creates the emotions and you can dictate what kind of neurochemicals your body produces by exercising is one of the ways and the first time I deal with depression again I've diagnosed a bipolar 2 is when I was in high school. I got sent away to military school I was mad depressed and I don't think I was suicidal then but I know I didn't care if I lived or die. As soon as I started working out it started to change my emotions and I didn't know what was happening but it was these neurochemicals that your body produces once you start to train to start to work out and then also when you start making some progress what happens is yourself to sting starts to rise and more importantly you start to become more confident right and the reason you become more confident and not just because you're strong when you look better and you have less fat but to get in shape you have to start making these promises to yourself every day and you have to start keeping these promises that you make and what you start keeping the promises you make to yourself every day was going to happen is you start to trust yourself more you start to believe in yourself more because think about it if you don't have confidence it's probably because you shouldn't have confidence you probably have been giving yourself a reason to be confident yet. Imagine somebody who was telling you they were going to do all these things for you every day and they never do it. How much confidence would you have in efforts that person is you a big reason why some people don't have confidence and or are depressed is because they keep breaking these promises that they make to themselves to keep telling themselves that they're going to start eating right they're going to start training they're going to get his shake and they don't do it and there's no reason why they should have confidence in themselves right they haven't given themselves a track record but once you start really training and you start keeping the promises as you make to yourself everything start training when you're supposed to start eating right you start drinking in the water getting enough sleep and you do these things over a significant amount of time then you build up a track record and that you start to believe in yourself more you start to have more confidence you're self-esteem goes up I've seen that alone cure people's depression I swear to God I've seen it I've been a personal trainer for over 25 years somebody I'll worry about the born when I started training people I've seen it change people's whole personality that's all changed mine this is why I fell in love with fitness because when I was in high school and I was depressed and I was ordered online suicidal working out change things for me I started keeping these promise in myself and I have more confidence higher self-esteem and then other kids started asking me for advice and I started training them helping them get in shape and what happened was remarkable like I saw these children their personality changed they have more confidence in themselves and they started doing better in school it stopped being little jerks they were getting in the less trouble I believe a lot of their lives turned around I know that was my experience and that's really what made me want to become a trainer because I saw how exercise connection the impact people on an emotional level if you start doing that start training yourself it will help you with your mental health this is not just me saying this turns the books on it you can read a book called Spark by John Rally is all about how exercise affects the brain another one called moves by Caroline Williams is this a great book about how exercise can actually change your old brain another great one is stealing fire by Stephen Copler you can read these books or you can just trust with what I say here right like I read the books and I'm giving you information with this tons of evidence that shows that exercise can actually help with depression and mental health the next thing you need to do and this is going to be controversial it's to make a bunch of money because if you start making money you can do things that actually impact your mental health for example you can change your environment change your living situation improve it I'm happy you're now in my Miami pinhouse then I was when I was living in the hood in Chicago just changing the environment can change your emotions because south side of Chicago Warframe it feels depressing you got people getting shot pretty much daily the homies are dying you watching your back all the time it's a difficult way to live but once I made some money got to move out the hood I feel way better now I'm beyond what you're when I wake up in my condo overlet the Atlantic Ocean I feel better it's more difficult to be depressed here than it was on the south side of Chicago but also there aren't many problems they can't be solved or at least improved if you have enough money magic Johnson would have died in the 90s if he wasn't a multi millionaire everybody was died from HIV it was the death sentence when the rich guy's got it somehow they figured it out it also you know I don't know what the amount of money is but I do know there isn't a amount of money that if I had it I would still have a dead I don't know that number is but if I was a multi millionaire when my dad was going through with his challenges I think he would have solved like that in his internal I think he might have talked to me or we could have figured something out that ought to me a little bit because when people say money is not important or money is not everything I just think man why are trying to downplace success why are you trying to say it's not important when you know it'll fix the majority of your problems or at least improve it make them easier to deal with so most I realized that by my father I vowed to never be in a situation again where I could not help out the people like care about if a family member or friend was ever in a situation where they needed some money they were well I wanted to be in a situation to help her I vowed to never be in a situation and here's the thing as a man if you can't provide for the people you care about that's an easy way to find yourself struggling with mental health if you can't provide for the people you care about as a man so start working out and getting great shape and make a bunch of money I would think those are series cures for most of men's problems and I believe that they are the cure for men's mental health some of that sound shallow but that's only if you don't think about it right these other motherfuckers that tell you the journal or see it there piss and I'm not saying those are bad within themselves but what we gonna write about our problems but we gonna fix them you're like I'm telling you I have to fix the problems journal and then going to a therapist they're cool I've been to therapy before I just didn't see a lot of results from it the things that helped me with my mental health were getting a great shape and making a bunch of money I'm not trying to say therapy is not good I'm not trying to say journaling is not effective I don't have a lot experience with journaling but listen man you want to write about your problems and talk about your problems or you want to fix them and most of your problems can be fixed or at least improved by making a bunch of money and getting a great shape even if those things can't improve whatever you're going through at least you have more resources to fight whatever you're going through if you're getting great shape you have more energy more strength more mental stamina more physical stamina to attack whatever's going on and you have enough money now you've got resources you can throw at whatever the problem is to help improve it now you maybe thinking like what if you're depressed because somebody died or something like that listen I'm familiar with that as well like my father killed herself the focus on working out helped me get through those troubling times for the reasons I said before for the same reasons that I covered in these books right working out changes the neural chemistry of your brain and also making a bunch of money to help me fix a lot of the mess then my father left behind I was able to move my mom out of the South Side of Chicago I was able to help my sister deal with certain things that she was going through because I got money I don't see how journal in or talk into a therapist it was going up my mom and my sister maybe it's cool for women to do that stuff and I'ma say men can't do it where I don't want to sound like that kind of guy but as a man we got to fix the problems that's what's gonna make us still better and I'm not talking about it and I'm not writing about it and I say that with compassion because I have struggled with mental health my whole life like I got bipolar to fucking dead daddy Louis brains out right I know what it's like and these are the things they help me and these are the things I've seen help other people I promise you brother if you are dealing with any mental health struggles get serious about your fitness get serious about your money and things will start to improve I promise you I wish you love I love you and let's get it on me
