Yo's going on so I'm here with my man to rail and this dude is an expert at helping people get funding Improved it credit and when he told me before me to old people how to legally rob the bank tell me what you mean by that Bro I teach people how to how to legally rob the banks right? But he just gets access to capital get access to business funding at 0% interest right because the biggest thing about what people in general Right a lot of time we've been afraid to credit Yeah, afraid of you know access to funding because one we're not educated To we don't understand when we don't have education you don't understand it different resources that you have and how you can use those resources What you better your life and better your business so I basically teach people how to get access to business funding in seven days or less 0% interest and then what happens is that they can leverage at the bill They business to scale the business to grow the business or even started business, right because sometimes you got to have a financial backing Yeah, and I've been the biggest thing like coming from Baltimore, Maryland I didn't have a financial backing. I didn't have the education and then I didn't even know about the resources and so we don't know about it It's like you know they say if you know better you do better I'm older than you right and I remember when I was in college I was afraid of credit Lot people I seen people going to dead and once I was watching MTV Crips and it was baby from cash money He said it was it. I got all his houses and all these cars and I and got no loans And then I paid it for them all cash and I was like, oh, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna do what baby I never had no credit up until four years ago a credit score was zero Okay, you know, I didn't have no credits no loans nothing and I had built like a multi million dollar business Fucking with debit cards because I was afraid of credit, you know, but now I've learned you know I got credit like I know Mx audits say Right, and this crazy man. I got like three million Mx points I'm yeah, I don't pay for flight anymore. Yeah, I bought computers with it in points So I didn't realize how much I was missing out. I did not have a credit What happens in our community like that's how we get access information. That's how we like we grow up and watch Either rappers Yes ball players you really become that because you basically gain information from that That's life that you live, but when you really think about it We understand it like rappers or not people that should be given like financial literacy if I say not communities Yeah, I found that out later like you said about just using debit cards and not really understanding the resources I had been in fiction you know, and I had access to funding I kind of made things happen to faster Looks like I'm a credit right, you know, and we could talk about some ways on how someone can do that especially me I had no credit right, so I had to utilize different tactics to get my credit up I was able to scale my business as so much faster For example like just spending money on ads instead of waiting for me having the money to spend it I can use Mx's money and then look their money and then pay them back I built points and then like that's the thing It's like marketing right like a lot of people that are in business don't even understand the power marketing Or even like running ads right because now you can use other people's money to run the ads to number one Build your brand to get more awareness right one of my mentors say if they don't know you they can't float you right So they don't know you they can't spend money with you. Yeah, and so it's crazy that you know You can use other people's money Mx you can bet reward points. You can build your back brand Build your awareness build your business and at the same time Now you can be profitable right like then if you can get sales and things like that Which is a whole different aspect that your business for being in your sales is like now you use other people's money to profit Yeah, see I don't think it's none wrong with using other people's money as long as you use it to make money If you're using it for like bullshit like anybody watches jewelry with all right, and then you fucking up right But if you're using it to make money then I think it's all good same thing about education right like what we just talked like When you think about baby like you said it right, but like nobody probably ever had a variety conversation Because if he wouldn't use credit and he understood how to leverage that how many more properties and things he could have leverage Yeah, and how he could have leverage that even with the tax system right with the appreciation and different things like that So a lot of times like when you think about it, but it's just because we lack information I can be there you don't need to make sense nobody talks about it break down the steps is somebody who was starting from zero Right, what would they have to do to start getting some some business credits so they can fund whatever ventures they have Going on stuff was starting from several if you have no credit right the first thing you got to understand that banks are pretty much like business partners Right, so let's say you you plan on only the business your futures that you're gonna own a business right well It's looking at banks and understand that banks or businesses that have assets right So one of the things I did and like you know, we leverage a y right, but I went to chat GPT and I asked chat to be tea to give me like the top five banks based upon assets Okay, right, so Chase was number one right bank of miracles number two I think city group was number three I think Wells Fargo and then some of the other banks right that right so if it was me I'm gonna definitely set up in the count with Chase I may definitely get an account of bank America on on that side because why? Because I understand they had the most assets which means they had the most ability to lend right and because I'm going to go in the business at some point I wanted to establish these relationships with banks right then I did the same thing with credit It's hey get me the top five credit unions right that's you know, so Navy federal was one of them So another thing I was I was set up a couple relationship with credit unions with Navy federal right I would call and say he looked my grind dad was an military he passed away But I heard that I can still get a check in the savings account Navy federal say cool that lets you any give you the check-ins and save as a count right if I'm that's not working the job I wrote my direct deposit straight in Navy federal right because you can build fast to a credit unions when you have no credit Build your credit faster. Yeah, we're quite an instant you could we've gone to the national big banks The reason I still want to have a link a bank with those national big banks those because later on down the road once I do built my credit up Now I'm gonna go to Chase and I'm gonna be at a get you know You know, you know, I mean 0% just business credit cards I'm gonna be at a get even the Chase freedom right the chase elite We'll talk about some of those cars you can get some of those cars later on down the road So I'm gonna start building with the credit unions first. I'm gonna get my direct deposit with Navy federal right So step one is set up account with a few big banks and if you cut us more credit You piece money credit even so now you basically start building relationships because a lot of times What I see is people just go try to get access to cap on an each field like a one-day stand Right, we've all had one-day stands, but how successful had it? You know, is it but if you take a go on a date, you know, say you do a little wine and a dime Talk to people turning into a relationship Yeah, right You're my not even one-internet to it Right, like yeah, so it's like you know, it's like just looking at it like that right, so we start there So next step is that I would do some secure loans Depending on you know money and things like that I would take a thousand two thousand dollars and I would go to Navy federal I would do a pledge loan I would go to other credit unions that we talked about maybe you can do a line yet Alliance of credit a good credit union as well. Okay, and I would do like I would do secure loans with the credit You explain to him what is secure loan So it's secure loan is that when you base you take your money like let's say you got a thousand two thousand dollars Right, you're gonna take your money. You're gonna go to the bank You're gonna ask them to give you a loan, but you're gonna base you give them the cash right You're gonna base you in turn give you a check for that same 2000 also loan against the money you already got now what you want to do is going pay 75% of the loan off the rest of the loan you want to base you do the payments over time because With credit credit is built up with one time payments over time So as you build up your as you as you're building up by using secure loans now What happens is that now when you make those payments on time you're gonna now build out your credit for it Another thing that you were now able to do is you were now able to put your own limits per say on your credit report So because you went into the 2000 loan let's say with a line a 2000 loan with baby federal now you put your own kind of data Posts now you have let's say you did two of those $1,000 each now you got it you got your credit limit is 2000 But you've paid it all down you paid 70% of it down so now it looks like you have a lot of available credit We do have a lot of good credit and you continue to make the one time payment Right, and then they got credit building account so another good one is rent reporters right So let's say I still I know I'm a dad of family member who was paying a mortgage I go to them. I basically let them know the hey, you know, I want to base the Report that I'm paying rent to them right Rem report us you can go to that website. You can pay rem report us to basically say that your paying rent So I was set my rent. I would say it's $2,500 a month Yeah, you can even back data So depending on how long they've had the mortgage You can back data they've had the mortgage for five years eight years 10 years How have a long-nete had the mortgage you can kind of back data and that will give you a primary trade line But it will give you age Okay credit report. Oh age on your credit report right I did got it guys So that's how that's another factor So we got on that's another factor when it comes to credit. Yeah, it's how long you had credit So now you got rem report is you got the two secure loans I it's something called credit strong credit strong doesn't account that you set up and you just make on time payments every single month And now you got about four to five trade lines right that you now have kind of established Okay, and you you're just going with just to make one time payment so just pretend this person don't know nothing What's the trade line oh got you so probably you have primary trade lines Which means that it's it's that the true response before it's a concept that you set up a senior name Yeah, your actual response will make an appointment since stuff like that at the same time You have what they call authorized user trade lines which means that if Brandon has a credit card of $10,000 he can add me on as an authorized user and that's now what they call the authorized user trade line Yeah, so in the wordies you have the higher credit go. Yes, the more the more Primary accounts that you have yeah with the age right and the fact that you're making on time payments now You pretty much build out your credit report guy from there like once I do that now I'm gonna look at what they call I'm gonna do some soft pools right for credit cards that do softballs So you got Capital one capital one is a credit card that they will deal to a pre approval right where you know now You can go in to application the pre approval you might get approved you got to discover it now Why am I going to capital one discover it? These are major credit cards that you want to start getting in while it because as you start building up You want to have major credit cards in a while that give you decent limits and things like that So another thing is two that I see a lot of people don't know when they don't when they go in and and and and do applications Another thing that happens is that people will go in and say hey, let's say in a true job You're making 40,000 50,000 60,000 something like that right well one of the things I tell people is that when you're going to Application you wanted to use what is called a household income at it Let's say I got a wife. I got a girlfriend right I got a you know Let's say even if I got some kids and they work in this stuff like that you can now basically take all of their incomes As the household income and put that as your income for That household in game doing the application right now Why do I want to do it because a lot of times we want to get access to capital credit cards things like that and we're going to say We only make 45,000 year, but we want to get a 20,000 credit card or 15,000 on a limit Why would they give you you know melcordia? What do you make sense? It doesn't make sense so really what's the very important is when you're doing applications They use your household income And that's the method that you can use when you're going in and doing applications Specific of those pre-approvals But yeah, and so that's how you would start your foundation you would start your foundation on reporters a few secure loans building the bank Relationship of the bank's and stuff like that you start the emikyo on time payments You make sure I understand this first we're gonna get some relations with the banks because we're some accounts right then we're gonna get secured loans You know put it like it was the minimum you got to hit a thousand as a good minute That's 2000 or more the more the more money you have more and more than better right because you want to have more available credit All right, and then you said so the number of orders Remember we said we did room orders right credit strong credit strong credit strong did somebody's places where you did this this also secure credit cards You're working in that yes, and no, so if you're gonna go to secure credit card Make sure you get a secure credit card that graduates into a real credit card Okay, because a lot of people will go and get secured credit cards But they don't graduate into real ones and now you cuz you just thought what a secure credit card Right, but the thing about the secure loans to is that if you go do the secure loans first The reason I suggest that is because what happens is as your credit starts to build you're starting getting letters in the mail from credit card Compton Don't credit cards at you and then also if you do the pre-approval method and you already got the secure loans that been reporting for let's say four five six months You know you'll start getting higher limits God on your own those bread your first credit cards that you do all right, so instead of secure cars we go get discovered it cover it capital one capital one Even maybe federal if once we got the relationship and even and we got to direct the positive setup Maybe federal also allows you to pre-qualified or get pre-approved for credit cards This one affect your credit. Okay, because this is because from what I understand the things that affect your credit art length of credit Yeah credit history length of credit history Available credit credit do you have right, so that's what the screw loans that's what you say pay half of it off immediately So don't report as if you're your utilization is high I don't matter and then you get some more different cards because the number of Maces that makes that you and then even like a auto loan like if you're just starting out to you know I mean getting access to auto loan. That's a it helps with your credit mix Usually auto loans that a lot higher on the terms of the actual amounts and the thing with that's different with loans As opposed to credit cards as loans are meant to be paid off over time right So if you get out auto loan is 25,000 30,000 you're meant to pay that off over time now You've kind of basically boosted and opens your report, you know pretty much all the way out right Then it's just understanding how to leverage credit for you to be able to make money Right, like how can we be able to make money by having good credit before we get into that all the steps you talk about so far How long with that take it just depends on kind of money the person working with right So I would say that it could be a it could be a six-month process Right, I'm depending on like how much money he working with because even with the security loans when you establish those and you make the on-time payments You know you want to have that kind of drag our six months And we do the run report isn't we back day to age right now What happens is that you should have like two or three years of history because it'll it'll even out right it'll balance out right I'm also you can you can also get like maybe one or two authorized users so you can pay all that's what I did Now I went to this girl in the right and I was like, oh look look I need you help I had I put me as the authorized user on the car and then I think Also have my girlfriend at the time she had a car and I maybe authorized user right and then I had my sister do it and my boy The homie white boy Brian Gotcha, he maybe authorized user on anyone is a guy he had it for me alone and that's and that's where like the other part is Where you can now go to three people that you know and actually free hey can you ask me as the author But you want to go to people you know, I get credit credit that went ankle master the credit cards But if you don't have those people in that work like where I come from bottom all you might not have those people So now you got a little websites like trade lines apply calm where you can actually pay to get on get access to other people's credit cards And you don't get the car you don't get the car Yeah, you don't get the car, but you can pretty much pay to get access to get you know authorized user and then from there You know you're pretty much your report is now wide open right like now you're good to go How much does that cost to get the train It depends on the camera right because I look into it. Yeah, it depends on the account But the biggest thing to that I would tell people is that when you start getting credit cards It things like that you can not even list your credit cards on those websites as well And that's how you can start making money right because you can make money just by having good credit Right, so let's say you do get a discover car. Let's say it come with a $5,000 Even if you had a foreshort pretty time there's people that you might know that need it need help with a credit It's like you look I add you my credit card. I'll tell you 250. I'll tell you they don't get the car You know, they get the car. It does their credit roof reflect on you now if I got the card and I add your mark on my card My credit is gonna now reflect on your report not the other way All right, so you made some of the all the right user. Yeah, it's motherfuckin go bankrupt. Yeah, you straight Yeah, okay. I don't just People really stay on someone else's credit card if you're paying for it Like 60 it's like 60 to 90 days and that's the thing about credit cards Like sometimes you get five slots sometimes you get three different times. We start to get you to So it can literally be a side hustle where you know you add in people taking them off For things like that every 60 to 90 days like an extra $1,000 a month depends It was awesome. Yeah, yeah That's probably a good nuts. Yeah, no Because you just add and people want to a card and take it off off You know, so it's like you know a lot of times we do like you said you have four people that are for you for free Yeah, they did charge you you know, I mean 250 that have been $1,000 a year to pay it out And you probably where it didn't understand the way you had to pay it. Oh, I would have did it Sure, no, my credit went for like it was like saying it Let me say zero. I never seen that before yeah, and then it went up to like in the 700 year You know and it got my first card. It was an MX blue Gotcha, and I went and got the gold and the platinum Those are my main cards now I got chase-off sapphire reserve and a bunch of other like cool cards Yeah, it's all about like I said being educated and the resources like I think Willie what happens when we come from you know Empires or certain environments you know you don't nobody even talking about credit because like they said they go to work Eddie bills But they don't really understand how the leverage resources to start businesses and Willie is about creating wealth and so people need to notice information Yeah, because if you want to start a business rub business, yeah, you can do it all okay You can boost track yourself door-talking is getting out of the middle. That was difficult though. Yeah How was like I wish I didn't have to do it. Yeah, you know, so how do we turn it into money the biggest thing is now We want to start that LLC so we're gonna go get the LLC all right We want to make sure doesn't have a risky name We want to get the same yeah, yeah, risky name so A lot of people go in it's like oh, I'm straight hustling. Yeah, yeah, they are all like real estate or Trucking or that they give leeways to like the industry date they operate in No, just keep it simple so like whatever your first and last name as it could be your first and last name initials enterprises Solutions go to be they keep it very big why don't you want to say the industry? Well, because what happens is that some industry depending industry is risky to banks Will the states risk it yeah, it creates the most millionaires what they say right stocks right taxes A lot of stuff actually people make money in but when it comes to banks and how banks view the industry is very risky to it That's a tool I never thought about it If you're in certain financial industries like let's say you do taxes and you want to set a bank account They want banks won't rock with you. So what's it risky? I thought you was like yeah, man Stacks on deck So some like that's a I mean and that's and you know it depends on what you don't like some people like if you got trucking company You can have a LLC that you conduct business in in terms of your contracts and things like that But when it's time to go to the banks the gax of the funding No, I would I wouldn't want to keep it very very general if anything if you want it to have like a crazy name for your business Something if you just get a doing business Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah So yeah, so you want to make sure it doesn't really have a risky name We want to get a brick and mortar address one of the ways you can get a brick and mortar address is this is a google Registered agent in whatever state that you ankle bridge a business Right, so you can get a decent business address Get a business phone number right you want to get a 1-800 number for the business as well And really you want to have a business email at your company.com Yeah, right because the biggest thing is always about structure is like if you want to get funding like Walmart or Amazon Any these major companies then this time for us to structure our businesses Yeah, as such What what's the best thing to get? I move to Florida. I actually I started my LLC over again It's funny You know why I'm as good. I think Florida's good when it comes to taxes and things like that's why I think the biggest thing to is a strategy New Mexico is decent but it all depends on strategy because at the same time you got like Florida We got access to most of the banks so we get access to chase the bank of America The credit unions but then it's like okay, truest is a regional bank. We got access to that because they lend it not region But if you're in Wyoming or Delaware Truest is not in your footprint right? So it does depend on strategy in kind of what you're doing if you're gonna think about getting act like Maximizing capital yeah, sometimes just because you want to have asset protection and be anonymous or some of these other things It doesn't mean that's the best thing for if you want to get a access to capital and get a kind of going to scutted business too So always when I had when people ask me hey bro, what's the best way to just like look bro? What is a strategy like number one? We're in the show you operate in and which is strategy for how you want to Build and grow your business and scale because that also depends on that too. You can't just make you know Oh, I want to be anonymous or I want to protect my ass like like No, because hey if you got a business that's have you on capital you need money for that money adds and stuff like that But now you limited to only going out the national banks so once we have all this structure set of right we got that LLC we got our emails all that we did we did all the trade lines we did we did all of that What what kind of Credit score do we want to have before we start on try to get like real you want to have Overset hundreds and the reason why because another thing to write like you never want to make your minimum Your maximums too many times in life, you know a lot of people it's like they want to do the Bermanum, but they want to get the most maximum. Yeah, that's not due that right if the higher school you can have us at 50 you know the best thing is to have at least 700 or but because anything under that now you're kind of a mediocre range Yeah, right and another thing I guess that you know is really important about and this like for people if you have we talk about people I had no kind of right but what about the people who you had some stuff for you might stop So yeah, that's important to you know I'm glad you brought that up because I skipped over yet So the big but the thing is like now with AI like we have AI right and it's like a lot of times People are afraid of using AI not realizing that same thing how to be educated and how to leverage as a resource So with AI now if you have negative items on your credit you can screenshot whatever the negative items on your credit You can upload that negative item the chat GPT you can act chat GPT hey look This is the negative item mark credit draft me and aggressive F-a-dave it is if it came from a customer law attorney using the F-CRA right draft me an aggressive F-a-dave it using like you know using F-CRA got lines and Making it seem as though it came from like a a a a customer law attorney Boom chat jk 10 30 seconds or if less than that five 10 15 second They're gonna spit the whole F-a-dave it up and then you just send that in the mail you can even send a mail But that's what let's say you don't want to send the mail right you can go to Experience dot com and upload your dispute before you even before you even go to experience dot com Once you have the F-a-dave from chat GPT there's a website called notarylive dot com or notarylive dot com You can not arise documents anywhere at any time right so just upload your ID Notarized a document we take the document we can upload that directly to experience then of course you got the CFPB You can go and ask submit a complaint you can upload the same documents there which I think you can go to BBB dot right because I know what's crazy is all the time that these are businesses that look for funding and do things just like us Right so think about the better business bureau What happens is that now you can go and dispute the better business bureau right and now this company has a it has a it's like oh These are some negative reports from you know other consumers and it's like they have the handle these complaints So a lot of times if you got negative items there's so many different ways to go about it But we can use a to at least draft that F-a-dave it right yeah get it no-derived notarylive dot com and Yeah, we can upload it directly to the websites themselves if we do want to send it by mail I suggest going to online certified mail dot com because now you can send that you can send the document I was certified from home. Well, you don't even have to go to the post office Yeah, tonight on online certified mail dot com that's what's up The thing about the F-a-dave is that it's an official swan statement Right so once you sign that and get it no-derived now It's an official swan statement from you as an as an individual Right and then let's say people say oh, I did that and it didn't work Okay, but now you actually can take them to court or go and sue Because now you gave them an official swan statement from you as the consumer Got it and you had a no-derived and then that's like okay data and follow the certains our FCRA got lines Which they're supposed to adhere to so now you can't take in the court and some time people went money and sometime They kind of take the negative item off, but either way you we need to leverage a out of kind of get the negative items off It just be aggressive right sometime you can once you send it in okay, but it sent them I sent the certified now. I know I'm a send the certified return receipt. I know they received it. What kind of do you want to receive it? Excuse me. Hey, Trans you in this is Mr Brown. I sent it in a certified letter stating the different things I was on my you know that was on my credit report Did you get that did you get it? Oh, yeah, we got it. Okay, perfect while I still see the disturbance to report negative I'm a credit report and you guys violated you know you use the same thing that was in your F-a-dave it Right, I need to stop the leader on it. Wait so now you can pick up the phone and be a lot more aggressive How about getting these like that works yeah, yeah I had one of my one of my mentees. This was he was you know he was on a phone experience for our To the thing about life is that like if you're if you're persistent enough and you are Hey like your intentional you're gonna you're gonna make it happen a lot of times people just don't have intention When I'm intentional you're not gonna be successful and that's the thing about credit I think it's like one of them intangible things where think about it. It's like hey man I got free flights. I didn't got you know free computers all types of free stuff. It was in tangent what the time because You used building your business that because of double car, but once it became something tangible now You understand how important it is and that's the thing I think with people is like everything if it's not right now Mike away, you can't just pop in the microwave and have it. It's successful. It's so intensive We've got to be persistent with it. You got it today. Seriously. I guess it depends on how many negative I didn't do have but yeah General how long will it take to for some people to start clearing off the negative I mean If you if you use those f-a-davis get a no-derived you're gonna see results in the end your first 30 days Right 30 days. Well you just got to be persistent like people just see a thing about us as human beings We're emotional right and like we have a motion to when the things don't really go our way Yeah, but like if you just Precistently keep staying on top of that stuff you have everything wiped off your credit You know and really in no time I say no time because a lot of times Deadpool is staying in credit for a 70 years Even if it took eight months is that compared to you know eight years? That's not a long time but how consistent and persistent are we about the process and understanding like it's where we're going Not what we came from people to cut up in the past they always looking in the rear of you Whenever you can't drive looking in the rear view you gotta know what you want to win show this bigger They got right so that's the thing like that's what people when it comes to credit and just their life It's like this is your livelihood this is you being a creature in the rest of the world because in the in our system like everybody Is leveraging dead right the whole shit even the government right like oh We in this material use it Yeah, we stood the most powerful country in the America I mean in the world that's the fact But we still leverage in other people's money right we're still doing trades and borders and things like that So it's just like when people start to really understand the system and understand how money work That's the first thing that people do is it's like clean a credit and work on that and then a lot of times the business I did as I think that people have like it really would work if they had they has capital Have fun. All right, so now we did that what's the next step? Let's in it and we can get our shit to like seven 50 now All of a sea yeah got the LSE cleaned up our clear curve where I belong that to business checking the counts It's the same thing. I'm looking at the checking accounts with Bank of America Mom and you chase them for one because like I said they're the biggest asset on the Debar America I'm looking at some community banks. I'm still doing some marketing as well same thing I'm gonna do the same thing in terms of the build on the real different ways I have all my shit Yeah, so bank America bro like it some other relationships because think about like you were Been this on it, right if you already like went to chase naked you money Okay, boom got you already I don't have my money all the time. We're here. Let me go Let me go step is my relationship with them And let me start building with them and let me see if I could get some funding with them right because it's like and you can do this every even like every 91 days You can go and do like anywhere for three to five banks Okay, and just a stay every 90 days. Yeah, and just to start establishing relationships Even if you put in 2020 find it 5,000 in something like that even if you're letting us sit and it's like cool like that You can call the bank of you know you got 5,000 in the account They just want to know what kind of business credit cards is stuff. You all got what kind of stuff do you guys offer? I'm saying and then sometimes you could put it game like let's say we'll change I got 700 That or whatever I got 75,000 sit in change right now You know, I move everything over what you got going on? They even sell your game. Oh, yeah, man. We got this this this this this You can move your money over for a couple days get a couple business credit card I guess some access to capital and then it's like you could do it. I'll be one So how much money would you do you need to put in the business account for them to like you know Leave it over Chase bank America. I would say if you got 2500 school because most of them charge A $10 fee or 5000 fee or something like that if you don't got 2500 more so at the minimum I would start with 20,000 2000 and I would act the bank like what's the minimum that you can have and that's the thing that's so motivated And it's funny because you got different counts with Chase one of the things that motivated me with Chase was like They got accounts day you can have a hundred thousand minimum. You know, I mean like you know a certain account They got accounts with like it's it's 20,000 they got accounts with a hundred thousand dollars And I was like wow it was crazy that you know You know money where I come from bottom all like I ain't you know, but I had a hundred thousand liquid Yeah, so it's like there it's people that they just keep a hundred thousand and then they checking the cards I'm just such it like that's the minimum That's right and it's like so that means that's broke the some people like there's people out here in the world right now That a hundred thousand I'll say any count is broke that's the thing about life Man, it's all about how many experiences you can have I think a lot of times when people are broke or when you don't have money It's because they don't get around other experiences with people That's the fact you know, I mean it's like like growing up in Chicago I thought I was a bridge right like the south side like we thought I was rich You've come to find out I was just only me with a dead Yeah, so we had two incomes yeah, I got sent to a military school because I got some trouble And then um, but there was some like legit rich kid yeah and like it so one do I went to it I went to his crib for the weekend instead of going back home Chicago almost his crib It was my roommate scratching my fucking horses yeah like horses Yeah, horses I never said I know she had a mansion He's there with his they had like man cars, you know like they they have roses for us and she but they had like beehives and yeah That type yeah, yeah, and I was like oh shit, you know what your dad do is like Just a doctor Look how you doctor Like just a regular ass doctor Like yeah, you know like shit, man bucket. I'm gonna go to college That was what I was thinking you know back in the 90s That's crazy bro because in and with that shows is that like you got into a different environment It shows you something different and it's like now I motivated you to want to be something that you didn't even that you never even thought about I understand because you know coming from Baltimore like I'm for me with Baltimore like like in the hood It feels feels hopeless like you could feel it right it's like 10 was like so it's no wonder You know kids to get in the gangs so start doing another shit right and because when I go back to Chicago I know them kids they don't think they gonna be hedge fund managers Oh shit like that like For real it's like I they're gonna be alive. Yeah, you know saying like real thing about and I think like What's so crazy is that like a lot of times is because your parents like you know the grand parents the family is like Really used to all what your family right and like most of people in our families is like they go to work Yeah, they paid a bill they they honest things like that but it's like when you think about things given in Christmas T was like these conversations it's not like You know it take you going to a different type of school getting on a different environment and it's like damn This damn this shit really is possible like and I was a thing for me like even just seeing that people had like 100,000 dollars was broken some people Yeah, liquid is minimum like okay like I even at that time was like I got my money up Yeah, and that's the thing about money. You know, I mean it's like you don't even know Was possible until you really get a chance to see what's was going on in the world and I think that you know like in the hood Like a lot of people were shelter You know, because even like in the hood it's like yo I bank with time When I bank with you know, it's like bro you're gonna real bank again. Yeah, I remember I don't know I remember Yo, we was catching our checks at the liquor store Yeah, people still don't know Yeah, they still doing it like I know that was thing yeah, I remember catching checks at the liquor store I remember my first one of my first checks when I was a personal trainer. I was like 17 and I went straight to the liquor store Okay, the cash is You know, it's funny. It's not the one of my guys right? He got a refund check. Yeah, the morning state. Yeah, yeah refund check, right? He got two. I'm like one one day. He was like 3500 next day. He gave me another 30 find it right lot of you not I took him to the liquor store 3500 I was You can't you cash this cash is really fun check and then like you know and he took the whole 3500 I came up with this all his money is probably it started peeling up you know Because like I'm and it's crazy as you say this but I promise you it's funny When when you look back at like the fact that people that we do stuff and it's all based upon lack of education We just ain't no no better. I could I got a checking account. Yeah, I was never said I'll cash it look It's okay Like a fee depending on how many I forgot how I'm depending on like every 100 E-pass certain amount of money Yeah, you better fee like if you got a check on the account how much do I call such cash check? Nothing nothing So it's like you do it from your phone now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Like just from your phone and that's the thing like and then we and then what happens when you do when you like education You know spend more money. Yeah, because you don't even had a It's ignorance test ignorance test that's what it's paying you know straight up, man So now that we got that let's see yeah That's what I mean distracted but I was making sure they get the game You know so they know what to do. I know you like not like sometimes people come on especially if they they Coat just sometimes coaches don't want to give the sauce But you give you given it all and I appreciate that Yeah, because the only way that we grow in our community is if we if we impart the wisdom and dollars That's not the them to go execute and that's the biggest thing that I see that even when you give game We don't matter how much game we give because that's what it's only a select few people That's gonna go out there execute straight up, man, and then some people You know that's why I tell everybody who's like a coach or anything like you're gonna give as much game as possible Because some people execute it and they'll just they'll just love you for it, right? There's some people among you who's like yeah, I don't want to do it It's like but I all pay someone to do yeah, right? You know sense of people. Yeah, yeah, but no, so once you got that Let's see if you go and establish those business back checking the counts And then you want to go to you want to find relationship managers So even with Chase when you set up your account you can ask them for a private banker Yeah, relationship manager And then basically what you do with the relationship managers you want to go in now Let's say you want to get a $50,000 business credit card a $75,000 business credit card When you're doing your application right we talk about the household income like that right What happens when your business revenue side? Let's say you want to get a $50,000 or 75,000 business credit card your business revenue has to be you can project your business revenue Right, but you want to project this your doing at least at least a million more. Okay, a year a year a year business Right, even if it's brand new right now What happens is that if you go to Chase private banker and let's say you let's say you say you're you're you're you're regular income You know as a hundred let's say Anyway from 147,000 to 265 right let's just say that on a business application right so you put that down for your yeah Yeah, yeah income your personal income and then for the business you can say you're gonna million 1.1 1.2 No right those data points will give you a either 50,000 or 75,000 Business credit card with Chase you can get that as your you and you've got to prove this You don't got to and you and the biggest thing about Chase is that they give up to 150,000 right now with no prevent Like the Chase ink Chase ink order or or the I could be the Chase unlimited the unlimited order ink okay Then go right and then what happens is that now? What's the difference when you do really they kind of like the same car Because I got the ink I'm like man do I need to unlimited as well So the same car they'd be really do similar things like both from a 0% for 12 for 12 months What I did was I got the I had got the ink right and then I got the unlimited The ink they gave me 75k 0% you know, I know me they gave me 25k so I was in the 100k from Chase Zero percentors. I didn't have to prove no income anything like that. Wow and the best thing about business credit You can wear you to expert this thing, but you can run up the utilization and it'll affect your purse It don't affect your credit score. It's not even on your it doesn't even show you a person Yeah, you can run up you just they got you know, yeah, and that's why I saw is there's bench that you like this business credit cards You don't want to get capital 1 because that repository a personal discover business credit card We're posting a personal TD bank that business credit card also reports the a person So those are three business credit cards that you want to make so you stay away away Yeah, right because you want to get it run it up like you say and leverage it for your business and things like that But Mx is good Mx is great That's I do most much of the Mx before we run some shit over on the chase tool The thing about the thing about Mx right is like the loungest of course again I was just and yes, I mean the best part That's one of the area When I go to the to the planning station. I call it the planning station Yeah, because it's a long story, okay, but then when I go to my stage I had straight to this interior like straight Especially if it was early flight because that breakfast five or some times You know the lunch is hit or miss but the breakfast goes hard Yeah, and then I hit the shit when I get off the plant. Yeah, all right at the next So I get two free meals and they usually pretty good. Yeah, yeah, and that's like that's what I'm saying But I think that Even like for fitness like so yeah, and it's like your you start it you start your fitness brand and now you need to build You need to run ads boost post you need to get more awareness like you can leverage I American Express Goldcroft for six months to 0% yeah, and you can run ads You can and with the gold card the correct me for one of the first hundred hundred hundred k you get four points Four times points and that's the thing like and then people don't really understand the point at the points But now like you said you start getting free stuff pro free flights I don't remember less on my pay for a flight and I take like I think like 50 flights here Yeah, yeah, it's because I and In first class and I remember the last on my pay for one with cash and me my girl We just came back we had this when to this resort and can't cool Okay, you know all inclusive shit Some real nice shit some fall it shit first class down there fucking sweet at the resort We want to sweet with this own pool, you know, I hope shit all points all points all point. Yeah So that's and that's why I think love you said man. It's just it's just once you once you get access to information Like it literally change the situation so yeah, so I would do I would do that with Chase I would go there American Express I would get those cards as well. I would look at Bank of America as well And then the biggest thing I tell you is to like you gotta go to like it's different resources So you got I bank that right I bank that calm where you can now look at You can look at different banks that are pretty much in your foot print per se Okay, and you can also start relationships or even least pick up the phone call and figure out what they're lending prices is Who they lend to and you can also ask who the day poor from that's another thing that's really important when you want to go out to business funding is Because like Chase right now, they're pulling from experience Transigen right Mx is pulling from you know experience But you got banks like native federal they won't pull from transient and too So now what you can do is you can kind of figure out how you want to do your sequence and funding right knowing what banks are hole from Transigen what bank is going to pull from X. Tell them why that's important about big sister God, because really you want to get access to much fun as possible So if I know that choice is going to pull from echo facts and I know that Chase is going to pull from experience and Transigen right and I know that bank of America so bank of America if it's a personal credit card They're going to pull from experience if it's only business they pull from transient okay, so it's just knowing Okay, how do I access the most amount of capital but when they limited amount of inquiries and they're wires like drop your credit score They drop your credit scores well and Movoter and it lets banks know that you're looking for capital Right, so now we want to we want to play against each other basically if I go if I go to a truest and then they pull from echo facts I'm going to go to a bank that pulls from experience I want to go to another bank that pulls from transient that way you can get a bunch of funding at once at one time And understanding who they pull from and you can also still do that play But make sure you deal with the relationship managers so true as has relationship managers every bank That you're pretty much going to deal with they have like even private bank relationships It's another thing I feel like people do is that people don't pick up the phone and call at a look You know I'm interested in getting this what what kind of products do you guys offer So one thing that you do like that's that you want to get access of funding You pick up the phone you caught a bank you want to know one hey, who do you pull from? Yeah, do you pull from transient and echo facts experience right and other thing that you want to ask is how many lending products am I able to get on this inquiry? Right because I We're quite the ones you can what they call double dip so with credit units a lot of times you can get a You can get a credit card personal loan right all off of this One inquiry right but most banks don't allow you to do that some most banks is like the more pools that you do I mean the more like credit cards you want to get alone They make do a hard pool, you know every single time so it's kind of understanding that But that's why you ask questions like even with us and novice you have banks like Sonova Sonova Sonova's will allow you to we call it a multiple entity funding so let's say you got Brandon Carter LLC and you got BBC LLC right you could do one inquiry with Sonova's and get a business credit card for the BC LLC and get one for Brandon Carter But it's one inquiry and Sonova's also post maclifact as well. That's what stuff so it's different What's different is different things to it? How do you learn all this stuff just locking into one and understand how the system works? You know a lot of times my my pain came from my I wanted to over the state deal and I Part of what a guy and he and basically he was able to steal 68,000 dollars from me out of the deal Me and my mind right, but what he knew was how to set up that LLCs and he knew how to go to banks and guys It's the capital when we closed in our first property He was able to get the 68,000 we didn't even understand how he did it and that and that that pain was something I want to turn into a triumph so yeah, that's when I just dug in everything about LLCs and fixing our credit and stuff like that Just understanding what banks pulled from where and I did a lot of YouTube University right there was a lot of mentors You know shout them my guy and 500 you know, just even tapping in the him and recession proof and stuff like that But I'm somebody if you give me access information I'm gonna execute yeah, and so that was really I think that's the biggest thing is so much information on here already on YouTube even for like Let's say being fitness if you want to start a fit in front of it. It's called it's so much information But people do not really tapping they don't they don't lock in on information and then when they get the information A lot of people play around like oh should I do this? Everybody's looking for confirmation of validation with someone outside of them. No, fuck that like you need to validate yourself And go do it yourself so that way you can learn information implemented execute and you are changing like stop What info validation? Excuse me and confirmation from somebody outside of you. Yeah, that's the biggest thing That's the same.
