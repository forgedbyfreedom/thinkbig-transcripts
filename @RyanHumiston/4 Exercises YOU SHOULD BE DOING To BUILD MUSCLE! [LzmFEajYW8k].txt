All right, today we're going to have a more than most unrated exercises because let's face it, life's full of overrated experiences. I mean, think back to when you're a young man and your whole goal in life was centered around the fact that you were just hoping a woman would touch your penis. And then the day finally came to get you first H.J. and you quickly realized after she smashed your junk into what resembled a sin of un, probably not what you thought it was going to be. In fact, you couldn't have done a better job yourself. So in the spirit of that, let's go over some exercises that X-E-R is good as advertised. Let's get after it. So if you were done any standing hyper extensions or the ones where you put your butt up against the wall of talking about in the previous video, you've been humble. You got about five reps in before you cramped up, a tear came to your eye and you said, screw it up and done. You quickly realized why you can only pick up a few of your kids toys before you feel like you're going to shit out of disk. That's because the primary way we train those structural muscles in our back is by holding a static contraction and moving a shit load of weight in a good deadlift. But I feel like that misses out a really important aspect of training those muscles. And then it's being able to safely and efficiently disengage and re-engage those muscles that will. And this exercise is the most horrible way to do that. So the way you're going to set this up is by having the slight bend in those knees and pushing your butt back, which is ultimately going to shift the way to your heels. And the name of the game on this is flexion and extension. Now, one important note at no point during this movement are we actually rolling the weight up. We are going to engage those round boards up or back at the top, but you only need to slight bend and you're able to do that. So don't screw it up by trying to rose away. And the bottom of this movement is really center-run exaggerated in the stretch. So make sure you flare those lats at that back naturally roll forward. And when you start the contraction, think about flexing from the bottom all the way up. So engage that lower back first, move into those lower part of your lats, into those lower and mid traps. And then finish up by hitting those rhomboids and then even into those rear delts. Also keep in mind this is really a light movement. If you haven't done this before, I would simply just use the bar and hold two kind of the top and the bottom. That way you can ensure you can safely go through it. But also because it's harder to go slower. All right, next up we got one of the most underrated exercises for biceps and it's actually for your break-yallus. And before you say, I don't want to do a stupid break-yallus exercise, you're wrong. You absolutely do. Let me just see if I can relate it back to something that hits home a little bit more. Think about the last time you went on a hot date. You knew before you went on that date, there's a specific pair of pants you're going to wear because it really accentuated your bulge. And let's be honest, 50% of that thing is balls. They really probably are a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of some сам dessa thing. Wow. OK. Well, like I said, I took about four pounds. Eight kilograms to four centimeters. Oops, Jeff. So we didn't talk about others and that either, but I knew I was interested in a thousand of, that little thing andthink that you know, right? This would help as much muscles as the bigger calf Yeah. So I got about five times. That way it would be the most positive part because you're going to ask you to do those wrists on the way up because why the hell not? And as you go into the negative, make sure you lock it all the way out because you're going to feel just as much tension at the top. As you do at the bottom, and I guarantee this can be the most pain you've ever felt in the balls of your biceps in your life. So I wanted to go over this next underrated exercise because in terms of chest training, I feel like most people will get complacent. And if you ever see one of my favorite dumbbell chest exercises, where you press those dumbbells together, and so much like a scoop flies you come up and you drive that elbow in at the top, it's largely derived from the fact that I'm too much of an asshole to have friends and I didn't have YouTube growing up. So I had to make up shit, but also from this exercise. And what differentiates this from a simple low cable flies, one we're going to do immune laterally. It's the only way to ensure you get an equal contraction on both sides. You focus on one side at a time, you take the off hand, you grab your boob, and you make sure you get equal engagement. Now the second thing is just like that dumbbell movement, we're going to flare the elbow out and as you come up. So at the bottom you flare it out, as you come up you drive the arm along your body and try to drive the elbow towards your sternum at the top. It's going to engage more of the inner and lower part of your chest. So there's quite a few exercises that by themselves are decent, but when you start to use your body to work against it and actually make it harder in yourself, it goes from being decent to wholly hell it's underrated exercise. And this shoulder example is one of my favorites. And that's taking a traditional front raise and add in a few modifications. The first one is before we even start the movement, when we press those dumbbells together. And you're going to notice right away there's a different level engagement out of those shoulders. Now we're going to widen those knees out because as we come down, we're going to lean back and increase the stretch on those delts and what really screws us is as we contract up, we're going to lean forward and make it that much harder. Now we've turned this decent exercise into one hell of an exercise, into a f*** my life exercise, into a f*** f*** whole f*** ball is f*** exercise. And if you have an ongoing list of underrated things, I add to that baked goods, parks at a Utah and anytime you have the opportunity to take off lottery clothes before you take a shit and feel free to add to the list in the comments below. And if you haven't got a chance to check out the 30-day program, I'll leave a link in the description. It's 30 days, 20 videos, 20 bucks, it's a dollar a day. Also, if you like to California this weekend to buy some more equipment, so we can do a full equipment version of that program. It's going to suck too. And if you haven't got a chance to check out these videos, I'd watch those next, but most importantly, subscribe and hit the notification bell. You can get out through and get growing. Talk to you soon.
