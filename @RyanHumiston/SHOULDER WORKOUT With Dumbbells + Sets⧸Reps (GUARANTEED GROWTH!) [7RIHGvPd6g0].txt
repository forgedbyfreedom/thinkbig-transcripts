Alright, so today's gonna be a little bit different because obviously I'm in the gym and most people don't have access to a gym But I want to give you a little preview of what the course is gonna be like so run through workout and we're still since everybody's limited We're gonna do dumbbell workout only use lightweight hit some shoulders, so let's get after Alright, when start with side laterals, but the way we're gonna do these is partial reps and we're gonna go nice and slow We're gonna go thumbs up the entire time because now I'm doing one of the gates at lateral head But we're gonna start to warm up that posterior delt as well So we're gonna go slightly below parallel Slightly above but the key with this is I want you to focus on actually going back in an angle a little bit too So you're pinching those shoulder blades together squeezing back and up nice control movement Alright, so the way I'm structured today is I'm gonna do two exercise for that lateral head two for posterior delts And then one for that anterior delts just kind of finish it all off but next that we're gonna do a leaning side lateral now The key with this obviously if you don't have a mental health doesn't matter just leaning against the wall Walk this feet a little bit you're trying to create a little bit of an angle with your body just to put more pressure on where that delxly inserts More than the insertion point than higher up in the actual delt and with these I want you to focus on a nice low contraction But not going directly out to the side because usually what happens there's an anterior delt jumps in a little bit or you have more of a tendency Let it drift forward So really actually actively drive it back at an angle a little bit even if you get some of that posterior delt involved That's better than having that anterior delt jump in and take over the entire movement All right next ever doing rotation of the slight lean forward I'm gonna superset those with rear delt flies But we're stay towards the top of the movement doing parcels and a nice slow controlled rep The key with the rotations is obviously a slight lean forward, but really exaggerating the rotation the shoulder itself So as you come in touch those dumbbells together That's can really exaggerate the shoulders rounding and then as you come back make sure you feel like those elbows are glued your body If they drift too wide you're gonna pull in your traps You're gonna get everything else involved, but if you can keep those elbows tucked in the entire time You're gonna fill it jump all the way around. It's gonna run through your entire delt and finish the contraction off in those rear delts All right, so the key with those rear delt parcels is testing because a lot of times You'll do that neutral grip in a feel great sometimes you come in you have no connection whatsoever So for me today it was palms down and it was coming back into arcing motion So the key with this tests and see what feels best another big thing on these is there Are there you air on the side of a smaller partial rep than getting any sort of motion and movement involved whatsoever because a lot of times To see people do these and yeah, they have a ton of weight on them, but they're throwing up the motion They're getting their traps involved so I rather you stay more towards the top the entire time Very small range of motion, but a better connection that rear delt You All right, so we're finished up by hitting those anterior delts, but we're gonna get that entire shoulder involved because we're gonna do Arnale presses, but with these we're gonna do really slow systematically mechanically because we're not gonna do that traditional way of bringing up in front of you and And throwing up the weight we're gonna go 90 degrees slow rotation and keep it on the same plane the entire time and with things I want you to be really conscious about how much that risk controls the rotation of your shoulder So start of the movement you're gonna be staring at your wrist palm facing you and as you rotate I want you to exaggerate even more so instead that palm just facing forward try to turn out even just a little bit more That's gonna get that delton involved and really contract the entire delt not just your anterior delts as you're pressing and for these I rather you fail not getting that press not throwing that press up, but really making sure that you control that movement around and Keep it a 90-degree angle the entire time that's more important to me than the actual press itself All right, so I'm gonna put sets and reps in the description also I'm gonna put a link so you can put your email in there So when the course is ready quarantine gets lifted Let's start kicking ass so as always like subscribe to the notification bell leave a comment in the video me do next and get after get growing I'll talk to you soon you
