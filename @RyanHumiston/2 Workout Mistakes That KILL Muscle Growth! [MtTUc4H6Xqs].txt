So as at the gym today and I noticed what I would consider quite a few mistakes and I'm sure you've seen them too and naturally you're just maternal instinct kicks in and I want to go over these people and help them and just politely say hey hey stop no put it down put it down you go home and think about what you did let me start up by saying that we've all made these mistakes at some point in our lifting career and even if you've moved past them and now you're an advanced lifter don't be surprised if you still end up in one of these categories because bad habits have a way of creeping back in just do me a favor raise your hand self-identify that way we can get you into an after school program and get this taken care of nothing to be ashamed of so that learning centers literally save my life for wasn't for them my days would consist of shoplifting and whippets so the first mistake happens when people design their program are just choose to do exercises and don't factor in their own limitations for instance one of my old clients the first time he came in I said all right just run me through some of your favorite exercises let's just get engaged here form and write to an easy bar started doing close grip curls and they were awful specifically he was so bound up that it put more of a strain on him just to hold the bar in that position then it did do the exercise because to get in that position it'd flare those lats turn those shoulders in and he had such poor risk flexibility that it was just a two inch movement and it went from being a great exercise to really hit that long head too if you saw him behind at the gym you'd think that dude's talking it and that's the trap that most people fall into they choose a phenomenal exercise but there were series of unfortunate events whether it's bad genetics stress in their life or just bad form of a time that eventually catches up they end up dismissing the benefits of that exercise because they're fighting themselves the entire time so instead of be able to sit there and focus on the contraction get that muscle to fire they're trying not to screw it up and they make matters even worse their way of fixing it is just do the same exercise over and over and hope it gets better never does dead lives are good way to illustrate this because if you have great form but you have a small weakness somewhere in that posterior chain and then throughout that set it starts to deteriorate then yeah just doing dead lives repeatedly is going to fix that but that's not usually how bad form presents itself typically it's a bit more obvious because it's not just one issue it's a little bit more blatant in your face because there's 75 different things going wrong with their form and you can easily spot it at the gym because you'll see that glowing hue of the dumpster fire in the distance and as you get closer looks more like a car crash when you're dealing with a litany of issues it's better to break down your form and figure out exactly where your body's failing you then you're going to choose specific exercises that target those areas so you have a weak disappointment of an upper back and the moment you lift off it just crumbles then finding that perfect pin height for some racked-deads is a better option or maybe one of those common cases that the close you get to the ground the more you fall apart and then you have to figure out okay what's my issue is ankle mobility of hip influx ability to have a weak lower back because all of those things require a very different plan of attack so I'm not saying you shouldn't work on movements your bad at or you shouldn't attack your weaknesses but if your limitations are turning a great exercise into a bad one then you need a systematic approach to fix it because in my experience there are no bad exercises only shitty people which brings me the second mistake I wanted to cover today which is going to heavy and this has nothing to do with my own personal bias of valuing connection and volume versus just adding more weight because for some people that absolutely works this is for the people who haven't earned the right yet I need to come for your setup like three in the morning I'm the f***er a lot of people use the weight they can lift in a specific exercise as their way of keeping score it's their measurement of progress and this is where the problem is instead of only increasing the weight after they mastered the previous amount they ended up reaching too high because they're chasing a number and this is easy to spot the person that shouldn't go up and wait when they start to fail their form goes with it and it follows apart the person that should their form stays intact the entire time it's just the muscles involved in that lift can't get the job done pretty tired and think it just swallowed my tongue more of the story your body will humble you if you let it so if you like this video you're going to want to watch these two next and if you got the program happy to have you chest day comes out tomorrow and as always get after get growing doctor soon
