Alright, today we're getting big ridiculous looking lats and if here's aren't growing but in this video you'll know exactly why because we're going very specific detail about certain parts of some of the most common exercises where people's form usually breaks down they lose the connection they end up hitting biceps more anything else so if you're ready Let's get after it. Let me first start by saying these insights are specifically for somebody that just wants to put out muscle it's going to fly in the face of that DVD that came with your perfect pull up, but I don't think that's a bad thing. You probably should never take advice from anything on an infomercial unless you try to live and die like a rock star In that case, Billy Maze is your man and I've talked to Nasi about keeping that element of fixed position so I'm not going to reiterate that here you guys know where I stand there What I do when I cover today is the exact form you should have we're going to fully stretch position when you're at peak contraction or fully contracted and the position or angle of your body Let's first start up by talking about how your form should be in a fully stretched position because I rarely see anybody do this and it makes all the difference and the biggest takeaway is never disengaged at lap and you know when it happens when you start to stretch and you feel it go from your lap to your shoulder to your arm and you're fully straight with that arm doesn't sound like such a bad thing you have to re-engage that lap to pull it down But 99% of people can't do that. They can't drive the force from their hand to their bicep back to their lap You usually just stop right in their bicep and it's a bicep movement and on top of that you're losing your ability really stressed that lap because that point right before your lap disengages You're going to actually push against and driving into that lap so you can get that nice deep stretch If you let it fully extend you lose it so you're going to stop a little bit short keep it engaged really stretch those lats and then pull it back down But it comes to full contraction the lap pull down This is where it appears me that everybody has some sort of weird fetish about getting that bar to touch their nipples by any means necessary Because your lats are only pull that bar down so far and they're going to stop The only way to get it all the way down is by rolling those shoulders and pulling those biceps into it And you obviously don't want that if you do you have horrible decision making skills So you only want to contract down as far as those lats will let you know further You're not going to test that chest or definitely not going to touch those nipples So save that for later The next question is okay, where should that handle be because I'm sure you've seen people where they have that handle way out in front We're like a full face pull we can answer that by going for last thing which is position or angle of your body because it's really an efficient To train those lats on a fixed path. I don't care what angle your body's at if you're pulling straight down You're working against your body's natural biomechanics and on top of that if you factor in that I want you to keep the elbow in a lock position the entire time it just can't happen So what you have to do is get some movement of all to get the most of your lap pull down So during the negative portion movement you're lean forward and force that stretch And during the positive you're going to lean back and handside contraction and just as important You're following the natural arc your lats the elbows and a fixed position and you don't have to guess where your hands are going to be They're just going to naturally fall with their supposed to fall Just me or do I sound like I've ever reverted back to my four-year-old self and a minute and go get us all day I think I have some sort of strep throat But everything and She could die and I mean now when it comes to pull-ups a lot of the same things apply and I know some people just in a achievement to get 20 pull-ups or Military training so they have to go all the way up all the way down But just know that top of the movement There's no way your lats can pull you that high it has to be shoulder has to be bicep So if that's important to you that's a totally different style of training for me I'm my whole training is about taking the inefficiency out of certain movements and isolating down to whatever muscle you're trying to work And so obviously not pulling yourself all the way up with your biceps and shoulders So one of the stretch on these it's still argue that it's better not to disengage those lats because these are even harder to reengage than pull downs You could screw up so bad that you actually even get your traps involved and you're still going to get that movement involved But to what severity has to put on the grip you take because with really wide grip you're still going to follow the natural arc your lats But you're only able to bring those elbows in so far so the top of the movement you're still fairly straight up and down Now when you bring those elbows all the way in for a closed grip or a reverse grip Now you can really start to follow the natural arc your lats So you're going to feel like you're pulling those handles around your body Well, so like you're touching your stomach to the ceiling They just follows the natural arc a little bit better both great movements Close grip is going to feel like you can really Contract a little bit easier have better connection to it wide grip if you can do it It's actually harder could be better for you. It's just more advanced way of doing it Just so you know when I work with somebody on this we start with that closed grip. It's a little bit easier It's more natural and then we start working wider and wider until we get to the point where it's that wide grip I'll go slightly tucked in and they're right back to second edit I wasn't going to go over barbell pullovers and one arm rows But I think you need to go home and drain my face not with a netty pot because Whatever human invented the fact that you pour hot water in your nose and the snout comes out of your mouth is pretty sick Probably the same one that likes to touch the barbell to their nips It's not okay.
