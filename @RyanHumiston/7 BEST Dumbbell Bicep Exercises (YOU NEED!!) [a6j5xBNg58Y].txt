All right today we're grabbing some dumbbells and going over some bicep curls that you probably've never done before and then a few that you definitely have but we're gonna make them even worse So if you're ready, let's get after it All right, let's first go over traditional curls to make sure not making the big mistake I see most people make which is no matter what the cost they're gonna get it up which is admirable I'm sure tenor dates really appreciate that about you, but in terms of growing that bicep it's not gonna do much because inevitably what happens is as that bicep gets tired And you're trying to force it all the way up. There's no way to get there. So you have to get that shoulder involved and unless that was your horrible plan from the start Let's try to avoid it, but we don't have to focus on the shoulder All we have to do is simply focus on where that elbow is so if you're doing a curl wear your arms right by your side As long as you keep the elbow tucked into place and there's no movement It's gonna be all your bicep. So then the question is what should arrange a motion beam and my argument is you should push as much blood as you possibly can those biceps That as you go through the exercise it actually shortens for example I start out with three quarter reps because I don't see a benefit in pushing the extreme ends of the range of motion I like the very bottom where you almost have to actually push to stretch or the very top Where there's really not much of a difference in the contraction. So they start out three quarters But my goal is to push so much blood there by the second set that they turn into half reps and that same stretch that you got before You actually can't get because you can't stretch any further and you definitely can't contract up any higher because your bicep won't let you And yeah, you might have a hard time washing your hair tonight or wiping your ass But it'll just be a lesson how versatile your garden hose is You All right next up we got drag curls and in my mind you got some options because anytime you put a dumbbell on a string and pull back in a straight line That's a drag curl So you've got the traditional arm to your side pulling straight up, which is a phenomenal exercise But for most people their shoulders are so bound up that it turns into something else entirely They end up looking like a creep in the corner of the gym run the risk of getting kicked out So instead you can put that dumbbell right to your knee and pull back on a straight line and get a phenomenal contraction Went in doubt take it to the extreme hopping in the inclined and pull straight it from there I have no doubt you have a great connection to these, but yeah, you're gonna look at an asshole So if you didn't grow up wearing janko jeans and drawn stuces all over everything You're not ready for this So you guys know me. I'm basically a giant 10 year old So any exercise that resembles a right at Disneyland I'm all about it. I don't know what these are called, but I'm assuming it's something great because anything that makes you look You're having a nervous breakdown has to be named something epic and I've talked about these before But I'm also gonna show you another variation in day that I think's even worse And the ideas you're actually gonna leave that dumbbell in place and mostly work around it So as you go in that negative you lean back, put all that pressure on your bicep to hold and stabilize that weight And as you can track up you barely move that dumbbell, but you lean into it Maybe that contraction even worse and this sock and another way to utilize this movement is with hammer curls I like to do them standing, but also like to lock those elbows into my stomach So it's just that bicep working no shoulders involved and it's also a great way to make people feel uncomfortable Just find the closest corner at your gym go stand in it and make sure when you're doing them you look back Really up to creep factor In just in case you didn't feel like that long head's getting enough love We're gonna finish with pinwheels now go what to think about these is just categorize I'm like a drag curl that'll help you get your form right, but the ideas you're pulling that dumbbell straight up Flaring that elbow out to the sides of that shoulders turned in So it's mostly that long head and as you finish off that contraction You're gonna really drive and cock that wrist out and it's gonna really f*** up that long head So if you haven't got a chance to check out the 30-day program I'll link that below It's 30 days 20 videos 20 workouts it's 20 bucks and you're gonna get your ass kicked And if you like this bicep video I'll link to another one here also another one of my favorite triceps But most importantly subscribe hit that notification bell and get after it get growing Dr. Soon
