Do you want rounder and wider shoulders? Then this is the most important video you're ever gonna watch because I've spent the last six months in the lab Trying to make my training even more efficient the lab is just a dumb way of saying I've been working out a lot in my garage and reading a crap load of case studies And it still amazes me that the more information I gather and the more I know the more I realize There's a lot of shit that I didn't know for example the lateral head of my delts has grown more in the last three months Than at any other point in my training career and that's all due to a tweak in my form because now I believe There is a definitive right way to do side lateral. So don't believe me. I'm gonna use this guy to help prove my point Which is gonna be a bit difficult because He's been through a lot Now everyone categorizes the deltoid muscle by its heads the anterior lateral and posterior And what separates them and allows them to be categorizes their own individual head is that each of them have their own Separate intermuscular tendon that insert into the humoral shaft Sorry about that. It's not you. It's me It's you here's a question for you since we know it has three separate insertions. How many different points of origin are there? Say it with me now 7 it has freaking 7 the reason that's so important is found in this case study where they look at how those seven segments originate and Their function and what they found is that and what they found is that the deltoid originates up the spine of the scapula The acromion and the clavicle, but not how I thought this is a top down view of my right shoulder and how it's segmented based upon that case study The first thing you're gonna notice is that medial segment, but it makes up your side delt is actually a very small percentage Now obviously all the segments are gonna work in conjunction to create abduction of your arm But that should give you the first aha moment those giant wide bolder shoulders that you would gladly throw your mom in front of A bus for aren't so much the lateral head of your doubt They're actually a lot of anterior delts because that mean we should start pressing more to get wider shoulders No, that won't target those fibers either what I'm saying is that if you're doing lateral raises directly out to the side That's a mistake now before I go into a step-by-step break down of what I feel is the optimal way to do side Laterals based upon this knowledge I had people DM me them doing lateral raises just to see if anybody And neatly did them correctly don't ever ask anybody to DM you anything there was dicks everywhere Nope, definitely not this is the classic old man side lateral that you'll see it every single gym not correct But I appreciate you fitting the stereotype all right big man not not correct But I appreciate you sending that this is by far the closest one, but it could be better Everything starts with your hand because it dictates the internal and external rotation of your shoulder You can see that if I supinate my palm I've now put my shoulder into external rotation if I do a lateral raise in that position It's all anterior delt but not the segments that we're trying to target It's the one that comes off the clavicle and you could just target that with presses I understand that for some people That's their only option because their shoulders are so dysfunctional. That's the only side laterals they can do That sucks the correct way which is gonna sound crazy at first But it will make sense is by Proteating your palm and internally rotating your shoulder what that does is perfectly align the segments that actually make up your lateral head Base to find that case study which are all the ones that come off the acromion So you can see we're now targeting all the way back to the posterior segment that comes off the backside of your chromium Which they called P1 all the way to the anterior segments a three a two and actually limiting the activation of a one Which comes off your clavicle because it can't really fire in this position And before anybody freaks out. Yes, we are creating an impingement if you try to internally rotate your shoulder and go directly out to the side you can That's because your humoral head actually jams up in your chromium Terring up all your rotator cuff muscles and if you did that over a period of time you would grind them like cheese There's a better example what that looks like internally rotate in and then grind those rotator cuff muscles like your back at a seventh grade dance Again, we're not going directly out to the side I just had to reiterate how the shoulder works because I know somebody's going to watch this and say actually I feel the best connection when I internally rotate my shoulder and go directly out That's not a mind muscle connection those are micro tears That's bad we're staying in the scapular plane and the easiest way to understand where that is just put your arms out to your side And pretend there's a camera looking directly down on you your first thoughts gonna be why I look like a dumbass How did I ever trick a woman into sleeping with me and then you're gonna bring your arms towards your center at about 30 to 45 degrees That's scapular plane You oddly shaped weird out my favorite variation is the one on the incline bench It's roughly around 75 degrees because it puts you at the perfect position makes you control the weight and allows you to just focus on what your arms are doing That's all you have to do just don't mess that up and you will grow you're probably still gonna mess it up though And that's because for a lot of people this is gonna be an uncomfortable movement because they have poor internal rotation You can test that by pinning your shoulders of the wall and seeing if you can push your arm past parallel to the floor if you can't Yes suck If that's you then I would start every single workout with this stretch What you're gonna do is wrap a van around something lander side and with your off-hand You're gonna force yourself into internal rotation that's an important part because we want to put those tight internal rotators in a shortened position But not try to get them any stronger We're gonna force them into the position and then eccentrically load and fight that stretch Basically, it's a P&F stretch so it's perfectly safe to do you can do this every single day until you fix your problem It shouldn't take long and less you're really suck. I'm back to the incline variation because I think there's some very important cues I can give you to help guarantee success and cues is hard to say The first one is that as your arms raised up it should feel like you're pouring out jugs of water or milk Doesn't matter. I would choose milk. That should remind you to not only maintain internal rotation But also make sure your elbow is leading the movement your hand should never come higher than your elbow If you have trouble maintaining that form grab a strap like this or one of the ankle ones women use for training their glutes and put it above your elbow and Practice that form and yeah, this alone is a viable exercise The other thing I want you to take note of is shoulder elevation and just so we're clear It's not a bad thing in fact is part of the scapula humoral rhythm It's a functional part of how your shoulder should do a lateral raise, but it depends on what elevates your shoulder the incorrect way Which is what most people do is either engage their trap before they start the movement or just naturally engage it as they go Your traps should not elevate your shoulder the proper way actually comes from your lats as you flare out that drives your shoulder up But also disengages that trap and I understand this is gonna feel a little awkward at first But I guarantee once you master it you're never gonna have your traps jump in and ruin your life again Interesting note when I did all the EMG testing one of the things I wanted to figure out is what exercises were really trapped on me Because that's the complaint that everybody has Side later was in the scap they're playing ended up being one of the best exercises to do meaning that had some of the highest Activation of the delts while still maintaining low engagement of the traps So pairing that information with how we now know the delts are actually segmented and function in the orientation of those fibers It'd be hard for me to do anything but lateral raises in the scap your plane going forward and once you've mastered that the next step is to move on to standing Grab some heavier dumbbells and move some weight around But again, make sure you maintain that same exact path because that actually targets the segments that are the side delt Not the side that we thought was actually the side that's actually very small. It's the anterior side the side that we've been neglecting for the last 20 years And the reason we didn't have big boulder fucking shoulders if you guys are interested We can do a whole series like this Where we go body part by body part really getting into the grid of it because for me It's made one hell of a difference as always programs a link below again. They're shutting down soon So if there's one of them you want to kick your own ass with I would get it now You won't lose access, but I'm creating something that'll drop around October 1st that everybody's been asking for that's why
