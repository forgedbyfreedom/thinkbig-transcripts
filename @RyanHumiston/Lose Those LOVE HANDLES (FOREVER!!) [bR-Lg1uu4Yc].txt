All right, today we're going over how to get rid of those love handles so you can kiss that big beautiful muffin top that bulges out of your skin and jeans goodbye. So if you're ready. Let's get after it. So this video came about because I still get a ton of messages for people asking hey what's the best exercise to get rid of these love handles and why don't watch everybody else's content. I've seen some of the titles the ones like the best seven minute muffin top workout that will literally melt fat and make your junk threunches bigger. So safe to assume that there's a hefty bag full of bull-f*** being served and I hate to be the bear bad news as much as like to come up with a creative exercise as in workouts I can't reach between my cheeks and pull out an exercise that's gonna magically make you less of a juggling mess So I'm gonna break this video down into three parts first going over the most effective diets you can follow to trim that waistline I'll give you the pros and cons of each then I'll give you some tips and hacks you can use to make it easier not to screw up said diet and Finally go over the truth about training your beliefs are let's first start with the carps cycling Usually don't with the high medium and low carbohydrate day now the high day is hypercolarch You're getting about two to two and a half grams of carbohydrates per pound of body weight the medium day is basically maintenance calories about a half gram per pound of body weight And the low day is an I hate my life calorie deficit no carb day But anybody who's ever done this before knows you get the best results on the extreme ends So just having high and low carb days going from hypercolarch to hypos is gonna get you the best results All right pros and cons one of the benefits is you can program those high days around your most demanding body parts So your legs your back or you can use them to feel the workouts of your lagging body parts in attempt to bring them up Also, it's just an incredibly effective way to diet and for the cons It's hardest to have a stick to on the high carb days You can be gigantly like a school girl on the low carb days You can be tempted to go lay in the middle of the street you also have to give up junk food as a whole because there's really no place for garbage calories And it's like this and just a little aside the benefits you're gonna receive from those really high carb days and feeling your workouts You might not see for the first two weeks because your stomach will not be used to those carbohydrates You can spend half the workout blowing them out in the bathroom. All right next up We got intermittent fasting and this is one of my favorite diets for people that are roughly this big and Bigger because it's tough to screw up the most common way to do it is a 16-8 which is a 16-hour fast 8-hour window now That's really good towards the general population that start their day off by butt chugging a foreign calorie drink from Starbucks the better ways to do it are the warrior diet, which is a 20-hour fast for our window or Whatever's cooler than a warrior where you do a 23-hour fast and just one giant meal if you don't get a name it I will call it the mega-chode so some of the pros are like I said It's pretty hard to screw up, but also you can get away with eating some not so great things during your window like a whole F***ing low-fibred and still get results also You're gonna enjoy a consistent amount of energy throughout the day because you're not screwing with your blood sugar So you won't be sitting in the corner or looking like your jam and out by yourself and the biggest con is there's no way to get the amount of protein You need to put on muscle during your window and even if you could there's no way to utilize all that So the only thing you can hope for is to maintain your muscle mass while you're dropping body fat little side note Anytime I've done this myself or advise somebody else always have him push their eating window towards the end of the day And you get the same results and you're gonna be able to sleep at night if you try to push your eating window in the morning Good luck sleeping through those hunger pains and tears and last but not least because this is my go-to A keto style of diet now traditionally this is done where you have high fat moderate protein Basically no carbs the macro percentages work out to be something like 70% fat 25% protein and then 5% carbs because Those stupid trace carbs are everywhere But instead I found that if you focus less on trying to get yourself into cittosis and instead on just getting good Monocerated fats as your energy source you're gonna get better results and you definitely don't have to worry about me being biased because all diet suck Now the pros of this one are you're gonna feel more associated throughout the day because you have fat with every single meal Also you can program and cheat meals or in my case an entire cheat day and it makes it so it's a diet You can do in perpetuity and the cons are by the end of the week. You're gonna hit a wall hard by the time you get to that refeed meal You're definitely gonna need it also you're gonna have to learn how to train with your pent up hangar as your energy source because you really don't have much But fat and that's not the same as delicious carbs tip number one Which is the most important when it comes and losing those love handles is of those three diets Which one can you do without fail? Which one can you do consistently without falling off even if it yields you less results? Because it'll get you further in the long run and everybody's different. I know for me personally I can't do carbs cycling eventually I F*** it up I start justifying crazy things once you get a little carbs in my stomach Next thing I know I'm in the kitchen bottomless making rice crispy treats tip number two throw away all the junk in your house And if you're gonna sit there and say I can't my kids love gold fish crackers No shit all kids love gold fish crackers one of the best experiences I ever had was working with a single mom who had four kids who wanted to Entire family to start eating healthier, but more specifically one of the daughters was not gifted with the same genetics that everybody else got And she was a hundred pounds overweight. So I went over there with the 50 gallon trash can put it in the center of the kitchen I said alright, we're gonna throw away all your junk food and I said my profus it. I said don't worry It's not a waste if you throw it away. It was a waste when you bought it at first the kids were hesitant The first one to do it reached into the pantry. Grab some mac and cheese stirred their mom the entire time and slowly Softly put it in there, but by the end of it I had the mom jumping off the counter slam dunk and bagels in there because they all had fun with it But on top of that in empowered the girl who's suffering the most But it also opened up the conversation of you know what's really going on because at that level It's not just on having you know seconds and thirds more we're eating you get a whole buffet under your bed Which brings me the last tip get somebody to hold you accountable if you have a partner Just have that conversation to say hey. I want to clean up my act now because I want to cheat on you with a prettier person I'm just tired of looking like this or even better just tag me on Instagram I'll check the post and then I'll recheck in a month from now and if you're still a chubby mess I'll let you know and this with the question or the hot topic that everybody talks about should you actually train your obliques Depends if you're actually gonna fall through with a diet and get the results Then yeah, you actually see more definition you'll build those obliques up more, but if you're just a habitual failure of diets No, it's just gonna make your waist block here and your obliques are one of the easiest to train You can hit him in that transverse plan you could go side crunch you can grab a single handle and do a slight twist It's all gonna work because that's not the biggest issue the issue is your shit diet And I've said this before you can't out crunch a shit diet So if you haven't got a chance to check out the 30-day program where everybody is just flooring themselves It's a pretty incredible group of sick individuals.
