are today we're hitting abs because even though there are set of muscles that really don't give you how hard you train them and whether or not you see results is dependent on what you're shoving in your face we still got to hit them so one undo does efficiently as possible let's get after it. V-ups are a great exercise but not for everybody for some that violent jolting back and forth puts a good stress on those abs and they can really have a great connection to them for others it's just a matter of time before they blow a disc right out of their ass so we can shorten the range of motion to make it a little bit safe for an allow those hips to tilt back and forth during the movement but still make it just as effective by adding a weight to our hands and feet and I want to make sure breathing correctly on all the exercises we're doing today because I see a lot of people try to use the same technique they used to brace themselves for a squat or a heavy deadlift and try to apply that to abs this is not that you're not clenching down after never-ending possum breaststicks and olive garden you got to breathe through the movement I start breathing out before even start the contraction and try to time it perfectly to have most of the air out of my lungs before those abs are fully flexed it's going to keep you safer it's going to keep you're from full and over to whatever distension you just created but it's also going to create more of an intense contraction let me take a quick second thanks Skillshare for sponsoring this video there obviously notice that I still wear the same shirts that I didn't sixth grade thought this guy could use the deal appreciate that if you're sitting there saying I don't think there's anything for me to learn on there you're wrong Skillshare's class is a design for real life problems let me ask you this how many times you've almost cut off your finger prepping your own food yeah me too that's what they have an entire course on knife skills so people like us don't end up with a nickname stubby or like the guy from yesterday they couldn't use their course on body language to tell that I wasn't really interested in making new friends what was in the gym bathroom peeing I'm currently taking one on drone photography by wall rabbit productions because the first time I got this thing I just turned it on see if I get it to hover and then I proceeded to smash it right into the wall because of the course I'm getting better but I still can't believe they let you fly these things I feel like at any moment I'm the loose control of it it's going to follow this guy and just take out some poor unexpected old lady Skillshare's an online learning community with thousands of classes for curious and creative people there's no ads they're always launched new premium classes and it's less than 10 bucks a month with an annual subscription the first thousand people to click the link in my description get a free trial of Skillshare's premium membership all right we're hitting the floor because sitting on your ass is one of the hardest things you can do for abs and you got some options you can bring the stopwatch and death into it time yourself and make it a static contraction by tilting back and just holding those feet up or you can make an active movement by bringing those knees in and out or you can bring those a bleaks into it kicking them side to side like a bicycle all equally as horrible just have to choose what you're trying to target this is probably how I'm in a trick kids out of their candy this year I bet you you're a bag of candy for my bowl that you can't sit on the ground hold your feet up for a minute oh I feel bad you know what you're going to ahead and keep those smarties in a little. One thing I do all the time because one it's just easy to set up but two it's one of the best ways to do controlled movements in that transverse plane really get more activation out of those abs and no bleaks is just set up a single handle on a high cable pulley I either set up square it off to the machine or to 45 degree angle but the contraction still the same it's down in a slight twist and make sure as you do these you're not driving forward take a step back and I want you to feel like you're pulling that handle towards your body. All right last but not least you're going to hate me for these ones so the idea here is you're going to have your legs elevated the entire time you have to burn your hands and at the same time you're a slightly drop your legs until that bar back but not too far because you don't want that lower back to lift off the ground from there you're going to crunch and bring them both together and try to lift those shoulders off the ground and pretend like you're touching your toes you're not going to be able to but you can dream.
