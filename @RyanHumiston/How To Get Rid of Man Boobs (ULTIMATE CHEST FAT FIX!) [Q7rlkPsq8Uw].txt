All right, today we're going to the most underappreciated part of every dad bod you know the one the man boobs and I'm right there in this camp on my body Fickets over a certain percentage I don't know how to test it. I'll just be the grocery store and some may walk up and try to milk me and if I wasn't so offended I let him now the obvious fix of this is just get revolved your friends I down to ridiculous to low percentage of body fat and stay there for the rest of your life, but there's a more sustainable and faster way to get rid of those glorious others So if you're ready, let's get after it. Let me start up by saying if you're dealing with actual mass of tissue or an apple is That's a surgical issue this video is not gonna help, but for most men That's not the case. They just develop an excess amount of fat around their chest either because their mom told them that every time they have sugar Just have a diet soda and they'll cancel each other at which obviously didn't work or because they had a genetic lottery And their body is exceptional and a romanticizing testosterone, but either way they got a move problem And the fastest way to fix this is by pairing two things together Obviously a diet that's going to decrease your body fat, but also chest training that really targets that lower and outer part of your pack And before anybody says you can't do that and dictate what part of your chest grows more than another I completely disagree and if you're one of those people need a case study to believe anything Just use yourself as an example hold that arms straight up in flexure chest. Obviously it's hard to connect that lower part of your pack Now drop it down do the same thing congratulations You're done just by doing that you can see and feel that certain movements are gonna stimulate specific muscle fibers more than others in the same muscle If you're sitting there thinking this guy has no idea how many goals starts and gotten kindergarten how smart I am I've already thought of this I've been doing it. It's not working if that's the case You're probably not connected to that chest as well as you could be and you're doing things like dips or a declime bench And the anterior delts you're just taking over those movements So when you go everything from cables to no equipment whatsoever And how to really connect to that lower and outer part of your chest all right So we're starting off with cables and if anterior delts are the reason your chest isn't growing then Unilateral work is the way to go because it's more than just flexing your chest and focusing on one side Compared to both there's a lot more going on you try to flex that chest to the anterior delts out of the movement Figure out what position to put your elbow and it gets you the best contraction what angle or path to take I'm gonna try to do that on both sides Even though the both sides are built differently and they're gonna take different tweaks to have that great connection That's a difficult task regardless how many f***ing goals stars you got one of the best ways I found for cables is setting up at chin heights That way can come down in about a 45 degree angle. I step away from the machine to get a nice deep stretch And I also have a supinated grip because if I try to go pronated And a triceps has not today. I'm trying to jump in take over so supinated and have a great connection When it comes to dumbbell work it'd be nice if we all had a declime bench in our garage But most gyms don't even have a good declime bench. They have one set of for abs and try to go take some dumbbells over there You have to throw them back and risk your life or you do curls off the floor You know I'm talking about but in reality you just have to be resourceful because even at the gym sometimes I'll make my own declime bench by sitting on my feet and track them abs to stabilize myself and in reality I'm not using much weight, so it's perfectly safe and do it a mix between a barrel press and a fly movement always using the best connection So like I promised we're finished out for the moment. You don't need any equipment for it So reverse grip push up with the twist we're doing it off a bench where I do one set of time Rep it out keep that connection and then switch benefit here You can dictate how much weights on your chest by how much you lean into it Really limit those secondary muscles jumping in but also you can make sure that chest is leading the moment A lot of times with something like dips once that shoulder jumps in your screwed With these you can pull those shoulders back for such a nice and tall and as you drive up twist and flex all day from the outer pack all the way to the inner part of your chest So if you like this video make sure you watch these two next if you haven't seen them most importantly Makes you subscribe hit that notification bell and get after get growing talk to you soon
