Alright, today we're ranking at top eight chest exercises because everybody else has made one of these videos so why not? Also have a different take because I could care less about strength. I only train for hypertrophy, so if you're getting sick and tired of stuffing your broth full of toilet paper, this'll fix that. Let's get after it. Now understand, some people really need a strong chest because the only way their kids ever gonna be proud of them is that they get invited to show and tell They show up in the wrestling shoes with a fanny pack in the bench 405 for the entire third grade to see But I'd argue it'd be a little bit easier just to go to all their damn t-ball games and just so you know there's no bad exercises on this list only people with bad form that suck at doing these exercises So that's not how I ranked them. I ranked them based on how easy it is for people to have a connection and get results But also go over the things you can do to get even more out of them. I'm already sweating profusely. I need fucking pickle juice number eight Incline barbell dumbbells or even Smith now. I've seen a lot of people say that this severity of the incline makes all the difference But I could give two shits because the reason that people usually prefer dumbbells is the same reason that angle really doesn't matter because when you're using a dumbbell Really promotion put the elbow to 45 degree angle actually flex your chest and actually drive your elbow in on the way up And if you were a retraining buddy in person and how to do an incline at any angle You know what happens first thing they do Elbows go to the ears like they're getting in cold water and they don't want chili nips But if you really start paying attention to what your elbows are doing and actually flexing your chest and driving that elbow in doesn't matter if you're using a barbell Dombells or what the angle the bench is you're gonna get more activation of that chest and less anterior adults part of the reason I sweats so much It's not easy to grease in here the other reason my body knows that I'm a little fat kid at heart and tomorrow's the day I eat nothing but shit So it has to get ready for the fact that I'm gonna wake up and eat fucking Chinese food from breakfast I'm that disgusting number seven coffin presses now I really like this one because unless you have a lot of patrons on one of those other social media sites It's one of those rare times you get to squeeze those cans together and really flex the inner part of your chest But make sure you keep the elbow tucked your side the entire time because the same mistake you can make on an incline by flaring the elbow too high And getting the anterior don't involved you can do here So keep those elbows tucked your side drag them along your body the entire time and really flex those melons number six dumbbell flies and I know You're scared to do these but if you can't get over this fear How you ever gonna put a table up in front of the grocery store and ask perfect strangers to buy two boxes girl scout cookies It's not gonna happen and yeah if you keep your arm perfectly straight You deserve all the bad things are gonna happen to you but we have elbows for a fucking reason and for the people that say these are an efficient because you lose tension after a certain point Easy fix just don't come up as high keep constant tension Do part of the bottom I've also seen somebody recommend holding a rubber band with those dumbbells I carry scissors for people like you number five cable flies now obvious benefit you can hit your chest from every single angle but Even more important than that if you're one of those people that doesn't have a mind muscle connection with your chest Sitting front of this thing for a half hour and start experimenting I guarantee you're gonna walk away with one something I try is just grabbing a single handle and focusing on one side at a time because more often than not One pack has a great connection and the other one does it and it's screwing up for the rest of the team So try to figure out what's going on is that shoulder rolling forward is your trap jumping in Are you not flexing your chest at all because when you focus on one side at a time you can figure it out two is too many Unless you're talking about girl scout cookies It's never enough number six barrel presses Number four barrel presses now these are great for people that piss their pants at the thought of doing dumbbell flies and you still get that horrible Terring feeling you do with the fly and you actually can increase the stretch by opening up the elbow a little bit more than 90 But at the end of the day it's still a press so you get to kick your ass and that old fashioned kind of way Number three machine flies now these are such a winner for me because it doesn't matter what part of your chest You're trying to target you can do it on here and with the inner part of your chest do parcels at the top You want that upper chest just grab higher in those handles you want the lower chest decline movement tilt back This machine is so good that if you want to exercise it look like one of those hybrid fish babies that they advertise in the back Accutane you could do it you could start the movement as a press and as you come up turn it into a fly and then Tilt back and finish it off more of a decline movement it's pretty damn phenomenal fish babies That's a much now at this point in your life your shoulders are basically your surrogate mother They tell you what you can and can't do so the order of these last two might be different for you But let's pretend for a second that your shoulders like your mom don't care what you do because She's too busy at the casino gambling the mortgage away So for me number two has to be decline dumbbell presses because these are hard to screw up even if you flare those elbows out too much You're still gonna get a lot of activation of that chest. I don't think I think of as Actually picking up the dumbbells you could hurt yourself, but in that case you deserve it and number one dips now can a lot of things go wrong Absolutely you can loosen your shoulders your triceps, but for me the risk is worth a reward because nothing tears your chest up like dips do and All you have to remember is just lead with that chest and even if you can't get any Jumping yourself up and fighting that negative will do more for you than 99% of other chest exercises as well So if you haven't got a chance to take out the 30-day full gym program or the garage one just depending on limited you are They both will destroy you 30 days 20 videos 20 bucks.
