Alright, today we're hitting legs again because why not? We're all sick individuals here and specifically I'm gonna give you some things to think about as you're training legs really connect with them even more, get more growth out of them. So don't you worry little buddy, I'm gonna get you out of those skinny jeans. I can't bring them up! So there's a lot of people who say that squats at the end I'll be offered a development. The little baby Jesus of Leg exercises but for me, I don't prescribe it to that religion. I think there's a lot better exercises you can do to really get more development out of your legs and not just me personally but most people watching this because most people are gonna have lower back issues, impingements or just your form is just and you don't really get the most out of squats because you'll see people the gym doing squats, they'll do it three or four sets, they walk away, acting like they killed it but you see them and they look like they're about to spit out their spine. I don't think you hit your legs there bud. For me, a better compound moment is when you can overload just as much but when you can also dictate what part of leg has to move the majority of that weight. So it's less about all the other muscles working you can judge to get the job done and more about narrowing in that focus for a specific group of muscles and making them work even harder. So today we're going to kick our own ass with walking lunges. So that number one, take up your new shoes, you're going to screw them up if you don't. So the reason I want to go over these is because obviously I said it's a phenomenal exercise but also I see a lot of people do these at the gym, they don't really put much thought into them, they kind of just go through the motions but if you're a little bit more methodical with how you do these, you're going to get even better results and for me the best way to do these are weighted and specifically using a barbell. Now because it's just a texture breathing I mean it's just that much harder on your body and you'll get much swing because with dumbbells if that's all you have and that's all you can do, fine use those but I would suggest you throw them up and do lunges that way because when you're hanging them down you can get a little movement to it and you actually lift yourself up and if fake weights your thing, use those. So if we're going to make this a quad down in a movement there's a couple things we're going to do to make that happen. First thing is we've got a shift that knee over the toe it's going to put more of a stretch on that quad. Next thing is you're going to lean that back slightly forward again that's going to put more tension on the quad but also it's going to inhibit your hamstrings ability to pull you off the bottom it's going to take that out of the equation and finally the most important thing is as you're driving through this you're not going to come all the way up it's three quarters the way up because you want constant tension it's better air on the side of being too low than too high because if you come all the way up you can rest a little bit we don't want that and then from there it's just going to do some deep dart place in your subconscious mind I would suggest some sort of childhood trauma and use that to get you through this pain. Let me take a quick second and thank Skillshare for sponsoring this video because after the last couple of ad reads I thought for sure they're going to be like nope we're not doing that again so it's nice to know that some big company still let the decision making executives drink on the job. The biggest hurdle I got to get over is you're going to say I heard it last time I know skills here on an ordinary community thousands of inspiring classes for curious and creative people you can learn new skill deep in a passion but here's the thing I know you took the merch class from Draftland but still yet no merch and here's the thing I did but that phrase with a great power comes great responsibility kept ringing in my head and at this point in my life I don't want to take any responsibility for my actions I just don't think it will be ready for me to have my horrible CD personality but more allies than assured and that's the cool thing about skills here all their classers designed for real life and all the circumstances that come with it and it's inspiring stuff for instance my favorite book of all time start with why by Simon Sending incredible book it's reason I developed the channel the way I did why I asked you what you want to see next and you say I just make it because of that book he's got a course on there it's all about influence and connected with people so if you ever want to make a YouTube channel I would watch that because it doesn't have to be about fitness there's a guy who makes a ton of money just traveling around different miniature golf courses no joke it's curated for learning there's no ads and they're constantly adding new premium classes so you can follow wherever your creativity takes you honestly I got lost in some ladies minimalist interior design class no business being in there pretty good and it's less than 10 bucks a month with annual subscription this is the cool action part the first thousand of my subscribers click the link in the description we'll get a two month free trial of their premium membership so you can explore your creativity yeah now if you're target in hamstrings and glutes you actually want to lunge as if you're as tall as that bullshit height you told everyone your tender matches because you really want to exaggerate your step that where your hamstring has to pull you up through the moment now with your back you guys want to keep it nice and straight but as you start to drive up you're going to lean back to pull that hamstring into it and then finish off in the glute and then just as important you're actually going to flip your toe over and drag it all the way up because that'll help you stay stable throughout the moment but also help you finish that contraction off by flexing the hamstring but also really contracting that glute leaning back flexing as hard as you can at the top and then going into that next step now if inner thigh thickness is one of your problems I'd actually step out of the 45 degree angle and then pull up from there it's going to pull more of those adductors into it and eventually kill that thigh gap another cool thing about what we just talked about with walking lunges a lot of those principles being on shift the focus and choose what muscle dominates the moment also applies to step ups which for some reason I don't see a lot of guys doing step ups I don't know why it's a great exercise might have something to do with those skinny jeans which brings me into another point have you seen guys where tights to the gym in the training legs? nobody wants to see that man or woman no woman just looks that goes the tights on that guy doesn't happen sorry who sells those who would sell you who would sell who would design those and sell those so the target quadz and glutes you're going to end up with a tallest step you have at the gym because before you even start the moment you want your quadness stretch position that way you can lean forward release stretch that glute knee for more and then drive up from there and before you do every single rep you re-engage it the same way leaning forward put that stress and then drive up so hopefully your gym has a smaller step up as well because that's what you need to do the hamstring glute version which I'm going to go over next I just didn't want you get too focused on the goofy pad that I'm doing step ups on because that's all we have and honestly I don't think this is a piece of equipment this is one of those things that moms buy for their little kids when they're rough housing that way little Timmy doesn't power bond the next door neighbor is hearty as he possibly can and break his neck so to make it more hamstring center we're going to step back nice and far and every rep make it sure that ham has to pull you off the bottom and then from there it's just rotating over top that hip and then finishing it off in the glute the knee chest and maybe let us go well you want to get to a van that one kicked me right in the end so I'll start filming some of those Q&As later this week I just thought there were a lot of those questions deserve more than one or two sentences they need a little more context could be a whole video but there was one that stood out there was nothing else but dot dot dot I don't like this guy's personality I don't blame you I wouldn't like me either so as always likes to subscribe to the notification bell make sure you leave a comment I read them all I just I can't get back to everybody it is just not so many people comment on these things get after you get growing I'll talk to you soon
