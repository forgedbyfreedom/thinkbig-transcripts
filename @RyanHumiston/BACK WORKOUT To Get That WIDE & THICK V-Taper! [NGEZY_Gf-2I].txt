are today we're hitting back and I love it's because I'm constantly fighting out the inner soul that makes up the majority of my personality or because it takes a concerted effort for me to be a good human but I realize I haven't done a full back day in a long time which is incredibly important because if I asked you if you wanted wider lats or thicker back or more of a V taper your answer would be yes so let's stop wasting time let's get after so back is one of those body parts I can never just walk in hit two three exercises call it a day it's just not enough for me it's composed of two different muscles to the point where you can break it down in his sections but without being said I would never split up back training I know a lot of people like to do lats on one day and then pair mid back and lower back with something else to me that's disgusting and some of this baddest training quads and biceps together feel that vomit it's coming so today I'm gonna be a little bit more succinct on the reasons I show certain exercises as well as the tweaks on form because we got a lot more to go through and I don't think it's important what section of the back you hit first you can go lats first you can go mid back although I wouldn't recommend hitting that lower back first unless you got some sort of deep rooted self hatred because you could potentially blow that back up and ruin your entire back day so what I'm gonna start with is a little bit more mid back that lower lat by doing a seated cable row but using two individual handles and leaning forward now the reason for the individual handles is because I'm gonna really get my elbows involved during this movement during the negative portion I'm gonna drive those elbows in as much as possible to flare those lats out and as they come back and contract up not only when it pulls towards me but because of the individual handles I'm gonna try to pull apart as much as possible to engage those lats and the lean forward is because most people just do this wrong they just focus too much I'm pulling as much weight as possible which if you need to do it do one set pull the whole stack we down with it lighten it up because what I want you to do is lean forward because if you lean back it's all traps you lean forward just do it in your chair right now sitting that position you're gonna feel your mid back just light up now just imagine pulling weight in that position it's gonna hurt Next up we're doing a very similar lap pull down with a similar concept of the last exercise so using those two individual handles because God forbid anybody else gets to use them so what I want you to do is lean forward during the negative portion movement but this time it's not to get that mid back involved it's in hopes of really stretching that lap so just as important as you lean forward to stretch that lap makes you don't let that arm extend if you do you get engaged at bicep you lose the connection of your lap so make sure you keep the elbow and fix position and really it should feel like you're doing a pull over the entire time and if the very bottom really just separate those handles to engage me even more All right next up we went absolutely nowhere because sometimes it's just nice to sit on a machine and ruin somebody else's day and it goes without saying that different handles help you target different parts of your back and it's obvious but what I really wanted to emphasize by taking a wide grip is that sometimes we forget to focus on what we should be pulling with because truthfully unless you're really underdeveloped human a fully contracted back won't get that bar down to your chest you're going to get those biceps involved to get it all the way down so this moment's really about lagering that focus contracting just with that back and taking all those secondary muscles out of the equation next up we got bent over dumbbell rows and the way I typically do these is parallel out of the floor and the reason for that is I want to make my entire back work as hard as possible to stabilize me and keep me upright and the benefit here over just doing traditional barbell is that just by rotating your wrist or changing the angle of your elbows you can completely change this movement so if you have any shoulder impenetraments you might want to take a neutral grip or if you want to hit those traps you can do what I'm doing today which is flare those elbows out so you're pointing up into that upper back so then the entire movement is that lower back driving all the way into that upper back all right we're finishing up with reverse hypers now if you have the machine for these by all means use that but if you don't it's still a phenomenal exercise just doing these up the back of a bench doesn't mean that people won't see you putting your junk close to where they lay their head and never use that bench again but that's their problem the only difference here between this one and the dedicated machine is you're not going to use weight on these you want to slow down the movement and really contract that back as always like subscribe with an notification bell leave
