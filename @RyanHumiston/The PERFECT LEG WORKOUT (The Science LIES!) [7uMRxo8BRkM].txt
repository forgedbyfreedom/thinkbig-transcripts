Alright, today we're going to have the perfect leg workout and why the science around how you should be training them is false and at the end I'll build out a workout that will ruin your life. So if you're ready Let's get after. Alright, let's start out by electrocuting all four quad muscles at the same time And I'm sterile. There's a lot of videos out there. They're go over the scientific way to train your legs for hypertrophy and most of them Our shortsided the other ones are outdated and need to be updated and there's some that are interesting But need a little more context. Let's start with quads. I'm sure you've heard somebody say it's impossible to train your inner or your outer quad yourself muscles And the argument absolutely makes sense because if you look at the inner most muscle of your quad your vassus medialis your tear drop or your outer Most muscle your vassus lateralis your sweep neither of which connect to your hip The connects somewhere underneath all this shit high up on your femur. So no matter what you do externally or internally rotate your hips feet wide feet close Doesn't matter neither muscles gonna get lengthened or shortened because they originated first of the same spot on opposite sides It's all here Black and white clearest crystal you get nothing you lose good days, sir But I have a huge problem with that because even though that makes sense That's not been my experience in the past. I've had clients come in with a non-existent medialis and by manipulating their form as we train legs I was able to turn that dilapidated nutsack into one of the most dominant muscles to the point It looked like there was some sort of growth growing out of their knee and others who came in with no quad sweep We just modified the movements and in no time they got out of those skinny jeans and even calling on my own experience I know I can instantly put more emphasis on either one of those muscles and get a better connection Create a more intense contraction the next day That muscles is gonna be the most sore and most importantly it makes progress But I also thought I have no idea how to figure out why that is or how to explain to the people Then the last thing I want to do is get in a fight with a biology major who age rooms about being muscular as they shadow box in the corner of the gym Maybe I should just shut up But then I did some digging and found that there is science that supports the fact that you can selectively target your inner or Outer most quad muscle to help me explain this. I want you to first think about your tits the reason you can't neglect incline movements in your training Isn't simply because that upper chest has its own distinct head but more importantly It's because those chest fibers have a completely different orientation if the heads of your pet can work individually They'd actually be antagonist that collector head because you're armed to raise and that's turtle castle head But force that arm back down, but that's not how they work they work in unison because that's how tip muscles work The same exact principle applies to your medialis and lateralist They both work to stabilize your knee by pulling in opposite directions, but I'd argue that you can selectively isolate either one of these at will and I can prove it My electrocuting myself Now I'm doing this on the leg extension to help illustrate my point But you're not gonna want to internally or externally rotate your knee or hip when you're doing this exercise because it's gonna cause a shearing force on your knee That's not what you want. I mean, I've done it, but I'm an asshole so whatever at the end of this video I'll show you how to apply this principle to every single quad exercise we do All right, let's start out by electrocuting all four quad muscles at the same time As you can see there's an equal distribution of current and contraction throughout the muscles, but the moment I start to externally rotate my hip and open up that knee Keep my hand the same exact position the fibers that vassus medialis are not even more engaged the same thing happens when I go the other way And I internally rotate now the lateralis is more engaged and before you say yeah, dick head is because you're inhibiting that muscles ability to contract by pressing it against the pad That isn't it it has everything to do is what we talked about earlier And that's that muscle fibers are laid out in a very specific way and that's the exact way they can track so at all times They're fighting to put themselves in the optimal position to generate force because even when I take the load off my leg and Externally rotate my hip to try to limit the lateralisis ability to work the moment I applied current and electrocute this shit on myself It auto-corrects and forces me in a position where the fibers that lateralis can dominate knee extension and the same exact thing goes for the medialis, but it fucking hurt more And if you're sitting there thinking what the hell does Alex kidding yourself have to do with science? Here's the interesting study I found that Brad Sean fell dead looking the differences and I purchased you when comparing full and partial range emotion When they strap somebody up to an EMG and had them do leg extensions with no tweaks that are formed They found that certain muscles in the quads were more active during different portions of the moment for instance the vassus lateralis was more active during the middle portion And the vassus medialis was more active during lockout, and I think we've all unknowingly experienced this you go to a different gym hop of their leg extension and think This thing fucking sucks the range of muscles too short. This is gonna be a waste of a workout and then two sets in you're walk around like you got 10 pound nuts because your tear drops are blown out Now what about hamstrings? I highly doubt any of you've looked into the science behind training him and your only experiences with your elementary school P teacher who hovered over you with those broad shoulders and their short ass haircut threatening to take weird popsicle That you rightly earned for running the mile so fast you lap the kids who's parents obviously gave up on him because he wore jeans every day because you couldn't flex your toes Your shoes when you did your hamstring stretch Another interesting study I found show that having your toes pointing towards your shins and dorsy flexion when you're doing leg curl movements will allow you to generate more force And I don't think this is why most people do in this way. I think it's more of an unconscious thing But regardless this is where I go completely road because I think you should do the exact opposite and this is something I figured out years ago By putting a moderate amount of weight on leg curl machine and doing a couple reps my feet in a neutral position And then without resting went right into planar flexion so toes pointed away and it was fucking impossible Got my ass kick so I went right to dorsy flexion and it was too damn easy now. Why is that? Is everything to do with your gastrocnemius? It's main action is planar flexion of foot, but because it crosses the knee joint it also adds a knee flexion Now what you're doing when you're putting your feet into planar flexion during a leg curl is flexing your calf and actually isolated the movement even more down to your hamstrings Which sounds counter intuitive, but what you're doing is essentially turning your calf into the system to the regional manager Giving you an meaningless job of contracting that calf so it can't help in with knee flexion But when you're in dorsy flexion it can multitask and screw up everything also remember when it comes to hypertrophy strength or how much force you can generate Isn't the name of the game if that's your goal then you should be trying to recruit as many muscles to work as efficiently as possible to move the most amount of weight That's the antithesis of hypertrophy where you're basing everything you do of connection and isolation You're trying to limit secondary involvement as much as what's biomechanically possible to just hit that targeted muscle But if you're still a little worried about doing it that way just turn every leg curl movement you do Endo mechanical drop start in planar flexion when you get your ass kicked go right into dorsy flexion one more interesting thing I found which I've always felt to be true Was this study done in the effectiveness of hip hinge movements versus knee flexion movements and when comparing stiff leg deadless to leg curls Leg curls were far more effective at eliciting growth. It should just serve as a good reminder when you're stuck somewhere with a limited hamstring equipment Even though it's a pain in the ass and there's a 50 50 chance you're gonna drop that dumbbell on your lopsided balls You should still do dumbbell leg curls if you've ever done your research on glue training Then at some point you came across Brett contraris and the only thing I'll say about him is Used to teach math at my high school, which is fucking weird because he was like two years older than us I remember one of my friends turned in me saying I don't think this guy should be teaching us math and I looked at him You know very disappointed face What was the giveaway the beer ball in the back of his truck? It's guy looks he should be working at a margarita veil constantly getting written up for getting chest hair and people's drinks or in a lab Researching women's butt cheeks I was right the glute science lines up with what I felt for years any time you could exaggerate the stretch do it because you'll get even more glute Activation that's why every time I do Sumo as I turn them into more of a hip dominated movement and when I do something like reverse lunges Actually rather doing assisted and hold on to something that way I can shift my husky body over top of my glute and Then exaggerate the stretch by leaning more forward now when it comes to calf training I've heard people say for years that foot placement doesn't matter But it absolutely does and there's a few studies are starting to show that but You have to look a little bit deeper than the general conclusions like this one like Who the fuck dox like this like this like this one they can clear the point in your foot four Maybe the ideal approach when the aim is to induce proportional improvement across both heads of the gastric neemius That's fucking right how much further do you have to read to get to the part that I actually believe The very next fucking line it says that pointing your foot outward or inward may induce selective growth That should be your aha moment anytime you can selectively isolate a region and cause targeted damage and stress You're gonna get more growth here's about to illustrate my point the next time you go to shouldn't paper bag and let in somebody's doorstep What do you think be more effective drop on a herses kiss and no bag for each one of your neighbors? We're picking one of your neighbors to victimize soaking that bag in gasoline and eating Chinese food for three days choice is yours now. This is an incredibly important thing to point out what you do with your foot is Even more crucial than how you place your feet because I can put my foot in a neutral position and as I can track up If I supinate my foot and put more pressure on those medial fibers if I pronate my foot There's gonna be more pressure on those lateral fibers that outer head of your gastroct the way you place your feet just makes it easier to do that All right, let's put together everything we learned into one hell of a workout starting off with the quads Now that we absolutely know you can target your sweep or your tear drop just look down and see what's more embarrassing If it's your sweep then put that lateralist and prime position to bear the load not by internally rotating your knee You'll die but by doing movements to allow your leg to be closer to your midline a good starting exercise We'll be a leg press with your feet together and then right into a split squat with your working leg directly in the center of you if your tear drop is more like a ball sack On a hot summer day then choose a movement that'll allow it to dominate like a hacks go out where your feet are still close But your toes are out at 45 degrees and based upon what we learn Pre-existing in the leg extension, but staying at the top for a parcel movement and forcing that lock out Is the way to go? Then go throw up on hacksquad if for hamstrings It's still incredibly important to incorporate some sort of hip-hinge movement because they target a different part of the muscle Stiff legs are usually a good way to go, but make sure you do some sort of leg curl movement because they work better standing lying Doesn't matter and if you want to get even more of it I slate that hamstring even more point those toes away planter flexion And we get your ass kicked go to door seat flexion goods for me Thouph to be so most especially when you're hinging at the hips, but the research shows you get even more activation Out of step ups, so to make it even worse when you go in that negative I would get assisted by holding on to something and really leaning forward to exaggerate that stretch even more and finally calves Responded a pretty good ass kicking so hit them from all three angles. Mead you'll head dominant lateral head dominant Fuck them both. They'll make sure to leave the sets and reps in the description But make sure you don't do this workout over and over again, and that's all you do because based on the research of Jose Antonio Different exercises and do is hyperchophane different regions of the muscle So after you do this leg workout, make sure you watch this video and do this leg workout next and if you have four and 19 pesos Buy one of my programs. I'll link them below Most importantly make sure you subscribe because the next video It's gonna be a good one
