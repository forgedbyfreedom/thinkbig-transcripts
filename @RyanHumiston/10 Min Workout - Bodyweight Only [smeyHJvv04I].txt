So it's plugging away doing research, seeing what video I want to do next. I realize a ton of people are searching for 10-minute workouts, 10-minute full body workouts, 10-minute bodyweight workouts. I had the same look on my face. Really, 10 minutes? That's probably not. Okay, let's try it. But I'm gonna get myself a fighting chance to do a full upper body workout. I'm gonna use a style watch, and actually see how much you can really get in. And I'm kind of at a disadvantage here because we're still in quarantine, right? Nobody's supposed to mean this gym. There's no AC in here. It is fucking hotter than balls. So here's my thought. To be able to get everything in, I'm gonna have to more some exercise together, compound sets, supersets, and even with that, I'm still not gonna hit everybody part the way I want. But I still think that's the best bet because our goal is growth. If I wanted to jazz her size, I'd pop it at Billy Banks' tape and get after it. That's not what this is. The way initial thought is, I have to hit last first, because that's the hardest body part to hit when you have no equipment. So I'm gonna do that pull over various, and we pop your shoes off, you slide on the floor back and forth, and really just mimic a pull over. And then from there, I'm gonna actually pull myself up high enough where I go into tricep push up. So I get tricep some balls, I get my lads involved, and get that taken care of first. Then I'm going into a wide grip push up. And my goal with these isn't just to hit chest. I wanna get the anterior delton involved, but even more so than that, I'm gonna turn that hand out to the side, and actually gonna shift my weight from side to side, pulling with that bicep, because other than lads, the biceps are the second hardest thing to hit with body weight only workouts. The plan is to hit at least two sets of everything, preferably three, but I'll know after the first couple rounds, whether I have enough time to throw three in, otherwise I might have to cut it short, do two sets of everything, just to be able to hit everybody part I want to. We almost have worked to save you. We broke our �athlete to the wall. We tried our way into the night, but I cut it right for a while. Chiled ... N הא� There's no fucking wire, So what's horrible is that was that definitely didn't feel like enough damage to cause response to those muscles But they're still gonna get hit again Just part of me thinks that some of those YouTubers that have said that they get this crazy 10-minute full body workout Maybe they're not 100% honest with their clickbait titles next up. We're gonna go into a variation for that mid back lower Lats where you lying flat on the ground using those elbows to lift you up I must feel like you're just flexing in as much as you possibly can and therefore We're gonna try to get those traps for your delts involved so we're new a nice high row Using those elbows to lift you off the ground again and then we'll go right into vups A couple of things to note so the reason I exaggerate the stretch on the first exercise is it makes me feel like as I come down I can start to engage those lats that starts to contraction a little bit better than just sitting there Otherwise it just tends my neck up too much if I can start to contract some of my lats And I can keep it in my back the entire time and then with vups I just did 10 reps each time because I'm not gonna waste two minutes doing those when I'm gonna do abs again at the very end This could be a huge mistake. I could blow up my back But I want to finish off my back so I can focus on other things get that done with so I'm gonna do superman's or I take my lace completely out of it Just that upper body moving and I'm gonna start to contraction off in my traps and try to run it all the way down my spinal rectus and just tear that back up And then from there going to a chest specific specific specific specific going to a chest specific pushup Where I'm going all the way down half way up and really just keeping that chest engaged dropping those elbows and just lighting up as much as I can Feeling on those for sure I definitely want to give those delts a little more love so I'm gonna do a side plank really hitting that lateral head And then my back's pretty well spent so I'm surprised how much I got done there and how good it feels and usually I don't engage my My workouts by this, but if it's by how much I sweat and how deep my voice is getting it's been a good workout So I probably have time for two more exercises so I'm gonna do one more for triceps and anterior delts while I go halfway down Shift my weight forward and back to really get that delton involved and then I'll just burn out my abs anyway I can Without making a mess up I was out of your workout so in the last ab exercises I went with just a little bit of a bleak so nice slow controlled Bicycles just really flex inside aside just get a little bleak involved there took the hip flexor side of it completely by opening those knees up Crunched up forward and then brought a mac game with a slight raise of those legs just to finish them off back and forth between those two sets of those Then I was over the limit so if this is interesting to you let me know I'll try to do the full body 10 minute workout Probably end up being a little bit of blood, but it's for good cause as always like subscribe with the notification bell again I'm gonna leave that link so if you want to put your email in there find out when the course comes out You'll be the first to know I promise I won't spam you.
