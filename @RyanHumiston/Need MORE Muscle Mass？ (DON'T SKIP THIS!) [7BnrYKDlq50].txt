Alright, today we're going to have some principles you can add to pretty much any exercise and make it that much harder and in turn obviously get more growth because it's not good enough for the gym to have some AC you in think Man, that guy's definitely pushing himself and then they look back. Yep, definitely breathing hard. Instead, you're going to be to have them look at you and think Man, that guy's definitely pushing himself and then when they look back. Let me start up by saying there's still getting a lot of comments from people that probably don't want to turn on my content but have that same sentiment of why is this guy come up with so many weird exercises and Honestly, it's out of my control. This is what happens when you give a really analytical mind to somebody with the intelligence of a fifth grader. The only thing I'm good at is coming up with better ways to hurt myself and that's the goal of this video. Hopefully to bestow some of my idiot wisdom upon you because Once you realize it's not just a right and wrong way to do an exercise. There's a lot more gray area than people realize and you shift your mindset and think okay, how can I take this exercise Manipulating away is I connect to it better your results are going to skyrocket for instance taking the top of the movement on certain exercises can benefit you in a couple different ways One being you just can't rest squats are good example of this. I mean think about the worst squat set some horrible just Disgusting set you did. I'm sure you have a memory of it. You probably don't remember the actual set itself You probably remember just getting up locking those knees out leaning back trying to suck some area and try to get a couple more reps out You remember the rest and you can use that and make a deal with yourself and say okay if I lock my legs out That sets over and it completely changes the exercise think about that 100 reps squat challenge if that's the deal you made to yourself You wouldn't get there it'd be a game of last man standing Everybody'd fail just to what extent let me take a quick second I think Roman for sponsored this video because if I know you guys the way I think I do you messed up You got your wife a horrible gift for Christmas probably some piece of crap from KJU or just a little heart shaped thing Then you've been sleeping outside ever since that's where Roman comes in give you the chance to totally redeem yourself and give you why something that she might actually like Roman makes it easy to get help for serious men's health conditions like a rectal dysfunction These spent years building a digital platform that can connect to you to a doctor licensed your state All from the comfort your own home and it's really gonna help you because if you think you're gonna shove your Flacid joke inside of box and your wife's gonna be anything but disappointed You're certainly mistaken instead of giving your wife a gift looks like he's been melting in the window of your card In the dead of summer grab your phone or computer and complete a free online visit and you hear back from a US license physician within 24 hours If a doctor decides treatment right for you Romans pharmacy can ship your medication to you with free two-day shipping You also get free unlimited fall ups anytime you have questions, but you want to adjust your treatment plan With Roman there's no commitments and you can cancel any time So if you're struggling with ED go to get Roman dot com slash Ryan for free online visit and free two-day shipping Again, that's get Roman dot com slash Ryan for free online visit and free two-day shipping And then there's moments like a dumbbell fly or not only you're trying to inhibit your ability of rest But also limit how much of a secondary muscles can get involved because during that fly movement as you closer to the top of the contraction There's less force from gravity so there's less stress on that chest more in those anterior delts and those triceps to stabilize the weight So by taking out the top of the moment now you're making it more of a chest focused exercise But the not so obvious application of this is with rear delts because now you're back to fighting the earth's arrest on every single rep But now you've also cured the issue that pretty much everybody has on rear delts which is their traps ruin their life Because if you do these correctly, which is with those elbows locked out You no longer have to think okay, I'm going to make sure I don't come all the way up It'll stop you from being able to because that locked arm won't let you come into about 75 degrees If you're having a trap involvement before of that's an issue in the past This will be your new best only friend So I've talked in the past about the benefits really slowing down a moment obviously you can make a lighter weight Feel heavier really isolated into that muscle sitting the awfulness of the exercise But there are times when you want to do what I call grip it and rip it as long as your form is good You got a good connection that muscle by speeding it up. You're building move a little bit more weight The way I like to visualize it is think that I'm outpacing the lack to gas it because with those slower reps You're probably five reps in before your scream and make it weird noises with these You probably hit a ridiculously high rep set. It's just a different way to cause good damage But my favorite way of doing this is by taking a single exercise and implementing a slow and fast version back to back Which makes you feel like too completely different exercises So you're gonna start up by doing excruciatingly slow reps and once you fail or peel a little bit Then you're gonna speed it up and just by that momentum and tempo and the fact that you're just not doing the movement that slow It's gonna make it that much lighter you may able to get probably the same amount of reps sometimes even more So in Arizona we still have a lot of gyms open so I decided for leg day I'm taking a little field trip and try a different gym I haven't before because it was leg day I walked in I saw a hack squat and that inner voice said you're fucked But here's the thing that's not what got me Obviously it was an accumulation of things but the last exercise I did was lying leg curls But the last set I held the top of the movement for five seconds so hold that contraction the top for five seconds at the end of that set I tasted sadness sadness Oddly enough tastes like vomit so in the spirit of sadness We're doing exactly that using a lighter weight and home the top of the contraction for a longer than average period of time I'm using the five count because that's what ruined me earlier today and we're doing a one arm row because you can really take inventory and feel okay Am I contracting with that lat and can I stabilise and hold that weight with my backwards and my bicep jump in and does it go to sh So if you liked this video and you haven't got to watch these two yet You're gonna want to watch these next but most importantly make sure you subscribe hit that notification bell You can get after a get-grown Dr. Sue
