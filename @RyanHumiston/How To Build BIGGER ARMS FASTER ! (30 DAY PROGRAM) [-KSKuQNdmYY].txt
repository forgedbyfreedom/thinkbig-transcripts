Today is going to be a little different because the full gym program comes out in two weeks and I thought When I get people a little preview and see if they actually want to hurt themselves this bad So here's day one and it's one hell of an arm day if you're ready It's good after it we're starting off with arm day and you guys know how I like to theme my week So this one's going to be f*** from the start because You'll see why all right we're starting off with rope extensions and I want you pick away You can roughly do about 30 reps with once you fail You're not going to rest because we're going to turn this to a rest pause all the way to a hundred So get about 30 fail hold the stretch position take five deep breaths keep going probably get about 20 same thing failed do it again probably get 10 then eight then six and it's going to be a miserable ending I don't want you to focus on tucking those elbows into your stomach keeping that form nice and tight And don't worry about turning those wrists out we'll hit that lateral head soon enough But really just getting that tricep to fail not your traps So when it comes to training arms we're definitely going to be doing a lot of cables because to me It's one of the most effective ways to train him But we're also not going to sit in front of the machine and hog it the whole time and that's not because we're not assholes We don't care about that it's just there's a lot of other effective exercises with dumbbells and barbells and that would get boring So we're going to set up at a 45 degree angle grabbing two dumbbells and doing an inclined skull crusher I want you really focus on the actual movement of your wrist so as you go back and stretch Force that dumbbell towards your shoulder as you come up you flex at rest as you come up But don't lock it all the way out keep that tension and then once you fail you're going to sit up Press those dumbbells together and do a seated French press And I want you to focus on the initial part of the contraction so full stretch half way up And if you did that first exercise correctly you shouldn't have to change weight It should be the perfect amount to kick your ass on both of these Oh look we're back at the cables all right now We're going to really attack that lateral head by doing a compound set with a cable for inch press Bring it all the way to the top leading slightly forward and do an overhead extension and the two biggest notes on these It makes you opponent that hand as you come up or turn that shoulder in whatever physiological trigger You need to tell yourself not to screw these up and second thing is we're doing a full range of motion So full stretch all the way up. I might stop a little short a lock out But I don't know until I start to do these whatever gives me the best connection So same for you if you lock it out and you feel better do that if you stop a little short and that gives you a better connection do that We're going to finish off those triceps with a close grip bench and we're going to put on a weight We can do about 20 reps with and slow it to a crawl five count negative five count positive and what are you Access to a regular Olympic bench or just an adjustable one like I do inside a rack You still want to sit in it backwards because you're gonna fail That's the goal so at that last rep be able to just chuck that weight off of you and rack it We'll save your life You This is our days rough but you're gonna have one person quit on day one last course had somebody buy it watch all the videos and an email me and say This isn't what I thought I was gonna be what do you think I was gonna tell you to twist your nipples a certain way and you're gonna start to grow That's works You can try so because we don't want your biceps to fill left out and the theme of the day is Fuck from the start where throw a straight bar in the cable machine and do the same exact thing shooting for 30 reps Don't let go 5 deep breaths and just wrap it out good luck So I tried to equip this place with stuff that everybody's gonna have their local curves So there really is no excuse for the next one we're using the preacher curl bench But we're gonna hop on the opposite side shove those elbows against grab a nice close grip push that to failure Then you're gonna hop around the opposite side take a wider grip and go right into drag curls All we got two more exercises to go, but if you don't feel like you got your money's worth in a molested kind of way Then you're doing it wrong. So grab your easy bar. We're gonna go with the overhand grip close We're doing reverse grip curls make sure you really flex that wrist on the way up and then once you fail flip it over stay nice and close Rep it out regular curls So just like we did for triceps We're gonna end biceps with a five count negative five count positive disgusting exercise And we're doing it on incline curl so make sure you keep that shoulder back and out of it the arm and a fix position And just try to slowly squeeze and pop that thing one more quick note We're doing this on a pretty extreme angle so pass that typical 45 degree angle with a bench So put it back 30 35 degrees whatever your bench has You'll know you're on the right track when it just feels awkward and uncomfortable But your arms away back behind your shoulder and you're not gonna be able to use much weight You Let me end this first day by saying I'm glad you're here anybody who goes through this can see why this works because You got to be a pretty sick individual and I still don't know logistics of this But it would be nice after everybody's gone through it get together as a community I vote for the spirit right on Vegas my wife so sweet she make us a little goody bags Here's your good after you're getting growing T shirt Here's your lifting straps here's some purel because you never know where their butt holes have been So if that's the kind of pain you're in to I'll leave a link below where you can drop your email and I'll let you know right when the program comes out If there's any cheap bastards watching this don't worry I got you covered I'll throw an extra arm day in there that way you feel like you got your money's worth and if you need help with your diet And watch this video next also another my favorites, but most importantly subscribe hit that notification bell and get after a get growing Dr. You soon
