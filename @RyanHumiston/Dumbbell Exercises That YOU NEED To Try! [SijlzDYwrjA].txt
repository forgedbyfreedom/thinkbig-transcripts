All right, today we're going over some dumbbell exercises that are just as good and for some people will be even better than the original because What can I say I got a sauce button my goods for people that are being forced to train at home so much so that I'm a sentence power blocks to somebody because I got a rack over there. I don't use them anymore and I'm sure somebody needs them more than I do and They're a little dusty. Maybe there's a sticker to missing, but they get the job done. So if you want these leave a comment. Tell a story, tell a joke. I don't know just pick somebody randomly. Oh, candy art start off with biceps and I don't know about you, but I love rope curls that little exaggeration the top when you start to pull it apart Slightly supinate that wrist really just lights them up for me and we could take advantage of those same things by sitting up perpendicular to a wall and Hold that dumbbell slightly out in front of you because if you just try to curl it naturally where it hangs the supination of the moment only happens because of the way to the dumbbell Not really because your biceps are doing anything so by holding out in front now your bicep has to work to curl the weight But it's also actively involved in the supination as well All right next up we got to find a way to mimic a tricep cable extension which I know is a tall task because it's a F***in phenomenal exercise, but if there's will there's got to be a weirdo and a garage gym that you paint at all black Even the door handles that's gonna figure it out and the best thing of it come up with which I actually like Especially as a burner is by flipping those demos on the side kneeling and mimicking either a rope extension or a skull crusher that same exact movement And you can even get a little bit of that pronation as well if you drive those demos all the way together You'll notice as you come up you're able to rotate that wrist a little bit and hit that lateral head All right next up we got to try to knock off the seated cable rope because if you're hitting back You're probably gonna end up here That's because it's a beautiful mix between being a cable exercise, so it's smooth. It's easy to set up But it also fits in the category of this is gonna kick my ass and I use this variation a lot because I don't actually have a seated cable row It looks like I do but when I bought this piece They got you in the wrong size cables and I just see here and think about how my life would have turned out different if I did I feel like you're gonna have flashbacks if every time you screw it up and got sent to the corner in elementary school because We're going back to the wall and the reason for that is because the true beauty of the seated row is it virtually takes your legs out of the equation Then I'll get to focus on is what part of my back to a more emphasis on and that's done by tilting your entire torso at the hips So if you want more low and mid back, you're gonna tilt more forward If you want more upper back and traps you're gonna tilt slightly back and the reason I'd argue this is a better movement is because it's easier to lock that lower back In position and create more of a dynamic movement which allow you to move more weight, but also get a complete contraction from that entire back So if you like this video let me know because there's a lot more exercises We can translate the dumbbells and make them even better and if you want those power blocks You want to see how much FedEx is gonna charge me any ship those across the world comment below as well And if you haven't seen these two videos, you're gonna want to watch these next most importantly subscribe Hit that notification bell and get after you get growing talk to you soon
