All right, today we're going to go over what's probably going to be the most intense shoulder workout you've ever done because I made two changes recently. This made a huge difference. So I figured I'd share that with you. And yeah, leave the stats and reps in the description. So you don't freak out. Let's get after it. So the first change I made was to get rid of that traditional split four to five exercises where you're doing three to four sets each because I caught myself Dreding that for sometimes even that third set that same anxiety you got when you were kid and whatever grade that was where you teach your slap that time and multiplication test on your desk. And you just looked at her like you I thought we had a deal. You were gonna outmeas the dumbest kid in class and I was gonna keep feeding your ravenous diabetes by bringing your fruit every day But you're fucked it up. So what I've been doing instead of setting up shopping a bench like this grabbing some dumbbells and then doing one sometimes two sets if I really like the exercise And then take very little rest in between and go right to the next exercise Allow me to get five sometimes even six exercises in in a ten minute period and then I do that same thing on cables and then with a barbell as well And not confining myself to hitting one specific head because before I would say okay, I'm hitting weird doubts I got to do four sets or I'm going to hell now I jump back and forth between all the heads Maybe do one set in the anterior adults two sets for the lateral head one for posterior back to the anterior adult Really just focusing on taking as little rest as possible and causing as much pain as I can handle and the second major change I made was basically saying Screw it. I'm just gonna do it feels the best that means pulling out PT exercises doing some movements that people will consider dangerous But I use such lightweight that if you hurt yourself doing some of these movements It was bound to happen you're gonna be a light one day trying to turn left and your shoulder's gonna explode So blame your shitty genetics so make sure I least include one or two reps of each exercise So you don't understand what they all I'm talking about in the description, but I want to least break down one fully So you really get my thought process so for this one you're putting them back in a 45 degree angle and if you ever done Rear doubt flies on the machine and really focus on that initial part of the interaction You know how easy it is connect with those weird adults because when that delts in a stretched position It's really easy to fire it and all we're doing here is exaggerating that stretch even more and then contracting out for the arm is straight out in front of you So yeah, it's a real small range of motion, but it's a great stretch and even better connection But I understand if you're nervous those little babies get even smaller thinking about that shoulder being turned in like that because it hands-pronated down So if that makes you uncomfortable just supinate that rest treat like a modified team and make sure pulling with that rear-doubt and it's just as good So if you saw some of those movements in the gear started turning your head and you got excited to train shoulders again You want to take some of those concepts over to cables because even if you're a perpetual screw-rupper of shoulder movements and everything you do jumps into your traps You're gonna find that cables not only allow you really explore the limitations your own biomechanics, but also do some fun and innovative movements And you have to worry about having a great connection because that constant tension makes it easy for instance If you're an avid Arnold Presser, you know that the press itself isn't what gives you that horrible burning sensation that makes you want to kick the person next to you right in the Is the rotation you do as you press it up so why not just focus and isolate down just the rotation part of the movement by grabbing the cable and rotating that shoulder back But by all means if you want to keep that press in there just rotate it back Drive it straight up nice control even though it's lightweight and the tent is pulling you forward Just to stabilize that shoulder and flex against that tension It's gonna give you a horrible pump, but the biggest takeaway I wanted you to have is next time you go to hit cables Know that every little tweak you make is a completely different exercise So say you're hitting rear delts and that palms parallel out of the floor try to drop it to 45 degrees See if you get a better connection that way or drop it completely by your side Probably never done it that way, but you're gonna get a great connection just pulling straight back hitting that rear delt Or even try to supinate that palm as you come back open up that shoulder You're probably gonna get even better connection doing that and yeah You get a lot of dirty looks from people, but based upon a law of thermodynamics that no energy is created nor is it destroyed as your shoulders are getting bigger They're getting smaller so you win So if you feel like that traditional way of training shoulders isn't working for you anymore Just to crease the number of sets you're doing and increasing number of exercises and get a little creative with some of the movements Even if you feel like that one's not working great for me All you do is simply change the angle or just open up that shoulder by supinating that palm and that might be the best exercise That you should have been doing along the long-f*** time ago and one more thing I want to leave you with when you're training shoulders if you stop thinking about driving the weight up and you start thinking about Okay, what head of that belt? I want to use to pull the weight up. It's gonna transform the way you train them And if you haven't got a chance to check out the 30-day program I'll leave a link in the description It's 20 videos is 20 bucks if you can't afford that You're one handy away and here's two of my other favorite shoulder videos So if you haven't watched those watch those next but most importantly subscribe hit that notification bell and get after a get growing Talk to you soon
