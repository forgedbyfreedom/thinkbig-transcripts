Hey, I really love you in that gay cowboy movie. Are you sure? I'm pretty good feeling I've seen your butt home before. Welcome to Between Two Plates. I'm here with my special guest Ryan Hymniston to talk about his new People Program. Tell us about it. It's actually not how you pronounce my name or the PPL program. It's not short for people. It's an abbreviation for push pull leg. It's a style of work. Excuse me. Who does this guy think he is? Let me ask you this. Does this new program come with steroids or people expected to shut them up their ass and smuggle over the border on their own? It's pretty clear that anybody's ever watched your channel that you've made a living off a fart humor alone providing little to no value. So how ashamed is your mother? She's dead. Did she also die of excessive steroid use? Really? Pretty some of your comments. Here's one from Marco DTF Roberts that says, OMG. Your shoulders are so distracting just kidding kisses on those delts. Which brings me my next question, how big is your wife's penis? It's huge. Maybe we just start off on a bad flight. Can we talk about the program? Sure. Tell me about this program. How many DVDs does it come with? So DVDs. I mean, it's all, I mean, think of like virtual workouts. They're all online. There's like 24 videos. It's a three day on one day off split or you can even do it over 60 days if you're so how much are these virtual workouts? Well, that's a cool part of it. Make it accessible for everybody. It's only 20 bucks. Typical spam price. You know, why don't you get after it and grow a bigger mustache and sell me a reverse mortgage while you're at it. You f***. You know, this bullshit. Fuck your stupid plan. Hey, get out of here. You bullhead. Fuck. Even Tony Little throw a DVD in with the gazelle.
