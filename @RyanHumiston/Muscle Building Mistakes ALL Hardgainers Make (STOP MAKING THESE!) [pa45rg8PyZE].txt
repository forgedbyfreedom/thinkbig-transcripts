Are you actually a hard gainer or are you just screwing up one of these three things? Let's find out a little game I like to call Just the tips First and foremost if you've been banging your head against the wall getting no results and you feel like you're not even a hard gainer You're whatever below that is just know that no one is ever completely screwed and if you fix the three mistakes I'm about to show you you're gonna get results and believe me. I get it I used to think I was cursed by the universe and I traced it all the way back to when I was a kid And I pinched off one measly cigar and he earned all and because of that I was destined to be small forever Here's the deal Everybody has the potential to completely transform their physique and yeah while it might be easier and quicker for some people Believe me when I say those people aren't blessed Yeah, many personal trainers that've ran into with a gift and metabolism that really have no idea how to actually help people They get stuck after they tell their clients to eat a healthy bowl of cereal in the morning and Switch their bread to whole wheat instead and as their clients progressively get chubby or in chubby or They have no idea what to do don't worry Pam most of that's muscle That fat will start melt and off in no time. Yep. You put on 30 pounds of muscle good job The truth is that the heart of the journey is the more you go learn about yourself and then Be able to turn around and help the palms of the world that other trainers have fucked up But first we got to fix the trifecta of things you're doing wrong. Let's start with the fact that more than likely your diet sucks All the dicks. I want you to think back to your high school football coach or maybe that old guy at the jam who constantly reminds you that He used to be as big as you when he was younger and I guarantee they fed you the same bullshit added you want to get big You got to eat big what a bullshit directionless analogy That's like saying you want to get laid you have to fuck things You know what happens when you eat big you take big shits because you end up taking on the persona of somebody who values quantity over quality A good example of how prevalent this lie is is go to your local gnc and talk to the guy behind the counter Who takes his job way too seriously the senior Nutrition and health advisors cheap dickhead. I don't know what their titles actually are and say hey I want to put on more muscle what should I take and these gonna promptly send you over the weight gain or section Which melese the wrong approach, but Once you start reading the ingredients you'll quickly realize that you're better off known a couple big max in a blender and chugging that down Say no, if you're watching this video and you happen to be over four bills Please do me a favor go to gnc and talk to the guy behind the counter and say hey I want to pack up more mass what should I take and Watch him nervous and try to figure out what to sell you I guarantee you either leave with flinstone vitamins or Some new genics when it comes to your diet make sure choosing quality over quantity and also make sure that getting all your protein in is your number one priority No longer you're gonna have snacks like a handful of nuts or an apple with peanut butter Unless you want to continue to look like you're a six year old so that means getting an adequate amount of protein with every single meal So if you need those nuts pair with a protein chick and even if you're one of those lucky bastards who are extremely lean, but a size small I would still apply the principle of highest in best what's the highest quality protein? I can eat or the best source of carbs that I can have and what are the healthiest fats? I can add to my diet most of the time That's not the case though because true act of morphs are pretty few and far between most of us are some weird Fish baby hybrid and we have the muscularity of an act of morph, but we can put on fat real easy like an end of morph all of the bad None of the good so all that means is you're gonna have to be even more meticulous with your diet There's times you're gonna be in a calorie surplus and other times you're gonna run a deficit And you can do this on a daily or a weekly basis on a daily basis it looks like carb cycling on your Rufferdase legs are back you'll be in a surplus We're gonna deficit the rest of the time when you're doing it on a weekly basis you might take a whole week or even two weeks of being in calorie surplus And depending how much of a pregnancy you have for becoming a big fat mass You might take a week or even up to three weeks to diet off some of the excess fat the second thing is you're training itself And there's a very clear scale of hypertrophy and if you fall in the extreme ends of it You're not gonna get results. So at this end of the scale We have the person that stays at home and flexes in front of the mirror like a sociopath and Obviously they have a great connection to their muscle, but they're not really flexing against any resistance whatsoever So the results are gonna be dismal because they're at home flexing in the mirror Most likely bottomless and on this time we have the person that goes to the gym and goes as heavy as possible Zero-fox about what muscle they're connecting with their one goal is get to the bottom pin on every single machine because That unlock star world. This one has the opposite problem all the resistance in the world Zero connection the sweet spot and where you want to be is in the middle either airing on the side of having a better connection and focusing on higher volume or progressively overloading and moving more weight for me personally I prefer higher volume workouts and focusing on the connection because when you're a beginner or a hard gain of a shit form It gives you a very clear signal and whether or not you're doing it correctly because if that muscle you're trying to target is on fire You did a good job when you're progressively overloading you can easily mistake just moving weight for a successful set Lastly, and one of the biggest things that holds hard gainers back is a lack of consistency When you're not seeing results right away Make it's frustrating and then you end up missing a day at the gym here and there you skip a meal and then you change a program after a week because It's not getting results working out as a grind with very few wins You're constantly kicking your own ass in the gym pushing yourself to failure and rarely do you even see the slightest sign of progress unless You hold your breath flex as hard as you can You almost pass out you might see a new vein pop up but for the most part It's judged over long periods of time but that only happens when you're consistent and life's gonna test you It's gonna match you with somebody on bumble and tempt you to skip the gym and try to put your p to the V but Just know that that's life's way of checking how committed you are to reach your goals And it's also gonna come from the people we're closest to I'm gonna say why you spend so much time on this frivolous goal You're wasting your life and one day we might look back and realize they were right But I have a feeling we're all gonna spend our lives on frivolous shit So it might as well be a goal it's gonna teach you discipline patience persistence and that way when one day You decide to shave your head and realize it looks like a giant testicle and kids run up and kicking the shins because they think you're gonna bomb a trossody At least you got a little muscle on you and if you need help kicking your ass and you haven't checked out the 30-day garage program It's 30 days 20 videos 20 bucks pretty damn simple and if you need specific help with your diet I watch this video next also another one of my favorites, but most importantly subscribe hit that notification bell Get after get growing talk to you soon
