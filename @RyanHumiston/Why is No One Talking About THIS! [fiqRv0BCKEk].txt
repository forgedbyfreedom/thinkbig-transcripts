This is by far the most important video I've ever made because 80% of people will experience substantial back pain at Some point in their life of that 12% of those people end up clinically disabled meaning they get one of those adorable little handicapped stickers and this sick ride And even if that's not you you're one of the lucky ones very few people understand how to properly align their spine and brace Before they live and on top of that if you have shoulder and hit mobility issues You're never gonna fix them and tell you fix your spinal mechanics first The first thing I want to say light on is the spine itself now We've all seen models like this before, but I think very few lifters truly appreciate how wonky the spine actually is your spine is Curved all the hell the Lumbar and cervical portions of your spine have a natural inward curve known as lardosis And your thoracic spine has a kyphosis or outward curve your spine is the strongest Nable to bear an incredible amount of compression when it's in this neutral position when all the vertebrae are perfectly aligned and displacing even distribution of force through the disc below them that almost act like individual joints That was a tough one That was a tough. What you run into issues is when the curves your spine become either too exaggerated or not existed a pretty common fault You'll see in the gym is when people lose the lardosis of their lumbar spine the old brown eye wink You're better than that that should be in aha moment because I'm sure at some point in your life You've had a coach or a training partner give you the verbal cue to flatten your back during a deadlift or keep your head up during a squat I am guilty of this as well those are dumb things to say you shouldn't tell someone to flatten your back You fucking pieces because inevitably they're gonna take that verbal cue and then proceed to flatten out their lumbar spine Which we know needs that inward curve to be in a neutral position So in fact if you see somebody with a flat back They're actually more susceptible to injury and then when you tell somebody fucking head up or I'll murder your fucking family No one takes that cue and then tilts her head back just enough to realign their spine in a neutral position They tilt her head back as far as they fucking can and then create a localized extension fault in their cervical spine I might have to amend that by saying it's a lot harder to tell on chubby If you're somebody that self identifies as medium husky to husky then you're not to be able to get visual confirmation that your spine is in a neutral position because it might be neutral And that might just be a shit little back that so the most important thing you could do to make sure your spine never turtles out of your ass Is to have a set of kinesthetic cues that you run through in a step-by-step process to make sure spine is in a neutral position That's what you're learning today magic screw box and we're gonna need two of these the one we use for lifting Which is called a braced neutral spine and then when we use for everyday life Which you could just call perfect posture that is a little bit easier to get into there's less steps But it's just as important because people underestimate how much they put their back at risk with everyday activity like tying their shoes Or picking up something random to impress a woman. Oops. I dropped my monster condom that I use for my magnum-dong I can't emphasize this enough if you spend 23 hours outside the gym with improper spinal mechanics and bad posture It has more of a negative effect than anything you could do in the gym I mean unless you train like a complete asshole and before somebody says I don't know if I believe that because I've been told that there's no sense thing is bad posture your next posture is your best posture That's complete bullshit because There are goodwill hunting formulas you can use to figure out the spinal compression force the force of the muscle itself and Most importantly the shearing force between two specific vertebraing to me That's fascinating you could take a formula like that. Wasteland tires Sunday and figure out that a 300 pound dead lift With a neutral spine is a hell of a lot safer than having the curvature of a spine just slightly off and picking up an object that only weighs 20 pounds That's a foot in front of you. Yes, the compressive force of the deadlift is gonna be higher But that's what your spine does that's it's job the real danger and risk for injury comes when one of your vertebrae becomes out of alignment It creates what's called a shear force where one of the vertebrae slides on top of the other That's where you get your bulging disk your rupture disk your pets head starts falling off And that's your enforced can happen the moment you lose that neutral spine position Hopefully I've scared you enough that you maintain proper spinal mechanics even if you're just picking up your giant condom that you use for your Magnum Dawn So let's walk you to process of creating a brace neutral spine the best way I found is the supple leopard method In this process you remain identical regardless of the lift you'll simply just adjust the width of your stance the angle of your hips Whatever you have to do to get in position to execute that lift But the way you align your spine and brace for the lift should never change Step one wind your feet and I hesitate to say rotate because you don't actually want your feet to move You want them to lock in place just fill the pressure and torque of external rotation because it's gonna put pressure on the outside of your knee and help align your hips Step two, contract your glutes. That's gonna help align your pelvis and a neutral position Where is America when you need her the reason I'm gonna have it heard do this is because the last video she was in got flagged because Fuck me right step three time to brace your abdominals now the way I like to teach is to take four fingers And jam them in your oblique the only way you're gonna get that pain to stop and for those fingers to exit is if you brace your abdominals in a way That doesn't just fire those superficial muscles but contracts those deep muscles involved in stabilizing your spine like your Transversus abdominis I think I just subconsciously made myself want to have abdominals Fuck domino and that's just bracing for proper alignment when you brace to do a lift the intensities Gonna change based upon the lift you do a standing dumbbell curl will need a lot less intense contraction than a heavy ass deadlift So very the intensity accordingly don't just give yourself a hurting by flexing your glutes and bracing your abs You've now align your lumbar spine the little green bastard So now we have to work on your thoracic spine because when you brace your abdominals You actually compress your entire trunk and everything goes forward and down So to fix that you're gonna open up your shoulders and external rotation but bring your hands out to the side thumbs up to the ceiling and then drop your hands right to your side It's that simple from there All we have to do is align the cervical part of your spine so they do that. I want you to pretend There's a string attached to the ball spot on the back of your head when that string is pulled your head Goes slightly back and your chin drops into a neutral position next obvious question is how in the hell am I supposed to brace and breathe at the same time While I left time glad you asked that question because I'm gonna fucking answer it the first thing you gotta understand is that no matter what when you breathe You have less compressive force in your abdomen Which is gonna put you more risk for injury, but you also can't just hold your breath the entire set that impedes blood flow of the heart Increases blood pressure and you probably get done with that set and realize that you have what seems to be a shiny new testicle the key is to take short compressive breaths from your diaphragm not like this whoever designed this program is an idiot Because this person is breathing with their chest and when you do that you ultimately tilt back and forth and create a localized fault in your thoracic spine I'm probably gonna spend the rest of my week finding out where the person lives who designed this so I can go shit on their lawn So focus on short diaphragmatic breaths or put simply breathing through your stomach that allow you to maintain that abdominal brace and then line up your breathing Base upon your need and I would love to tell you it's as simple as breathing in during the eccentric breathing out during the concentric But it is way more nuanced than that because think about just doing negatives on Nordic hamstring curls by definition The concentric part of that moment is when I take my hands and push myself back up, but I don't even give a shit about that part So that means I'm inhaling during the negative which runs a risk of creating laxity in my lumbar spine because when you inhale There's a nightly less compressive forces than when you exhale so in that scenario I should breathe out during the negative what the fuck? And before you say just exhale in the hardest part that doesn't work either because think about a 10 second negative on a squat with an explosive positive That positive is easy compared to that negative That negative sucks all the dicks and yeah negative is our rarity and you can get by with the phrase and during the negative out during the positive But I think a better way to think about it and a question you can ask yourself before any lift that will never let you down is During what part of the lift is it most important? I utilize the more compressive forces of the exhale to help stabilize my spine Now when it comes to fixing your day to day posture that the forces of gravity and the stresses of life itself slowly erode with each passing second Actually a lot easier and this works whether you're standing or seated But I'll highlight the seated version because most people's issues are derived from sitting on their ass all day and losing the natural Lurdoces in their lumbar spine all you need to do is go into the extremes and start to back it off So for your lumbar spine you got to archer back and then gently start to contract your abs and tell you for the muscles in your low back Start to relax Then your lumbar set from there. It's the opposite for your thoracic spine You go into flexion and then you start to externally rotate those shoulders until you fill those mid back muscles start to relax Then tug your bald spot to correct your cervical spine and it might seem like a lot to maintain that posture throughout the day But it's not when you realize that this is a neutral posture and this is a neutral posture and this is well What I'm saying is you don't have to sit straight up like a jerk off the entire day You can change the angle of your body because it doesn't matter what your hips are doing now If you're somebody that habitually winks to everybody that walks by during your squat I want you to do this exercise before we leg and back day It's a variation of a plate good morning and there's a very specific way I want you to do these So lock your feet in put pressure on the outside of your knees flex your glutes brace your abs Extremely rotate your shoulders pull the ball spot in the back of your head and as you do these I want you to focus on keeping the plate as close to as possible the entire time because not only I would work into increase the endurance and strengthen those spinal muscles But we're also working to stabilize those shoulders and increase mobility in the hips because if you have mobile hips Stable shoulders and the neutral spine no one will ever laugh at your equations But hold again if you don't already know the new backed by science program is live It's by far the most efficient way to train. I'll also include an 30 minute version for those of you that have a life and good luck
