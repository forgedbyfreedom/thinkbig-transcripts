Alright, today we're going over absolutely everything I keep in my gym bag and to be honest with you I actually had to go buy a gym bag to make this video because I keep everything in the trunk of my car And I know myself that was the title of this video It just went ended up being one long dead occurred joke so to save us from that Let's just throw it all on a gym bag and yeah, I had to believe that out because for some reason YouTube tries to take all my money every time I mention a dead in the first 30 seconds of a video So they must have some sort of prejudice against haters now when I originally thought about doing this video I was torn because my first thought was who gives a shit what's in my gym bag But then I started thinking I love when people make videos and what's in their camera bag or different tools they use and on top of that I know this is going to be helpful because I picked up some pretty interesting stuff along the way And it seems like every video somebody asked where do you get that shirt or those straps etc So you'll never have to ask that again and know I won't leave links in the description because I don't want your affiliate money And because you guys are pricks last time I purposely didn't tell you where I got that Bios still stuff I like to drink you jerk still bought all of it off Amazon How to go to Walmart do you have any idea with the Walmart by my house is like it's awful? What do you know it's busy? Oh, there's a spot no journey diaper no crackhead Nope two year old with diabetes Now you might say Widmet why do you even have a gym bag or stuff in your trunk because don't you have a gym? Yeah, it's more of a studio than anything else there's lights everywhere and Personally I don't like to sit in the studio all day and then train there I also find that I get some energy from the gym just from people and They don't like people but I like the energy they give me so I have a membership to pretty much every single gym This is the one I go to when I'm sure on time and I don't want to make it excuse for not getting a workout in Plus they have one of those vibrating power plates which are great for tickling your I don't know why but I always have the best back workouts at this gym. It's not the equipment the equipment sucks Now this is the gym where all my exes workout at this is the one I go to for my version of physical therapy and to feel like a loaded soccer mom just for legs All right let's start off by running through the basics things that everybody should have and if you don't you're failing at life And then we'll go into the specialized things that most people won't need but if you do it'll save your ass Holy shit, I think my beard just got grayer in the span of three minutes first things first headphones because Everybody needs a good soundtrack to listen to us. They hurt themselves so I use these and I know These look ridiculous, but I also have these but these are really good at breaking So I'll take them more reliable ones that make me look like a fucking Disney character now the next thing is my new favorite thing because I'm sure I'm just like you where you like to take a pre-workout strong enough to make your skin crawl borderline melt and then I chew one of these it's called neuro gum and it's got enough Elthine and then they really take the edge off you still get all the benefits of the crazy energy that pumps and Feel like you're on meth but less anxiety next up straps now you should find a reason to use these every single back day and if you don't I don't know what you're doing with your life. I used to be on team old school straps It kind of had to wrap around the bar and still use chalk because it didn't work that well when I saw people with these I thought oh my god that's adorable that part of your Halloween costume You look ridiculous who let this guy in here when he's not looking I'm gonna shit in his gym bag when I finally tried these I was furious why didn't you tell me these were so good You maybe ruin a perfectly good gym bag these ones are made by chic the same as a verset grips and I think there's even one called cobra grips It's shaped like a cobra and even has a cobra on the back of it way to make a good product really do she I've never broken a pair of these I probably went through 50 of those old school straps and if you've ever done that You've seen your life last before your eyes because it's always only one that breaks so you get jolted from side to side You end up checking the tear my obliques my my testicles good one two three. Okay, we're good Deodorant don't be that guy. There's one every single gym. I don't know how they don't know that everybody can smell them and hates them Hope say die next my breaking case of emergency kit and I keep in a shaker cup you got your pump The pre-workout and your protein For the rookie that says well, how do you know which one's the pre-workout and which one's the pump? People work out so one that looks like cocaine and if you smell it Mergers knows now for some of the more interesting things so about a year ago I ended up getting a pinchner from my neck which led to stratus anterior palsy and scapular winging and Even though they all happened at once I didn't notice it right away just slowly over time once out of my body started to deteriorate and die Fuck and the only way I figured out it was nerve related and I should get an MRI to see where it all stems from is by using this thing I strapped it on the bad side turned it all the way up and nothing I was like oh, maybe it's just not that strong put on the good side and it jumped like crazy back to the bad side burn my skin. Oh No I'm pretty fucked up and if you're not familiar with what this is this is just a really strong east-im Holy shit which ended up being really beneficial in the recovery process because I had strapped it on the bad side And try to get that muscle and nerve to work together to Kind of fire and stop being a piece of shit and then conjunction with all the other stuff I was doing It definitely helped and I've seen people in the comments say I really can I have one of my triceps but not the other If you have one of these you might want to throw it on and see if it's not nerve related and even if you don't just go to your closest P.T. and say I'll let you Give me that stupid sales presentation if you just let me use this this alien term was really great for improving posture Thrust and mobility you just lay over top of it open up that chest Pinsos shoulder blades together and hurt yourself and this straps only when I found the ledge to do a Sratus anterior exercise that isn't a total wasted time so if you have a wing scap I would use this just Rapper on your back hook your elbow and drive it forward and you're gonna start to see some improvement No, those last few things are definitely for a specific group of people But if you have those issues, they're definitely gonna help Now I've seen a lot of wings at the gym so that last banded exercise is a fucking winner I'll make sure to put the names of everything in the description and if you haven't checked out the full or garage program I'll leave those links in the description again 30 days 20 videos that's only 20 bucks pretty damn simple and if you haven't watched this video last video Is it good one?
