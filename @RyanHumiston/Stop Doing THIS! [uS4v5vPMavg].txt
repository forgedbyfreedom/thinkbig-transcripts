Today we're going over the absolute best way to train your back and I guarantee you're doing it wrong because I sure as hell was. For example, did you know that a reverse grip lat bar pull down is just a glorified glory hole of an exercise because it's more biceps than back But if you just slightly lean back, it completely redeems itself and that's just the tip. Here's my issue I've seen several other case studies and videos where they took an EMG device just like this strapped at the different parts of their back Did exercises and then ranked deadlifts are a f***ing tan the glaring issue and oversight with that kind of testing is that 95% of all Back exercises have a built in weakness of fall Your biceps in their haste to develop their back to a point that they look like a goddamn shit I ordered the wrong size I'm starting to cut my tail Not bad none of these people waited the effectiveness of an exercise in comparison to bicep activation So that's exactly what we're going to do today to figure out what exercises are actually the best and even more important than that How to tweak your form to make a good exercise even better. I am excited So let's start this off by going through some common exercises that everyone does when they train back and seeing if they are truly any good If they do suck if there's changes we can make to the form to redeem that starting out with one arm rows and I know some trainers would have you believe that this is a highly dangerous exercise and these things are given out Hernia is like hotcakes, but that's not the case. It's actually a great exercise Depending on how you do after disgusting amount of testing. There's one thing I know for sure You can definitely make this exercise better if we look at traditional form the kind you'd see any Impressible show to the gym do where they grab heavyweight with the neutral grip pulling straight up when I tested it 34.8% more activation out of the lat than out of the bicep Not bad just to make sure you understand the percentage We're looking at an exercise taking the mean activation of the lats comparing that to the mean activation the biceps and that gap in between Is the percentage we're talking about the larger it is the better the exercises it targeting your lats Welcome to math bitch, but one thing I've always thought to be true just based upon my own anecdotal bullshit is that if you keep your elbow in a fixed position and you row and more of an arc like motion That you're gonna be able to isolate the lat more and that's because If you look at the origin and insertion point of those lats and They actually originate several spots, but to make it simple think about them starting at your ass crack Coming up your spine and then the wrap around and attach to the anterior side of your humorous Right below your pectoral smager, which means it is the most dominant muscle for addduction of your arm so when you raise it up But if we look at most lat exercises as you add duct that arm you also decrease the angle of your elbow Which gets your bicep involved so my theory was keep the elbow in a fixed position It's gonna be more lat and I was right When I tested the fix elbow variation of the one arm row I got 73.5% more activation of the lat than I did out of the bicep, but I didn't stop there I decided to go one step further and see what happens when I use that same form But take a pronated grip because I already know from bicep testing the rotation of your wrist plays a huge role in your ability to contract your bicep and it was glorious 94% that is the way you should always do that again I'm shocked and disappointed nobody told me this shit back when I was 14 so I didn't waste my entire life Next up, let's go over lat pull downs because for my phone each attachment as well as grip you take has a different level of difficulty Meaning that some are harder to keep out of your biceps than others traditional why grip pull downs are the toughest to screw up You can give this exercise to any gym nuve and tell them don't come back until you cure yourself of Imagineary lat syndrome and as long as our hands are wide enough that way when they pull down They don't break 90 degrees with their elbow so it's harder to flex their biceps and their chest is nice and tall So their shoulders are an external rotation not internally tip forward They're gonna pull through we're gonna let pull down 63% more lat than bicep the form that I like to do which is more of a pullover 71% next up v bar handle and it's not horrible But it's not great and it makes sense more you think about it If you look from the side the angle of your elbow decreases at a greater rate than the angle at which your lat can add out your arm and Just puts that bicep in a better position to take over and screw things up the only thing that saves it is the fact your hands are in a neutral position That way your short head has a harder time jumping in screwing things up and it usually is the short head that does and the Factor arms aren't straight up and down. They're always angled that way blah blah blah blah But if you just slightly lean back it transforms it and I'm not talking about leaning back like the old people Planet Fitness where they almost jacked the back at their head on the ground We just want to get our hands slightly away from our face so we're not curling the weight down 10 to be 15 degrees but then again both of those suck eggs and comparison the variation where you keep your elbow fixed reverse grip pull downs As you soften the intro they're pretty crappy Doesn't matter if you use this bar or the straight bar when you put those hands in a super day position Those biceps will ruin your life and yeah You could redeem them by leaning slightly back or keep them to elbow and a fixed position But I wouldn't recommend them because they're just too easy to screw up and before so many comments It says yeah, but you should still do them because they're better hitting your lower lats Don't worry. I used to be an idiot as well. That's not what happens. I littered my lat with sensors Doesn't work like that. I had a lot of people comment on the last video My shoes are so f***ing loud Still got it. I had a lot of people comment in the last video and say why didn't you test face pulls? I did That's why I didn't put them in there because I got the most activation on my lower traps Then post your delts then mid then upper traps It's just as much as a trap exercise as it is for your posterior delts and it doesn't mean I wouldn't do them on shoulder day I would actually do them on shoulder and back day But wait till the very end that way you don't light up your traps and screw up the rest of your workout and on back day who cares if he had posterior delts again But wouldn't it make? Next let's talk about the seat of row and I'm not gonna go over every variation or grip because Pretty much everything holds true the same as lat pull downs best way to do these Hinge at the hips keep your back straight to make sure your lads pull the weight not your biceps and to answer the question What's the best grip to take? I tested three different variations with a single arm cable row first variation Hand in neutral grip the entire time the second one pronated to twisting into a neutral grip last one staying pronated Clear winner again. I don't know if this is interesting to you guys, but I've been doing it wrong a long time Like a long time it's fascinating if you put all the information together Then the best seated cable exercise you can do for your lads Is this one by a lot? I should note that you can actually get away with any grip you want as long as you keep that elbow in a fixed position Yes, it looks dumb, but it works next up Let's talk about something I was dead wrong about nuts compound movements like bent over rows and deadlifts The ass kickers the ones that hit your entire back my assumption was that if you use lighter weight It's gonna target the same exact muscles as if you jerk the weight up. It does not when you use lighter weight It's predominantly a trap exercise specifically mid trap and just so run the same page I was usually in a weight I could roughly get 20 maybe 25 reps and then throw up in my mouth when I increased the weight to something I could do eight to ten reps with it was still predominantly a mid trap exercise But I got significantly more lat and upper trap activation and it wasn't simply because I increased the weight I got more excitement overall because it wasn't a unilateral increase I actually got less activation out of my lower traps as I went up and weight and again It makes sense the more you think about it the heavier you go the more of a well-rounded ass kicker of an exercise It becomes it's still a mid trap exercise But your upper traps now have to stabilize and maintain a heavier weight throughout the movement and your lats work to counterbalance You so you don't fall in your face so it's almost like there's a built in overload e-centric movement for them So it's just better. I was wrong do it that way and the same thing applies to deadlifts the heavier You go the more upper trap and lat activation you get Another thing I had to check my ego on is how you do those bent over rows and not grip Supernated socks don't ever do those pernated winds every time what I'm talking about is the angle of your body I'm sure you've seen somebody the gym do them when they're almost standing straight up I love to just stare at them across the gym and giggle because I hate them so much Well, we can actually learn something from because when I tested it when you're more straight up It actually turns off your lats and turns on your upper traps then vice versa So if we know that then we can make one hell of a mechanical drop set starting out by almost parallel of the floor And as you start to fail stand up change the position keep going and you're gonna light up your entire back and the same thing applies for T-bar rows If any of that was interesting to you then pull-ups will blow your mind because I tested every variation You can think of wide grip wide grip fixed elbow reverse grip reverse grip fixed V bar handle V bar handle fixed elbow The only two that got more lat than bicep activation were the wide grip variation I even tried to pre-exos my biceps for a half an hour and then test again same result. I also jumped up and just did negatives That was worse. I also hired a lady to come because maybe I'm just too chubby But she got more bicep activation than lat on every variation she did now does that mean you shouldn't do them? No to me you just need you have to be thoughtful of how you program them in your workout because there's no way around it You're gonna hit biceps while you're doing them so just put them at the end of the workout because it's much more than a lat exercise But it is interesting to know how much those biceps get involved during most pull-up variations I mean I guess if you're 130 pounds, you'd never train legs then you probably could isolate it more to your lats But then you would never touch a ladies boob in your life So if I had to summarize what I learned and how I'm gonna apply to my training for upper traps You can't go wrong with shrugs But one interesting thing is that even when I change the angle of the shrug I maintain the same level of activation out of those upper traps I just brought in more mid and lower traps So that means it's a perfect setup to do a mechanical drop your mid traps get hit several times throughout the workout Whether it's bent over rows or T-bar rows But if you really want to isolate them as much as you possibly can then doing movements with your elbows nice and high Is the way to go for lower traps face pulls and wise are by far the best and for lats pretty much every movement going forward Is gonna have a pronated grip and I'm gonna try to keep that fixed elbow the entire time And I know we didn't cover the spinal rector muscles, but that's gonna take its own separate video because there's a lot of conflicting arguments on flexion Extention whether it's safe or not. I'll do a video on back pain programs link below the new one comes out soon good luck
