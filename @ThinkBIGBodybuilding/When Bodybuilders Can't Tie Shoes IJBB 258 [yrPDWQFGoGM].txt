You just on it. Yeah, almost Okay, so there's that and then there's another thing and I don't know how many people will know this that have this greatness But I find in the middle the night that every now and then you have an inch that cannot be scratched you can't reach it So I may or may not Definitely do have a retractable back scratcher by my bed at all times I travels with me it goes down to like you know Little pencil so yeah, pull it out because it's not good you get the scratch and you're like I'm like on the bed and I'm doing one of these and makeies get pissed So yeah, think about the things you can't reach as the bigger you get like you ever see somebody They can like put their hand over the head like this and the other hand behind the back and grab them together Yeah, yeah, yeah that they that weird You know people that have never been over 250 thing yeah, yeah, yeah, I put the belt in the pants before I put the pants I tried to slide that shit through one no air and you can you get to that point you put the belt in first I'll ever cross my mind never cross my mind think about how does that was for you at your biggest when you were trying to get back that back Luke Then you miss one I got one tip I've got one tip for everybody here. So But lots of belts and just leave a pair of belts and every pair of pants is well here's the thing is that you you're always kind of wandering You know you're putting muscle on you look in the mirror and you're like you're like I'm starting to get bigger like am I really jacked yet? I'm gonna tell you what if you can cross your legs You're not jacked yet the gentleman said Cross your legs Your legs aren't big enough yet if you can even put your heel up on the leg with like though other one at a 90 that's also difficult All I can throw like that like like real starts to stretch yeah, it's a good thing Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I basically doing physio if I sit with my legs crossed like in that fashion Yeah, yeah, but the gentleman sit like the oh you mean like this out what that is is like the All the folded yeah, yeah, you know like your professors You know you see a professor sitting like that you probably don't even squat You didn't do a lot of squats No, I've got I've got a friend that'll sit like that. I got a good buddy that'll sit like that once in a while And it's funny because he just pulls it off You just think yeah, he said to distinguish dude in there little bit of them Well, you know complete deviant a little bit of distinguished gentleman in there But he can also wear a bow tie at an event and you know That guy rocks it he's one of those dudes and every did pull it off never warm, but you know what I mean right? Yeah, yeah That can't do it as my life when I was smaller. I could wear a bow tie but there was just cuff links with it I don't want any judgment and most of those guys were very nice anyways Oh Just for pay. This is awkward. Just for pay. Yeah, oh no biggie. Ah It was a 90s dusty. No one's judging you the 90s. Who was it? There was there was rumors I can't remember if it was dumpter or Marcus rule something like oh when he went to the bathroom He couldn't even wipe himself his wife had to hose him down in the shower. Oh, no, that was co-vacce That was great great co-vacce. That was right. Yeah, that was the rumor people said that stuff Imagine being so big that people were make a rumors up about you like that Imagine if the rumor was true Anyways That's how you know you're a huge have you guys ever delved into Like Andre the giant's real life if you ever listened to like the Jake the snake interview where the Hulk Hogan interviews where he talks about Andre or if you ever read any of Andre's Just what you told us on the giant Yeah, yeah Andre people don't realize how big he was he was over seven feet tall And he was 550 pounds when he died and so Like people just don't realize how big Andre was and you listen to the guys that Tired with them like you know the old school guys like Jake the snake and Hold in and the guys that drove around in the vans and the early days with them and all that shit and He would she would shit in the bathtub of the hotel You're kidding because he couldn't use a toilet that he couldn't use the toilet There's no way he could use it you would break it so he would shit in the bathtub and then he would just run the water and use it And he would they use a bucket like wash it all they just insane You know stuff like that So he didn't have an easy life man and like I I thought about Andre like occasionally when I was really big because I'd be like man he's like Another 200 pounds yeah like so on Johnny yeah like look at that on Johnny Carson he put a hard boy old egg through his ring Really yeah, he passed the heart he gave yeah He did that on Johnny Carson when he was on I think that's a that's from Johnny Carson there But I'm he put a hard boy old egg through his ring so if you just think how big his finger was right But he would sit in the back of the van and drink like 36 beers Like they would wrestle and then they would get in the van and they would drive like two hours to the next town and check into their hotel You know what I mean and they get ready to wrestle the next day so that night time drive to the next town every time or whatever He would drink 32 beers in a couple hours no problem They'd get out at the next they'd get out at the next town and there'd be 32 empty beer bottles in the back of the van like you drink a whole flood of beer And it was just no big deal the way it was just so huge so yeah pretty crazy But yeah brushing your teeth getting a bicep pump having to switch sides having to brush left handed for the first time Here's Arnold look at that so Arnold was tall Arnold six one yeah, yeah, yeah, oh wait Here's a better one check this out. There's a little little better angle there Give you an idea how big Arnold was next to him. I don't know who that other guy is will change Plus you get to remember like the world will still is as nice to sizes now Like there are a lot more big men now than there were then yeah, yeah, you know like look at sports look at basketball Look at hockey like to be six four and hockey is normal now Like they were like who guys when I was playing they were that big Was it not a real like the big guy in the league at one point he's like two to 20 or something It's completely normal now so I think that that's another thing. I think about that all the time like Ron, you know when we get on flights And we always sit in like the premium economy at least If like we can't get bumped to first and I always think to myself okay the width is Little tight for me, but I'm short. I mean I'm literally five ten and think and where does like Jamie what does he do where does he let's go yeah because it's tight for my knees in premium economy And I'm five ten I'm like Where does six six go so when we were I've got video of Jamie and I riding in the back seat of Like a compact SUV I think it was a caring member it might have been George was driving and we were leaving the mutant mansion going to the gym And I have video at him where you know the the the ceiling of the car is you know Couple a few inches above my head and then it like goes up there's like a little thing it goes up in the back for like the cargo area And Jamie had to sit there like with his head in the Empire yeah in that higher part and then the the lower part like came up to his forehead that whole time I look like a child sitting next to him. I was looking at how much space I took up compared to him. He just Yeah big dude. I always on a flight to Australia one time going to Australia with mutant and so I was For sure enough to be in premium economy because any overseas flights they put us some air Canada premium which is that those are such nice seats Yeah, pretty air Canada premium like I'm happy is shit there, right? And this entire basketball team gets on and they're like college level or maybe like semi pro I don't know but they were all like Australian kids who had been in the state so they must have been at like some basketball camp or something because there was like 25 of them like it was it was like I saw them in the airport And I was like holy those are those guys are all like like six 10 you know like that really tough And they all cut on my plane. I was like oh damn they're all on my flight They were all sitting all sitting in coach the whole team was sitting in coach and they were all just like Spread out through the crowd like some of them are in middle seats and some of them and and I just remember every time I got up I'd look back there and I was like oh man those guys look like they're just Die and back there like your knees are just pressed against the seats. Yeah, it was really and I'm ever taken like the And bigs weight easier than being six 10 on a plane oh yeah, yeah, you know being big is rough for everybody else But being six 10 that's just brutal on you like their knees are touching the seat the whole flight man Yeah, so you're hanging into the eye or whatever being wide it's not a huge deal So anyways, we've do railed as always Yes, what's up I do have I've got another one because we kind of badly know we're like we didn't know what we wanted to do for a lead topic We like that one and we like this one what training split did you guys get the most Overall growth from and I want to hear the story like like how old were you at that time? You know what was bodybuilding like for you at that time? Okay I mean mine I think everyone knows the plan which was DC training It was 2007 that I started it But the reason that I was obsessed with the plan was I had seen Justin Harris's pictures online before and I just remembered seeing what he looked like and I thought to myself He's a big white guy Meaning it's just he's big but it's not the prettiest thing and I thought you know what that might be an achievable thing to look at you know because at the time you're looking at these guys that are all drastically different than me and it was just kind of hard to digest as I actually glance to my pictures Well, I'm doing this to see if I had this picture of him but it was hard for me to even think Did I could look like them so I found out that he worked with Dante and I hunted Dante down and asked him to work with me and I reached out. It was funny But I had just had a bad experience with a coach who didn't go I hired and I told him I was gonna go to an event and I walked up to him and said hey, I'm dusty how you doing I didn't know who I was and that threw me off because I understood like he's training a lot of people And he might not like not know me if I just walked up in an event Yeah, but I love not as coming I told him my name and then he looked me because I hate what's I've Dude and shook my hand. I was like I mean walked off. Oh, I Weird so anyways I said you know I don't know if you know who I am blah blah blah So Dante responds back to me says, no, I know who you are You've done really great and you're huge. They don't need me See ya and I remember at first I read it and I was like, oh, that's cool. I keep that you know I don't need him and I was like Trying to trick me because I'm dumb So I Reach back out and I hounded him as the long story short and got him to training and The thing that made it different Then this is the whole thing I want to remind people of his two things number one It was a first time that because of the fact that I literally had to nag him into working with me My promise to him was if I changed anything about his program He could dump me immediately and never talked to me again And I paid him 800 bucks and I was poor so that was a ton of money sure for me I should have to save it up once he told me to mount so I could hire him And because of that I executed it flawlessly No mistakes. I mean no deviation. I was obsessive about making sure I understood what he wanted me to do How he wanted me to do it? I'd send him videos make sure I was executing not just the movement correctly But the intensity and all those things and that blood into the Diet and on and on and on and the reason I explained that whole thing is my true answer is Progressive overload to me is the best way to put on muscleness does not have to be DC training There's not like it worked the best for me But the biggest secret was progression and the fact that I was a machine about it day in and day out And I think that's where most people slip With growth is they don't see a bunch of growth in three weeks and they change a program And they don't see enough and they change this and they change that and they're never Extruing anything long enough To figure out what would work when in reality chance art everything that they were doing would have worked Yeah, if they were done with the highest level of intensity Hopefully progressively and been consistent so I I Made the most gains I tell people this now because things have like and but I made the most gains When I was 17 right at the end of high school so my last year high school I After football was over so like I started training like Dorian That was when I started Dorian style because I was doing like just regular workouts before that like four sets of you know four sets of bench You know what I mean just like thinking and just terms of regular workouts taking a you know stuff out of flex magazine and stuff But you know I started training like Dorian and I'd flirted with it a bit you know throw at high school Started taping my sets down a little bit but I remember I actually started training four days a week Because I thought that's what he did you know about what we were reading so I started just training Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday or Saturday and Friday was my leg day So I would sometimes do it Friday. I would sometimes do it Saturday and then I'd have Sunday off and um I started training like that would have been like 1992 Like you know and the 92 and I did that exact split the Dorian split and then when blood and got to came out in 97 I was like oh I'm already on this split. He's still on this split Yeah, no, I mean yeah, and I just stayed on it The guys in Australia. I trained with we're on it so we just stayed with it literally didn't change a thing We all trained exactly the same and I stayed on the Dorian split until I think it was like 2004 is when I finally like was like I think I'm gonna have an arm date Because I thought my arms had to come up, you know, this weren't coming up at that point And I was kind of being stubborn about it and I made some changes, but So essentially 10 years didn't change a single thing Barely changed exercises Like leg press Squats like it was basic gym stuff all those gyms were pretty basic you're leg pressing hacking extensions and squats and that's it None of us no one was lunging in the 90s not until Ronnie came along no one was lunging They weren't a thing and like girls were lunging and you know fitness people were lunging But bodybuilders were like they can't load that exercise enough screw that everyone was into like What can you load effectively, you know, right so you know You know what I mean so anyways the the point being is I did that for 10 years and I went from I mean, you know It's probably about 210 when I started training like that 205 and you know by 2004 I was like three you know 320 so Yeah, it's a lot of weight man. Yeah, but that's but I literally got all the way up to 320 on that split I love that's the thing that I connect with the most that I hope people get is Basically the same split a lot of the same movements, you know because you get that a ton of clients like Can change your workout and I'm like are you by singing? Yes, why? Like and I sometimes think and I like to remind newer clients when I'm going I'm not being lazy And sometimes we will switch a movement to movements some of the you know you've you've run out of but like Oftentimes people will say well don't I need to shock my body and my get the shock is Getting strong. Yes, that's You know those are getting crazy You know my body was it's in shock when my delus were 405 for five and then when they were you know 750 for five my body was like oh, that's shocking That's a lot more you know, so you kind of want to get to those places Scott I just sent you a pictures That was what I looked like when I saw Justin Harris that's him on the right Okay, and I decided I needed to hire Dante So I was kind of a guy peek at that point and then so that was a Six in that picture so I didn't actually like that was just my best look at that point and I hired you And then later seven and then that picture was 2011 doing what he told me to do So that was that's crazy from 07 to 11 Yeah, so that's what five years Yeah, so the left picture actually because that was that was a late o six, but yeah, it's like I mean just a five-year time period and only Like I said basically three and a half of that was with Dante Yeah, and it was you know just just a night and I probably have friends With with you know, maybe changing gyms the odd time and a bit of variety you probably used about six Back exercises the entire time Right right right that's actually that's the funny thing is that's true. I could literally tell you Yeah, what no we tried because you do them name them so I would what for width was How many how many did you actually do on a regular basis? That's okay, this was this would all of them so one workout would be ractions with a Smith barbarrow That's the full back workout those two movements Another one would be pull ups with a deadlift and Then the last one would be like I used to live the hammer pull down With a rack deadlift there's my hole. That's everything I did Those three things you know those three workouts would rotate through and then you'd go back to the first one again And be your numbers and that is what I did essentially my entire career You just now funny people would pick on me online. They're like you keep posting the same stuff like this is all I do Nothing else to folks Yeah, yeah, that's awesome those pictures are crazy. I I also too have to Pitch in about this that era where Justin and Kuklo were training together very young Steve Kuklo were training together on YouTube those What what yours would there was a bin? I saw him who's even YouTube where they those were on the message board I saw a couple of clothes 2006 I believe it was win his first show and he just smoked yeah like dudes at him and you know bodybuilding Completely for a decade, you know, yeah, so it was even pre YouTube because those videos were on the message board That's where they were posting and Justin was putting them up and it was like a young Kuklo with him and they were like doing stuff that Was crazy like Justin was squatting six plates for like sets of 10 Yeah, and then he would do a widow maker. He'd put 405 on and he'd do 20 reps of it And afterwards Yeah, I grinded it and then you know they were hacksquadding seven plates and it was like That was not calm and you know and I remember it I was like super motivated I'm gonna hacksquad 7 plates now because like but I remember they were just so strong back then It was mind bogging and I knew they did this DC training, you know, yeah, so yeah, that was exact that picture though That I mean that was literally when I decided because I was like It was literally like what like you know when people talk about the the Their dream of you know a wrestler whatever I saw a guy who I I didn't know but I knew he was on the boards and I'm like I want to look like that like it's just it was so freaky to see Me just you know out in this patio hitting a lot spread and I'm looking at mine I'm like this thing like we do the same thing But I you know the last picture put up that was like probably one of the peaks of my career because I saw that picture and I'm like I caught him I did it like this is What that was you know what I mean and and that was super rewarding because here and it was the best part was I did it by doing what he did Hmm, yeah, he's copied on there was work with him and I feel like that's the confusing thing that people just don't want to accept is the fact that You don't have to reinvent the wheel But you also can't avoid the hard work consistently I mean I watched the train and I was like okay, that's what their training looks like that's what mine muscle like every single time And I think it also reinforces what I mentioned about like How I've always thought about exercises like all those exercises that you listed are very like You know you can get really strong on them And you can you can Really tax the body with those exercises you know you're locked in You know that sort of thing and how I said like you know that like I'd never really been a lunge I just Just didn't really feel like you could really go to failure on them because like my idea of Why I'm in the gym was to do sets that are incredibly taxing Right, and I just think well what's more taxing like getting in getting under a smith and doing another set of deep squats to complete failure You know with a spotter or you know wrestling around a bar getting up behind my neck lunging outside in the parking lot Can't really go to failure. You're can't really get a spot Like you know what I mean like I just so so exercise selection was always just like what kind of hit the hardest with like what What are the highest impact tools I have and just repeat those for 10 years? Yeah, that's why I love Matt Jansen's like slogan like do the hard stuff Yeah, that's where things get missed and you know I talk about it regularly at home When we're talking about what we're picking to do in the gym because to me it's simple like There's a reason everyone and I I'm picking a movement. I like there's a reason people love to go to the hamble Hammero and row on it Because no matter how you cut it that's easier than putting a bar on the ground pretty much a weight on and doing barba rows Oh, yeah, it's a pain in the ass and every way you got to load up you got to lift the end the whole thing is a pain in the ass It's harder so that's literally my advice to young guys. I'm gonna do the most basic things and perfect them Then eventually when you want to rule around with that row, it's fine, but I'm telling you When when the thing happened that we were all the gym for a couple of years ago And I had to go to a gym that didn't have any that equipment and I was forced back to a barbell on the ground I got really strong again my back got really big again and I was like why did I get away from this This is the stuff that works You know, so that's always my push them like if we have a bar gravity and weight We're ready for back day. We're good to go right right Yeah, yeah, keep in it simple, you know What about you Scott? I want to hear because I like you I know some of your stories far as variations Yeah, what what was it and what made it different that made you grow the best? Well, I would say that for a lot of my body building I feel like The training was creative and it was fun and it was really hard and it was higher volume and I feel like it honestly was the food and the drugs that were the driver And Later when I did start getting into more progressive overload and I just decided like I'm gonna try to learn to get as strong as I can Then I started growing with really low drugs and not doing anything with my diet like eating like I was kind of like you In that semi retired. I'm still eating bodybuilding food, but I'm not really Being super strict with it. I make sure I get on my protein in and and you know what I'm gonna get a little extra carbs Because I'm trained in hard today that kind of thing and I'm like look I'm getting big you know right right And it really did open my eyes. I will say One body part that I really struggled with for a while was hamstrings I learned how to grow my quads and and you see this a lot you know you see guys that like that early stage of You're building a physique your shoulder start growing faster than your chest Quad start growing faster than the ham that kind of thing and and I still didn't have a good back yet But I started doing Hamstring curls the way John Meadows would do them in in Shelby and we're you know doing a lot of mountain dog stuff and I What I started doing is I started really controlling the negative Driving it down is hard as I freaking could trying to like slam that thing into the bottom if I could But not letting it bounce back up holding it there, okay? Yeah contract those hamstrings Like I'm trying to freaking make them spasm for like one full second and then just slowly let it up And I did that exact same hamstring curl every time I trained legs leading forward to kind of like get a little bit of a stretch in it And in one day I realized that I had worked my way pretty far up the stack you say machine every week, you know And I realized wow I'm able to control this with a lot more weight now and and I kind of like felt the back of my leg Around that same time and I'm saying man, I got a I've got a lot more hand than then I took a picture and I could see it like I didn't see it You know what I mean right and then it but like it transformed my hamstrings from Being like mediocre and missing really to being like a legit muscle group and they've honestly they've never gone away since then like I've still held on to them That's awesome. That's funny. I remember Back when I was I think it was just like night two years after high school I remember my hacksquat. I got up to five plates on the hacksquat and this was like an old school hacksquat that we had like wheels on it You know it wasn't on the nails So like and I was doing five plates on that hack and I remember like I would have only been like 19 years old but everyone in the gym was like holy you're strong on those and I was probably bouncing a bit out of the bottom You know like there are Little aggressive I always be in aggressive on that thing and I remember I took my monthly measurements and You know I was running like one of my first cycles. I was probably just taking a bit of test or something you know what I mean and I took my monthly measurements and my legs were up like half an inch from the month before And I was like oh And then like because I'd I'd seen my legs grow over time. I had like years of measurements But they were really doing they were really growing and then like the next month I measured and they were up again like noticeable like a couple eights and I was like man this is really going well especially my legs And I remember thinking you know I'm really focusing on my hacksquat Yeah, it's been like my main focus for legs like everything else was secondary like was all about what I was gonna hacksquat Yep, and and I was just Really putting everything into that particular exercise and then that's I remember that just triggered in me like wow I think hacks are really good for me like But you know some exercise like dusty picks weights up in his back looks like that, you know, and I just remember thinking like oh I haven't never seen like even my previous cycle or whatever I didn't see my legs grow that rate. Yeah, and I remember just like little things like that They kind of make you think like oh this XC exercise for me, you know, so I was stuck with hacks as like a real kind of rule You know before the pendulum squat days Yeah, yeah back spin Jim Jim's were simple. Okay Let's see what else we got here how about this one Enjoy the program you guys are great 48 years old started lifting again at 40 After not doing anything for 20 years I've been making great progress and Being completely natural not even TRT he's getting 315 for reps on an inclined bench 405 for reps on squat This is at 48 405 for reps on dead's Question I took two weeks off lifting and I also had a massage during that two weeks now on back and I lost as much as 70 pounds on my lifts is that typical? No I would say no that's not typical And the massage didn't hurt you if anything it would have helped But it also might come back really quick too Yeah, you know I I mean I know from personal experience from running like actual TRT now That you know if I missed let's say I take a week off like you know we used to you know how I would take a week off as like a d-load When you come back to the gym and like nothing's changed right now if I take a week off for like a d-load I come back to the gym and some of the lifts are down like It's not the same so yeah, I don't know just it'll come back up though just stick with it This is what you think that I would say is um and I do this all my clients on our plan d-loads is We don't go back trying to hit those old numbers right away So if something was on like a 12 week blast and then they go we do our d-load for two weeks I go back five weeks and I want to look at those numbers start there Right and and and you might be gas to help and could have done the newest numbers again But I find I shouldn't say I find let me rewind I was taught By Dante and then he was correct and my you know experiences If you go right back to your numbers even if you can beat them you shorten the next blast Because you're going to hit a wall faster for what you can do Right and I know that doesn't make a lot of sense because the thing that will aren't you just going in there and doing the max You can anyways, but you're going base off of other numbers so if I go and look into weight from five weeks go and I got 12 I might get 13 14 today Which is a higher you know total on a straight set that I would have gotten and then next week I'm making your asses in next time I have that movement. I'm making the decision off of that 14 reps Yeah, yeah, it's going to go longer so I wouldn't worry at all I would say the biggest problem that he had there is that he tried to go back to those numbers It wouldn't have been where I started anyways Right, right. Yeah, don't sweat it just get a few workouts under your belt Yeah, you know and if that's just coming back from you know Come back from the flu when you're 15 pounds down you just go psychobled the true all your muscle tissue a couple times and you'll fill right out Yeah, you're great Okay, here's an interesting one He says as a strict eastern Orthodox Christian I have to fast every Sunday 12 a.m. to 12 p.m When we per take in communion in during lent in advent We also fast 12 hours a day for 40 days each Have you had any clients that had to work around this? That is it something that I should approach my bishop to get a Dispens like dispensation I am not a competitive bodybuilder just a guy trying to get leaner and in better health And keeping up with my five grandkids all under seven he says he's 63 going on 64 and he's all nanny and His testosterone level show that they are still in the normal range For his age I'm going to add that part there's the important line What I mean first off I know the answer for all three of us and yes I've worked with people that this time sure you both have as well I don't find a 12 hour faster really hard to work around It just means we're eating more. I mean all your time is I'm assuming that you sleep at night like most people So it means if you're waking up at six in the morning there's six hours before you can eat again That's not really a huge deal to me and I can I could roll it roll through your lent time as well And it wouldn't be an issue um as far as the the question about asking your bishop That's that's up to you and and what these things mean to you but as a coach I could work around it without a being a problem at all Yeah, I agree same thing I worked with the guy that was doing Ramadan Yeah, I'm going to go harder Like overlap as part of his prep you know what I mean up. Yeah, we were just strategic about nighttime eating and having a shake in the middle of the night and you know just Keep into it, you know best you could you got really good shape I think that's good for you to think about on the on the religious side which I am not but because it's important to you Um If you're executing these things and you're able to Stay within what you Want to do religiously while doing this I think that both should feel like bigger victories You know because I feel like that's where things get slippery for a lot of people is You've got your views of of religion and then you got your views of the world and then you decide to which one You're going to let tug you and what direction it's cool when you can stay strong on both So there's no reason you shouldn't in this case Yeah 12 hours We need to see whatever you want 12 hours easy, you know 12 hours. It's easy. Yeah, and remember what are the what's 95% of it Eating the food totals and doing the workouts. Yeah, okay We need them. Do you guys should we tell them to maybe get his lips checked again and look at maybe I don't know I don't know because he's he's in the normal range for 65 year old I don't like it. I don't like to turn range because Truthfully and this isn't even a push on anything but like a Doctor could tell you that when you feel like shit Yeah, you're in range all the other girls that are you're either during your age or in the same range as you You know Yeah Yeah, but even in order to find a end of normal if you don't feel as good That's not okay like you can adjust that and the thing I remind people is Had he went to bed at 20 years old and woke up the next day with his hormones where they are now He would go to the hospital because he would like something is wrong When they say when they say average you have to remember that the average American is I can't remember the number I thought was 35 pounds overweight and has a thousand dollars in the bank So you don't ever want to be average So when they say oh you're right in the average right in that average zone it's like no, no I know nothing about this is gonna stay there You know what's fun. I have to show us we're gonna be told but I Had to go to the a counselors office with my oldest daughter at one point and she's like yeah She pays a three point out which is right where you want it to be it's right in the average and I'm like We're promoting Yeah, right no no no no no You know it's like well, oh we did Not shouldn't for average, but it was the way it was presented to me like I don't give a shit What a great darker just killing every other way But it's just funny to me when I was presented that way like it's excellent It's at me like it can't be both it can either be excellent or it can be average Right Yeah, very odd to me, but at any rate That's why we don't care about school Moving This is what we don't care about school. We're teaching money around here anyways. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh fight man I honestly think sometimes like I'm a watching a lot of like financial YouTube videos you know and um And the what I feel I'm talked about like how on you know how the schools don't do anything to educate people on finance whatsoever nothing Right like nothing and It always seems like it's on purpose because They did like you know you do the math on the people that are taught finance at a young age like you know Take $100 a month and invest it into the S&P 500 or something or a mutual funds or and then you know save for this and you know But you know budget for this and just awareness and like how credit card debt works and just all these things that they don't tell Anybody and if and you do the math on like kids that are taught it when they come out of high school And where people wind up on average 30 years later They're just like astronomical the difference. Yes, you know, they're out paid out paces school by far because of you know School doesn't guarantee money, right? So yeah, pretty crazy but things are definitely if you can educate yourself financially that's like the number one Most important tool So You know plus you have That's what you can do before you have money. That's the confusing thing like that I did wrong Is I didn't know anything about money when I started making it which just meant I wasted more Yeah, that's what people don't get it. It's like no, no, no, you want to learn this when you have none You know, oh you can only put $40 a way a month a great put it away Yeah, like that that's okay You don't want to be the point where you could put away 4,000 but you don't because you're more on Like yeah, that's not good So yeah, it was interesting, but you know I will say she had one class last semester that was all about it. It was amazing She's bringing stuff home on like this guy's teaching you this This is the only good teacher you have I mean it was for not every every day. It was a conversation I'm like you're learning something worth learning This is I'll never forget my my favorite teacher was my economics teacher and He back in the day like this was in 90s, but like you went about to do this now, but he was drug dealing Like he was always talking in like drug dealing terms. He's like okay If you have a kill with cocaine and the market gets tastes this is then he's like talking about supply and demand And this and he would always use like hilarious examples. Yeah, you know You can you can you can you can where the fuck okay We're gonna cut that We're gonna get the gangster teacher. Yeah, he was awesome He's like Ron you understand kilos anyways Okay, so there's a high demand for prostitutes There's only this many prostitutes No classes like look at at each other Ron and back here at the front going aha Yeah, so so Two it's from They have past ports or they know passport type prostitutes like we need to know Mike's friends. They're from Calgary, but anyways Oh Sorry, all the Canadians were good that joke. Um yeah And for some reason they're always on a boat and Kelona This is all over the country All the Canadians are getting all of this right. I'm sorry. There we go. There we go Scott doesn't know about boats and Kelona. No nothing. Okay, just good. It's a Google for Later buddy. Okay, okay Okay, I know I saw a Jim Googling that right now, but anyways All right now like probably offended like half the people I know that like to go to Kelona for summer vacation every girl I met in Calgary is also mad at me right now Yeah All right, you I was talking with the other one. I wasn't necessarily laughing at the at at at Calgary specifically, but I just was laughing that you picked a city That made a fun guy. I had experience Because then that maybe fake he does he's got some skin in the game We're really jeez You know that says more about you than it does about Calgary I'll have to ask my wife after after my wife was some life to ask her what this means God's like I'm an honorary Canadian, but I'm not this Canadian Yeah You haven't gotten in any trouble in Canada yet buddy Yeah All right, so we had another one says question when you first start lifting You feel and perceive yourself to be way better than you actually are and then As you've gotten better you actually make and you make progress You never feel like you're good enough and only see it Like when you look back at old pictures. Yeah, so he says is that true or is it just me? That's true Hi, I Don't like I don't mean to sound like it's like you know I don't be I don't want to be a downer thing, but I Literally didn't really ever Like my physique Like you know what I mean? I look back now at some of my pictures and I'm like Man, I really was you know like I can't believe I look like that at any point in time You know what I mean? Yeah, and at the time I was just so critical of everything and I see guys now who have Your good physique's like coming up national level and stuff and they're really critical of themselves And I understand it but I also want to make sure they they take a minute and just enjoy where they Come and how far they've come you know like I try to help people I know you're critical and every show you feel like you could have been a little better here a little bit of there But like try to also celebrate what you're doing and how you're how you like what you've achieved and how What you've built and stuff and that was a bit of that was lost on me because I was so Competitive with myself you know I saw it like it's a good thing though like I Yes, and I try to do the same thing But I also find that all of my best clients are that way Because they're yeah, I've been for more and like you said you just want to remind them hey just for this minute Just just right now Soak this up for 24 hours and then tomorrow We will talk about your Terrible yeah, yeah, even just even just even just a bit of that even just a bit of that you know what I mean I guess I'm I'm saying like you want to recognize when there's misery being caused Right no reason you don't want that you know what I mean and I got to places like that I'd buy it periods where I was just fucking like you know what I mean Got enough body of the disease of bodybuilding because Those things we all have like so you'll love this round but two days ago I wake up in the morning and this is like the routine of us how just sleep She goes It happened like what she goes I had the dream Didn't have my tan on before the show I got that dream yeah, I go had you shave she goes hadn't shaved and I was talking to my grandmother and I was late for pre-jaging And I'm like there it is we all have it's the dream yep You got you ever have the drawing You forget to drop your water or something you forget I've had that dream a Santa backstage you look down my arms aren't shaved Yeah, I forgot to I forgot to take I was exposed to take like half a tablet dies. I did my dream I forgot to take it and I looked down and realized I hadn't shaved my arms didn't know my tan on hadn't My diorotic I had one trained to shave backstage in the mirror what like all my class was pumping up I was like I get this finished, you know I think it's so great because everyone can relate to that the bodybuilds Yeah, when I used to play hockey I would occasionally have a dream that I got in a fight and I was like throw in like cotton balls at the guy Like Yeah, you're strolling everything having it's like The guy's like look at you like what are you doing? It's like super slow motion. I've had this get handled It's so it's like every I assume that means every sport has a thing because I would tell the guys like oh, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, also I've mentioned this before but way before I competed I had to I would have a training dream all the time It wasn't prepper-related, but it was just workout related. I'd be I'd be in the gym And I'd be about to do my big set of something in kind Smith or squads or late press or something And then right when I'm about to do my set. I'd realize I forgot the time I shoot oh And I have to tie my shoe and then I get under the bar again and the someone took a plate off one side The hell that guy there didn't realize I was using this and he took a plate off it so I got to put plate back on and then Getting all psyched up and really asking my spotter hasn't walked over. I'm looking at my spotters talking to someone on my jeez And this frustration and I remember one time I had that dream and I was on a cruise ship So I was like on a cruise ship in the cruise ship gym trying to have a workout and I was just getting so frustrated and I'd wake up in like an angry cold sweat Squats It's amazing. Yeah, and that would happen all the time and the setting would change the gym would change But it would always be the same idea That's amazing that is freaking amazing I haven't had that so but yes my point was just that we all have those things like the never being happy to look and Everybody builder that's worth the salt is definitely forgotten the shave and this dream Yeah, just a shy or posted this picture these this side by side the other day He said this was like is off season 16 weeks out and then at 255 and then to 25 at two weeks out And he said that he was he's like I look at these pictures and I wasn't happy with either of these He's like and I look at I look back at him now and I'm only Remotely happy and somebody commented and they didn't get it.

We need a good finisher question something to leave the people with you know With with feeling like they they've they tuned into something worthwhile and that they're Happy to leave and a good no And I'm gonna try to pull it's no pressure yeah And this thing is this it took me only we're doing so to me to me two hours to find this picture by the way There's incredible just That's 93 right 93 yeah, okay, and that is also any of the injuries Yeah, look at that table yeah, look at him kind of furniture Did he think his mom's house or something He looks like a children, you know, I mean a 90s bro So just think like you know Just think you know he's a rainy mr. Olympia in this picture Yeah, because he won a 92 that's a TV he's watching is that a 20 inch That a VHS Yeah, all in one Okay, it looks like it. That's nice It's really classy for the time. Yeah, no judgment no judgements. You know what I mean? Yeah, it is a different time man. It's funny Old school hey I had something I wanted to tell you guys about We always get questions about like people when you hear about investment stuff So when I was a kid my dad would put like a little money away from me here and there and I remember we got involved with What was called like the internet fund? Technologies fund With Janice years ago and he put like just a small amount of money away for me and then over the years obviously from since like 92 That's growing a lot, you know, but it's not anything you're gonna like retire off of what it's not like a Bitcoin or something But it's right, it's a way that you can you're nice to have yeah, you could put your savings in there anyway I got involved in The Vanguard federal money market fund this year and So basically I don't know what I wanted to do with some little bit of money I had put away and it was just sitting in savings We said it's like the worst thing you can do right? I lose you money yeah, yeah So this is like a it's basically a mutual fund and it's federally ensured So like you are guaranteed not to lose anything on it and it's actually like made money. It's like made decent money So It's kind of cool. It's kind of cool and obviously the more you put in the more you make back But yeah, I put a little bit of money in that and it's cool. I get a monthly report So I wanted to throw that up there for anybody who's listening who's maybe in that position where they've got like a couple $1,000 in the bank and they're like hey, I'm gonna save this long term You could pull it out at any time, you know, and you're gonna make more money off of it than just sitting in the bank You could do it all yourself, too. You don't need like some help or anything. You just do it all on you Like Dusty said people forget that if if they're just sitting on cash technically they're losing money because of inflation Yeah, so Your cash is slowly worthless less and less and less and less when you sit on it So that's something you gotta keep in mind especially when you start accumulating any sort of savings So you know Yeah, definitely good advice. I had a guy last week Go ahead run I just say bring up stuff like that because honestly I have a professional that I work with Yeah, and one thing that I'm adamant about especially in the in our world I don't not everyone would be somebody who's speaking out of term So when people was do you have investment advice? I'm like no yeah, and that's why I can't like I can't give you expert advice I would send you to my guy who would give you expert advice so it's like Even sometimes I've said some things and I'm like oh man and I'll verify with him. I'm like what's that wrong? He's like no you're fine. Like Yeah, because you just don't want to be that guy that's giving out advice like and then somebody who's listening to show that's like a fine answer experts like Dusty some more on or Somebody loses money because they listen No, but my my financial advice to people is yes Like take action educate yourself You start saving somehow. There's a lot of different ways you can Invest in safe but if you're not investing in saving then you're truly Set new self up for a rough future. So yeah, my advice is like I had a 22 year old kid asked me last week Like what should I do to make sure that I you know have the money to bodybuild and I was like well first of all set yourself up at life Oh start Investing starts saving money putting some money away start making a budget. You know that sort of thing like You know like what Dusty's given the helping to give the gift of financial literacy to those two girls and You know that's that's that's awesome. That's that's the tip Yeah, you know yeah and the thing too is like the reason I brought this up is because it's one of those things that like You don't need to have like you're not gonna be if you have like 2,000 bucks that you want to do something more Than just putting the bank you're not gonna get a guy Like guys not gonna yeah, the guy's not gonna take time out of his day for you. You know what I mean, but But it is a step better than the bank is it gonna be like your biggest turn You know you're gonna make the biggest returns on it probably not but it's it's still a very true, you know Yeah, you know pretty pretty say a pretty safe long-term thing like you know on an average doesn't the S&P 500 out perform most hedge funds If you just go long-term like over to George. Oh yeah, yeah, so Even if you're just doing those those ETFs and stuff those are that's kind of a real you know relatively Smart and safe choice if you're gonna get into that type of thing too. Yeah, yep Okay, I remember what they were what they are now, but I remember back in the day when I first started Those things were like I think it was over seven years might have been nine They're average and 12 percent so I mean that's and there was an enormous than not I don't know it is now But it's really interesting some, but it was like that's a big number Yeah, you know to be locking those in and and you nail it around like I make the girls save 20% of every dollar they make And right now it's just saving and then in time it'll become other things But it's just my my initial plans get you still living off of the 80% of what you make Because most people live off 110% of what they make right right yeah, yeah, you don't want to be there I read how's this for I love these stories So do you guys know who Duff McCaggan is oh, yes, of course the base player the base player from guns and roses right Got a rate radio show on serious with his wife three cords in the truth. I love it anyways. He's a easy great guy. I like Duff And I was reading a bottom I can't remember where I read it, but I guess in 1993 If you think that was when guns and roses released the user illusion one and two albums Oh, yeah, right so they had like that double album in 93 there with November rain and all those huge hits And I guess that's when they really made a lot of money because you know appetite was a massive hit, but you know By by the early 90s they were really making money those tours were making the millions And he thought you know I don't want to be a broke 60-year-old rock and roll or so I should invest some of my money and he thought you know I really he's from Seattle So he thought I want to invest in my own community so he looked around at Seattle companies And he thought well and best in In these companies he invested in Starbucks he invested on this one Invested in like a bunch of these local Seattle companies right And yeah Yeah, and so I guess stuff McCagon has made more in the stock market investments He's made them from all of the music he's ever written and sold a bit of all with yeah, no kidding Yeah, I was you said Seattle like telling you gonna use or Starbucks in episode Yeah, yeah Why a bunch of Starbucks stock you know, yeah probably a several million at that point ready to just put somewhere You know So Victoria was talking about some a rapper. I can't remember who he was, but he's like heavily involved in the car wash industry And he like I don't know if you guys have him where you're at dusty, but we're getting these new car washes and it's like a club Where you do like a monthly fee You remember you yeah, you come as many times as you want. I have four of them Do you every recar our house as one of those Okay, okay, so yeah, then the new car wash and like I know a guy That I actually got in recovery with we both I knew him from high school We both ended up getting in recovery about the same time and now he's building those car washes he'll get like a loan And then he'll have that car wash built and then he flips it basically and he's a That's what he's doing for business, but this guy this rapper. He's like it's not a sexy thing But he gets involved in these car washes and that's like where all of his money goes that he makes with wrapping and then he turns it around I wish I could remember who it was, but it's not something you think of you know You think of rappers and you think of like oh he's in the weed industry or something like that, you know Right, I mean think it was I mean that's such a obvious great business. So I mean who doesn't wash their cars? I mean Yeah, people who don't wash their cars wash them occasionally Yeah, and you can go in there and pay hand to a rest if you want to buy one wash You don't who else likes car washes Hey There we go, see for the me again our case Not a lot of Not a lot of different yeah, look little something called a laundry mats A laundry mat right Are we still given it or are we still given advice to people here? This is also just different The different my name This is from Ron's teacher, I believe After you made the money selling me yeah What one of the biggest business guys is shack do you guys know shackle on over 50 over 50 different businesses like different brands Any other jobs? Yeah, he's got 150 car washes he's got 155 five guys burgers What's got in real expensive 19 pot 19 pop a john 17 anti-annas pretzels Okay, handful of good crispy crispy creams He also he also owns 60 24 hour fitness locations Yeah, like he's he just Six little that money that's amazing You could think too like he wouldn't really need to do any of that I bet he could probably just sit on his money Yeah, do whatever you want you know right as It is fat as he can and run out of time doing it. Yeah, you know That's cool though. I was just watching I don't know do you guys watch that? I don't have to talk back remember to short thing on Kelsey That's is on Netflix or whatever it is, but it's They're they're looking you know they're talking about a guy who he's trying to figure out what he's gonna do he retired this year just barely is announced his retirement from football and He's so much what he's gonna do and he's like oh, I don't think about real estate and all these different things I mean finished watching it, but what I loved about it was is while he's talking I'm like Quick Google what is he worth and I know these aren't accurate because mine isn't fully accurate, but I went and looked and it was like $40 million and I'm like wow he has no plans. It's just chilling He's like right now. What am I gonna do and I wish more people understood that because my mom died Attempting to retire and I'm like the thought of retirement is disgusting to me like I want to do something I mean it'll be something I fun. I want to do but like I can't imagine just being like all right I'm gonna stay home now And then what you know what I mean? I mean I'm gonna make Scott doing on podcast Yeah You know like you said I mean like shack has so much money his kids kids kids kids can't spend it all But it's just in the game and I love that yeah, yeah There's I you see that Andrew Tate real It came through my YouTube and it was Andrew Tate and he said Someone said like what's the limit of money and he said 20 million He said unless you want a yacht or a plane 20 million is the limit where nothing above that makes any difference whatsoever And it's saying because when you get to the 20 million part you have so many your money is making so much money for you That you can literally just try and waste it and you'll you'll never run up that is crazy He said and he said you know, but if you want to yacht or an airplane you need more than 20 million Because that's gonna be a big vacuum of like maintenance and constant taking care of and you have to hire yeah Like it's like you have to like basically only a company to take care of your yacht and your plane right? Yeah, so he said but if you don't want a yacht or a plane nothing makes a difference over 20 million and I just sucked that was pretty funny that You know that's that was his ceiling, you know, yeah, so yeah So we're almost there boys find those find those lines. I a friend of mine bought a a Oh, like a condo and Dana point So he goes and he puts the offer on the place and everything and then there was a hold-up and the hold-up was the real estate agent Couldn't find the owner So they had to Call around and eventually his pilot called the guy who drove his yacht and he was out in the yacht and they had to like he was like oh He had forgotten he had that house This is an old thing. I'm like Wait, so your pilot had to call the captain of his ship that you were on and it's going to remind you What is happening in this world and and why isn't there someone else that can sign off on this like Yeah, it was like it was obviously that wasn't like a long process But it was just a funny thing he goes you won't believe this. I'm trying to buy like my coolest little thing and this guy forgot to ever own it Right Is anybody in there he probably had never was funny is it in my his my real estate agent that That deal goes he probably never knew he'll he probably never saw it like that was just a thing Someone bought or you know what I mean Yeah, whatever reason he was required on some piece of it which I guess isn't normal either That's that 20 million mark when you said that about a pilot.
