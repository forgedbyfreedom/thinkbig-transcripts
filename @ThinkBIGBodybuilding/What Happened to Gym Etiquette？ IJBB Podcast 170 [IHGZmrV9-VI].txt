in one season you know a lot of drugs log it's so hilarious because that's that's the joke it was all it was was a massive cruise yeah I'm kidding and staying relatively good shape okay like not pushing the way it up like crazy just like eating to be big you know and you know I think I don't even think you got to it's heavy a stepper his heaviest ever was like 260 I think and then the last off season I don't know if you even went over thinking mighty hit 250 maybe okay so you know and just like just training and eating that was it yeah and then start the prep again right like with a big break it's a lower lats there I like that lower lat hanging his yeah so you know he's using using good shape that's cool yeah the third one down see the first one oh yeah yeah I didn't know so he's done some shots with mutin you know and not to inside his garage jemmy's got his own jemmy do he is the coolest gym let's see if he has any pictures of his gym up yeah his video the compound okay yeah some screw down a little bit here because his jemmy's one of the night this is from his jem this is one of the nicest home jemms that I have ever seen in my entire life he's gone as far as to like repout her coat machines so that they patched that's a nice shot of right there yeah yeah he's in great shape you know he's six feet tall so he's in that that 220 cap classic yeah you know he's in the the bumstead class when bumstead was an amateur but all bumstead turn pro's a body or turn pro's a bodybuilder I'm looking for his jem here this is that's less mister no yeah that's all less goes keep scrolling that'll be one come up but yeah I got him hooked up with with mutin so it's been going good for him let's see I remember he posted one a long time ago this is what there's one yeah yes so this is sitcom jemmy if that kid even flake in there he calls it the compound can you blow that up at all I can't actually wait maybe I can let's see what this does there we go oh boy you know we got all the flags and shit you know he's even got I would even got like an out of order treadmill just like a real jem right like literally that's the fucking jokery's got like an out of order treadmill like oh yeah real jem you know I mean he's out a lot of people over to train there you know but like hammer machines fucking I carry in or whatever he's got in there uh some like to stuff at lannis stuff our old ceded calf raise out of the jim yeah in place the circus car still then still got a place to park his car which is hard to do I carry inside lateral yeah the flex by sept curl so I I I know all these guys on instagram that that have like you know jim zed are like five times as big in their houses right but they're definitely the the really rare exception like there's a guy yeah see side backs hack he painted it he he ordered new stickers holy shit is on it you know what I mean like he gets aftermarket stickers and puts them on yeah you know so yeah hammering climb like our hammering climb because we wound up getting a new one kind of for free so we we sold them the old one then he pissed is this this in-clinery here is this hammer that's a magnum oh okay I like that converging uh Magnum in-clin yes have a really good feel me being an equipment nerd there's a story about that press if you look at it it goes too deep for for big guys yeah so when you when you get into it it's like really hard to get into because it's sits too deep for big guys yeah so the guy learned it before it took a hockey puck on that side yeah and bolted it to the frame so the the arm comes down and it sits one hockey puck higher this is so Canadian not like a piece of wood it had to be a hockey puck yeah and so it's like it's going to hockey puck a hockey puck mod on it yeah and it makes it an awesome machine because now you can get into it you know you can squeeze and do it it sits a little higher yeah not a plant that shoulder press is awesome yeah that's the minor shoulder press right there yeah that looks good it was adjustable too yeah yeah but anyways just crazy Jim calls at the compound he's got a couple of signed bum stead photos up there on the wall yeah Chris gave him see can't Chris like handle over those or something yeah yeah well Chris trained with us like we trained with us dad you know yeah so you know that's pretty cool man yeah and then you know really like that smithre he's got a TV up there he's played he'll put like a J-cut their video on yeah and we'll train oh yeah you know blasts him he is it can put an old J-cut their video on it's not a trend there for a while we got it we got to hammer some sessions there because it's been a while so everything you could possibly need you know so since then that old leg press there he can get rid of that now because he bought a sidebecks leg press to match the hack oh yeah and I'm not sure if he has it painted and installed yet okay yeah I like that hack squat a lot like that's a nice that's a nice machine it's crazy that he went through all the work of like repouter coding and getting the stickers you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah pretty cool so but enough about him fuck but that's how you got it you got it my show talk about your guy you see him in person oh yeah I saw him and I knew it was him but like you know I'm fucking tied up with stuff of course you know you're just getting shit so I got all that's Scott's guy and I remember giving him like a nod and I was hoping to meet him but I you know I don't I don't think I actually met him oh no kidding yeah I don't think it's you were a busy guy you know here's a couple of shots so I'll give you an example I saw it like he looked great how did he wind up placing I don't even remember so he did true novice this is his first show and he won that out of 14 guys so he was pretty happy with that and then in his open class he said there was like there's like I don't know it was either eight or ten guys he was like there's just so many of him and he ended up getting third place there yeah meaning I know he won the overall yeah meaning he ended up taking out a bunch of people who probably had more experience than him obviously he's not the biggest guy yet you know he's he's a taller guy he was great yeah and we that's all we really could do was make sure we nailed the condition I just hope now that he's able to put on the muscle he needs to because if you can do that you know he'll obviously continue to be competitive you know yeah yeah I don't think I met him like I don't think I actually met him but the funny thing is is I saw a couple of pitches on Instagram that I don't remember taking yeah it was a blur so yeah that was very intense yeah here classic was really really competitive overall classic was fantastic yeah you know unlike half of course half the guys in classic could have just walked in the body but in classes and the body but in classes what a look fucking great sure yeah yeah but I don't know why people feel like they shouldn't do it I just don't get it oh his name's Matt Flynn by the way yeah Matt Flynn yeah yeah yeah Matt I remember I remember reading his name like you know what I mean yeah and I remember I'm waiting that that true knob is that was kind of a to me that was obvious just by walking around on the stage I didn't see fun with guys but I'm glad funny thing funny thing about this show was it was in a new venue so we moved it to a casino so we're in like a Delta hotel like it's all inclusive it's beautiful it's like okay you know like fantastic so we got a giant ballroom right yeah and we set up the lights and everyone looked great like if you look at pitches of the two-twelfth pros they're fucking peel they look awesome so we were really happy with how people looked but from the side stage where I am standing people don't look good oh no kidding it's just for my view you know what I mean like just from my view people were like you know okay but when you just walked around front it was like the transformed right so you know because your view as MC is always different like every show is different because the lighting is different and some of it's terrible for an MC but knowing cares that's not what they set light up for yeah so it's his funny but then like so you know it sort of made everyone look equally conditioned from like my brutal side angle right but then when I walked around it's kind of peeked around the front of the line at one point and he was hard as nails nice yeah yeah we definitely brought like I said man when that was our I knew we could do that and with him he was he really was eating a lot of food still like in the last week man we were just hammering and that was no dioretics we did manipulate water a little bit I think he was drinking like four leaders a day on average so I pushed him up to seven I believe it was maybe eight for a couple days and then we started tapering it back down and by the time we got to the show he was still drinking like four or five right awesome yeah no it was a great show we had a you know an open show all day Saturday and a natural show all day Sunday and remember last week when Scott said no one cares about natural shows yeah that was super funny how did it turn out fucking awesome yeah anything sold you know everything sold yeah so he'd show two twelve was fantastic romaine oh I don't want to say his last name wrong I was I didn't say rest moose man I gotta look at that this guy you just sent me yeah he's romaine remassity romaine remassance look at he looks really good oh no that's that's my client that that he looks really good yeah he won the the novice body building and stuff and those novice good for him yeah he won novice body building and got second in the heavy weights hell yeah he was conditioned as fuck his name's John thick on Instagram nice so check it out but yeah it was crazy crazy event I am see the whole thing everyone worked super hard everyone was on their feet for 14 hours a day three days in a row because Friday was like we literally arrived at the venue with everything unloaded everything like taped up the floors did everything like we all did that like hands on the team you know we had a team of volunteers and all of us working together and you know setting up the venue and setting up all the vendors came in and set up all their tables and boost you know just crazy assembly day of everything and then we all had to be done by new because that's when we were like gonna kick into registrations and all that stuff registered you know 300 people and in like almost 500 different classes and uh and got everything wrapped up on and we did it all on time it was crazy we registered the two 12 pros we had the five of clock meeting on time with the pros boom boom boom every one weighed in done deal and we wrapped it up and the show ran like clockwork like I was it it just went so well like the team just operated well and all the athletes listening it was just like like it was fantastic so we're just all of this like I'm just on cloud nine today like we just I feel like I just hit home runs all weekend you know so yeah it was good time I mean I'm sure somebody somewhere is unhappy but we just haven't heard about it yet you know like you got a message and happy yeah just fantastic stuff like Roman he message me after the show and he said that was the best experience of my life I've qualified to the Olympia pull this is unbelievable your show was awesome like he just had a great time you know what I mean that's so when you hear that when you hear that from like you know the athletes it's uh you know they should feel pretty good about stuff you know yeah just sharing a win we're sharing just sharing a win I like wins yeah you got to do that once in a while you know and just trying to thank the athletes and everyone who listens they got a ton of people come up to the other's new podcast and you know it's just like just like how we were at the UK dusty like this is another body building event and I was just completely like completely just getting hammered by people saying hey listen to show listen to the show you know and then um I had two people tell me you got to bring dust yet for it next year oh yeah although don't expect us to like tape the floors and stuff just no no no no no no no no no but maybe we can maybe it maybe I can get me to bring them up for a shoot and you just have to be here for the show I could pay someone to do my part in the taping no no you don't have to do any taping I'm pretty come on yes come up as it yes we're gonna make you look worthy I'm like I might make you go to Scott that I took it like way to the side we should do what we do alive alive podcast the night of yeah you're funny that'd be cool you know so yeah and it's funny and another thing too like the last couple times I MCed it I was like it was pretty exhausting like yeah and and I thought fuck I can't do that like forever I can't do a two-day show like all the time like I'm gonna have to find you know farm that off yeah and then so this year I was like well I guess I'll do it again because I never farmed it off to the last minute and find anyone else so it would be good to do it and and you know what by themselves and but then after this weekend it went so well that I'm like I don't want anyone else to do it yeah I job now like I didn't realize I was gonna be my job but that's my job now I thought that was my job to get things going you know like all MC it for you know first few years and but now I'm like no no I don't never want to not MC that show you know well super fun you know just a lot of fun and you know we had Tarekil Gindi up to head judge nice the Saturday show because we

he Olympia you know you want to make sure of these in order so that was cool he had a great time and love the venue and you know so well yeah so I look forward to the van city showdown again next year that's my little shout out to my own shit for this week that's cool I want to Jersey I want to Jersey shirt just so you know yeah those are cool you know there's there's certain things like you know you can only really fit so much into your thoughts right so we're having these team meetings and I hear someone say hey we should all get a Jersey matching jerseys like the the team should have matching jerseys you know the promotional team and I heard them all what kind of jersey but and and and and about that many words into the conversation my brain just went oh doesn't matter and I just stopped listening to anything about jerseys because I just I don't go to fuck just whatever you have me I'll put it on I'll go to fuck so I got other stuff to think about right like I do that you have to partition your like importance of stuff like oh they're talking about the brownies that someone's gonna bake yeah you can only make so many decisions yeah yeah I don't even care like what like you know I just opt to go so uh so they came up and had to be that shirt on Friday when we went to set up and I was like oh these are fucking cool and I got a triple XL and it's actually like a little big but I'm like all this is gonna be a great late day shirt yeah absolutely it's like old school long nice if you could put you could you could you could pull the ultimate meat head move you could put your fanny pack over the long baseball top well tell you hold it up properly I like that I saw Dorian do that that's how Dorian was wearing his fanny pack when I met him he had an over top of baseball jersey hell yeah hey that's the look does that you could bring that back I bring it back because I'm doing fuck what's doing over time I love the jersey though the jersey I immediately was like we need those from you and sure that's all I'm like I need one of those and I know a guy who make him Ron actually knows a guy he isn't the guy didn't know about the fucking brownies what if they're weed brownies what if you either too many of them nobody told you you're fucked you gotta listen to that shit well I'm probably not gonna eat the brownies on party so oh I would fuck sorry anyways what just we can scout yeah what's your weekend sky yeah yeah to client in my show but you also had a life outside of that hardly it would you know little work it's nothing nothing fancy spent the weekend with the wife we went to pick up a bunch of vegetables at the farmers market you know that kind of thing she purchased gourds for the front porch so you have like the the mums and the gourds and the pumpkins and you do like a little like a little thing little little fall spread you know so we've got that going on so she did that I went to the range that was that was it work that was a lot of like old school just down what do you mean you know home home depot maybe bad back and yeah I don't know full-time it was totally like that it was totally like that yeah as you were talking I was like porch it was very low key it was our assorts good right where you gonna shop gonna be or not you're gonna play a banjo got it love it it's good what about you dusty I'm always doing shit now I don't even know yeah the bottom motorcycle went for a very expensive steak dinner and drove somewhere close to the road yeah yeah yeah how was that it was a busy it was a busy couple days because I close on the house on Thursday went to Atlanta on Friday saw Rogan went to dinner at STK woke up the next morning went drove to a gastroids like two hours away from there and picked up a bike and then drove it home no kidding quick quick yeah but in fairness I had planned on buying the bike for like 30 or 40 minutes before I did it so that was cool why did you buy what's your bike I saw so I'll be honest with you dusty yes here's me as a as a brother who loves you being honest I saw the bike on the story was it's story or post yes both okay well something came through my feed and I saw like a video panning of a bike yes and I looked up and it said dusty handshaw oh eight and I went bullshit and I scrolled past it didn't even want to see it I was like I nope he didn't buy a bike nope that didn't happen I'm just gonna not read the there it is he really knows you're making it real he was more real what is happening live yeah so it's a nice train or something it's all black it's a it's a road glide but it's black is the only color I think the heart is should be available and I needed to be black as it matches the truck so that that was part of that those were the keys you know I mean but I haven't I hadn't ridden in about six years I had a bike my first car was a bike so it's been a little bit I got on the frame for a minute it took about 10 minutes for me to feel like super comfortable again I was like damn it's been a minute but yeah I didn't kill myself in the first 10 minutes so we're uh we're in business and now it's the only thing in my new house currently nice good habits okay so okay so I have a feeling I know the answer but I'm gonna ask you this question is does that bike have do you have the intention of actually taking that bike on the road like packing up those like packing it up and going somewhere on it like is that or is that for Sunday rides yeah I know I cruise around like I'll go like an hour and a half two hours I'm like trying to if I go in long distance there will I'll be inside of my truck it'll be on a trailer hardly people are crying right now hearing that I don't give a fuck it's like it's like it's like camping like I'm gonna go camping it's gonna be like at the W oh try right right yeah we go in camping yeah but it does have a radio which is cool and you know see you and set up and play off your Spotify which is important for Ron yeah we're all set it's basically a two-wheeled couch oh and I did I've been buying furniture today by the way oh my life I think I'll buy a couch today I put new flooring in the upstairs the house today where I paid for it it was an expensive fucking day yeah good good carpet in my house I don't like carpet so first thing I had to call somebody they're removing on Friday putting it on the flooring so we're in business that I can move in but yeah it's been an expensive morning I don't know you know those love sack couches not the fucking bean bag the actual couch you can buy like sections and make them as big as you want and yeah you want yeah awesome but what I'm gonna talk about because it hurt my soul a little bit the total came up and I'm like hmm all right about a second motorcycle cool fuck damn but but the reason it's cool is because if anything happens say you happen to have two Yorkies or children who might fuck it up you can actually take the cover off and replace the cover if you want so like your couch isn't like fucked if someone stands in yeah or if you're a 40 year old two year old that approach for all yourself and what did you call that couch lovesack as they see love they're awesome fact you you create your own sectional or whatever you want you have to get one on it's amazing really why are you okay it's a fact of self is we need a new coach look at me something that fuckers better sponsor me so here's like for the average time you're even saying the same dusty 20 yet love sign exactly this is the time yeah you know we we actually went to buy the couch we have we just went to buy the new model because it's perfect and like all this not making it we don't have anymore yeah we're like oh fuck so now I'm gonna check this out imagine if you could build the couch of your dreams and you can who knew it'll cost your soul whatever yeah oh yeah they're classy looking too get the modern look to them absolutely yeah so right now that's they have a motorcycle in my house and nothing else so that's interesting my neighbors but I think I'm not I've been there twice just to pick it up and leave come back so yeah anyways that's the life what do we got for questions Scott it's going on well I had one question in particular that I I pulled to the front actually I got this message on DM and I said do me a favor and send that to me on the show like post it on the latest episode that way I'll remember because guys if you DM me questions for any of the shows it's like you send that to me on Tuesday we record next Monday we've recorded five other shows since then I there's no chance unless you're from Patreon then I will do my best but what did this one go even just get lost the one yeah I did it was like the question maybe it was at the end here um oh here it is yes I would go from Randy he says hi guys awesome show DM Scott a suggestion for a topic and was redirected here the topic is Jim etiquette and the evolution of what it is now mirror etiquette also with all the new plate loaded machines while you're doing it working set people returning their plates to the machine because they double as weight storage in the middle of a heavy set and feel the machine is shaking a bit from somebody returning plates am I an asshole for being pissed about that again I appreciate the hard work that everyone puts into the shows thanks for having just you Scott rock run like a show up but yeah good job Scott thank you I can't comment Randy on whether or not you're an asshole or not because I'm certainly am and that shit drives me fucking back shit like anything that's on my machine is mine during my set when the bar is moving you cannot put anything on my machine you get touch my machine you might as well fucking touch the bar I'm using go bang and around on that shit what I see just during your set while you're pushing out and you see it and they hit the machine I just ever so subtle what the fuck are you doing during tens to get people's attention and they're probably never happening with that person because their machine also has weight tree capabilities why are you on mine why fuck is wrong with you it reminds me of parking okay same deal I've parking a lot I'm way in the back away from everyone why is there always an 86 accord park to me when I fucking walk out to the car again a matter where I parked that was my whole zone back there my machine my parking spot is it the same node is a bottom in the same yes for people Randy I like you whoever you are I don't remember the first part of the question but you don't touch my fucking and Jim etiquette the mirrors has it changed that was as it changed over the years that's what he was as Ron would know if it's changed I've hated people my entire life go ahead well I don't know I don't know if it's changed there's always been people that left their weights out there's always been people that you know fucking didn't wipe their bench off there's always been people that you know carried their big fucking floppy open Jim bag around fucking through it on the floor like a mattress you know there's always people like mattress you know like to bring in their fucking mattress around them like that's my entire you know it's eight foot square space you know you know it just in considerate people are not a new thing and then also too it's not in still in always in considerate blissfully unaware people who just have for some reason never learned like spatial respect and like I don't know respect for like work happening it's just a concept in the brain right like I don't know where I you know I guess my dad it was always like any time anything was an operation I grew up on a farm so anytime anything was operating it was like stand back yeah right and I was stand back or you'll get your fucking arm ripped off oh yeah well because that little kids had reached into shit and the fucking boom their arms gone and it happened on farms and these to show us videos like education videos when we were in like when I was a little kid in school that showed us like videos of like amputee kids in missing arms back this is you know this is you know Teddy he reached into an auger and lost his arm don't be like Teddy like I remember seeing like videos like that dang I never saw those videos and I know you didn't either dusty right I would have never seen a video of Teddy losing his arm that would really driven a driven home better we got a little more hit to yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're just you're just learning just learn how and then it it crosses over is all I'm saying I don't know they're not learning as young as young people and then there's there's nothing to cross over to like adult life so I don't need like you know some people like they must have the mirror like yeah I'm not obsessive about the mirror like because I'm doing like I'm not like a lot of raising I know what the fucking doing it's fine and it whatever but I do have to admit one time I was doing I can't remember I think I was gonna shoulder press dumbbells and a girl came in front of me and proceeded to take her hair down and then turn and make sure she had it back up while using the mirror directly in front of me and then turned around to see it and then she looked at me and I'm like I should oh my god it was like she forgot she wasn't in the change room right then in there at least she didn't that's the blissfully unaware that you were saying wrong like as it was happening because like I said I'm not really a huge mirror person I was kind of laughing I'm like this can happen right now isn't it and sure as fuck I watched her like style her whole hair up and get already but I was at least a little warm in the heart when she realized she was a fucking idiot I was like that I girl that's like I don't know your it out that's funny yeah yeah you shouldn't you shouldn't play somebody's machine so here's another thing here's a sidebar I have done it to someone yeah I I remember there was a girl doing hip thrust on the smith and she was like using like hardly any weight like five pounds aside and she was doing like ten second wraps like it was some sort of like super slow no untraining thing and I just quietly put some plates on the machine non-trading thing but this is my new phrase like I don't know he's doing some new non-training thing but but I remember I put my plates like quietly on the smith and on the on the rack you know what I mean and I remember thinking like I'm not even vibrating the machine I'm doing a really nice job of this like I was conscious of the fact that I was breaking a a rule but I was like being so good about it that I was like hey I get away with this you know I remember doing that it's so funny that he asked that question because that's the first thing I thought I was I did that to that I did that the other day she didn't notice her anything and like didn't say anything but just in my head it was a thing yeah you know it was a thing does he's like you did break a rule I do it all the time though I will say that during like a rant of something that irritates me and I'm like and I fucking done this but you shouldn't fucking do this I'm like I'm a hypocrite but anyways back to the reason I'm right about this moment terrible this is I have something kind of related kind of and I think about it because I went off my poor client Patrick his name is actually Patrick Moore he's different Patrick Moore not the black guy he's the white Patrick Moore he's done a great job though and he needs to bring his name strings up yeah he needs to bring his hamstrings up like most white guys and I asked him to shoot me some video and he shot me some video and I looked at it and I sent him a voice memo back and what I felt he needed to do was be more intense with it and it looked like he was training in a crunch fitness and I went off on this whole tangent in this voice mail poor guy had to listen to for like five minutes of me saying that I think that one of the problems we have you know we can't all train at at gyms like west coast iron you know it's just not every city has one of those and if you do train in a place like that you're among like minded people who are all trying to more or less do the same thing which is growing incredible amount of muscle and that's not going to be you know that the non-training stuff you were mentioning around like you have to you have to train hard you have to take this to failure it's going to be uncomfortable and I think that in a place like crunch fitness people who train really hard are kind of looked at differently because it's it's they're going for mediocrity and I think that's striving for it yeah it's it's a lot harder to excel in a place like that because after a while I've trained in a place like that before that you do start drifting into that you know I'm just doing my workout like everybody else it's very hard than everybody here yeah exactly and that's not saying much but I went off on this whole tangent about it and I just remember the end of my tangent was like and if you're going to grow your hamstrings you need to take it was like you need to go to hell click that was like the end of my voice my one was like damn Scott that was pretty intense but but that's the truth though I mean as I feel like you know a lot of times it's it's frowned upon to try too hard in a gym like that so I guess it's almost a reminder that you know what maybe we aren't meant to fit in in places like that and there is some level of etiquette to that like everybody wants to be really polite and quiet and I don't know yeah it's well you know a rising tide you know raises all ships right so when you're in an environment where everybody's on their way up sometimes you get dragged along with them like that's you know everyone's doing their cardio fuck it's easier to do your cardio it is yeah everyone's fucking trained in hard around you the guys next year going hard like it is like that that stuff has helped me through like a lot of workouts being in the right gym has made an enormous difference like I've trained at health clubs I had a world health membership so that I could just get out of like you know I had to pay that hardcore gym in M&10 for 13 years you know it was a powerhouse at the end there but you know I trained there for almost 14 years and you know I always had a health club membership you know go to World Health once in a while and you know we check out some chicks on the treadmill you know how goes you know go do arms at midnight you know you have a really you maybe you have one of those days where you're just fucking bagged and you just fucking can't like you just can't and then at like 11 p.m. you're like fuck I can finally go train arms now like I finally feel okay like yeah that days like that and maybe go to World Health and bang out in arm workout you know so like but if I tried to train in those gyms for long period of time it it would like it mean it's hard it's like I mean like you're you're what trying to go like this against like you know the gym is like all underneath you like you know you're pulling them all up right dusty like that I didn't really understand the double jerk off I mean I was like well I don't that's this medium that's just me there was also like two hands way more than needed um anyway wow you know if you're in it if you're in a pinch you can use a pillow but I'm like I'm so following the whole city is like you're working off of it I just always happen to get more your turn is that's I don't think I was following it very well there I knew where dusty wet because I looked at his face it just had just like what I mean like you're you're what trying to go like this against like you know the gym is like all underneath you like you know you're pulling them all up I saw that it's like a dog dog so the dog and then I knew exactly what happened on my call does he's laughing at my hand movement and then you know I've do this to all the other members of like what's the one that yeah yeah yeah yeah we're helping him up justice yeah helping him up you're bringing them all up your level okay this good point though yes guys is you do not have to jerk off people here why why you do they're gonna come to your level hey they'll train harder if you jerk them off to the train hard that's hard or that's just awkward to see everybody train harder oh this is the episode that ends the fucking show here we go more technically I have been jerked off by members of gyms that I've trained at I mean we all have god um anyways the next question all right actually the next question is a comment from bass and bodybuilding he said dusty's overrated underrated game is iron point oh yeah we're gonna play that again we had a lot of comments about that people liked it that's beautiful I have some more saves so we can nice we should definitely do that all right yeah she could round a lot of comments here another comment from Neil he says guys be careful when you eat steak if you use dusty 20 yes you should be more focused on your steak at that point just about I had a giant steak before the show by the way but anyways you eat a lot of steak still dusty your steak consumption is actually is it higher? oh for sure and I'm a addicted at Tomahawk's now hmm five minute curl yeah amazing amazing show is always last five minute crew and dusty's new segment is fucking awesome see again question for the next show I have some neck pain going on waiting to get in for a cat scan been going on for a while but what's thoughts on taking a muscle relaxer I stay away from NSAIDs and stuff but fuck is it stiff? it'd be hard to say well I don't know man I mean I mean it just depends I've had some like really bad neck issues in the last like five years where I've heard so bad it was so tight and it was all related to my neck muscles in the front and my upper packs and you know in my shoulders and stuff and you know once I started having like because I all admit I quit getting worked them for a long time because I was like wow I'm just I'm not bodybuilding anymore and you know blah blah and then the neck just like I just you know couldn't get it to fucking really really go away you know kind of plagued me off and on and it's been a lot better now that I've been getting more worked on I started getting worked on it and made a huge difference and I know that that's like such a yeah get worked on it yeah this guy's probably tried that but you know I don't know just having somebody directly going to the front of my neck and then in my packs was a game changer and it's fucking painful when they've worked them on yeah I agree yeah that like front of the neck thing or they pull it to the side oh god yeah and then in my shoulder blades a bit too there's some some funky stuff going on in there so all right you guys want to jump to the next one because I don't think we really have a ton for him on that one no no all right he says uh hey guys listening every week from the UK absolutely love the show and the knowledge you guys share so if I have a question I have been pushing the food up for four weeks the first two weeks not an issue at all it went down a bit too easy but after that I have been feeling really bloated and uncomfortable and holding a bit of water retention my cycle is 500 milligrams premo 500 NPP and 600 test E 60 T ball daily and I'm running 1 milligram of a remadex daily as well any advice on this would be appreciated and keep up the good work well first lower your remadex dose yeah yeah so there's a lot there I mean obviously don't know what the guy looks like or what his history is but if we're just talking about like that snapshot and I'd take my best guess I mean not like I'm gonna tell people you know how much to fucking use and shit but I would drop the NPP completely because it's possible that he's having like an angelone issues if he's super bloated just just drop it just you don't still need it may even just both in fact drop everything but the test and maybe just want to remadex a week and just train this see what happens you might look way better like and feel way better I mean who knows I think what you know I don't know I'm just spit it on yeah but when you factor in the timeline what you're saying makes perfect sense of course you notice first two weeks no those drugs and hit yet yeah yeah there's really built up in the system they're active and stuff and they're you know triggering signals and all that but they're not like you know populated or receptors fully yet so you're shot in with a ton and that's the I mean I'm assuming you've never done the cycle based on the response so it like runs it it's hard to nail what's causing the issue so I agree I would definitely like I said my knee jerk was the one I remember that every day is a ton I don't think we've realized how much that is I mean I would do a half of one twice a week maximum one twice a week and you should be fine but yeah considering the only the only drug he's on that converts to estrogen is the test and he's only on 600 yeah yeah that's just a lot I don't think people realize how a expensive really remember that's it's in B how hard it is in the body everyone's so afraid of the drugs they take and don't realize what taking AI is can do what they're the high double so pull those back and then I do the same thing runs it you know take everything back start with a pre-mo be the first thing I put back in the other questions you know test only then add the pre-mo back and see where you're at you know and same thing with the T ball I mean that could be affecting your appetite not necessarily a lot of attention but that could be affecting the appetite for sure so the next move with that is if you put that back in take it before bed instead of first thing in the morning or whatever you're using it because a lot of people have appetite issues that's a good way to sneak past that as you take to sleep um it's about it I haven't tried that before with the world yeah before yeah just take the whole dose before bed if you have it yeah I mean some people still have appetite issues after that but it can be it can be the one step that works you know the last last thing you can do I think I wonder like is his a Rimmidex real you know like is his is his research stuff you know that's actually like is any of the milligrams yeah yeah that is the question real Scott oh yeah no oh okay oh about this one matrix jerry weans says question for the next show who is the most underrated body builder you've ever seen in person I got one to start us out Dave plumbo everybody looks at David David they're like oh yeah polomboism and all of that and intoward the end of his career he didn't have the most pleasing physique you know we never we never look our best all the way through but Dave was a freaking monster and he looked pretty good for a period of time so Dave was the first and original 300 yeah and shredded super freak and and people don't ever connect that anymore they think they think of polomboism or they think of what he looks like now like but Dave was a legit recovery first guy to be 300 pounds that lean like I don't know that's why I mean you said during height there's probably someone you know but I'm just thinking of like body builders Dave's height what is he five ten something like that yeah five nine five yeah how many guys were I mean what was that mid 90s yeah 95 he was like 300 pounds was like fucking veins on his glutes and shit yeah you know I mean obviously Dorian and Nasser were on the scene the biggest pros but I mean Dave was just as heavy as those guys and fucking just never turned pro you know like he did look good for a long time at that size he was huge I remember when I first met polombo was at the I mean what booth would it have been in like 2002 what booth would that have been without a been the MD that yeah with that yeah yeah without a been supplement company booth made enough species yet no but he was with someone and yeah it was it's funny that's a good place with like met metrics like he was because he kept when he posted his diet back in the day he always said metrics packets were like with a meal that was like yeah half his diet were metrics packages and yeah yeah yeah I remember I remember I was emailing with them a bit because of the boards you know we knew each other off muscle mayhem yeah and and and I was like talking about maybe having and prepping right so I went and met him at the booth and I remember I was just like holy fuck he was huge and ripped yeah like solely fucking shredded dry like like nothing on him like fucking stage ready peeled and huge and he was sitting there eating McDonald's french fries that sounds like Dave and I was like hey how's it going and he goes good let's get out of here let's go eat and he had fries already and I go oh so he he had a McDonald's french fries and we walked and I ordered like a burger and fries whatever the fuck I ordered and he ordered another burger just burger and we sat and he ate like just another burger because he was still hungry and drank another drink I think and we sat and talked prep for like 45 minutes you know so cool and then I was like oh good to me man and then like we never wound up working together but that's when I met him but I just remember I was like fuck this guy's fucking crazy looking in person like he was one of the freakiest things at the whole expo that's what I'm saying that was my first Olympia that was my first Olympia expo and I remember thinking like Dave Plobbo and I remember he had on like like cut off jean shorts it's amazing he rocked the juts because he was at the booth right so he looked like he had on like jean shorts and then he had on a plaid lumberjack shirt with a stomp yes that's the year right there oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't I don't know if I would count this as underrated but someone who I just what stunned by in person that I never felt got the true love was Tony Freeman yeah Tony Freeman was massive I will never forget you so one of my first trips the Arnold you you come down the escalators you know Scott and then to the right is where you go into the expo and I'm walking behind these guys and they were in like the the stringer shirts and they were all puffed up walking in of course scales at two two oh three and five eleven and I'll never forget because they turned the corner into the door ways and Tony Freeman was standing there just his back facing us and it's washing to flage not like you are not in small town USA anymore technically you are but the fridge came here yeah I mean his his delts look like planets I mean he was inches wide that I ever was my entire career and also how tall was he run six three four no no no he's he's six two that's Freeman's big I some of these guys everyone thinks they're taller just because they're so huge but he's only a little taller than me yeah but he was just absolutely massive and the thing I remember the most was that six two his quads jumped at me more than anything no kidding they they just swept off of his hips and I think if you if he was competing now everyone would be talking about him but in that era there were just too many super freaks I asked Tony Freeman how big his quads were once he was standing at the boot and he had like soccer shorts on and his legs were just fucking humongous and I go hey Tony have you ever put a tape around those fucking things and he goes yeah actually I taped them like he said it was like three weeks out from the Olympia and they were 34 day and that's like in shape like what they you know what I mean he said yeah they were like I think it was like you'll blow a week so to the Olympia I don't remember how many weeks it was but I remember he said there are 34 so the kicker and 70 inches to like a 28 inch waste you know that's yeah well he was so put it this way Tony Freeman had a remarkably good career he one shows he went to multiple Olympias and he placed top three in a lot of shows like I don't pull up his career but so he had a great career like he was a legit pro right and he did it all with a pectare yeah which ruins people and he still did all of that that's how good he is was you know crazy he was bodybuilding but that goes to show what his physique had because you know pectares destroy people's careers like it is fucking over for most of them right yep like pros you know lots of amateurs have a great career competing with the injuries and stuff but that's what keeps him back from being pros right but at the pro level like that that particular injury the pro level is really really devastating and Tony just fucking kept going and like one one to show one a couple shows I think and one to the Olympia multiple times and do you gotta give a guy like that credit that's a good one dusty yeah who's all mine is Tom Prince hmm oh god yes yeah because Tom Prince reason is outside leg of the planet Tom Prince Tom Prince wasn't wasn't in the game that long him and Mike Fran so I were both kind of short lived careers right and Mike Fran so I was very short but Tom you know I mean I mean what did Tom term pro in 97 and when the 97 Nationals in term pro and look done fucking believable and and also the year before that 96 been Craig Titus beat him he was unbelievably good but Titus just fucking beat him somehow and but yeah Tom Prince was great and then he got third at the night of champions one time and you know we went to the Olympia make one time he went to the Olympia I can't remember and and then that was you know kind of the end of the careers 2003 night of champions I think you he went to the Olympia but yeah that's that's the guy man I I knew him I met up with him in Vegas and we went and ate and I knew him through a mutual friend because he coached my friend and we chatted on the bones like he was on mayhem all the time and we were like band-tree back and forth so I went Nate with him and he told me all about like what he did for cycles and what he did for food and it was all just the most like basic like you know just basic basic basic basic basic okay and he just told me everything and he didn't mention like the new bane or any of the problems that had probably arisen by that point yeah you know which I heard stories about afterwards but but yeah he was a real nice guy and any paid for my lunch okay my lunch for me yeah it was just helping to kid out you know that's cool and um and then we went and he's like oh let's go down there and I think I think you know all the other guys are down there and maybe we can meet some more pros yeah walking down there and then I met Vince Comerford and Tracer Colato and like some of those guys yeah yeah it was funny and Tony Pearson I met Tony Pearson that day and um yeah it was funny and then like Tom took off you know and then I went and did my thing I don't know with my friends but yeah he was cool guy and uh fucking freak so wide you know like massive massive frame so he was very underrated body builder it seemed like it came pretty easy for him like he didn't have a single Tom Prince was interesting because there wasn't a single thing about his training diet or drugs that you wouldn't see printed in like a flex magazine okay baby four sets of 10 yeah four sets of 10 four sets of 10 and then another exercise for four sets of 10 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like it was a shot drop set you're done yeah we trained hard you know moved a lot of weights well we should wrap this one if we're gonna do two segments really that flew by yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we're gonna start that we're like mumbling about bulls shit I got it we I have to do this all every week I know what the okay is what about the hand job is that staying in there it's yeah it'll be like yeah yeah yeah yeah no you only need both hands if you're jerking off the whole jam dusty yeah that was a second that was a second that got it my bad no no no there's stack there's no two dicks there's only one day oh shit okay okay see you later guys remember like share subscribe comment ring the bell and use codes big wrong 20 yes dusty 20 on iamoon.com yeah so the codes work both in the states and in Canada so Canadians can even use your code not that they would not know why they would cool there's a lot of Americans who already don't like you and they will happily use my code that's a very valid point actually but you still win because let's say I take half of the Americans yes or and and and all of the Canadians you probably have all the Americans with guns I definitely do like all of your Americans have guns would be a lot of my Americans might not have guns so all of so wrong gets the Democrat Americans well because they would go Canadian right they would be more like sure Canadian government wise they don't know you know there would yeah there
