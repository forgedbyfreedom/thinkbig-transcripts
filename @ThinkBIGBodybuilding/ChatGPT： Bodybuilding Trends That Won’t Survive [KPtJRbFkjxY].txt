So I asked for a current list of bodybuilding trends that are hot now, but may not stand the test of time. Oh, huh. And it gave me an answer. And it said, it said, this is a list of things that are currently hot, but may fizzle out like many other trends have. I love how it talks. And it said, and the number one thing is optimal obsession. Huh. Wow. And it said, it said, chasing perfection with biomechanics, the length of the rep resistance profiles, altering machines, machine only training, strange exercises that isolate single muscles out of complex muscle groups. Yeah. All are already showing signs of fading. And it says, why they might fade. And it says, all of this is based on theory, not enough brute force. Many forget that progressive overload is still driven by maximum mental effort and high physical drive. Over analysis will lose steam once people hit platos despite being optimal. Hey, everybody. Welcome to It's Just Bodybuilding. I'm Big Brown part, little of course, I'm here with Dusty Handsha and the producer Scott McNally. Remember, like, share, subscribe, comment, and bring the bell.

I'm you.com, get your all in, get your ISO surge and everyone should get on the gear. So get your so some gear. What's your favorite flavor, gear, Dusty? The, I like the, the bomb pop one. I don't know what they rock it pop. The rock it pop. Rock it pop. Don't say that on a play. I don't name. Yes, I remind of, you know, the listeners want to understand us, but they're used to be a a truck that drove around called an ice cream truck. Oh, yeah. Right. Right. Right. Long. You get your, you get your rocket pop off there. Oh, way more expensive than out of your freezer, but I swear they taste better, just like shitty coffee from Starbucks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Hot word. You're on the roller blade. You're playing hockey in the street. Oh, wait. It's time for a break. Yeah. I was at this thing back in the day we used to pay with called cash, but anyone's no. Oh, yeah. Weird. Weird. But yeah, that's that. Um, yeah, you need the rock. Rock it pop. Do you like that? What do you like? Rock it pops. Good. I tend to go with like the fruit punchy flavors. I'm kind of like that. And then of course, I like iced tea. I like the iced tea. I'm a very big fan of iced tea. You know what I mean? So I tend to do that type of stuff. I've, I've boiled blue raspberry. I know that's like super popular flavor that everyone makes because it's like super popular. It's like a biggest seller. Like most brands will tell you that that's the number one seller, but I just, I'm not a big fan. Dusty has issues with it. Dusty's like some of the issues with it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, because it's, it's the most acidic option. So most acidic flavor. Yeah. Technically. Technically. They more. Yeah. And then on the, on the BCAs for those who are smart enough to still use those andtra are great. I've sold out on the rest. I don't even get the other ones. I'm a great guy. I'll I see what you're on my flavor with it with that. Well, that's the peach. I can already see the sour peach or the, the my. Yeah. It was FK. Yeah. It was good. You know what? So I only ever had like a couple samples of this stuff. And I loved it. And I actually tried to order some of the mutants. I and I was like, oh, I'm so excited. I'm going to get it. And then like a week later, I got my money returned to me. And they were like, oh, we're sorry. We're on a bad flavor. So I never really tried it. And then I got some at the Arnold that I've been using it basically nonstop. Since like I have, there's not been a day that's gone by. I've done like I could probably like if there was like a chart on how much work I've done, it's probably gone up like 20% across the board since the beginning of March. You know what I mean? Yeah. It turns out there is a little more than just training for that. Yeah. It's not available in Canada, but they're allowed to make it here and wear house it here and ship it out of the country. Yeah. What's there not allowed to sell it? That's how you know it's good, though. That's how you know it's good. Yeah, it's good. The Canadian government has a stack of paperwork that they just haven't gotten to. We'll get to it later. Oh, around it. Maybe they're going to somehow blame Trump. Yeah. It's legal. But I go down to the warehouse to visit George and I steal it. Yeah. So I need to let no sale. Legal. Yeah. And it's not there fault that I, but I'm just a thief. So I go in the back to the warehouse and say, oh, the guys, I'll ship and go in and then I steal it. So I manage to get my hands on it without muting. Can you do anything to do it with the transaction? I want to know one thing from each of us that we think is holding people back from me in the best body. Oh, right. Yes. Everyone genetics. What number number number two gear? Genics. Mark. Genetics. It's not the gear. Money all the gear. Drops. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay. Finer. Okay. I think one thing that is holding people back is they're crowding their brain with too much noise. They're trying to build a house by starting with the door knobs. Yeah. That's something. And like you, you have to lay a foundation to build a house. You have to have a frame to build a car. You have to, you know what I mean? And so I see people skipping that step to kind of copy what they see on Instagram. Like they'll see a 250 pound body builder who's got a bad shoulder talking about an advanced move that he's doing. And it's like first that kids got to learn how to press 100 pound dumbbells over his head. Yeah. And the value of that is massive. And also I had a very high level judge. Say to me this weekend. He goes, you know what I notice? None of these young guys have big forearms. Huh. And I went, oh, and he goes, yeah, they're not lifting weights. Huh. Not normal lifting weights. They have small forearms. And I thought that was funny. And that's just kind of like a symptom of not laying the foundation to the house. And you think if he doesn't have big forearms, what else on him isn't getting hit from all the fancy shit they're doing. And I'm not begging on the fancy shit. I do some fancy shit because I'm kind of busted up. I do wrist cuff cable side laterals laying back because they actually feel great the way we do them. But I didn't do them for the first 15 years of training 20 years of trained. And I have like elbow issues and a bit a little bit of chronic tennis elbow. So holding dumbbells sometimes bothers me when I do side laterals. And I mean, I used to do side laterals with like the 65 pound dumbbells, which doesn't happen anymore. But so I'm just saying like, you got to move some iron. And I'm not trying to sound old school or anything like that. But it is just the fact, without a putting a bar on your back, there's a lot of shit down through your core and through your back and into your hips and down through right to the floor. And I wasn't getting hit the way some of these guys are training. And so when a really high level judge who's a pro judge says to you that he thinks the new crop of young guys he seems at great physique, but they have small forums. And some of them are even training their forums. So that tells you that that's not enough. That's not the same as what we were doing. And I'm in grip and rip and like grabbing, I remember you'll grab in 120s and kick them up and row in and try not to use my straps until the last heavy sat and stuff like that. So yeah, that's I think people are just doing, they're thinking about the door knobs instead of the concrete floor. And build yourself a floor. I hate to fucking rant on this stuff. But I benched three plates and grade 12 and I scored a four plates and grade 12 drug free and I'm not genetically gifted. I'm too tall to be a bodybuilder. My arms are too long. You know, I wasn't a phenom. I had people thought I was good because I was the only bodybuilder in town. But like, get real here. A small town. Right. The only young bodybuilder. I mean, but you're good. Yeah. That was a good. I would argue you have genetic. I think that that doesn't take away from your point. I didn't have like, I didn't have like instant genetics. No, like, yeah. There was a lot of like really, really, really hard training. And I still had body parts that were really lacking that took a long time to come up and nothing came easy. And you know what I mean? So there's a lot of stuff you have to do to really get that foundation and it's important. So I'm not saying that a lot of the new school stuff isn't cool. It's great. I use some of it. And like, I love a lot of the stuff that we're doing now to make things more efficient, but you should be able to do a lot of the stuff that you're not doing. So that's my thing. We're about where are you Scott? I'll say self limiting beliefs. Now that I had a couple of minutes to think, I had longer than Ron. So I got to have the answer. Yeah, I'm not saying. It's self limiting beliefs. And I'll use myself as an example that I didn't feel like I was strong on as a chest presser. I just wasn't a strong presser. And I lived like the majority of my bodybuilding like that. And it wasn't until I was hit my early 40s. So I decided I'm like, you know what? No matter, like this might be my last chance to actually get legit strong as a chest presser. And I had to find some humility to literally strip back my technique and relearn how to chest press. And through that process, I became legit strong. And that's like the other half of it is get freaking strong. That is strong. Because that's what I said. It was like, you know what? I want to try to gain as much muscle as I can. And I've done everything I possibly could. But I've never been the one thing I haven't been is the strongest guy in the room. I've been strong. And I'm definitely like have grit and I'll keep up with you. But I hadn't been the strongest guy in the room. And I said, I need to become that guy in order to grow. And that's what I did. And I literally made the best progress in my freaking life in my 40s. Like on low gear, it's not like in the past, I'd been hitting all sorts of hard stuff. And at this point, I was like 500, 600 tests. I was eating like five meals a day and not even paying attention to it. I was like, take a tortilla, put some taco meat, you know, put some ground turkey and it rolled it up. You need it. That was meal. That was a meal. You know, I got like 40 grams of protein, 30 grams of carbs. And I'm like, oh, do that again in a couple hours. Like that wasn't literally my diet. And I got to the strongest at every bin. And I made better progress in my growth than I ever had. It's like, so don't have those self-limiting beliefs that, you know, we kind of put ourselves in a box, you know, that I can't do this or I'm not that, you know, what do you have to do to become that? That's kind of what bodybuilding is about is, you know, we have all of these obstacles, all these things that hold us back. And then we have to get creative to figure out, like, well, okay, how do I do it anyway, you know? Right. I always thought, yeah, I was one of my favorite things that Dante did was, obviously, anybody who knows him well knows he's very, very, very, very intelligent. But then he breaks things down to such a simple thing that it always clicked to me. Because like he told me when we first started, he said, my thought process is simple. If you can incline press 315 for 10 now, when you can do 405 for 10, you'll be bigger. Yeah. And I'm like, a lock thing. Hi. Yeah. You know, so it's like when you start breaking it down that simply, it's like, I don't think anyone would argue. And even some of it goes, well, some people are strong. Okay. Well, when he goes up a plate, he will be bigger. I mean, obviously, we're keeping in that everything else is in there. My thing is something I experienced with clients and people in general, which is consistency, but not in the lane way that everyone's so used to hearing consistency when life isn't cooperating. That's the thing I have a lot with people. I had a really good client that's moving. And he's like, look, I got to move. And so with that, I'm going to take a break on the coaching because I got to do this and this. And I said, okay, cool. I have to ask something. Are you going to go to the gym? Yeah. Are you planning on eating during the moving process? Yeah. Okay. I don't see why this would stop. Like if it's money, completely understand, but then keep doing what we were doing without me. Right. But that's the area where people mess up. It's like, I think that individuals think that like Jay Cutler was able to be so perfect because life never threw them a curveball. He never missed a flight. He never had any issues, life was just easy. It's like what separates the people that get to their maximum potential and those who don't is when they can succeed during adversity. And I think people don't realize that adversity is a privilege. It is absolutely something there to make you better. So yeah, when you look back, you start looking at your consistency. If when you're having problems with work or this or that, you're missing meals or you're not going to the gym or you're not getting sleep, that's on you. It doesn't take any talent. I drive it home all the time. Like you have to eat no matter what. If you've got a big job that has a lot of expectations, I think you should understand that if you die tomorrow before you're in the ground, your job will have you replaced. So don't put them before what you're doing. You can stop for 10 minutes and eat a meal. You can be prepared so that when you're busy, you've got stuff. I used to always leave my house and if I was going somewhere, this was my wife or whatever, how long are we going to be gone? She's say three hours. I'd go, okay, I'm going to bring two meals in case we're gone five hours. Yep. Yes, just ready all the time. And I can say that in my peak, I literally never missed a meal, never missed anything because it wasn't an option. And I think that's the area where people mess up. It's easy to be consistent whenever things rolling, but ask yourself, does that consistency waiver when things aren't good? And that right there could be enough to end your your ability to hit the top level because if you're successful in life, there's a diversity weekly. Yeah, there's a birthday party weekly. There's a trip weekly. There's something in your way and you decide what you do with that. So 100 pretty simple. I think one thing to add to that particular point is that you should always expect an hour delay with like as a body builder never expect everything to run to the minute and be perfect. You know what I mean? Like I think a lot of body builders want people. They just think like, you know, oh, it takes 11 minutes to get there. So I'll leave 11 minutes before I have to be there. And it's just a bad habit that that that that they get into and they're always stressed and they're always under the gun and they're always like, I'll eat after this and you have to give yourself that cushion because you're trying to accomplish a goal where you need to do these things. So you know, if it takes 11 minutes to be there, you should be leaving 22 minutes before you have to be there or whatever. Like, you know what I mean? You should always be prepared for something to happen. And that's where you would take two meals instead of one. You always have a shake in your car. Always they're just you have to you have to cover these things. It's very important. I used to when I had the scores because we was always based on customers. So you didn't really know him. I mean, you have a burst and be busy. So rather than have meals, I brought five meals with me all in one. I called it a trough just like a serving thing. And I just make sure where I left at the end of the day. It was empty because I didn't. I used to do that too. But I didn't want to be there. So you just you just leave it sitting in the back cold. And all right, I got time for six bites. Oh, customer walk forward. But I just always said as long as this is gone, I got the five meals down between getting here at 10 and leaving at eight. We're fine. Yeah, I used to do that the bar too. You know what I mean? I put my nights worth of food in a container. Yeah, and sometimes I'd have like 10 bites over the course of the whole night. And then I'd eat the rest of the trough, I was counting my money. Yeah. But it would all go down. You know, you're not leaving until it's gone. That's the rule. Yeah. Yeah. Make sure I always go home with an empty dish because they still to meal the eat when I got home. You know, there's a gem that actually the other day I was walking out and he had a bowl. And it was full. And I looked at him. I'm like, that's proper trough right there. And he just smiled. He knew exactly what I meant. I'm like, I see what you're doing. He's a knack, or can clown down. I'm like, there you go. That's how you eat right there. Yeah. I love it. So I got another one that was asked on my question box today. I thought this was good. They say stereotypes exist for a reason. What are some of the thoughts that go through your head when you see people wearing specific brands, gym shark, gas, young L.A. Dark Sport, etc. And I'm going to take a way for the NES, but go ahead. Skip where's T-Michael's sweatshirt still to this day. Oh, I love it. And he's bringing him back. He's got the net cut out of him. He's doing these videos. He's doing it. He's like trying to get more into being like YouTube and Instagram and stuff. So he's doing videos about like, do you go to sleep and have carpal tunnel issues from your G.A. juice? And he's like standing on his deck in Miami with the T-Michael's shirt on. I almost bought a T-Michael off eBay. A little bit. Oh, yeah. Like an OG T-Michael. It was like, I had this tie-dye green T-Michael. And I saw that sweater. And I was like, oh, do I get this? It's you in a triple X. Man, you should. Is it kind of the bat wing sweatshirt? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's like really big under the armpits. I was like, oh, man, I look so skinny in that now. I think, good to hang out. I mean, shit. I mean, I don't really. I always never. I mean, I was sponsored by gas seven years. So I wore a lot of gas, but you know, that was that was back when I was, you know, 300 plus, right? Yeah. I don't really, I don't really look at that stuff as much, I guess. I do wonder why people I was never a gallon jug guy. Right. The gallon jug to me was always like, that's a like, do you know what? That just looks so good. That just whole workout. Yeah. And it just, I don't know the gallon jug thing. I thought was like, that was one of the bodybuilding things that I thought was really, really meat-headish and like, I did that. I did it. But part of the two was like, practicality, because I needed to have water with me at all times. And I just wanted to fill a thing up. You know, so I just like fill a thing up and take it with me. Yeah. And then also how much water did I drink? I just look at my hand. You know what I mean? Right. That was just had a lot of energy. I was just drinking. I was just drinking. I was had a water bottle with. I've always had a water bottle with me. But I never did the gallon jug. I just thought that was this so much. I remember. I remember. One of my friends who later became a client, and he did a men's physique show. He worked for a competing soda company, competing pop company. And believe it or not, we were actually friends. And we still are to this day. He had to go to a target to merchandise. And this, I'll tell you what. So sometimes there's a person in the store in all the grocery stores and all these stores called the receiver. And that person works in the back room. And they're the one who, well, the merchandise that comes in or all the product that comes in, they are the ones who's responsible for checking it all in. And anything that goes out there, the receiver. And I'll tell you what, the lottery severs have a little bit of a power trip going on. You know what I mean? Because like they're in charge of this is their back room. That cart goes over there. You can't use it unless I tell you. This lady at this particular target told them that he couldn't have food and beverages in the back room. And he's like getting ready for a show and he's got to keep drinking water. I think we were like even loading water. I was like, well Matt, we're going to be loading water eventually. This is 15, 10 years ago. Like Matt, we're going to be loading water eventually. So you can't be there for two hours, three hours without drinking something. He went to his doctor. And he got a note that said, Matt must be available to drink water all time. He's kind of like mama. And he human being. Right. Like many person with human rights. Matt must have water available to him at all times. So he ended up with the receiver. Yeah. I talked to the receiver. That lady, because I had my portable cooler and any story went into, I just walked in the store and parked it in the back and with my stuff and she was like, you can't have that. So I had to walk it back out front. Matt got a doctor's note for his water. I think one thing that I would be conscious of is, I mean, I mean, I was loved. You know, when I was really big, I wore a light gas, but I loved it. I still think they make awesome clothing. Really good quality stuff. But I, I never wanted to look like everybody else. I was always like, you know, like I stopped by in Jordan's because everybody else, like, Jordan's got super popular. So I kind of switched to like a different shoe. You know what I mean? Just like things like that. And I would always be like, if I had like a gas putty on, I would wear like a different t-shirt because I didn't want to be too branded. Yeah. You know what I mean? I was always kind of conscious of not being like overwhelmingly always kind of like the same as I do. No, I was just, yeah, yeah. I just that sort of thing. So that was kind of a, I sort of don't. And then I was at myard like, cutler didn't do anybody building brands. He was just Nike. Remember like cutler will always wear Nike stuff. He never had bodybuilding clothes on. You'd see cutler, they'd have Nike pants, Nike, they drive it. We did the Max, he was kind of like that. One point. He did, you know, had the meek. But that was his friend. I mean, I was just friend. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, it's important as buddy. But yeah, I don't know. I just had like that kind of awareness. I kind of wanted to like change it up enough. And I think that the thing that the older generation, that it's funny to me that it bothers them. Because when I read that question, I'm like, it bothers you. I don't know why. Because fads and clothing and all, like I'm sure that flat landers have a style, particularly the beginners. There's things that people do or motorcross, whatever. And I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to identify with what you do because I always laugh because the big thing is like, don't let people put you in a box, put yourself in one. Yeah. Right. You know what I mean? We're like, I'm a bodybuilder. So I gotta go down. I call it the douche-less. Like, do I have the right hat? Do I have the right shirt? But the thing is, is in the beginning, that's just how it is. There's nothing in it. Yeah. I don't care. To me, it's like, I could really give a shit what you wear. And it's not until you get older and cheap that you start going with target shirts or seven bucks. I wore that. I wore that. I wore that. I'd be fully Gators gymned right out when I was young. Like, yeah. You know, the big baggy hammer pants, Gators gym sweatshirt, Fanny pack, bandana. Like, I was... All the thing. Oh, that's very easy. Yeah, I look back at how I dressed. But I was, you know, I was just, I was like, carryin' the flag. I go to the mall to get something dressed like that. You know? Yeah. Yeah, that's why I think it's funny though, is that that's something that we hammer on. Because I'm like, you did the same thing, dude. You did the same thing. Yeah, I did that. I can't. You know, the man-faulty people. No. And the one thing I'll give them is at least they're like, when I look at it, not all of it, but the majority I'm like, it's good stuff. Like, if I wasn't 43 years old, I'd probably like, I'd wear that. I feel like I'm building clothing and fashion. His gotten a lot more advanced than it was. A weight of 20 years. We were. You know what I mean? I'd just terrible material three X t-shirts and just like one size fits all pants. You know, it just, it was awful. And now it's like everything's tailored. And oh my god, the material, like I have some young L.A. shorts. And like the material on them, you could tell it's like, yeah. You know what I was like, pre-in the material. Yeah. Yeah. I know that's what I'm gonna start is, I'm like, all that is from the old guys is jealousy that our shit was so horrific. Yeah. And we had a lot of purple and gray. No, it's to be by. I can't exactly. I can't point, I can't point a finger at anybody because we were wearing like neon pink. T-shirts underneath a purple rag top. With, you know, it's just crazy shit. And yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy. I switched my head. When I look at the young guys now in the gym, there's a couple in our gym that they dress it. And I watch them train like, oh, you're a real bodybuilder. You're gonna start with your real bodybuilder. And it's awesome, you know. Oh yeah. I would make sure to pull those ones aside. And I'm like, you look awesome. And I mean, because a couple of them do, they look really good. And I'm like, I was you just in uglier clothes. And that's another thing too is like, I don't like the bag and on people saying they don't train hard. I think a lot of these young guys are trained and really, really friggin hard. I might not, like I say, I might think they're focusing on door knobs instead of concrete floors. But they're going hard. The function really hard on those door knobs. Yeah, like they're great door logging. There's a lot of logging. That might just, yeah, a lot of logging. There's a lot of logging going on. A lot of like max effort, you know, I got to get six. I got five last week. I got to get six. Like I see a lot of it. So I'm not worried. I'm, you know, no matter what they're wearing, there's muscle happening. So that's all I care about. I think it's like, it all got more expensive though, to the fashion. Oh, but, you know, yeah. You paid for that ice material in the neighborhood. Yeah. But I also had, I also had a bit of like, I was one of those guys that I liked the vibe as a bodybuilding fashion guy, but I also had like the lumberjack shirt with the threads hanging off the, you know, and also had like the the dress down side of me, too, to like not be too fancy. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay. You want some extra stuff? Yeah. You got, I don't see. You got, man. All right. This one I thought was cool. Aside from genetics, what made Ronnie Colin J. color so successful as bodybuilders? There's a very different if you think about it, too. You don't know what I mean? That's why it was great. That's why I liked the comparison. They are very different. So Scott mentioned it earlier was self limiting beliefs. And Ronnie Coleman is so Ronnie and J. are different. Ronnie, it didn't even occur to Ronnie to doubt himself. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like, it wasn't even like, I'll never forget I asked Chad Nichols when I worked with Chad. We have a lot of phone calls at year and a half. I worked with them. He's such a great guy. He's been on the show for those of you that haven't seen the Chad Nichols episode. It's way back. But you go back and watch it. It's great. Two of them. But I said, hey, you know, when Ronnie won that first Olympia, like, you expect him to win. Did you? Huh? You're voicing off for a minute. Go ahead. Oh, yeah. So I said, like, what was that like? I mean, he couldn't have been expecting to win. I mean, he was like, ninth place a year before, right? I mean, you knew what he looked like. And everyone else, some of the other guys saw his pictures and were like, ho, you know? And he said, yeah, we were sitting on the bed. And there's actually a photo of the moment. Ronnie's holding a pizza. And he's got a slice of pizza in his hand. They're sitting on the hotel bed. So there's a famous photo of the moment. And Chad said, in that photo, he's asking Ronnie, is there anything you did that I didn't tell you to do because I need to know. Yeah. Because, you know, we just won the O. Like, you guys blew everyone away. So if there's anything you did, if you ate something or skipped some cardio or did extra, you gotta tell me now because it's gonna matter. It's part of the formula. Basically. It's part of the formula. And Ronnie looked at me and he goes, huh, didn't even cross my mind. So do anything. And yeah. So like, it didn't occur to Ronnie to doubt Chad. Yeah. It didn't occur to Ronnie to question his coach. It didn't occur to Ronnie to look at the plan and go, hmm, well, you know, scientifically, I don't know if I should be doing that cardio in the morning or twice a day or if I should be eating my steak before bed or I don't know. Like, all that stuff was completely void from Ronnie's mind. He was like, plan from Chad, execute. Yeah. So extraordinarily coachable and no self doubt even present at all in his brain. And those are two major factors with Ronnie. And then with Jay, you just have very similar but like obviously extremely coachable. He just did exactly what Chris told him to do. But Jay was, I mean, are they say some people born winners or they're raise winners? I don't know. But Jay just, I mean, Jay set the goal. I'm gonna beat Ronnie and Chris told him you're gonna beat Ronnie. It might take a few years but we're gonna beat him. And so that self doubt is a huge thing and it was completely void in both of them in different ways and they're both extremely coachable. Yep, agree with that. What do you think Jay, you think? Are you doing with Chris? Yeah, never. Ha ha ha. What crosses your brain, Scott, I know you don't know them personally but. He's passing. What's he doing? Passing on this. You're muted. He's got no sound. We're gonna keep going. He's gonna figure it out. Okay. Okay. When I look at both of those two, I think that the biggest thing that I, from seeing them as a fan and then knowing them on a personal level later on, it was the fact that they understood the importance of each day. Neither of them were focused on the finish line. It was just one perfect day at a time. And I think that that's again, that's where some of the doubt comes in with athletes is they're looking at the finish line. They're trying to figure out why their coach is changing things. Oh, Chad just changes. I must be too fat. Am I too fat? Am I too lean? What's happening? They just knew to execute each day to the highest their ability. And I think that that guy that goes back to that laying the perfect brick thing. If every day you lay the perfect brick, eventually there's a perfect wall, I think that most people focus on the wall from the very first brick. And that gets lost. Those two were very, very focused on every single day. And it played out and from a young age, you know, they had that ability to just go in there. And I would say one more thing that really jumps if you know them personally is they both loved bodybuilding. Oh, and truly wanted to do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's all they wanted to do was train hard, go in there and they both would have been doing it if it wasn't their career. You know, they just love to train. Neither one of them. I don't think neither Jay nor Ronnie ever said, how can I do less work? Right. Do you know what I mean? How can I do less work? I don't think that ever crossed Ronnie or Jay's mind. Yeah. And I mean, I think there's a lot of guys out there. Like if you're ignoring in Yates and you train 45 minutes four times a week and you have the physique to back it up, that's amazing. But my training partner, Braden, he put up a post the other day said, if you look like you hardly train, maybe it's because you hardly train. And we see a lot of that, you know, and I don't think like Jay was always finding ways to do more work. Jay was always, and I don't just mean more sets. I mean, more work within the sets and more training heavier and loading more and going harder and Ronnie was always trying to figure out a way to get the right to the barge uses. And they were never thinking of the limiting factors first. Yeah. They were thinking of possibilities first. Yes. Limiting factors. They only thought about limiting factors if they ran into a problem. Right. Like, oh, I'm not recovering. That would be when it's time to think of the limiting factors for a guy like Jay or Ronnie. But I mean, if everything was going good, they just kept working harder trying to outwork themselves. Jay was trying to find out, yeah, trying to find ways to make everything, you know, how can I get more in, how can I get more in, you know? That's the thing is you can't figure out where the line of two faras and tell you across it. And I think the most people, like you said, Ron, they're looking for that line in the beginning. Like the first thought went a lot of guys and I think a lot of the information age. They walk in the gym. It's like, why don't you want to do too much? And I'm thinking, I'd rather go too far than not far enough. Yeah. Because your body will tell you if you're going too far. If you, if you don't have to pay attention, your coach will catch it or if you're doing your own thing, you'll catch it. But too short, it's like, imagine you're seeing progress and you're like, see, I don't need more and it's like, but you don't know what you're leading on the table. So yeah, you're making progress, but could you be making more? Yeah. You know, I don't know. It was fun to me back in the day when you just went in the gym and tried to annihilate yourself. And then in time, you'd gain the experience to know that, okay. So those last nine sets weren't necessary. Got it. Well, hold those out. Right. Let's see here, bump, bump, bump, bump. I've got a bunch of people who want to hear too, just to throw it out there. Just let you know, guys, we had a bunch of good ones and there were some funny ones too. So when you're ready for those, let me know. Okay. I want to jump on this one real quick because I think it's a big one, especially currently. Trends and fitness and bodybuilding recent versus past. What are some of them? And then what will they all eventually have in common? So obviously, currents would be the the ice baths and the morning, too. I thought you're talking about like, training versus train ace. No, those are like fast-acting. So, training has a really long half-life. But yeah, you don't need to take it nearly as many times. I was just going to reminisce about how I once had an amps of parabolic. Yeah. I was going to tell my 90s. I'm not going to get better. I have taken. No, no, no, just I can't. I can't hear where we were just in the start. It was in my hands. I had 10 of them. Oh, the box and gold come. Yeah. I took the briefcase on pulp fiction just. Oh, yeah. I just came back to the point of the time. Yeah. I once too had a brush with greatness. So, trends with a D. With a D, trends with a D. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, trend-dipropenate. Yeah, trend-dipropenate. Yeah. I'm trying. I'm trying. Well, trends now. So, I've never been. I think some people think Ron's old and jaded. And they're absolutely right. I'm old and jaded because I have seen so many things that were said to be the holy grail. Oh, yeah. Come and go. And I'm talking from Vanityl sulfate and Waron, which may still have like a value. But, yeah. They were like the next thing. Like you're going to gain 15 pounds of muscle. And then they just slightly increase insulin sensitivity. Yeah. Right. Which can also be done by eating a certain way or just training really hard. Or, you know, like all these things that, you know, study shows, fanitals sulfating, increase insulin sensitivity. But, in a bodybuilder who trains like a maniac, his insin sensitivity is like, super high. So it's like, doesn't make a difference, right? So all this supplement stuff that came along, you know, also too like the ice bass. I was never on board with the ice bass. I was like, this seems like a whole lot. Like, are these guys going to all become the biggest guys that we've ever seen? Like, people say, oh, it made a difference. But I'm like, did it? Did it make a difference? Like, do you know what I mean? Yeah. I think that's, and now there's new studies out. Now saying not to do them, right? We've all seen this latest study, right? So studies show, drops inflammation. And then a couple years later after they sell, you know, five million ice bath tanks and people open ice bath businesses. There's now studies saying, actually, her type of hypertrophy. So it's like, geez, guys. Like, that's why that's why I'm, that's why I'm jaded when people make these big promises. I mean, I remember when the peptides first came out like the original peptides, the CJC and the epimoral and stuff. Oh, this is going to replace growth hormone completely. No one's going to take GH anymore. What's everybody doing now? They're taking growth. Taking GH. Yeah. Yeah. You know what a good one is? I thought of this the other day talking to someone else about this topic. And not saying they don't work, but everyone wants to know. Oh, no. Okay, got it. You remember, so here's one that I think you wouldn't have to be around for super long to get it is CBD. Do you remember it wasn't that long ago that like you took CBD for everything? Oh, I have anxiety. Oh, you take CBD for that. I, you see, be, for my inflammation. I, I, you see, be, do this. I do CBD to bring down my cholesterol. Like literally CBD was like everybody was like tearing. You're going to, yeah, 100. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was finally the secret in it was like in everything, every store headed. Our gas stations were like CBD sold here. You know what I mean? It's like a gas station. And look at it today. Like, I never bought it for a single second. It is what what people, so people have been smoking weed. Their whole lives should have all these incredible markers of CBD consumption. They should have like no cancer. And they should have like no. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just not the way things work. And of course, that all went by. I don't have and heard a single person mentioned CBD to me for like a couple years now. Is anyone even talk about it? But I feel like a lot of our listeners even if you hadn't been around for that long. You remember the CBD fad. Yeah. Yeah. It was like, I think methylene blue is the new thing. Is it everybody is like, oh, you put methylene blue on that. I think there are some benefits, but Victoria showed me an article the other day that there may be some situations where it could be really harmful. So it's interesting. I'm going to have, I'm going to talk to Scott about that on an episode of muscle mind. So we can kind of deep dive further into that. But yeah, anything too where it's like everybody's taking this thing for everything. You question that, you know? Yeah. When I started, you guys, the big thing was your postwork out nutrition. It had to be like, you get done with your set and hopefully your training partners shaking the drink for you and then throwing it in your face because you can't miss your antibiotic window. You won't look as you're doing your last negative. You're going to see. You're going to see. You're going to see. But that was, that was the thing in the early 2000s. It was like, I mean, I, it was a fact. I had the stores. We would tell people like, no listen, bring it in as soon as you're done training, shake it up, drink it in your, like it was this whole thing. And I remember it, come to the point where people are like, well, what if I have to drive home in its 50 minutes away? I'm like, ah, I don't know. No, no, no. No, no. No, no. And then now is more information has come out. I have to thank the, the macro community for doing the homework on all this and they're like, yeah as long as you eat all your food today, you're good. Yeah. Yeah. And there is benefit, you know, there is benefit, but it's highly overblown, you know, the, you're thinking that if I do that, I'm going to put on 10 pounds I wouldn't put on. Yeah. And then it's also completely contextual as to what your pre workout meal was. Sure. Sure. You had two cups of rice and 10 ounces of steak an hour before you train shoulders. That food is dripping into your system for like five hours, 60 grams of intra. Yeah. And you're drinking, you know, 20 grams of EAA as well. You're training. You're fine to drive home. You can even stop at the mall and pick up like some new headphones. You're going to be okay. Like I think it like, so it happens in reverse, so too, right? So we used to do branch chains during training. That was the thing. And then a couple of studies came out this that O EAA is a better than branch chains. And the funny thing is if you actually do a deep dive into them branch trains, why you train the reason that Syvation came out of the product called Extend was because it extended your ability to train during the workout. So literally I laugh because I'm the only person that gym that dreams branch chains during training. That is when they're meant to work. And I used, I laughed when all the studies came out because I'm like, All the old guys should be shaken their heads because we could remember when we started using it, you could tell. Like you're workout. You're last set and your first set looked the same. You were like, okay, this shit works. And then a study comes out and it goes, oh throw it away and I'm like, What? And also, too, what's the difference between, I currently drink the gear just because I like to say gear. But what's the difference between drinking branch chains while you train? Yeah. And when you've eaten 10 ounces of steak an hour before, which is full of all the other EAAs. Yeah. Or drinking EAAs while you train. Like those, your bloodstream, if you're eating properly is loaded with the menos, you're getting some extra density, like extra high concentration of menos into your bloodstream. But in the EAAs are all three of the branch chains. And the blue scene is still the more dominant of all of them. So I don't like, yeah, my clients, what should I do? I'm like, what do you like? Yeah. It's hard because much is my high-p on it during legs. I can only drink water because anything has like the coach's my throat in any way. Makes me nauseous. So I drink water when I train legs. That's it. And sometimes I don't like to be sipping on the branch chains. I'm like, oh, this isn't going to work today. Put it down, grab your water. I'm drinking that now. So I'm one of the other jokes. I'm good. Do you remember the trend of drinking a hydrolyzed casing with cyclic branch? I do. Yeah. While you train, I did it with hauling's head one day for legs. And I puked my gut. Did you? Oh, yeah. It's on video. It's a mute. Not a mission we did. I mean, we had a hell of a workout. But that was the first time I ever tried to drink hydrolyzed casing. Was it like, you know, bro? A whole bunch. Yeah, something like that. Hold this head mix it up for me. He's like, here have this. And I remember I started drinking at what we were doing pendulum squats. Yeah. And I was like, oh, I don't know about this. I'm a water on leg day with maybe like 10 grams of amino's in like a liter and a half of the liter. Yeah. Like it's like very see through super diluted, you know. And I remember drinking that and we did some heavy ass banded leg press with added weight. It was crazy work. I was a mute non-emission episode from Kings gym years ago. And then at the end of the episode, I go on the alley. And I just projectile vomit all over the place. And obviously it was a hard workout. And I am the type of guy that has thrown up on leg day. But it was that crazy drink, man. It was the worst. And I know that Metos was doing it. It was experimenting on himself because he was trying to maximize recovery. Yeah. And so and that goes back to something on paper being great. Like the science says on paper. It should be awesome. And then you do it and you're like fuck no. Do I'm looking everywhere. At that time, so John was talking a lot to Shelby. And so I'm hearing what Shelby's doing, what John's doing. They were doing like 200 grams of carbs in your workout. You know like we're talking like, oh, it's drugs. That's what I was doing too. You had to build up to it and man, that was expensive number one. That's a lot of freaking carbs. You just hammer that insulin with it too. You know. Oh, I think the thing is that's back to what you were saying around in the beginning. When I'm a new lifter and I'm trying to figure out how to squat properly. Yeah. Just do it correctly. But I'm making sure I've got that perfect intro drink. And so it's even if it's even if it is a great door knob. We haven't put the walls up on the house yet. So let's not worry about it. Let's just yeah. Or that concrete. Make sure it's sturdy and flat. Quite often my clients will message me. I'll get them fired up on their plan. Yeah. And the message me, go, you haven't sent me anything about supplements. And I'm like, well, yeah. Like, I mean, you're 165 pounds. And you've never eaten properly. So get the steak like Costco and a ball of test. I had a guy come up to me in Germany. My hand goes Costco and a bottle of test. Nice. And I just laughed. And yeah, because, you know, just like, let's just get you going properly. You've never done a proper split. You've never done a proper diet. Let's get you eating. I don't want you worrying about a whole bunch of shit. I think that's overly important. We'll get that in later. Just take some fish oil. Get a multi. Get some good protein. Get some creatine. That's all you need. Let's go. You know. So another trender that. So I asked chat GPT because I've been talking to chat GPT a lot. I'm on this kick. Ron, Ron now has three friends. Yeah. I have a new doctor, everyone. I have a new doctor. So I asked for a current list of bodybuilding trends that are hot now, but may not stand the test of time. Oh, huh. And it gave me an insight. It said, this is a list of things that are currently hot. But may fizzle out like many other trends have. I love how it talks. And it said, and the number one thing is optimal obsession. Ha. Wow. And it said, it said, chasing perfection with biomechanics. The length of the rep resistance profiles, altering machines, machine only training. Strange exercises that isolate single muscles out of complex muscle groups. Yeah. All are already showing signs of fading. And it says, why they might fade. And it says, all of this is based on theory, not enough brute force. Many forget that progressive overload is still driven by maximum mental effort and high physical drive. Over analysis will lose steam once people hit platos despite being optimal. I think I have a new friend too. I like this guy. This chat. Yeah. Some sounds. Yeah. And then it said, influencer driven high-perchier-fee programs. And it says, genetically elite influencers who have already built fantastic physics using bread and butter bodybuilding techniques. Now selling optimal, overly complex workout routines to unsuspecting newbies. That's amazing. And that's a good thing. As buyers become more educated, they made demand better science and less BS and require more transparency. And I had a dinner with my brother this weekend. And my brother is an infectious disease specialist with three medical degrees. Rons of disappointment. And go ahead. Yeah. I'm absolutely disappointed with my family. And I have also met doctors that have said, part low. Do you have a relative Eric Partlum? And I go, that's my brother. And I've had doctors look at me and say, he's the best doctor I've ever met. So my brother is very smart. And I had this conversation with my brother. I mentioned some studies. And he goes, oh man, the thing with studies is everything is constantly changing. Studies are done on different groups of people, different numbers of people, different parts of the population. There's all these variables in all these studies. I deal with this stuff with studies on medications. And you have to take this all with the grain of salt. Nothing beats experience. That's why people come to me who have seen five other doctors. And I look at their chart and I go cancel all this. It's none of these things. I've seen this five times. It's this and I'm right. Victorian. I just similar stuff. You know, this is literally a study is just one thing. It's just one thing with one great. It's the back great. Yeah. Put it in a put it in the pile. Interesting information that is that could be useful. Absolutely. And yeah, yeah. And I said, wow, I said, bodybuilding is going through a lot of that right now. And he goes, oh, really. Like he doesn't know anything about bodybuilding, right? And he said, yeah, that's that's always the battle in the medical community is the studies versus the practical, actual experience of seeing things. And they just don't always line up. Yeah. And you know, if to take it with a grain of salt and it's interesting. So I give you a funny, I'll doctor story, Ron. So I was, I was prepping a guy that's a cancer doctor. So, so he gets done with his show, wins. He's nasty. About a week later, I did a text. He says, dusty. My, the adema in my legs is out of control. He's like, I don't know what to do. I talked to a couple doctors. He said, we've done some lay six. And I just won't go away. And I said, oh, Frank, you're dehydrated. Drink three gallons of water for two days. It takes me two days later, because doctors are idiots. I go, because you guys didn't walk backwards. Well, you almost died because of that. Yeah, you're not, yeah, exactly. And doctors almost killed me because I didn't realize I was dehydrated. And that's why I was holding a water Scott. Yeah. So they started pumping me with dioratics. And it took an outside source that knew I was a bodybuilder go, he needs more fluids. I remember that. I remember that better than you actually. I don't remember that. That's boring. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it's not going to be easy. I'll move with fluids and then all the water went away. Yeah. And then they just knew, oh, he needs more fluids every day than anyone else. Yeah. Do you guys want to hear the, the final one that it gave us? Yes. Absolutely. It said excessive data tracking. Okay. Tracking your sets and reps is one thing. But trying to track RIR sleep cycles, recovery scores, HRV and many more small details daily. For many, the juice is simply not worth the squeeze. Simple logging of your big core movements is going to make a comeback because burnout from tracking those tiny little variables doesn't make any sense in the scope of a person living a normal day-to-day life. We should just stop this podcast with just chat, GBT because I finally have a lot of things. We've been seeing. Yeah. Yeah. Great. We know you know what's funny guys. This is when when 2020 happened, I had five gym memberships because I went to one gym for legs. I went one gym for backs. I like their equipment, all these things. Well, then I went to muscle factor and he just bought it. So he had like very little equipment. And I was stuck there for like seven, eight months just training on barbells, pull-up bars, all this. And so we went in and he was kind of like assessed what we had and figured out the workouts. And seven months later, I looked at my physique and was like, how did I ever get away from this? I was bigger, stronger, everything looked better because I had any options. Yeah. We have a back leg. Well, there's a bar right there. Yeah. Let's do that. Hey, that's when Bumstead grew a back in a basement that year, you know? Yep. Yeah. It's just funny. We do the overwhelming options. Make you think. Get away from it. And I pressed people all the time if they're doing their own training. Like whatever thing is in can mean you don't want to do is probably the most valuable. I used to say that all the time. Yeah. You know, rolling off the floor is a pain in the ass. I mean, you got to lift the plates up to slide one more on, do all this shit. It's a pain in the ass. So why not just put on this machine over here and do a row. It's the same. No, it's not. I can't count the number of leg workouts where I said, what do I not want to do the most? And I'd be like, I really don't want to do heavy. I really don't want to do heavy hacksquats today. But I'd better do them first and get them out of the way. Yep. We had a question that's literally just about this. He said, do you guys think that an exercise that you tend to be weaker on versus a stronger exercise could possibly be of greater benefit? Example 15 plus plate leg presses for 10 to 12 versus just two to three plates for a squat for 10. So you're comparing apples and oranges when you're comparing two different exercises because everybody's body is going to be biomechanically slightly different from exercise exercise. So you might be really strong on the leg press because of the length of your femur and the length of your shin. But it doesn't necessarily mean that your quads are doing more than if you squat three plates. Do you know what I mean? Like you can like and and it's the level of effort that matters. Like if you're going really hard, then they're both valuable exercises. So and you will get stronger on your squat if you start prioritizing it and trying to progress on it. Maybe one of the reasons why you're squat is so far behind your leg press is because you avoid squatting or you don't, you know, progressively think if you're squat like that. Also anyone who's leg pressing 15 plates, I'd say chances are you're not going to fold up and you should probably take some plates off and reassess where your feet are on the platform and all that stuff, but that's a whole other conversation. So, yeah, you know, I think you know that is you're you shouldn't avoid things just because you're weak at them, but you also shouldn't avoid things because you're strong at them either. Yeah, um, there's there's a value to things and then I think the big thing is to pay attention to how do you feel when you do a movement. Because yeah, as much as I just told you that I think you should be doing rows off the ground. If you're not feeling your back the next day. And someone watches your form and it looks good. Then maybe it's not for you. You know what I mean? So it's definitely not one size fits all. I just had a conversation with a client that was like, I'm following your training, but you know, I kind of want to do these other things and he's just a hard lifter and I'm like, throw my training away. Train hard. I don't care if you do none of it. Like there's nothing I wrote that's magical. Now as you're progress, if I see a weakness starting to show, I'm going to ask you about the training you're doing and I might pop something in that you have to do. But I don't need you to follow this like a like you're on a mission you have no other options. Yeah, it's just trying to help you structure a workout. Yeah. Yeah. So if you don't like something toss it like I don't have a romantic involvement with any of these things like bounce it out. So what else you got Scott? Yeah. We got a bunch. What is something that competitors do on stage that you wish they didn't? Oh, go. Lip sync. You don't like the lip sync thing? No, we're trying to talk like they'll have a V-sover in their routine. No, like point to the crowd and they'll be like, I'll be like, I'll be like, mumbling the words or to be a quote from a movie, you know what I mean? And though that but the sound systems always it always sounds so shitty. You can't really hear what the person's saying and I might recognize a movie quote. But if you don't know the movie quote, you don't know what he's doing. Yeah. And a lot of times the timing isn't right and just a waste of time just got different things. And it never works. It never works. Stop doing it. Stop doing it. Please. One thing that I laugh about is when people prep their front lot spread the same way they do the rear Lot spread. So like they do the row and I can only see your front and then they grab their hips and then they do the last Spread them like that's actually part of the rear post. There's a reason you're doing that on the rear shot and on the front it's not necessary. Good point. You know so taking weight just one thing for your like that doesn't do anything. You know. Yeah. Yeah. I'll rush my clients when I work with them on the phone or somebody who's in person, especially the earlier guys who don't know as well. Well you say taking too long ground and they're trying to like set things up. And like the second they if I try to rush them like I don't tell them I'm going to do it, but we're running through the poses and I'll say front double bicep and they take their time and they set it up and they get those arms hit and the second they said okay, let's spread. And the second they hit last spread side chest. You know, either now they're starting to move quicker. They start snapping. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I also hate it. I hate it. When people do their when people do their rear lot spread. Yeah. So they're standing with their back to the crowd and they bend way over forward. Oh yeah. You like kind of the spread like it's completely unnecessary and you're sticking your butt out at me which stop. And it just takes longer and it's annoying and it doesn't have to be done. Just watch Dorian do a lat spread and just do that. It's not hard. Yeah. Just go Christmas tree. That's it. Let's spread. You know, I have to bend over and do this big production and then stand up with your eyes. Drives me crazy. A simple one that is primarily beginners is looking at their feet. Oh yeah. I'm like you don't know where your feet are. They're on the ground. Like it's like they have to look down to see where they're at and I'm like you should know that just by being there. If we're going to that level dusty, I'm going to add the bounce. You know, where you get into the side chest and then you have to bounce it a couple times to kind of feel it. Yeah. Don't get rid of the bounce. Get rid of the bounce. All right. Let's wrap it fire a few of these. I've got an important question here. I actually Victoria thought this is hilarious. Ron has to drive cross country with one of the following people. Who does he pick? Victoria, who just took a triple dose of all in and is excited to explain her research. And Dusty, who just got banned from the NHL center eyes and has ravenous hunger, a pseudo whose client just finished second at the Olympia or branch warrant. These are amazing. So, this is very important. Dusty just got banned from what? The NHL center eyes and has ravenous hunger. What's NHL center eyes? Is that like a membership club or something? You tell us basically just assume I got banned from sending it pisses me off. Yeah, I'm starving. That maybe it was like you were in like you were got like the good channels or something. I didn't know. And let me tell you I've been with Victoria when she's like I hear talk about her research all the time. Oh, I can't really say it. I've been with five days of estrogen, progesterone, radio. Here's the thing is, can't wait. I can't wait. I'm passionate about it. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah. I listen though. And sometimes I have told her too. I was like you realize we just did that whole dog walk. And I just listened to you. But something she has to get it out though. You know what I mean? So I also have a lot of research. She's in a way. You know, I don't need to be reminded of how stupid I am for five days. So she's out. I see those client just finished setting it up. It's going to be a life. It's going to be a life. I think I'd want that right. Could we record that? Yeah, I just hit like live stream on the Instagram. Right. Right. Going on the dash. Yeah. Oh, I get like a million hits. That's funny or branch. So branch would just branch would just want to have a lot of beef jerky. Yeah. And water on hand, I think. And you might want to stop at a shooting range along the way. That'd be cool. And he probably wouldn't talk a lot. Yeah, I don't know. No. Pull over. Maybe they can just wonder if you'd want to listen to country music. You might want country music. Oh yeah. I think I probably picked Dusty. Our periods are already synced up. Yeah. We'll film that out earlier. Oh, man. All right. Underrated or overrated. Body weight exercises. Overrated. Yeah. Overrated. Oh, my. Underrated. Although, although. And I got to spin back a little bit. I'm. I might actually lean. I mean, I like a prison. You depends on how our ride went. Yeah. No, you know what? I think you're our right Scott because there's not a lot to talk about him, which makes him underrated. Because like the other day at the end of my chest, we're got just for fun. I did close grip pushups off the ground. I got like this. That was like. Yes. So, you know what? You're right Scott. I'm changing my vote and they're underrated. So I did it. I did it. I did it. Oh, yeah. I've been doing plank. Right. And so I decided I was like, well, what if I started just like doing pushups too? I was like, all right. Because like, you know, yeah, I'm much weaker than I used to be. And so I do three chest exercises. Third one is just body weight pushups. Three sets as many as I can get. I just didn't today before the show. And I got like 20. And then 15. And then 12. And I'm like, oh my god, it's a nice way to just finish my chest day off for where I'm at. It's freaking great, you know? I think that's too much fatigue. Yeah. Much fatigue. You're definitely not recovering too far. Not gonna grow. All right. How about this one? Um, Oh, this could be like a whole topic. But craziest off season. Crazy off season. You ever have loved the stories from back to the day getting insight to the experience with different coaches. Like for our lives. Could be either. Why no runs or run? Let's talk about your time with Chad Nichols. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I know my knees easily. The year I worked with Chad. I hit 330 pounds. And I mean, what do you say about being 330 other than wow. It was a lot. And it, uh, it, uh, I mean, I can't, I can't even imagine being that body weight again. You know what I mean? It was, uh, but I was, I was like, Huge. Like, I saw a picture of me with my family. Yeah. And how it just didn't even make sense. I was just like, And it's how big my head was. I was gonna say where you smiling. You got the green thing. I just thought, yeah. I just shot. I just got, just got. Same for Nardron. Yeah. They pumped, yeah. They jumped in head. Yeah. It was, it was a lot. And, um, you know, it was fun to do. And like, like we said earlier in the podcast, you don't know what too far is until you've gone too far. And, um, I mean, people are like, Oh, wow, you must have been really fat. And I was like, well, I was definitely fat or like, I had body fat on me for sure. I was bulked up. But like I said in the first 10 days of my diet, I lost 21 pounds. No. So I went from like 330 to like 208 and like 10, 3 to 8 and like, in like, in like, 10 days. You know what I mean? Or 318, I mean. Is it 318? No. 308. Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry. Oh, yeah. And then Chad, oh yeah, that's just all that water. But, you know, being full of water like that, that's pretty anabolic. Like he, he just, he's like, he is like, you were in like a grow environment. I remember what he remember he would talk about like, creating a maximum amount of ballic environment inside my body. He was like, you know, that's why we did it. And I was just like, oh, Lee shit. Um, I was heavy. And I was really strong to, I mean, ratio wise. I mean, you know, you see kids on Instagram now that are moving like crazy weights because everyone's just, you know, while there's a drug faster there too. Yeah. Yes, it does. But, um, I mean, I was on like a decent cycle, but it wasn't insane. I was doing like 1200 test 500 EQ with like some good growth. I had some mom to trope pens. I was using a bit of good growth, but not like a ton of things like five a day. And I was taking an anodrol. And I was just fucking huge. Like, and you know, I remember I had my legs were over 33 inches. And I, and you know, I mean, I was squatting five plates, like, you know, like routinely and doing stuff like that. Barbell squatting five plates, you know. Um, so yeah, is this heavy a shit. And uh, uh, what a ride that was. Yeah, big giant face. What's funny is when I look back at those periods where in hindsight we say, it was bigger than it needed to be. But I still think that at the end of the day when you're, when you're beginning. And if you're, if you're not somebody who easily puts on body fat, I would rather the client gets too heavy than not heavy enough. Because they're, they're again, like, what do you leave it on the table by being too lean? Yeah, you know, your diet was, you still got shredded. Yes, you didn't need to do it again. But I think there's certain things that in hindsight, like, I'll move like that earlier in your career. I think would have been very well worth it. And then later in your career, it's not as necessity. And that's where things got, I've kind of gotten ruined with social media. You're watching Kion in his offseason and saying, well, that's what he's doing to be the best. It's like, well, that's what he's doing now to be the best. Yeah, you know what I mean? And he's just genetic free, so it doesn't even apply. But I do think that those times were good because mine was the same. I mean, when I look back, I remember dreading eating after my second meal, the next four. It would be time to eat and you're not, you're not, you're not hungry. And you're looking at an entire meal and it's like, it's got to go down. You know, it's almost always nauseous. Yeah, you spend your, and it's funny because you spend that your whole offseason uncomfortable. That's why I have a client that keeps telling me he's bloated. He's like, I'm bloated. What do you mean by bloated? And then he answers, I go, you're full. That's not, it's not, it's not gas in your stomach. You're full of food. Yeah. You're uncomfortable and that's the goal. You're good. You know what I mean? But I think when you look at those, more people should lean into the eat more. You know, I mean, I always go back to Dante and that was he had a big push with Kevin Jordan. He got huge one year. I mean, enormous huge when he was working on Chad and everyone was like, he's so fat. He looks terrible. Then he came down to one of his junior nastier wupp. He was nasty. He'd put on like 20 pounds of tissue in a year and he won the overall. And it's like, my data says that this worked really, really well. My data, my last piece. Dusty's study says he put on 20 pound of tissue in one year and was an experienced bodybuilder already. So I don't think he needed to do that every year after that. But for that year, I think it was really valuable. So I think more people that are serious about bodybuilding should consider getting really big and getting really strong and then diving down. And like you said, finally, yeah, yeah, the younger you are, the more valuable it is to push your weight up. Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, so yeah, man, greed, that was a lot. Hey, if you guys are good with that, I feel like that's a great place. We kind of came full circle, you know, on the show here at the day. Agreed for being out of practice and having all this time away. We didn't seem running two weeks on the show. I didn't even know if he was still on the show. Well, we do have to take a minute, Dusty. We haven't been on since we got back from Feebo. So we just recommend it to say hi to everybody that came by to say like, we watched this podcast. And like, you know, Lucas came by like, of course, guys like Lucas at like, re-post our video all the time. So show to Lucas and guys like that that we only get to see if we go to Feebo. And you know, and these guys come by and they say, hey, last five minute crew. And you're like, oh, what's his wild? You know what I mean? So definitely want to get to the world to everybody. And hammer. Yeah, the girls can buy their several several amazing amazing interactions with the female list. And they got accents from different countries. And you're just like, it makes, you know, I tell people all the time like we see the number on the YouTube video going. But it's just the number. And then when we go to those places and we actually meet the people, you realize that that's like, you know, it's actual real human beings watching the show. And you know, you meet a girl with a girl with a French accent who watches the show. And then I grow from Spain. You watch as a show. And then I German female listener comes by and like it's just, it's crazy. People from Sweden and you know, it's just nuts. So thanks to everyone who came by and talked to Dustin and I much appreciate it. I do have to share two scoggly and tell you this yet. But Ron and I went down to the equipment hall. Yeah, we did just like a gorilla mutin on a mission of the equipment hall. So we're going to the hall. Oh, it's almost done. And okay, cool. So we're going through and we're just finding pieces and I'm filming Ron, trying them, you know, maybe talking to the reps might come over and talk to us. Yeah. And I assume the whole time, you know what I mean, this is what they're doing. So they're just walking up to everybody. And we we we dropped by the the Jim like, both and we're trying some different stuff. And then what was the booth we went to next with the had the, the equipment that I like the row and all that. What was that the was that the new tech booth. Yeah, we would go by the new tech booth next. And so I'm sitting there and I'm kind of like filming and everything. And then the guy from across the way walks over. Yeah, to tell the guys at the new tech booth. They're like, you can't have whispers by over here and go because it was he's talking about Ron and he goes, he's famous. Make sure you cover anything he needs to know. That's amazing. That's amazing. I'm like, this is so classic and they were showing me some of the new tech stuff. And the guy was like, oh, come check this out. And I had, so I'm just doing it. I'm like, oh, yeah, like that like that. Then the owner comes over and he immediately had to do some of my first name. And I'm like. I just had no idea that anyone knew who we were. We were just kind of like doing our thing. And they gave us like in depth breakdowns of all their machines. It was awesome. Yeah, I'm actually excited. Even though this very guerrilla style, I think people are going to love the videos because I'm excited. I want to try some really cool stuff. And I sold a bunch of it on the show. Yeah, we're good. Yeah, yeah, it was cool because like the the one guy from New Tech. He was from Hong Kong. He's like a distributor from Hong Kong and he's got some gems. Yeah. And and and and and I think his name was Brian. And and I said, oh, I'm I'm Ron and he goes, oh, I know he goes, you're welcome to come to my gyms anytime. That's so cool man. I was like, oh, that's awesome. And like it was it was pretty cool. Yeah. Well, this is it was pretty cool. And I've got something to add here. Check this number out. So this is not including the audio podcast listeners. But in the last 28 days at the YouTube channel in total. We are almost cracking 200,000 views in the last month alone for the entire channel. So that's the whole thing. But yeah, so figure that on top of the audio lessons, we get maybe between 10 to 15,000 a week there. I mean, it's pretty freaking incredible, man. The the amount of people that were reaching. I'm trying to push this up. I want to see. I want to see 200,000 views in 28 days. You know, it's a it's exciting, man. It's exciting, man. It's exciting because you know what to it's not just 2,000, 200,000 likes of an Instagram post or you know, somebody scrolled past a picture or a real and hit like these other people that are spending anywhere from 22 to 30 minutes. If not an entire hour with us, you know, and that's a freaking lot of people. I don't know how many minutes that is. That's a lot. Just the night went by one booth where we tried out a bunch of equipment and it was a brand that I had always considered kind of a fitness brand. Okay. And we went by their booth. It was where we did the Lake extension and that was my favorite extension. And, and I saw their upgrades. I was like, your strength stuff is different. And he goes, yeah, because we are stepping up the strength like and I was like, I would put this in my gym like so some of these fitness brands are realizing like. The demand for real. A bodybuilding equipment is is come up like they're making a pendulum now and they're making we try we try to try to depend on them and and then he said it's very heavy and I said yeah, dusty, you know he's like a six seven plate pendulum guy and they he looks him goes, no way like you just move on right. And then and he had no idea who we were, but he quickly caught on like when he was showing us the extension I started talking but they have a thing where you can flip a lever and the backdrops flat. Oh wow. So you could lay back and do extensions right no one else has that. Wow. And I was like I was like I really like this extension like this is not the fitness brand I thought it was. Yeah. And anyways, we left he goes, oh you guys really seem to know your stuff obviously, you know he was just talking to us. We leave and the next day I didn't tell that to this but I got a message from him and my Instagram he goes, oh damn. I had no idea who you guys were. He goes let me know if you need anything he goes I can have like and I said oh we already have a great wrap with your brand and he's like yeah I'm very good to meet you guys like he was just kind of funny. That's cool. No idea who you guys were like if you want to net you know next year come and see me like he was he was cool so he was great when he didn't know us so that's me. Yeah, he was great anyways right but but yeah it was funny you know because that at that hall is so huge and you think like. They care about the guys is it like guys are showing up here like guys are coming from China and they're like I'm opening 100 gyms. Right right. Yeah those are the 900 people that. Yeah, those are the guys that they really want to meet right so it's like they're gonna give a shit about to meet heads with cutoff teacher to walk through that right. But it's cool to you guys. Yeah, yeah. That's all anyways great time at people and Scott we've petitioned for you to be there the next year and the people also spoke we made sure that George. We made sure that George heard heard some of the people say where's Scott. Yeah, let's go. That's going on the less of a hanging appointment. I was holding it down in the background over here. I'll tell you what I would be as cool as Fibo is. I'm hoping something happens with the UK. I would like to be there because that's where I feel like my you know our our channel is kind of split. Yes, US UK. I don't know who you know percentage wise. I we might even have more people percentage of human beings like per capita that listen to show and the UK then in the US because there are so many more people in the US. I was our numbers are bigger. Are they okay? I'm going to be the Arnold again next year so we will be there. That's it's like on I've only been to the UK once for expo they brought me out to do the podcast there a couple of few years ago now but I I already I feel like that's like my second home so hopefully we will bring me out for that. My my first trip there. I showed up to the booth and this was I mean I don't think I was a pro yet. I mean I had my YouTube and everything going and I got there I show up on an hour and a half after everybody else and I put my stuff down the back and the owner of I force goes, hey you got. You got you got some people and that's like an area for me so I'm thinking there's going to be like two guys standing there. Yeah, I turn around there's a line. Holy crap and that's what I realized was like the UK's a different thing. Yeah, I mean there were there were 30 people standing there and I was like, oh. Are they waiting for like I was so thrown off because I'd never had that before and I'm like you're like where's Jose. That was before he was even there. I was like oh different place. I mean bodybuilding is so hardcore there. Yeah and it was was a very immediate eye opener that it was a different planet. Like that's why they connect to our shows you know. Yes. Yeah, so that was a great trip. That's cool. That's guys had a good time. I missed being there but it was cool to see your pictures and stuff. I can't wait to see that mutin on a kind of mutin on a mission that'll be good. Yeah, so it's it's you know there's not a whole lot of content but it gives a good view like the people who don't know with the equipment haul will look like we tried to get some good pan and then I tried out some machines and dusty tried out some machines. We just I'm just I'm slapping it together on eye movie right now but I'm kind of amateur but I'll you're doing all right cool when I when I'm done I'll I'll I don't know what we're going to do with it dusty intended something but I will send it over and throw it on the channel and hey that'd be awesome. You know this is cool. It was an hour and a half Scott and we were hurting. Yeah, that's how big of it. Yeah, we saw like 10% walk it and we were rushing. Oh, yeah, we need to get back. I mean we could have been there for four hours easily. I'm sure easily. But just to give people an idea right like you know people have been to the art in the Olympia and they think they know what the supplement expo looks like but the equipment haul is like a car show these booster worth millions of dollars. Yeah, they're dropping 10 or gems. They're dropping 4,000 square foot gems on the floor. Yeah. Yeah. Like I mean there was easily but two and a half million dollars with equipment at the gym 80 booth. Oh yeah. Well then we like I was talking to somebody they were asking me how big it was and I said if you ever been in a Costco and they were like yeah I said okay three of those. Yeah, that's the equipment haul. Yeah. Wonderful. Yeah, there's an all-to-be. Yeah. Yeah, we only hit three of the halls of the equipment so it was obscene. Yeah. Okay. All right.
