Whenever you do a set, you can kind of like go into the void, but every now and again you come back to reality first, put second. Yeah. And you're like, okay, I need to get back in there. For that split second, I told myself if I died right now, I would be completely okay with that. And then that's just for your form or rest. What's going on, guys?

Dave, man, this is something we've wanted to do for a long time. So thank you for joining us. Man, you just killed that intro. I have been trying to work on my intro for a podcast, I've butchered every time. It's okay. You could do recorded. You got to record it. You know, then you just like cut it together afterwards and nobody knows the difference. You know what I mean? Well, we did that with one. We did that with one of my sponsors, but I'll mess up my own sales. Oh, yeah. I do the sales calendar for a lead FPS. So I plan the sales. I'm the guy. Yeah. I'll get on the pie. Hey, go go lead FPS. We have specials on. I don't know. Stuff a gym equipment. Give gym equipment. Yeah. Yeah. One of these days you're going to throw something out there. Like, we're specials on everything 50% off. And then like, you're going to run the woods. That's good to happen. Yeah. Well, for real, we're grateful to have you here. I had the opportunity to come down and check out the elite center. What do you call it? The compound is this version five or the compound now? Yeah. We call it the compound because it's a mixture of the warehouse to office. And I don't want to say gym because we don't have members. So we'll just call it a corporate business. But you've been around for a lot longer than that. And I think at this point, all three of us have had the opportunity to to check the latest installment of the compound out. But that's a place of lore, man. Like, that is a place of lore. And that's something we really wanted to start out talking about is talking about the company, elite FTS. But then also talking about like where it came from. Talk about hardcore training and talk about, you know, just just some of the experiences you've had over the years. Okay. The reason it's called the compound is gym one more title that many, many years ago, because we were in different locations at one time. So because of the sizes of the company are for a long time, it was downtown in an old beta $400 per month building. And then when we finally moved into a bigger location, the gym had to go out in the country. And an old John Deer dealership. And then the warehouse was across the street from the office. So there were three different places that housed everything. And then we were in the factory. Damn close to 20 years before we could actually put it all into one location which we have now. So the compound kind of stuck because at one point, we had the three buildings that were all right next to each other. But you had to go outside to get to each one of those. So that's a real fast track of the history, but this this year actually this month would be 25 years in business. So it was founded in 1998 and so I mean, it's it's crazy now, you know, like I can't say that right We we told Dave before the show were like we got to try to cut down on the Volgaardy and skip was like not as just not gonna happen when we get Dave on it's just not gonna Have Well, we're we're totally fanning out today because all of us put on our elite Derb now this shirt I don't know about your guys is but this has been one of my favorite training shirts since about 2007 You can hardly read it anymore No, with I mean, I still don't know why this three Yeah, with the company history is there anything in specific that you're Wondering about because there's a lot of off-shoots. Yeah, what what do you think skip? Well, here's the thing I have been with a lead FTS for about 10 years now and I do have some rapid fire questions Later, not now which I didn't let you know before so I'm just throwing a match of now scouts What you know for Dave awesome? I should know this I might get fired for this day We'll be like she and I just you need to just get rid of you know if I'd probably make Rhonda fire me That matter What how did you get how how did you where you just sit around and think in this equipment is just like there's not equipment good enough or start because for those who don't know and I'm surprised by this but in in bodybuilding a lot of people don't know that elite FTS equipment really is like there's nothing stronger I laugh and I always make this point the cissy squat could hold someone While they're standing instead of a plate they could be holding a box car and it's not gonna move It's not gonna bend it's not gonna flex you know the bars just Hold ridiculous amounts of weight that likely if you're not in the 1% of 1% You're not ever gonna need it, but you can get on this equipment knowing full well That nothing is gonna have to it's not gonna break and as a gym owner you would think Well from a liability standpoint I don't want cheaper equipment that is sold and buying I want this expensive stuff So what would you thought process? I mean did you just think you know what I'm gonna build the baddest ass strongest Ever notice how I decrystall know that you did good. You did good. They can't really get me for that one So I don't know I mean did you just know somebody who was building quit me? You're like you know what this woman do what was that? Where did you how did you get into it? All right, the equipment actually started The whole business started with me working as a personal trainer and You know moving into an independent contractor role to be able to pursue the consulting and seminars that I was doing at the time So I was assisting Louie Simmons with a lot of those things at that time So that's where the the name actually started is you know It's it got to a really weird place where I have you know 40 50 sometimes 60 Villival hours per week and then I'd be working on my own company stuff in between clients But yet I was being paid you know and I really wait for that time in between clients as well So I didn't want to lose the gig that I had because it was really good and But I still had to be able to work on those other things So with that in mind the first products that we brought out were Dragon sleds God I think back Training manuals just simple things that you could put in an ad in power lip and USA and then About a year or half year and a half into it Louie wanted to get out of selling accessory items because he was in the mail order business and basically still is now And the item see was just tired of dealing with where things like a man or a squad attachment weight releaseers Safety squad bars The Jimmy quit that so sumo a sumo 2 by 2 power rack a Bells watt belt a few other pieces and he Pushed that he didn't push he gave that to Tracy and I as You know because he wanted to get out of it But it also helped us tremendously because he gave us the contacts and the resources and he gave us a lot of product on Consignment which you know allowed us to have inventory without really having to buy inventory Which we could have died at the time as that fast tracks through the equipment company that he had at that time the building equipment Basically went out of business and it didn't tell anybody so for For for we got in my name been six months for six months I'm trying to get updates, you know from Louie Because I basically I was purchasing it through Louis which was person at purchasing through the company which was in Pennsylvania at the time And granted I already took the money, you know, so say you guys buy power racks and now you're wondering four months later Where the they're at and I can't tell you who that because Louis doesn't know because they're not returning his calls and what ended up happening is He drove down to where the company was found out there padlock They went bankrupt and tell anybody basically this all and so Louie was in a buying there I'm in a buying because I got people's money that I've already spent You know, I've used that because the the company's made on floating cash Yeah, you know, so it was back then the delivery time on equipment was long It was average of 16 weeks 12 16 weeks So I got your money for your power racks I'm taking that and I'm buying books from Dragon Door and then I'm flipping those books Hopefully before I have to pay for the equipment Yeah, and that's that's cash flow and What happened during that time is I bounced around through a couple different equipment companies that were just as bad as what he was dealing with and Then I found the company that I've been working with for the past 15 whatever years it's been forever now out of out of South Carolina and when I first got with them They didn't want to work with me because I was online and nobody thought you could ever sell equipment online That far back And and that you know the the They had already they they already had I history of working with a very big company in the industry which kind of screwed them over So it was all this kind of came together at the right time because it was a very blunt honest You know Handshaker Grimmett 15 years ago, which has worked out to be very well for all for both companies because the We rely on each other, you know a lot, but that's where the conversation of quality and all this stuff came in because I didn't want to have to deal with returns on Clipman I didn't want to have to deal with all these other things that you have to deal with in that equipment space because it's The margins are not high, you know, this is manufacturing and now I'm basically there's two companies selling that product So now the margins are being cut because two companies are doing that So it was it was a bigger discussion of here's the quality that we have to have because the real market's gonna be and The university's high schools is where the main focus this was that the gym market is kind of an off-shoot market But it's a really hard one to penetrate because of all the different types of equipment and Scuse that you need you know, it's we all know and I've known this from being around for my gyms My whole life is nobody has the best life Right, so if you wanted to outfit your own gym you're gonna have several different companies in there because this part this Like extensions better than this one and this one better than this one and you're not even to think you're ever gonna come up with the ultimate best line Where so the nuts and the bolts we're gonna always stay The strengthy limit which would be the power acts, you know lap. Oh, now is good hand raises reverse hyper things that kind of fit into that mode So that's this way. I said with the company There's a lot of off-shoot so the equipment is one one side of that which makes up about half of our revenue stream through there But and as it's as other companies come into the mix and you know the different Reena's there in it becomes The messaging becomes a little bit difficult because we're not really in equipment company Where you know, I don't do the manufacturer. I'm one of the retail and now what we'll retail I won't retail anything that I won't use myself. I think that's the best that's out there and The retail end is what supplies and supports the content That's how the whole thing was designed originally that the content would always be free And then the profits from the retail is what's gonna pay for the content and that's where the million plus pages online If come from you know through the videos and all the other stuff comes from because there's no monetization of That and so that's where that happened now the equipment also There's seasonality associated with that with the markets that we're in so Obviously the Q4 it's a different market because those are gonna be a more home-champ buyers and stuff like that Once budgets get approved and then Q2 Q3 do very well for us I equipment but usually do really crappy for us I'm a parallel rap straps and all the other stuff So a large part of this was how can we string together the seasonality of the different products that we offer? So we don't have droughts of cash flow throughout the year Exactly Yeah, I think a lot of builder body builders don't understand because again I mean I've been training for almost 40 years and all the gyms I've ever been in the only elite FTS equipment I ever have seen in gyms is the equipment that I bring in And that's bizarre. It's bizarre to me so and and I I have another question too because I'm that I'm curious about I you can cut me off at any time scout, but I'm kind of no this is good man As far as body builders need to know that It's not just the equipment like they were saying the the gear the When I say gear the wraps the straps the sleeves and things like that This is just really high quality It's really good It's just great and I'm disappointed that so many body builders don't know about this if you want your gear to last a long time You buy quality stuff you may have to pay a little bit more for it But it will last you longer. It's like buying a good computer that's gonna last you five or six years versus buying one Then slightly less expensive in it last you two or three years So for those of you who don't know about it check out a lead FTS check out their pair check out their pair And of course suit equipment. Yeah, exactly. I got a very year definitely for 12 years old and they're about the same as when I bought them and no kidding Hunters I mean there is literally nothing frame I think a big reason I think a big reason for what you're saying is and it actually Would I would chop it up as One of the potential mistakes I made over the past 25 years is I've always hyper focused on a target market of Lifters that place training is one of their top three or four priorities of life Where I don't care about those just starting out They began and stuff like that so in the past I avoided platforms like YouTube because the demographic was too young So in and basically what I was trying to avoid was I did not want to be the muscle and fitness I did not want to be the men's health. I didn't want to be that That's all general low hanging crap people can try anywhere So I wanted the content on the site that's a step above that Right so if we got article submissions and and contact Coming our way that was that it would get rejected all the time and and So the that in turn looking back You know Was a mistake because the people on YouTube get older Everybody gets older right? Yeah, you know, so they grow up so there's been a lot of back tracking with all that But it also means that say if you walk into a gym someplace and you do see our racks in there You know 100% certain that whoever owns that place whoever's making the purchasing decisions takes their training Way more serious than anybody else Because they know who we are So most people aren't gonna know That because it's not we don't have Google ads That are retargeting everybody all over the place You know, we don't have all these other things because it's kind of been one of those things where I don't know if I really want to Have that be my target market if that makes sense absolutely by that it creates a certain degree of scarce scarcity but it also makes it really freaking hard to grow You know, I We're talking a lot about business with just something that I definitely wanted to make sure we touched on But you know Beyond that there are a lot of people that are involved in in like the business of strength the business of fitness and that they're not They're not like a true passionate fan of and you are not that person like you are If you're one of the most intense people now I've never seen you train in person But I've seen some videos. I remember watching I can't remember where this what like what time frame this was But I remember watching you on a belt squat after you did something else like you guys were like supersetting something like You might have been with John you might have been with him and Scott Stevenson But you went to a belt squat and that wasn't even the first thing you did and you started doing reps and you got like 10 And then you just kept going and it's like there's this death metal just playing it like so loud ear piercing And I think the video was black and white and there was probably chains involved I just was like taken back because this belt squat set went on for minutes like it was just rep after rep And I just I guess I also want to make sure we got into this man Where does that intensity come from? I don't know I think I can go to the default answer That you know every every meathead has you know it goes to get beat up when I was a kid all the time you know, but it's some point time You're gonna grow out of all that crap. Yeah, I don't know it's um It's just a metal Challenge because I'm not stupid. I know physically that one said isn't gonna do shape for me It's not like I'm gonna get two more inches on my quad or 50 more pounds on my squad if anything It's probably doing worse Then then then positive and I completely understand that but I Love it too. Yeah, and it's it's just just the last week the last the last Week of the year there's there's one thing that John and I used to do we used to deadlift with chains off mats for just a challenge set a high rep set and I hate deadlifting more than anybody you'll ever speed to I absolutely I Right But once a year since we've been doing that I always do it at least once just to see if If Because I know what my rep record is just to see if I'm still at that same rep record with the same chain saying set up all those other guy stuff Because if I do it then I know I don't need to ever deadlift the whole year and I can still And And if I don't do it it still doesn't mean I'm gonna do it any again But this is one of the one of the scenarios like what you're talking about and We change some things in our weight room to put the podcast table in the corner and just make the setup a little bit easier Deadlift platform is there now So for some stupid reason I don't know why because now the deadlift is like the main Freaking attraction of my gym which I Problem with yeah, I decided to do that in the one thing I remember about the set is But well, maybe rep 10 or 11 I did 15 Because the way the gym situated now I can see the the squatter dude on the wall in front of me It's got a red background and I you know Whenever you do a set you can kind of like go into the void But every now and again you kind of come back to reality first put second Yeah, then you're like okay, I need to get back in there for that split second I told myself if I died right now I would be completely okay with that and then More rap That right there whatever that state is That's like bliss for me. Yeah, I freaking love it now it's counterproductive to every training goal I have But It's it's a really weird addiction. I just above John had a little bit of that so when you put us together for those training sessions that we did it just compounded and this This is stuff I couldn't do when I was powerlifting had to be expressed differently You know at singles and stuff like that because this is I there's no way I would have done any of that crap But I did a lot of that you know offseason powerlifting before I came to the left side That's how I trained all the time. I would say almost my offseason if you go back to old school hit training That would be how my offseason was aligned You know before 1990 7 so powerlifting meets compete for the meat you know take them on golf afterwards and then start ramping up using more Hit training protocols which is just that how can you completely oblibiate yourself You know and It seemed to work for me at the time so I love to I love challenge that so I love to really have these singles Everything in between I can just take it or leave it. I don't really care Yeah We You know when skipping I were at Swiss and we got to Sit in and with the memorial that that you guys put together for John that was really touching and and you know Everybody had a lot of stories that in some of them were sadder you know and it definitely It definitely was was you know some of it was hard to listen to and when it came to you I specifically remember you had said that You know this isn't what John would want John would want us to be happy and to remember the good times and to be laughing And you told some amazing stories there man stuff I had never heard before like I and I want to tell you too Like John has meant a lot to all of us like he's influenced this channel from this from the jump man since I've been podcasting Andrew was real close with John and he you know he's been a big part of of all of this so To hear those stories to me were just you know it was really impactful man and I want to first I want to say thank you for sharing everything And and second I'd love to hear you talk some more man because I and I know our audience would too Because he was somebody that I think we all really looked up to a lot and I know that you guys had a really unique And special relationship and it's interesting too that crossover, you know because you aren't that traditional bodybuilder guy But you guys made something work and and and I think that you were both better for it, you know Yeah, it was Started because John started writing for teenager and I was I'm my I don't want to say my end of writing for T-Nation but it kind of it was getting to the point with the T-Nation where I was starting to come to the big realization that my best Content wasn't even on my own site and then when you have other people that are writing for you what kind of examples is that You know and so John had some stuff out there and There was there was something I was coming back from I don't know what that had get was now But I reached out to him about I don't know what article that he wrote it was something in there and and that Doing choir about One of his programs or whatever the hell it was and he said that he would just come out and Give me the program whatever wasn't I look at the program like I can't do this stuff I mean this is just there's an arm day on there. I'm a And so so then when he came out it was you know discussing you know laying out helping me to lay out this foundation because You know I had to figure out a way to blend what I really want to do in the gym with what I have Probably should be doing in the gym and it's that becomes a weird situation when you're your whole background It's being a strength athlete and then you want to start putting in a bunch of high-perchipy work But not tap the resources that you need to recover from the heavy stuff that you're doing You just can't combine two things Yeah, you know something's got to come out and I didn't want to let anything come out and After the first leg day that we had that he came out It was just like I'm doing this man and then it was and he had a story coming in too because he was just He was still at the bank, you know, so he hadn't really committed to that yet But he was in the process, you know, so he had a lot of doubts as far as Could he make this work you know as an entrepreneur with the client that he had and you know And what would that look like you know moving forward would it be a paywall? Would it be just online clients would it be You know ebooks programs and I'm telling him you do ebook suck I we've had a couple do well, but most of them suck you don't want to do that and Then it's was his pro card, you know he wanted to get his pro card and I thought that I could offer Different perspective and if there's one thing that I've learned about training and even business for that matter is When you start consulting with people they don't live in the same world that you do Different ideas come to mind but You need to discuss those ideas you can't just have this person from the outside say do this do that Because I'm not familiar with that body-go-ny world familiar with how to change exercises You know to be able to target weak points and how to Do exercises in such a way you can get more out of them without having to go really heavy and that's just because I'm so beat up So That was and then a lot of that was just strategic talk like how long do you think this is gonna take realistic You know how do you answer when you're gonna get your pro card But like it's just like a year is this two years is what what is the timeline here? Yeah, what does this look like when you're just gonna say it's not gonna happen and walk away Like what is that and it wasn't being negative? But it's it's we're gonna if we're to lay something out that was the look I like long term plans So if we're to lay something out that looks like a quadriting up Then do we have four years or after three years you're gonna say look I'm now whole You know I'm about two old to be able to do this like what is this timeframe and then once we have that It was you know what what what do you think your weak points are you know this kind of stuff And we knew we had to bring up his lats We knew we had to do something about the waistline You know which it's thick right so Getting some of the heavier crap walk was gonna be able to help and then he Was very adamant about his training effort had to go higher And from where we started I'm thinking okay, I've all floor there But what's this look like you know like when we like two years from now Whatever it's gonna be what does this look like and his reply was I don't ever want to have somebody that can come in here and Train with us and not walk away and feel like they were not just they he wanted them to feel like they just got murdered All right All right, you know that if we scale it you know if you cycle in scale it right over two year period Then anybody that comes in for any leg training session is gonna feel that For a long time Yeah, and but then it's So that's kind of how that all started is there is a lot of that dialogue But where there's also the other side of I've been in this industry for a very long time in the business side of the industry And I've seen you know what happens in all strengths for body voting included and What what that looks like as well and I've seen when it's done to People that could be really good fathers that end up not having kids You know people that could end up being you know very good husbands or spouses Whatever and end up divorced because all these other types of things so there are other discussions that we had too Like so when you get this pro card what's that mean after that Is you're gonna be like 50 right or whatever he was gonna be I was Joe You know you're gonna be like 65 by the time you get your pro card But what's what's that look like you know in the the original agreement was that 20 would retire When you guys procur Yes because that would be like as Olympia because Realistically thinking was he ever been a win the Olympia was he ever been a win a pro show You know it's these All things that you look at his statue you look at his physique and this was before he went to 12 All right you gotta start stacking that up and saying where can you realistically end up with this and then is it worth because your your kids of little You know they were babies You know when I met him you know these sacrifices are being made by his kids and by his wife not by him Yeah, you know so so that was That was one of the first things was that is let's get this shit under control and Enbalanced because if it's not and but he's a balanced person of begin with But if it's not in balanced if it starts to get be railed then all of it gets be railed You know you start getting in a situation where you think you may end up getting into a bush You think your pro card is gonna come in that next year Where the in a year and a half you know Realistically probably not you know the stress and all the other crap that got to plays a lot So that has to be an order and as I said during Swiss the one thing that he pissed me off about was when he Would you have this pro card can study was gonna you know compete in the next show And then I'm on the phone with his wife and I like You know and But then he sold me on it and went from there But it was it was There's always stuff you know the end of Jim that was funny where he had I call him bodybuildingisms You know like you feel like you feel it. Are you pumped like you don't ever Don't ever Okay Right that's like you know As your dick hard you know Like this this does not resonate with me, you know It was you know it's always better to look strong than be strong and I was Hell You know so I'm in a lot of the other things that are just you know Bodybuildingisms that we would all make fun of he legitimately so would say yeah It's seriously right oh seriously and I don't ever say that again It's amazing I mean there are other times where there were there were leg sessions that we had because there's no air conditioning the fans I mean it's terrible and the warehouse that we were training at the time Where we would have ice buckets that we put our hands in between sets okay ice packs on our Max and back and these would be three hour leg sessions yeah and just burn in the crew Whatever electoral lights and all this stuff. I mean you're drinking piss and drinking. Oh you've even pissed half the time Yeah, you're sweating so bad and So I mean his workout thing there's no doubt that was it was insane It sounds like he learned a lot from you, you know and I want to ask you first yeah when ask you what what did you learn from him? um I learned that Bodybuilding goes in these weird waves and you have And strength is the same and you have this the science side right where you'll look at things and you'll be For instance, can you really shape a muscle right? I mean you have the muscle structure that you have you can high-perch if you can grow the muscle and I mean the But he would say No, that's bullshit You can And then he'd show me examples and I'd be like I Get what you're saying But I also see the other side You know and and he's like what other side is there the person did not have lower laps to begin with and now they do Now they just have laps, you know There there was a little bit of change of my perspective on exercise selection and is far as Bodybuilding and weak points for a bodybuilder and he and it wasn't really that much different been the exercise selection for Somebody that might be weak in a three-quarter lift or the bench press or we could have certain spot or their bench press or weak because of whatever that was so I had to He taught me how to kind of take that away from the biomechanics of a barbell and what the person looks like Another barbell and then just the biomechanics of how a person is moving and then how their muscles are working Which was he was an anatomy chart? It was really thin skin So when you can physically see you know the fibers moving you know and The upper laps the irractors, you know the traps Especially with back work it became very easy to see while look at this guy He's very weird. I'll dominate on everything and he's doing for his laps He needs the you know depressed the shoulders pull his rib gay do something to get that stress there and so That a lot of that came from John and then he would have other bodybuilders come out Train with them and you can see this that's like this is obvious. This is not doing a whole lot for your laps at all But it's build the shit out of your traps and where it melts. Yeah, yeah, which is why you know they're so big So that was a big part the What about wider yeah, well, I was gonna say like so I'm thinking to though like some of my training partners in life The people that I've literally gone to hell with in the gym Some of those people have become some of my best friends too and I know that you guys became friends outside of the gym as well Yeah, and I guess I was kind of almost thinking of in that direction You know we learn things from people that we just don't expect just through you know interacting with them And and and I guess can you talk a little bit about that side of your guys's friendship too? Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to do everybody too much You guys you guys know this man it was it was a fault. I'm I'm paranoid to the highest degree So you have people treat different people into completely different ends of the spectrum Which was that's that's one of the biggest things that I missed about him Because if I had something I was Dealing with you know or if he had something he was dealing with then we could speak to that of course You know where my perspective lies Here's the worst outcome And that's and that's not a bad thing because that's how you grow so expected you know lean into it Because where he was on the other side like oh no, he's a really good dude This is all good. It'll all work out really good guy The answer is always in the middle You know, so then I was you know I could come back to him and say well what if what if what if he's not? You know because the other ones were really good guys too But then this acts happens so what if he's not like what's the plan there? And then he would come to me and say well what if this what if this worst case scenario is then actually that You know what if what if what is the best case scenario of this? Yeah, I never thought of that The worst case not happening and That was that by far was the biggest you know because he was so optimistic you know and Trustworthy probably I mean he had reservations on people he would just rather make the mistake I'm being Too trustworthy yeah, I could really to that He always said and Dave's in my mentor in business And I think this is touching on exactly because like you said he was always maybe a little too trusting a little too wanting to see you know the good and people I guess especially in business situations I'm thinking back to like the Prime situation all the bullshit was Aaron P. J over the years and even clients that you know He thought he had a good relationship with and then he found out there in South Africa selling his plans and keeping on them profits and unbeknownst to him So maybe is there any particular situations you can think of where you had to say John this guy's trying to You like no Why I remember all this you know and the one that you're talking about I was saying that from the beginning from the jump Like this does not look good You know this this doesn't make sense Not only that but the contract and look Then makes sense there are just weird things associated with it and it just It didn't seem right and and I get what he was trying to do I really do Because it was centered around the entrap which he was really freaking proud of you know and that started I believe with You know biotast but then it And graduated into John Swarmila with that due still believe it's available through turning nutrition now and But that was one I mean some of the other ones the the biggest one to be honest with you wasn't that the biggest one is when When he was having problems with his wife that that by far You know and I spoke about that at Swiss to because that is That was a turning point You know when you know when you're trying to with some that was a turning point for our relationship I guess as well because when you're training with somebody you don't really Know you you you they're training partners I've had people I've trained with for 15 years. I can't really I don't know their wife's name You know like it doesn't matter you're in the gym. I just trained with it doesn't matter But he was he mentioned that he was having you know issues And with his wife and and what they were and it was he said that she'd be better off with somebody that was from the church That pissed me off because it was like okay here's two things going on here I thought this pro card mattered you know now we're just gonna just fuck that all up because You see that you know the grass is green on the other side and that's not actually true You know why don't you just be the person that she wants you to be what's so freaking hard about that you got married for a reason You know you can vouch for it. So I I pushed it back on him hard and Because he needed it, you know and then he went and did it you know not only that But he actually the faith became not doing it for her but doing it for him You know so when it comes to John's humbleness and the persona and all this stuff that people see on the internet See on his YouTube channel. That's from Mary. That's not John Mary may John You know and that that is a very important thing that granite John Yes, he still John is the training knowledge is still all in there but all that Stuff that he's known best for now is from Mary you know it's not from You know any other place by the back and The fact that you know he looked inward You know to just figure out how to become a better human You know and then was receptive to having somebody call him out on his own bullshit Which is very hard You know for a lot of us to get people like that in our lives Right because you reach a certain status You know and whatever endeavor that you're in and then the older you get people They they don't want to insult you. They don't want to You know hurt your feelings. They don't want to piss you off Whatever it's going to be you know so you end up being surrounded by people that just agree all the time And then they so you you don't know You know what you're saying now is bullshit or not bullshit So it tells somebody calls you out on it and that that situation there Kind of open the door for us to call each other out on our bullshit You know so there's so that's and that's that's a It's an important thing What's the mark of a good marriage as well? I think when you Come together and you're able to Balance and pull those things. I mean it's it's very similar to the relationship that you have with him in a sense It's you're both coming from different directions and on a lot of things you're meeting in the middle And I think it's it says a lot about the type of person that Mary is it says a lot about the type of person John is as well because we all know that the position that John was in he was dealing with I think a lot of sick of fan it You know people who he had to kind of probably Decifer and try to figure out as this person Close to me because they want something from you or to gain something versus do they genuinely Like me as a person and and I think in this industry it's also very difficult to not get caught up in that I'm a celebrity. I always say a false celebrity, but you know I'm a celebrity and all these people think I'm great and they're gonna agree with everything and then you have to go home and You're just dad Or you're just the husband and for him to be able to balance that out I just from the outside and I knew John but I didn't know John as well as you guys do and I only knew about Mary By discussing with John the parallels that our wives had about how they were kind of Appathetic about the industry in the sense that they didn't really love it But they didn't hate it because of What it provided for for us Not just you know revenue stream or anything but just our passion for what we do So we always after and said our our if our wives ever got together They would talk about an I-roll about the industry itself of everything that they've heard over all the years and I think that that balance I know I have it with my wife and I always got the impression from speaking with him and I finally got to meet Mary at Swiss And then you get to talk with her very long but She it didn't surprise me that she was The person that I anticipated that I expected she was very sweet I could very clearly see that that was I always say you know his better half and I do think well What happened very ground With with the industry and say spouses and so forth My own wife included what they Need to be reminded of and I think that we we lose this Our self a lot of times is all industries and all businesses and all sectors have crappy people in it Everything does you know body buildings probably no worse than Wall Street we just don't work on Wall Street Okay, so it's you know There's there's good and bad you know of all of it and when you're a spouse or you're a significant other You see more of the bad than you do the good Right because you see the ego of the laughter that you're with and then the only Time you actually see the sport is on game day if it's a firelifting meter or bodybuilding show People are not really themselves on those days because it's a competition it's focused you know and You know it's an ego contest and there's a lot of other things going on so a lot of what they see Is not appealing at all but what they need to remember is when they have people Like us that are working in the industry you can look at the industry and define it like many do Our government our governments corrupt boom by good we got it no problem But anybody that really knows a whole lot will tell you what you really need to do is to make sure That your own house is in order that your own families in order than your own communities in order Because that's where you can make the biggest difference So when you're in these industries where those significant others need to look and where And we need to spend more of our own time looking as who is the end user and what are they benefiting So in John's case he sells tons of programs there's tons of programs out there There's a 16 year okay, there's a 15 year okay, there's a 14 year okay that just purchase one of these programs Or is doing one of these programs and love is training and Looks forward every time they go in the gym and has an idea of what they're doing now You know and that right there is the consumer of the industry and that is What I will remind Mary of when I speak to her every now and again, you know because she's still in the industry But remember who the end user is don't get clouded with the politics that all fall above that That's great good chatter and good drama, but that's not life You know because if They all realize that and then they see the impact and the differences that Leaders in these industries have They're they're changing people's lives, you know, they're they're helping people become Better lifters and better bodybuilders and they're they're making a difference in that small Spear but there's a lot of small spheres that add up, you know, to make a big difference So that's the one thing that I all bitch about all these industries to know end we can go up hours You know I'm drama of all that But I'm I'm I'm a tune enough and John was a tune enough to get a separate back It's okay that's that That's just one part of it that really doesn't even need to occupy a whole lot of my mental space This is the bigger part What difference is being made like is this kid, you know now gonna you know Get stronger and build confidence And then it's some point in time stand up for himself You know then years later, you know You know, let me use that then just segue to this question because we're talking about the impact that John has had any Impacted so many people in such a great way that it's it's mildly Envious if I'm being honest maybe a little bit more than mildly but With the relationship that you had with John with him being a bodybuilder and you guys trained together Was there ever a point when you thought to yourself? I really want to get on stage oil myself down And go out there and dance around Dance around Well, what the tells you about the diet you did Yeah, well, you got pretty peeled Yeah, I did so it's once I graduated because I started powerlifting when I was 12 13 years old And so once I graduated high school went on to college I found a what a gem that had like equipment You know like machines and shit not just power acts and barbells and stuff that I used for five years or whatever and so I and Powerlifting you had powerlifting USA but then you might have one article and like flex in the very back of the magazine Which is like one half half the pages that add and the So it's in my roommate was a bodybuilder at the time at one the Ohio so I'm like maybe I'll just I'll do a show You know, so I did and I got killed because I didn't die at that hard You did a bodybuilding you did a bodybuilding show I I Yeah, I was actually I You guys did I think John kind of prepped you when he was also died and and you got real good I want to know a little bit about that but but finish your story about bodybuilding Yeah, yeah, no the bodybuilding so it's I got wife the friend of like fifth five in the team to this It was bad right now like this sucks like this sucks And the guy's I was training with says of course. It's gonna suck when you just placed dead last in the team division You know, so it's I did I did another show and that was a little better It was like heard or something or something like that and again it was like this sucks I like that you know I like the training I love the training that was a really good change I love that but I didn't make much difference one way or now there it's I can take it or leave it it didn't make them much different the But the rewards sucks and then of course there's what you didn't win So then I did one more show and it was supposed to be a qualifier for the Ohio So I did that show one that show and then I realized as I'm standing on stage with a trophy that was taller than me Which was kind of cool because most of them are like little barbell things and and I'm I'm Basically the lights come up a little bit and I realize I'm standing up here in my underwear and everybody in the crowd is wearing Boat next sweatshirts with tank top underneath you know, we can see this. Oh, yeah, we know those well Yeah, like the team Michael team Michael this. Oh, yeah, yeah, just get to where's it? I'm like this is terrible With what had he stopped and so I go I go home and I Straight pass out and my apartment that coma and my training partner picks me up the next morning to go training and you see He's like there's Oreos on the board. Oh, thanks There's a whole floor. It's just It was terrible. It was pizza boxes And it says why guess you're not doing the Ohio And I still like your glue One more time Stop so I'm like I respect what you do and I like what you do But this is not working for me I'm out and so anyhow and then that segues and I go back in the bodybuilding that put on 3040 pounds of lean body mass Her back the powerlifting and I put on now I'm a two closer to 75 from a to 42 and my total drop 200 pounds and that's kind of really and there's because The all the muscle I put on was not functional for what I do as a powerlifter now getting to what you're asking about John is the After our retired from powerlifting, I needed something to train for Because even now I still need something to train for because if this is just about exercising fitness I probably won't do it. You know, I just it's never been that you know since I've been 12 That's the paradigm shift. I don't know if I'm mentally strong enough to to make that Found ways to hack it, you know, just I will find something to train for each time So with with just then he had you know the carb cycling then and then I made work with Shelby for it Which I'm already first and then it was you know Justin which was carb cycling then I believe it was Shelby He was both of them. I worked with little bit different both kind of carb cycling Shelby is way more heavy on cardio Which sucked by the way And then with John it was different because with those guys before hand it was more about I want to die it down And then rebound back up, you know for the post show rebound which is supposed to be some mysterious best way But I'm also getting 20 pounds of lean mass Yeah There's interesting stories with that too, but anyhow that what John it was I kind of wanted to do that because my my set point changed to where my body weight at that point was now like it's 27275 to 80 really ridiculously high Where when I power lift it just weighing to 80 was a task Now the muscle mass obviously different when I was 280 you know years years back it was not it was more fat Then it was The lean body mass I carried before with John it was like how am I? Can I change this set point to 250 and and not rebound back up and so his little trick Was basically just a moderate diet so five meals a day Clean foods for the most part you know if they're not clean foods it's still gonna fall within the calorie protein range Just simple swapping and changing and You know checking body fat every couple weeks and weighing Standard what we didn't have to do were the photos and crap like that Because I didn't care I'm not doing a show for one thing he can see me when he comes out to train that's another thing and but once I got to to 40 I think it was I'm starting to think okay, we're done like this is cool like this is over now We're going to maintenance mode man because 250 is what I want to maintain yeah, not 240 he's he John played these stupid metal games man I He would say you see that and your shoulder and my dude I can't see my shoulder there's no weird going to jam so no I don't see it In my shoulder so he take a picture You see that there's a vein by ready to pop out or you ever have a vein in your front And I like I like no actually I haven't this kind of bothers me because I've seen big fat fox I've been and I can make the super heavyweight Have that big gross vein in their front belt, but I don't like this that was the halo chest and popping through Yeah In two more weeks and that will come out so you started this two more weeks shit And so that's how going if it wasn't that and it was You know you see that vein in your cab it's going up to your you know your addoctor now So that's the really really start to look like a garden hose I can do I could do that that's I can do that to where we said it was yeah two more weeks and it's like okay Where we see you're you almost have a veins in your abs Hands in my abs like this getting never happened And this this keeps going and it and I remember the one Saturday I woke up I weighed myself and I was like 24 And I go in and I I don't give a shit what you said We're done There's nothing else that's gonna pop out and means that I give it about We're done and he just kind of snicker to little So when you normally would rebound how many how much did you usually gain? I said about 30 freaking pounds Every freaking time because where's that gonna put you? Am I he's kind of a bitch 250 Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a play that with uh yeah I said way a little bit yeah, of course, man We could be talking great stories about John all day, but um yeah, I was really interested in the you know your your business model of You know the equipment sales is really just there to be able to provide the funds for the education Yeah, and Education been like like a big driving force for you like your whole life and what what kind of inspired that I love that Well, the vision of the company when I when it was Founded was to live learn and pass on Right, and this this a lot of thought went into this I would not be who I am if it wasn't for the coaches and the power lifters that helped guide me as I grew up Right, so it's my dad threw me a power lifting gym when I was 12 Because I was getting my ass kicked all the time and Those guys taught me how to get strong mentally and physically, you know, and it also and at the same time My earlier teen years we're starting to go as stray because once I started to get a little bit stronger and learning some wrestling skills there was this Revenge that I thought I had to seek on a lot of people which I did which was starting to become a problem Right, which was you know, which was Several chips aren't trips to juvenile core for things like that So anyhow these the first off those guys They're 40 35 40 years old they didn't have to help a fucking snort in those 13 year old kid Learn how to squat bench and deadlift Nor drive me three hours to a power lifting meat now coach me at these meats. They didn't have to do that And if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be sitting here today talking you now I also had You know a wrestling coach after I got thrown out of college or flunked out of college You know call me out on my bullshit You know tell me that I'm not stupid like everybody said I was I grew up in special-ed classes And barely graduated high school so the my whole education system was basically You're the idiot go sit in this class here's your tutor We're just gonna get you to graduate and that's the main goal I graduated high school without ever taking algebra biology I had or at rock science I had business math You know I had a reading class you know and stuff like that and How how how I ended up in college is still kind of a mystery, but the but my first year was taking courses I supposed to take an high school and I transferred and I clunked out and then when I came back this wrestling coach You know pulled me aside national school was doing and while I was there I found the library which was kind of cool I've never been a library in my life and I found that International Journal of Sport and Nutrition the Soviet sport review the NSCA journal all these strength and conditioning resources And every time my girlfriend would go study I went and I just went up to the shelves and I read all that crap Photo copied all these all these things So when this coach asked me how it was going I went on this tyrant about two hours on how linear Periodization isn't as good as block periodization and we probably need to look at block Periodization to be a not been playing around with all this and so he he pressed me on the school and I said I know I flunked out so I'm back as you know I should be working at one of the factories in town Wow, I was track that's right here basically to do But I'm gonna kick ass in the gym because I just learned all this other So I mean training is always been my first priority anyhow So this all worked he called me out and said that I wasn't stupid I was just in lazy and that if I could go on those shelves and learn that then there's no reason why I can't learn algebra algebra To anything I wanted to learn I just wanted to do it and That was my head a lot and it made me go back to school Which ends up you know getting the degree in that so Louis Simmons is another one You know he didn't have to give us product on to assignment You know he didn't have to invite me to come train at West side of Barbell You know or teach me the things that he knew so this I feel I owe these guys You know because that's how the gyms used to be you would go into gym you'd earn your dues Right you you you'd you'd have to train hard and I mean the whole goal of being in the gym was how do I get with that group over there Right you can't just walk up at least then you just can't walk up and say hey I want to train if you got Yeah look at you know like get your ass out here you're You know You had to earn your way in and then once you were in you know Then it became a matter of okay this is awesome Not I want to become the best here And then once I'm the best here I want to go somewhere else around the best and But all those people along the way I didn't pay a dime for any of that not of that You know so now I'm online and I'm looking up strength and conditioning and information the forums of junk all this other stuff is junk And it's like well how how can I answer questions? You know and not have to deal with trolls and all this bullshit that comes along with it I just want to answer it be done and then go to the next so I can help more people by doing that And so this the website started is just the Q and A and then have a store and then After that then people started asking about products and stuff like that so the drive is coming from This is this is what the gym is made me who I am the good parts and the bad parts You know and it can help a lot of other people as we all know Otherwise we wouldn't be doing the things that we're doing So how can I give access to that 12 year old kid that 13 year old kid who was me or who is you know now and not have to have them go through a And paywall and all this other stuff to get good information But they need to be serious about what they do Thus it needs to be one of their top priorities to actually yield the kind in other words They need to earn their way kind of like you used to back in the day You know they got earn their way into the better contact, you know then when they find it That's what's there so that is been the vision from the very beginning the tricky part was how do you pay for it? Right because now you if you're gonna have you know at one point time we were putting out 62 articles of mud And that was you know before Social media and we had training logs and we had Q and A's we would do Around 4,000 Q and A's a month on average There was somewhere between 6 and 800 blog posts between the training logs and coaching blogs every single month and then 62 articles Where in some This that's a lot of editing that's a lot of programming You know, that's a lot of things to go into that how's that paid for? And that's where the product come in where content's changed Obviously a lot in 25 years We're now contents more expensive Right because now you need video people you need you know it's it's a dip now it's becoming a different Spear because the cost of Contacts is probably five times higher than it's ever been With the revenue not being five times more so now it's like with the podcast How do we find sponsors that can offset some of this cost but not take over all of the cost So I can't tell them to cough You know, I don't want to be held into anybody You know, so yeah, if there's that and then other means to be able to produce it But the division hasn't changed it's how The content has you know the the way it's being produced and how it's being tracked and how it's being Because you you still have to figure out is this providing a return Because most of it doesn't but isn't providing enough of where we turn to at least just pay for the content Is it hard because it's constantly changing like more like every year it feels like there's a new App or new whatever out there is hard to keep up with yeah Yes, I mean as far as what the message is no Where to put the message yes because the message requires you know There's so many social media channels. Yeah, it's there's a different dynamic when it's a company that you're running instead of an Individual where if it's an individual that does their own online coaching or whatever it is They're posting their own Instagram. They're posting their own Facebook. They're doing their own YouTube Maybe they're outsourcing editing on whatever it is per video and it's it's all them doing it right so they're They're only cost they can opportunity cost right now if you have to take that and say to yourself Okay, now I need to hire a guy to do YouTube and that's probably gonna be 45 50 Now that person probably isn't gonna want to do Instagram and all the other stuff so who's gonna handle all those things? Yeah, you know, and it's like God damn you know at what point in time You know and then when you're when you're a company everybody's quotes are ten times higher because they think you make way more than you really do sure You know, so it's it's crazy you know with I've had quotes just to be able to strip the podcast clips in shorts Yeah, $4,000 per podcast good God good God, you know, like there's no way that's gonna no that's an outlier Yeah, you know it's it's different because you got it for those that are doing it themselves You need to ask now if you were to hire somebody how would that look? Right, so then that's the space so then it's like what where do they put it and then if it is your own personal Instagram Are you really gonna let somebody actually post on that Because I won't yeah, I went on post on the company one But if it's my personal one hell no I don't care if they're contractor who they are they're not didn't get in there and Have access to that yeah, hey, if I got to tell you man. I didn't realize first of all I I'd always seen a leap as being I thought the equipment was the main thing and that the education was in addition to that That number one but and I don't want to make this about me, but I I know you don't know my story But I do want to take just a minute to share that I Had gotten clean and recovery from drugs in alcohol 2005 and I had no-in body building as a kid But I came back to it at that time and it had done so much for me That my goal had become to to help to share that with other people so they could have their own version of the experience I had and and through that I started to Q&A and then I got to get paid for that Q&A And eventually that became a podcast and that became Many podcasts and that's evolved into what we're doing today. It's it really just strikes me as being a Similar drive and everything you're talking about about where you're at now Those are the steps I'm trying to work toward are I'm looking this year, you know, how do I how do I pay people to do things because When you do you couldn't do everything you're doing yourself and I you know I saw the studio you guys had set up in the gym. I saw all your equipment Man, I saw your people walking around shooting stuff like that literally blew me away The level you've been able to take it to and that's that's where I want to get It's been amazing just to see that and I can see like you wouldn't be able to do it yourself You just wouldn't you have to have the network you have and having the skills To manage all the people that you have to manage it's it's very impressive man. It's very cool Yeah, there's not we have less staff than you think okay. There's definitely under 15 But where I'm very blessed and fortunate is You know she and who's our senior contact manager? It should be with us every 10 years Yeah, I mean may you know and our customer service has been with me 10 years sales are up as many 10 years You know a warehouse manager is 10 years so I got enough people that have been with me for a long enough period of time That they're they're great people you know and and and without them we wouldn't be able to do anything That the fastest turning department is definitely contact 100% You know, so that that's always hard You know to find people that are gonna stick and and a lot of that now can be outsourced This far is editing and stuff like that and the outsourcing of that can be done cheaper than actually having a higher and Employee but you lose certain control if it's always evolving let's put it that way So yes, you're gonna be frustrated. I'm sure you are now. It's gonna always stay that way Yeah, never changes Yeah, and then YouTube throws a curve ball at you and takes all your money away for swearing Can you know my pushback on that is you shouldn't be completely dependent upon what the YouTube I agree you know that's got to be a piece of it because that can go away Yeah, you know even a spot any of the sponsors that I have can go away Yeah, you know, so how how's that always and this is my paranoid self, right? This is the where John would step in right and it's like how can this still work if all of that went away? Yeah, yeah, how does it still go right because that that's the lowest hanging part that needs to move And it's it's I used to try to keep double people in content So if somebody was sick or quit I had somebody used to back up You know that was a good idea for a while but it destroys a culture You know, so it's always evolving so there's the internal Part of the content which nobody sees which is kind of good sometimes Then there's the external which is what everybody does see yeah, you know and that's that's Finding ways to keep that Row of it to your target market Yeah, yeah, and and and and and I think the big thing to is for me is not Compromising with the vision, you know because there are I mean sometimes we may talk about things that won't necessarily Be able to be monetized and that's okay because it's important to us to keep the vision the way we keep it You know versus trying to change to please a sponsor or to please youtuber whatever else, you know So we can still swear I just want to make sure of course of course if we have to we have to They've asked you Yeah, it's after three to five minutes where yeah, I've had to work on it I've had to work on it to because I've seen a couple of the Podcast clips, you know a couple of them will do well. Yeah, you know other ones I'm like man what happened here? Yeah, you know, you said the F word and like are you kid man? Oh, yeah, this is like zero because of this Like just honestly I would like I don't know if I'd want those listeners if they get turned off like dropping an F bomb here and there like come on It's not the listeners. It's the it's the platform not pushing it because of it Yeah, yeah, and that's where the monetization thing comes in because if you're not monetized then the platform doesn't push you anymore. Yeah, you know They push the content that they know they can make money off of Do you guys have anything else we want to talk about? Yeah What was your favorite or hardest workout and one of your compounds and who was it with? The hardest one was by myself and That was it's good to have it that way because I know I can verify I'm watching a few videos Dave to know It was it was on a leg day and It was I got in that stupid mindset kind of like the bells what thing you were talking about On a leg on the leg press and it was I was I was Hiss going in frustrated going in and it's just one thing let you another and wait and let you another I mean was There were probably seven different challenge sets throughout the training session Then I decided that out of everything the leg press was the hardest so I was gonna go do that again Which was like an upset with a strip set and all this other stuff and Then after I got done with that I passed out and woke up in my own feces You're it this was the greatest thing and I called John and I think it was like on a Wednesday night or something I like dude you ain't gonna believe it happened So I'm playing this all out and like I just woke up in my own shit Is that I remember saying you want me to send you a picture? No Me a picture and then he started to lecture me about you're never allowed to train your legs by yourself You're lucky you didn't die yeah And um, but that I that was by far something I don't ever want to repeat again because when That Saturday whoever came out was a nurse and I'm telling the stories I think it's all cool Michigan It all to me like no you you were almost dead Wasn't dead I wasn't here right now But that that was probably the one that tops the chart because if I've ever gone too far it was that Whew I could say I just want to say for the right Do not Is this you should try to see someone that does his day flu like especially like if you know you're going in and it's you know Saturday You're having a leg day with someone that you know is equal to the challenge Would you start thinking about it like Friday morning Friday at Friday night like it be on your mind and It was almost it was like an anxiety that was building It was almost like a relief just to do the damn thing because you'd aren't on something similar to that Maybe the week before but maybe attacking a new weight or a new a new Personal best or something like that For for the bodybuilding hyper to be training now. I don't know about things like that and so I was in there Now for a strength work That's where it's going. Yeah, yeah, if it's um And if I'm in a peaking phase or pushing and I and there's something that it's not just training it's gonna require More mental effort Then and focus and what we needed. I'm probably thinking about that for at least a week before or maybe Me too You know some of the bigger ones it's all year You know, so there's always something each year that I know is gonna take me year to be able to get to You know because it has to be phasic so you got to you know There has to be downtime to ask re-plushes and then you you're not gonna get where you need to get in one push It needs to come down push back So checks and balances so those lifts and there's usually two or three that I have each year I mean there they they are to be done sometime between October and December You know, so like year and goals if you will The only difference between the way that I train those now compared to when I was powerlifting is I don't have a set gay A parlor than you have a meat the other competition you have a set day. Yeah, my day can float by three months So if I'm too beat up I can back down I don't have to force it We're most of my injuries that I've accumulated because we're always because I was forcing to be able to get Something on a said date where that date could have just pushed You know a week two weeks three weeks God, and then I wouldn't have had to push through I could have trained around and um so I have that That's the way I kind of structure my training now So there are some and usually the squats and one that's gonna require more focus than anything Most most the training that's just Checking the boxes You know, but then the other ones yeah requires focus and I love that without that I wouldn't I don't know what I did Yeah Now sometimes with the things with John it was a trying to think of and I know he was probably doing the same Like what can we do that's gonna be more brutal than what we did before yeah You know and that's That became a little bit more challenging and then That also becomes challenging because they johns backs messed up I go against lower backs messed up so now we have this off this off this off this off Any kind of structure around that So I pivoting so well we'll have one we have one more question for you and I think it was Andrew I think you came up with this one was what was one thing about life that you learned from Louis Simmons You know we you've gotten to tell us a lot about just how influential he had been to you It sounds like in business and in training just do so many areas And you know it's like kind of a big one to just drop on you No, it's um Louis had the same basically you live by your own sword, you know, so I mean he If anybody lived by his own code He did bar nut so it was more of What what would be my code? You know that I want to live by and stain I don't want to stay staying within the rails because I think that was a fault of his You know that he stayed too within his own rails that all the time But they still have that focus on who you are and embracing who you are But maybe add a passing lane You know instead of just having a one lane road You know have one What would it have? passing lane you know just to dodge some things here and there and Because that man's focus on who he was his strengths his faults He knew and he was 100% fine with it and he didn't give age What anybody else thought in one way or another way to a point that I it's an admirable and I admire it But and I I want that But there needs to be some flexibility Because it's misinterpreted right so he he lived in a bubble I live in a bubble so I for me to sit here and say he lived in a bubble is a big thing But he did he lived in a in a in a very very very tight bubble Which is a decent thing when Your your more out in the industry I think you need to have a passing lane You know because otherwise you know too many things are gonna be misunderstood misconstrued or just You know that so it you knew the the other thing I learned from him In the opposite thing was to to know your bias And understand that there's other ways Right to to him there's one there's one way it has white right And he's allowed to have that bias Strykin Louis Simmons right that's kind of like like you know this like like 10 likesner was you know a hit guy He's allowed to have that bias he's like the hit guy, you know and remember gardens like the hit guy is allowed to have that bias But when when I'm looking and seeing those other people in the industry and then I see I have a bias Yeah, and I don't I don't sell training. I don't sell programming. I want to show people how they can become there's lots of ways You get where you want to go I want to show all those different ways because I've used a lot of different ones I need to be very cognitive of my bias where he he wasn't it's like fuck off They don't know what they're doing You know and but he and his spirit and his art he truly truly believed that yeah So it's that was the one thing I learned from the opposite end Like don't be so biased that you don't see Everything else that's going on Because in an industry where there needs to be a abundance You know and an abundance mindset this is one way to really limit you really quick That's wild Good advice too.
