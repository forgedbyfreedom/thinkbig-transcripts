What's up guys? Welcome back to Think Big Bodybuilding Media. I'm Scott McNally and of course I am back finally We've got Stevenson. This is our hundredth episode man We have a bunch of studies that we're gonna look at we actually have a series A many series if you will over the next three episodes. Scott's gonna bring us studies. This today is going to be about training specifically About to turn it over to him after that we do have One question from one of our patreon members. So we're gonna tackle this stuff. We're gonna hit that question at the end And then if you guys have any questions about anything we talk about today We were considering doing this episode and then doing a follow-up to do questions about the episode and then from there Getting into the next batch of studies So I Right to sit back and listen to you professor. Oh, I should also mention to we're brought to you by true nutrition.com So all right, what's up man? It's been a long time. This is our hundredth episode Well, yeah, you climbed out of the COVID pit so yeah, yeah, it wasn't an intentional like let's build the Expansion and for the hundredth episode there was no choice in the matter. It's I'm degree. Yeah, so I'm glad you're back brother I'll glad to be back. Yeah, thank you man. Yeah, yeah still recover in speaking of trainer nutrition. Yeah, yeah, I know You know I was gonna say I mentioned I I don't know if you follow it on Instagram I just started a facetious Sort of Hashtagging of the serial gains nation. I see that yeah, yeah, yeah, so that's what I'm doing post workout is a box of cereal That's kind of my standard and people are slowly There's slowly joining the nation which takes in people from all creeds and colors anywhere around the world world world Nation so to speak I just call it that because people use the nation thing all the time so I thought it sounds funny Yeah, but I actually I'm using true nutrition stuff for my protein. Oh, oh my way, excellent I thought it's gonna say Dante was making cereal now Lucky Charles. Oh, but he should I know right, though they got some of the protein cereals. There's the cereal there's Matt Porter has one. Oh, yeah, I have Porter proved And then there's another School yard cereal or some shit like that. They send me text messages all the time, but those are good Yeah, and we do accept people who are dieting who want to be part of the cereal gains nation If they want to use those cereals that's are like zero carb. Well, that's fine You can join you're not considered a second class medicine of the cereal gains nation Just your veggies your proteins based cereal. I like cool. Yeah, we're when do you come out with the shirts? When you come out with the shirts cereal gains names Like yeah, it's a guy Nick wearing I think I say his name. He trains it that they the Derek Oslo's gym where I've been training and Nick is I think the number five ranked Competitive eater in the world. Okay. I think it's what he told me Yeah, but he does the Nathan's hot dog challenge all the kind of shit. Okay, the badass body builder too, but He's sort of our poster boy. Oh, yeah, so I was shout out to Nick if you watch this He did a three boxes of lucky charms Challenge on it for St. Patrick's day the green ones and make your milk green. Oh my god What took you like run a half an hour something like that he's a monster So we'll see I'm I'm trying like I suggested this to him. This will be on his he and his is girlfriend Mickey. She's the number one female ranked competitor in the world. She's just ridiculous that house is a powerhouse Find her She's just I just watched a thing she would did the the big Texan and Albuquerquey and she ate two of them in just over an hour you're kidding get the thing free I did it like 52 minutes long time ago, okay, and she just nonchalantly eats there's no mess There's no no efforts just like sat there and just take the two of them maybe we should have her We should have the two of them on and get some get some insight, you know, I'm pushing our cereal and take up how that works I mean, and I have been talking shop about that all the time Like all the stuff they do I'm getting insight as the how those people can train to do that Yeah, she's just she's just an actual She literally the food even tastes good to her Yeah, whereas he doesn't have like the biggest stomach. He just not get he's just got a strong strong mentality So we can push himself through yeah, and that's what makes him as good as he is to some degree obviously He's got some gifts otherwise, but she's I don't I haven't asked him this but she might be better than him on all the events in general I don't know she's the best in the world among the among the women well you definitely have to be able to eat cereal You got to be able to eat period in order to grow But you also have to know how to train what are we what are what's what's what's our game plan for today? So There's so often this is sort of trial always trying to sort of bridge the gap between the bros you think science sucks and Not a scientist don't have that reciprocal sort of feeling about the bros, but there's a connection there as I say that the science that happens What a quote in the ivory tower is in the divert tower is in the same universe It's in the same town as the gym where the bros for your things out So I wanted to put together just some basic research studies That confirm the things that the bros know about a variety of things that we've sort of figured out It's infiltrated into our mindset and some of it just from empirical learning a little bit of dash of science You're but give some solidity to that and then also add a little bit of nuance to that information as well Through the science is out there That's the whole point of science is not just like you know generate all these data and published this so it can be Lodge the way in a you know in the library somewhere You know deep in the animals of Google scholar or PubMed instead it's to be used by people So I'm trying to like take the information say here's some usable stuff Apply this and this can help you be a better body builder. So yeah We got it's kind of a three part series today is gonna be training Think next week we'll do some drug related stuff and there's also nutrition related stuff So sort of grouping of just a few studies The all sort the information sort of converge onto a general idea related to training drugs and Nutrition so today's training okay so with that You can pull we got just three four main slides in the summary slide to pull that first one up All right, look at it here now this is not the summary side correct you want the actual the first one Says damage with dissection Damage with discretion or discretion oh I can't yeah, I got to get closer in order to read that Does it fill the whole screen? I like people will be able to read it or see let me make sure I get it out of here. We'll be able to but boom we are full screen mode at this point. Okay cool So a couple things There's the basic idea that we know People know like any trainer knows this sometimes trainers don't pay attention to this but first time you come in the training If I'm in training for while you've never trained before you'll get really really sore And then the next time you train those muscle groups There's something called a repeated bout effect or protective effect of that previous injurious bout So you don't get a sore the next time. Yeah, so you do come in and do like 10 sets of squats You have been training you're gonna be just annihilated but if you've been deep in training for months You try to do 10 sets of squats that's still held the workout but you won't be nearly as critical otherwise. Yeah, so keep that keep that in mind so First study for people first thing to kind of people look at it's in the upper left here Okay, and the idea that has been put forth in many acute studies and it does make sense Is that each time you train you turn on muscle protein synthesis You can measure that after training and To the extent and muscle protein synthesis and breakdown generally go hand in hand As one goes up so it is the other so they're kind of directly related and the idea of course is its synthesis will exceed breakdown Yeah, so You break down the muscle so to speak with the training and you incur the injury and then you have more synthesis than breakdown And because of that you accumulate muscle protein and the muscle cells get bigger Yeah, maybe you can get more of them if our five relationships and play so The thing that was interesting is when people started measuring Muscle protein synthesis like at the beginning of a training period and then looking to see if that was predictive of how much growth Someone got over the training period the correlations were atrocious Okay, it was basically like you're not you're not predictive at all like nothing Yeah, not significant you know around zero negative numbers in fact if you look in that and this won't be hard to see I apologize I wanted kind of make this simple people might be able to screen capture and zoom in and this particular study This was Domus that I talked about this on the podcast I leave before they measured my my Fabular protein synthesis beginning of this training period 12 weeks long and when they looked at how much growth was a vote over the course of the training The training period the correlation was negative point two to one wow So and it was non-significance so that means nothing so perfect one to one correlation to our value the correlation is one Zero means there's no association whatsoever between the two things you're looking at so it was zilch So that doesn't seem the maxis idea that if you turn on protein synthesis really robustly That and you do that every day over the course of your training period you're gonna get the most muscle growth Because that day one there was no correlation between what eventually happened weeks down the road But if they waited till week three Which is you're getting past that you're getting that repeated about effect in play that protective effect is there Now you're not nearly as sore and the injury isn't quite as obvious you're not like You're not doing the comacasi when you go to sit on the toilet where like holy shit just dive bombing Cause your legs hurt so much. Yeah, yeah Once you're past that in week three then the measured protein synthesis and you can see in that graph and what I've written there is that in week three and then at the end of the training After your past that initial period of all the sort of champagne Then the correlation is like point nine Super strongly correlated that's really that's actually a really really really impressive correlation That means that literally about 80% of the variance in as to how much someone's gonna grow Can be explained by the protein synthetic Effect of the of the training balance which makes sense biologically yeah, were you trying to protein synthesis the more you grow So what's going on there initially Such that the correlation is for not well That's when people are getting sore Couple things I've talked about it in one way is that you've got so much damage That your protein synthesis is and there's some limits there of course is just going to try to keep up with the damage that you've Encouraged and that the other way of looking at that the other side of that same coin is that because you it's your it's new And novelty when you get so so sore there's so much injury the muscle protein breakdown is really substantial So even if you had a strong protein synthetic the fact from a training bow if you're starting off and you're fresh And you you get really really sore you've got so much muscle protein breakdown that it doesn't amount to much Yeah, and the thing we know from the muscle soreness literature is the training Soreness and muscle breakdowns all over the place I get sore really really easily I mentioned John Meadows and someone who doesn't tend to get sore and he's grown really well with he I just talked to him like a week or so ago and He reminded me that when he made his like a big growth spurt when he started putting intro workouts in Back in the day and people thought it was a shield, you know the way he said that but it's what he's experienced He wasn't getting sore whatsoever It's best growth Decades into training happened with no muscle soreness really whatsoever And it was associated with that intro workout That he was that he was for Teenation I think they had the I can't worth the name of the product was but John was sort of the poster boy for that. Okay, so So this tells us that being super duper sore is not really the greatest thing right Because what you're evoking there acutely isn't contributing to the long-term gains which is what we want muscle mass yeah, so doing too much Isn't the best thing so the next study here if you look to the right you'll see a couple plots This is a very like literally in the title of the of the of the publication they put the no gain no gain no pain no gain is there Because they wanted to see what would happen If you did what smart personal trainers do and start somebody off with really really Lower intensity lower volume training initially Yeah, which will still get that protective effect You do just a little bit step just do like one set of squats one set of what whatever You'll get a maybe a little bit of soreness, but nothing over the top and ease your way into training What does that mean? Do you have to blast into training and then just blast through that first three or four weeks two or three weeks? Can you still grow So take a look at the Right most plot there and you can see I've written red of void damage Those are that's a plot showing Create and kinase in the two groups that they had so one group Spent three weeks easing their way in as far as training volume and you can see them the left plot If you look on the right plot The bottom line there that's that's below that dotted line across the graph That shows the creatinine levels in the blood of that group the group that ease their way in So creatin kinates gets released from damage muscle you get the inflammation the plasma membrane the cell membrane becomes porous An enzymes leak out like creatin kinase. So that's a traditional marker muscle damage Basically using that that level that they've got dotted there which is suggestive of Muscle injury they avoided that all the way through for the eleven weeks of training that they did Now look at the other plot that's above that one for much of those eleven weeks in the fourth week That group came in and And they wanted to try to accrue as much volume over that over the as the other group Until the end of the training period so they did higher volume In each of those weeks to try to get the same amount of training done essentially and the creatin kinase went sky high You can see that the first plot is like that rest that's the baseline no training and then for the next one two three four weeks They're creating kinase with sky high because they were killing them Okay, it all it took like four weeks for them to bring that creatin kinase now. So they were sores Jesus In those first four weeks and finally got into control well what happened did the the that group we just went for broke Get any better did they grow any better did they get any any stronger? No, so look at the bottom there the increase in quad size for the no pain group It's just been like three extra weeks easing their way in was a think was about six and a percent in the group that really pushed it 7 a percent that's basically the same The increase in strength that they showed in the training exercises the ones that they measure I think it may be a leg press Was basically 25% 26% for each okay, so You can as long as you spend some time easing your way in you're gonna get the same gains Had going through that period of crazy soreness Doesn't help As long as you give yourself a little bit of extra time to ease your way into the training because you do that and just one or two weeks I would bet you would that protective effect can happen and just one in one bout you could probably go three or four bouts of Sub-damaging and elicit that in the way they did because by the fourth or fifth or six weekend They're they're doing the same work essentially as the other group that was that was sort of playing catch up and Sory shit for like a mug Well, before they finally brought the muscle damage down in the last few weeks of the training yeah, so The proofs in the pudding like you can grow just as well without destroying yourself That's exactly what John experienced yes best best drug out being extra sore and from the first study and in this slide it shows That's sorness when you're when you're breaking into a program when you're really sore like that The muscle protein synthesis which is which is what you want to make happen for growth Huge correlation after the sorness is gone if you're super sore you're wasting it Yeah, having too much break down and or the protein synthesis is just playing catch up listen to I got to tell you two man. I feel like that's something I wish I understood sooner I think about I think about like leg training where I had Destroied my legs so bad so hard it would take forever to get them to recover Whereas did I really have to Do what I did and I found that if I do less I can get better growth now today I it's just a thing man where I feel like we all want to just freaking kill ourselves so hard on everything You know, I mean it's like if if a gram is good or a 500 milligrams is good then a gram has to be better in two grams has to be magic You know, I mean Well, here's the thing too like and this points and we're gonna get into this today actually as well Okay, is instead of doing you know 20 sets for your legs or 15 sets Yeah, let's say 15 once a week and you just destroy yourself and you spend the next you know three or four days soar Which can happen that protective effect is also variable some people have it strongly I'm always sore. I just tend to get sore What about doing five sets On Monday five sets on Wednesday and five sets on Friday. Yeah with a higher frequency That's gonna avoid the soreness Yeah, then if you think about it in the context of this first study You're never you're never Basically digging the hole. Yes, much in terms of the breakdown and The using up your protein synthesis with this monstrous workout instead you're getting workouts that are stimulating Yeah, and avoid and making sure that that protein synthesis is directed towards a Crueying muscle size over the course of your training period and makes total sense living your mesocyte Yeah, so yeah, avoiding so you're Exactly right. This is this is why for some people higher frequency stops gonna work better Because you get the same training volume in and Vaunt. There's a dose response with training volume 15 sets once a week versus five sets three times a week Check my math three times five 15 to same training volume yeah, so but there's more new ones to that so like sometimes the studies Don't suggest we're gonna get it this actually okay just a second year that the frequency doesn't always play So that's a good segue Scott hey what's going on guys?

Let's get back to the program Let's pull up let's put the next slide. All right got it And So's big picture programming? Yes Okay, so On the left there I've got a study which I've referred to previously And I talked about this so this was there's some Brazilians involved I think I think Stu I sure have stuf those was on this one or not but So Brazilian group that's done a lot of this work that I'm talking about here today and what they want to do is test the effect of Frequency is sort of the way they catch it but literally was also volume and they use this one leg Training method this this model for Examining muscle growth which I think is just brilliant. That's yeah actually what I used in my dissertation We just trained one leg and use the other leg as a control so it's kind of like It's basically like having twins you've got one trend that gets one treatment and the other twin gets the other treatment either no treatment or a Different treatment in this case Every person in the study Train one leg five times a week and The other leg either twice or three times a week so they literally had three training conditions But the cool thing is is that you got you don't have to have that many subjects Because one leg is getting trained five times a week Yeah, the other leg is getting trained for a lower frequency and which was in this case also a lower volume So each workout was just three sets of knee extensions taking a failure in the nine to 12 rep Range and they were progressively increasing so And these were these were on Untrained individuals so That plot there that is on the left side that shows the increase in in this case the bassist ladder Alice muscle which is your lateral quad With an MRI they measured size there and it increased in all cases whether it was trained Five times a week which is 15 sets Or two or three times a week which is six or nine sets and it was a progressive increase and that shows just the different plots for those different training Conditions and there was no difference it did not make a difference whatsoever Whether it was five times a week or two or three times a week on average okay? So when you average everything together and that's what happens This is sort of the beauty of science is you can take those averages and Without knowing anything about the individual other than he is among the population of people studied in that study Those averages and the statistics that we use to evaluate those averages allow you to predict what you might expect on average For an individual who matches those subject characteristics Yeah, but it's not gonna tell you exactly because everyone's a snowflake right everyone's different yeah To some degree and So that's what they did. I'm gonna get to that in just a second, but I've got a one more study Which was really very cool as well that they did and it ties in as well so They asked the question and this is same group they had I believe these were trained individuals. Okay, pretty cool because They made some made some growth here. They took them and Had one leg train just basically essentially the same way or they were doing leg presses and And knee extensions and they did Four sets of leg presses and four sets of knee extensions that nine to twelve rep max range okay with one leg and then the other leg they did Four different workouts so they're training four times a week So somewhere in the middle of their previous study So in one of the in general there is more volume and they wrote to these three these four workouts and I'm not gonna go through all the details But one of them included a high rep day Where they are doing like I think like 15 to 25 reps per sets There was another day where they did a little more volume. They did 12 sets of volume on as a versus just the Eight yeah the other leg which is the control leg that leg got eight sets the same every workout And then they also had some eccentric only reps So They were having they were lifting and then letting them just lower the weight so really focusing on the eccentric Which is gonna create more soreness But you get more tension there and we'll talk more about why I expect you to support and so they were they're Employing what a lot of people do which is a great way to keep variety in your training You don't go on the gym every single day into the same damn thing. Yeah, okay leg press Extensions same rep range same number sets that'll bore the shit out of you said they mix it up and what happened there Was if you look on the right There was a little bit more my my favorite approach in synthesis in the variable group which's on the right Where they buried the workouts versus the control just a little bit So you would expect that you know in there they had enough subjects of the head good statistical power and that might increase Mean that more protein synthesis at the end and they measured this at the end of the training period Yeah, would mean more growth that's kind of what the other story said he told us with the 90% It but however if you look on the left plot there Those are the individual plot individual points for the left leg and the right leg of all the subjects And the bar graph are the averages that's behind there. Okay the change in bass and slider all CSA was Literally dead on it's like 7.5 7.8 percent exactly the same So the variation didn't matter and Even though they had a little more muscle protein synthesis with the very very training where they changed things up every training day So let's go to the next slide so you're telling me that not changing it up was just about as effective Yeah, changing it up far as as far as yeah increasing muscle size. Yes, okay Even though there's a little more protein synthesis Yeah, that was brought about from what they could tell so that tells us that's a strong correlation But it's not the entire picture Okay, I got the next slide no to it Okay cool and that's just leave that one there, but no to the in the variable group They were doing one of their days with x-centrics only okay terms of the reps That'll make you sore it that's a lot of damage. Oh, I see there. Yeah Can make you sore so Looking at this next slide here So here's what's interesting So This is that same study on the left here and the question is sort of is more volume better So looking at that same study that we've been talking about here just now Is they look at the muscle protein synthesis versus the total training volume And there was a slight correlation there They added up the training volume over the eight weeks. That's the plot on the upper left the right most one that's labeled e Okay nice correlation there. It's 0.355 It was significant They looked at the training total training volume in the in the 17th sessions so near the end and the protein synthesis was greater as a function of the training volume So when you every time you train there's going to be an increase in protein synthesis and also an increase in protein breakdown And those generally go hand in hand Muscle protein breakdown is almost never measured. It's very methodologically difficult to do that So it's sort of like this It's like the dark pattern version and then this realm of exercise physiology or like we kind of like there's we know that that's going on But usually is not measured So here's the interesting thing Look on the bottom left there Okay If you plot the eight week total training volume and we know training volume turned on protein synthesis more From everything I've just mentioned If you look at training volume Versus the change in quad cross or vases later Alice across sectional area there was a negative correlation So the more people tend to the train the less they grew Okay, which which suggest that even though more volume turns on More protein synthesis more so More volume can also be excessive Yeah Train too much you turn on break down too much so the black matter portion of our equation the muscle Protein breakdown can be excessive yeah to the point where you don't have a positive protein balance I've been there with matter so I know if had those workouts those weeks very first study So I don't believe they looked at muscle soreness Or gather that or measure it But from the first slide we see that too much we are sore Does not vote well for making gains? Yeah, so more total training volume is a stronger stimulus you can see that from more protein synthesis But what matters is the balance of synthesis versus You have to have a positive protein balance and in this case apparently that was not the case More training volume generally speaking meant less muscle growth yeah in this study So the train volume didn't really help Or the variety didn't really help if there was a little bit more training volume just by the way they set that out Just a test of tad I think it was like literally like four or five percent in reading the text Okay, and it increased protein synthesis a little bit so a little bit of variation in the workouts were totally different But the training volume was just about the same the way they quantified it I really didn't two exercises this wasn't a Function of like you know do you count a bench press as a a tricep exercise? You know sometimes there's an issue with counting training volume Whether it's an isolation or a compound This was just leg press and Using the same exercise leg press and the extensions they just Verried the sets the number of reps and the set configuration okay, so So a little bit of training variety of training variety like mix it up Adds a little bit of volume doesn't really do much for you fact it can make it such there's too much volume so Remember the study where they trained one leg five times a week and they have the leg either two or three times a week Yes on average it didn't matter the growth was the same on average Well those same brilliant researchers I forgot I love that they did this they went back and they re-evaluated the individual data Okay, so On the right side of the slide there you see Um, it's figuring with two plots and the one on the left shows the two the training volume For the high frequency five times a week Versus the lower frequency and what they did is they just took those two or three times a week and just consider those as one So they kind of made that one condition for comparison purposes Okay, there's basically everything was the same there So on the left you see obviously five times a week much more training volume and On the right two or three times a week much less training volume all those plots from the high volume or high frequency to the low volume low frequency go from go from high to low But what happened in terms of muscle size and I've covered this one on a few podcasts and here Here's one of them and we've actually had this up as the slide previously this right most plot Those are the individual data points for changes in muscle size In the vassus ladder LS they're all over the place yeah, so If you look look on the upper right and saw there's uh there's some words written over there I kind of had to cover it up There is the person there who had a Changing quad cross or vast lettuce cross section area that was about 20% in the high frequency And they're the highest plot on the right most set of dots They're at nearly 30% for the low frequency So that person they responded really really well 20% increase in size Is phenomenal growth yeah for a couple months of training 30% is just off the charts yeah But they did significantly better from a practical standpoint with low volume Versus the higher volume okay, but they they responded really well and either So that for them From high frequency to low frequency if the the line goes up Yeah, but if you look at all those a lot of those lines going from left to right the line goes down Those are people who did better with the high frequency high volume and not nearly as well With the low frequency low volume and then when they went and looked at it It was very interesting about one third of the people did better with high frequency high volume One third did better with low frequency low volume and one third it didn't matter The growth responses were about the same when they broke it down But they didn't compare just to be clear they didn't compare high frequency low volume though that's not on here Right? No because the way they set their training up because a good question. I'm glad you asked that Is that they did five days a week and it was three sets each training Training session I see for that okay, and then we up so like imagine you're going unless so your left leg is getting hit five times a week You're going in Monday and you're trained the left leg and then you train the right leg the same and then Tuesday You're going in just train the left leg. Yeah, and then then you go in Wednesday and just train the left leg Yeah, if you're in the two times a week it might go in Thursday and train the left leg and the right leg And then you go in Friday and train the left leg. Okay, just three sets each time So they couched it as training frequency but volume was also Also very here so at another way to do that would be exactly what what I suggest people do like what I mentioned before You take those 15 sets and spread them out over three workouts as opposed to putting them in one yeah, but this this This study they did not do that that's another way to configure the study which is a great way to do it It's a better way to evaluate Frequency in and of itself. Yes, I want to basically evaluate it Both frequency and volume Yeah, that's why I keep saying those things together because they didn't distinguish between the two five times a week is both high frequency and high volume Two times or three times a week is both lower frequency and lower volume gotcha So so one third did better with the higher frequency high volume one third Dirt did better with the lower frequency low volume and one third did didn't matter they're equally equally effective for this duration of this training program But look at the Worth or the dots are there are some people that are down close to zero There's if you look on the right at the lowest point on the right set of points on that right most plot there There's somebody who had a negative increase in size for the lower frequency Yeah, the very bottom there's a couple isn't there? There's just one that there's one person who had basically just barely broke above zero Okay That would that dotted line there is worth what they sort of considered non-responsiveness. I see I see did not respond to Frequency or low frequency Gotcha he was the only non-responder to both training modes both training volume slash frequencies But the the other guy who didn't get anything out of the low frequency He actually did okay got about 7% Right just from I balling the graph there with the high frequency So he was This is where people would say You may be a non-responder to a given training regime But you're not an absolute non-responder. There's something you can find something that's gonna work. Yeah So there's only one instance in this study where that person was According to the two ways that that person trained five times a week or either two or three I don't know which that person was that poor that poor saw did you grow from anything? Yeah, you worked So I mean that must have really sucked right you know to go through all of that But who knows there may have been other things we're gonna get in a nutrition In another podcast okay that plays a big role too and they weren't paying attention to that So this is just the training So this is very cool stuff this this basically in the bottom line here I've written there is that growth is highly variable generally So some people like the one can you imagine this like the guy who had like the you know The what is it about 27% increase on the lower frequency and like 20% of he's the best responder overall for sure He like he could have gone in twice a week gone in twice a week can imagine this like this so here's a scenario You've got that that guy who any of those two bottom ones who basically got just over zero or literally mathematically negative muscle growth from training twice a week and they happen to be training partners That guy got 27% training He twice a week yeah, like that's like he just blew them out of the water Like he's gonna be like this was only I think eight weeks of training So that's 16 workouts like he's seeing a one more than a one and a half like a one and a half Percent increase in size Every time comes in yeah, that's crazy. It's quite gonna look bigger every time he goes in the gym And the other guy is getting nothing Zilch Zipo not a yeah He's just like dead in the water as far as muscle growth goes so that's what happens with people are genetically gifted They outpaced their peers usually right from the get go But the the good thing here is well one to know that there's a highly variable Some people are just genetically gifted but the big thing is that like for some of those if you look at some of those lines Of the most slanted like I'm looking at one now It's about 22% with high frequency and Looks like about seven percent with low frequency So like that's a that's a threefold difference basically High frequency high volume is the way to go for that person. That's gonna work for them But there are other people Who are very much the opposite? They didn't do well at all with the with the high frequency high volume is too much So what this kind of points to is that or Mesa's curve and I know folks can't see me now, but actually I'm in the adaptation they can see you Think it's the graph too. Yeah. Oh Awesome. Thank you your your the man So thank you you increase volume in this case vis-a-vis higher frequency training and Everyone if then have their own relationship between where they get the optimal growth It's okay with so for some people if you plot it like one times a week versus two versus three versus four versus five They peeked twice a week that'd be the best the best way to train for them At least for this muscle in particular or one particular muscle Um Let's hear I'm getting messages about my CPU being hot. Oh, I'll lose it Yeah, you broke up a couple times you broke up a couple times but we're following a long stuff So but someone else might find that peak if they were with for their exam and then test out over time One two three four five six They'd even seven times a week They're gonna do best at four or five Yeah, so you gotta you gotta figure that out for yourself And that's what this study is just so it's worth reiterating again and again and again and again because Not it's like fortitude training for instance, you know, it's a they're had the basic by two frequency versions in there For this reason it's only three and four You know, but two might be better for some people so you can take the program and spread out the days if you want But I also have three volume tiers Yeah, this reason because I knew this before this study came out But this study just is the best one that I know of substantiating this very notion that there's so much individuality And so you gotta figure out what works for you you can't some people could train with the highest volume tier in my program Others do the best from the lowest volume tier And the thing that that I also have set up and this is why this is an aside, but it relates Is auto regulating your how you when you blast and cruise So some people for them They hire free push you higher volume and they can handle they might blast along and try to progress for five or six weeks For they take a break Whereas someone else training at that frequency They take a break more often Because they tend to like basically backside If they if they keep going with that frequency and volume and that's the thing they did this and one of the studies from the Previous slides, but what you don't always see what we don't always know Over the course of eight 12 16 weeks Is what happened to some people so someone might have been on a nice They were growing and growing and growing for six or eight weeks and then It was time for a break and they needed a deal load they started getting so we're gonna start to get you run down They're training efforts started sucking But what they do is they just keep on training because it's a 16 week study That's what you got to do keep going And those last eight weeks are for shit and they actually back slide you know they don't make any gains Or they over literally over train and start to lose size And that can indeed happen So that's what you don't always see what's going on in the middle So being able to find a break in there which basically Over the long haul if you take a one and a half week break over five weeks or one week break Over those five weeks your frequency is less on average because you took the break So that's the way to sort of adjust your frequency So that's where auto regulation comes in a play There's some data looking at that. I don't have the slides or that I had covered those here, but Anyway, so this is just a really nice study that confirms that We're all different you got to find what works for you. This is why DC training works for some people and mountain dog training works much better for other people Yeah, that's an example Let's hit that uh hit that last slide. This is sort of some more comp confirmatory stuff All right, we got that up So this isn't to say you know that you like and we talked in the previous you know about how much the The muscle soreness and damage can be Can be work against you you don't want to avoid those negatives Because there's some import in those those are the ones That do create the most damage. There's the aspect of a rep concentric is lifting up eccentric is coming back down There's more force per unit muscle during x-centrics Interestingly enough and this is what I have written there on the upper left of this slide Is that the contraction in terms of the quote-unquote work Not really doing work technically when you're lowering, but if you compare Compare lowering of a rep of a weight versus lifting and consider that the same unit of work You're like two and a half times More if quote-unquote efficient during x-centric then concentric One study and this was done by my mentor back in the day when he was working for NASA Show that during a leg press where they compared Lifting the weight with no lowering so it's just the concentric versus lifting and lowering and normal rep up and down up and down all under your own power It only added about 14% to the energy cost of the rep to lower it on your own So Accentrics are they're energetically very inexpensive So you don't you don't gain much in terms of like getting more reps for instance by like lifting and then you see some people just could have dive bomb their reps Drop it up the bat you gain a small amount 14% is in much But the question is how much or how important are those for the actual training games that you can make and The meta analyses show this generally speaking There's different ways you can compare this with specialized devices, but the one of the best sort of basic bare bones studies But I know of is one that was done by my mentor with some of his colleagues. Oh, one other thing Before I get to that just to show you how little x-centrics affect fatigue Take a look at that bottom of most plot you don't need to be able to see the details to get the idea here. Okay, so what they did was they took it they took um And familiarized their subjects over the over a month like once a week they brought them in and got him used to this and they put them on an isocunetic dynamometer So fancy fancy knee extension device and You can set that up where it only you only have to do the concentric and then oh, yeah Yeah, yeah, or or you can you can set up where you start and it just you start pushing and it pushes you down I had to do that. How are you? I did that when I I did do that for a test when I had my ACL replaced Probably outside backs machine there's there's several Brands out there we had a king com one at Georgia one out there so okay, so this is this is the they're they're useful actually if you could set up There are some brands of resistors exercise equipment that that allow you to overload on the x-centrics that would be bad Yes, oh, they're awesome the great but they just people just don't like them a little bit price year They feel a little bit odd, but it's there's it's an advantageous way to train. I see this really is So but check out the plot here. So what um what you see there is torque So that's the what was happening in terms of the force being produced about the knee joint and They took them in on three different days Actually, I think it was six different days and they had them do at all out set of What was actually 32 reps okay, so each of those eight points there represents the average of four reps and if you look at the left most set About one if you can read that there is that open squares and and build squares The open squares shows the torque of the force production of the course of those 32 maximal Concentric all out reps okay, and there's like a 30% drop-in force roughly which you expect Yeah, so you're yeah, so they're they're fatiguing during the concentrics and They tested them on three different bouts and you can see each of those blocks look pretty similar In fact, they're kind of a little bit lower up after they're doing this maybe they're choosing their motivation So those are the fill those open ones and the bottom those are concentric you can't produce as much force on a concentric Okay, you can't on an x-ventric The the field squares are the 32 rep bouts. This is all out eccentric only So just battling against the machine when it drives your your leg down during a knee extension And the force actually tends to go up over the course of the bow and it's certainly in ends up at a higher value at the end or it's basically the same Vogue value as at the beginning 32 all out reps with zero average fatigue over the course of the bow and that's because There's some inhibition that's involved there. There's a protective neurological protective mechanism in place So you don't tear something because you could produce so much force But also those so energetically inexpensive to do though, so you're not you're not not Lowering or reducing the stimulus of the set by Doing controlled x-entrics What you're actually doing is require using muscle In a way that produces more force for whatever you're using and it almost adds zero to your fatigue Over the course of the set you'll fatigue just as much with if someone lowered every rep for you So the question then becomes like well what happened if you just trained that way? Well, that's what Dr. Dudley and his colleagues and asked that try to figure out they're trying to this was actually at all in in a line of research Trying to figure out how to hold on muscle mass hold on a muscle mass with astronauts and space flight. Oh, okay Yeah, so they're trying to figure out because you don't have you there's no gravity in space Yeah, obviously, but you can create devices and they have that will allow you to do concentric and eccentric reps like normal reps With that eccentric action, so they want to know how important is that can we just make this easy and just have like a You know flywheel this momentum it's all concentric or do we need to have some eccentric involved yeah, so They had people do Train twice a week for 19 weeks and They're doing Both leg presses in the extension think five sets of leg press for the knee extension and That was the basic workout for the lifting and lowering and then they had two other comparative workouts one was this would have been just horrible as a as a you know a lab assistant to do So they had them do Oh, that's missed there's a misprint right there The middle they had them do twice as many sets Okay 18 sets twice a week but only concentric Okay, so they did like it's so it's not supposed to lift in lower Yep, they would the middle one says con con oh, I see yeah Yeah, yeah, when the right one it's it's lifting up not down Yeah, but I'm for I under the con con I put lift in lower it shouldn't say that got you notice that we're good That's probably my coffee paste here. Yeah, but I mean I had to fabricate this figure from several other figures Yes, so so the con act on the left is nine sets regular twice a week for 19 weeks the con con is The double the volume Bob and the con is just the nine sets but no lowering Okay, so what those bargrats graph show Is the change in muscle fiber type fiber area in the both the type ones and the type two Act before versus after the 19 weeks of training and they also made some measurements after one month of detaining just to follow up on that Okay, so Just look at the the bar graphs that have the lines and not the ones that are that are more filled in Have the die lines Just kind of focus those those are the most important for us so if you look at The left most side you see about about 12% increase in the type ones and About a 30% increase in the type choose yeah, that's what you tip would see These run train folks as well here if you look at the con only so all the way to the To the right You see a little bit less in the Type ones and about half the increase in the type choose so as type choose didn't didn't grow nearly as much As they without the x-centrics in there and even when they doubled This is the middle condition when they doubled the volume twice as many sets With no lowering so this will be the the case where you see someone who just they push up and they just they're just dropping the weight and just like banging out the reps in a very Uncontrolled fashion yep see it all the time You see it all the time well this is this is this is that to the extreme where there's lilies no lowering at all Okay, they they were had the the type one fibers grew even less than with the about or about the same as with the nine sets and They still didn't get quite the same growth. It's pretty close But it wasn't it wasn't terribly it was about the same a little bit less and the type choose So even in doubling the volume You didn't see much So and what happens there if you look down at the the the more filled in Bar graphs Take a look at the type ones for that middle condition the con con a month later Basically they're all that that small amount of fiber growth that they had was gone It was just it disappeared. He went to nothing. Yeah, where's you look at the leftmost the con X the normal reps The type ones held onto their size entirely yeah on average so That was a more like persistent Maintenance of that growth it stayed yeah for longer period time That's what of course we want so in case you do have to take a deloter What have you you've got growth that stays I wouldn't have been surprised if People talk about and there is evidence that some people experience a sarcoplasmic hypertrophy That's is what there's a guy in Cody Honest on this study There's some issues with the study because they just looked at the people who grew and Then they demonstrated that was the case half their subjects didn't grow from the protocol to the use But the half that did showed some evidence of a sarcoplasmic hypertrophy Because the nature of that I would be surprised if it was happening in those type twos The that growth that they they found there was glycogen Oregon L sarcoplasmic particularly the things that contribute to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy not my or Fibular because they're doing this they had so much of an energetic demand and doing twice as much twice the volume That that would make sense to the type ones would grow and then once that energetic stress is gone You just lose the glycogen you lose the glycogen loading effect that comes from training Glacogen levels would come back down without the energetic stress You know, it's it's an easier phenomenon to to remove and clear away the some of those sarcoplasmic components Versus the contractile protein which is a very very highly organized by a Fibular construct within the muscle so doing the lowering gave you good growth that stuck Much better that makes sense Yeah, so the con the con nine sets the growth didn't stick look at what happened there on the right most Basically after the one-month month of detraining they've essentially lost all the size they had in the type choose No kidding. So yeah, it's basically they aren't totally gone that happened essentially the type one too So you've got it so there's obviously cleared vanagers to doing the x-centrics Yeah, and in this case That's a pretty reasonable program twice a week nine sets Yeah, that's a nice you know, no one would block at that It's totally tolerable that's a middle-level row that's gonna get you good growth from your average person And we see here on average that it's a good idea to have those x-centrics in place Very important they're energetically inexpensive and they create more force Preunit muscle mass and they create some of the damage which is part of that remodeling process And no here two they did 19 weeks so they were probably pretty sore at the first couple weeks But then they had 16 17 weeks actually grow and they progressively overloaded of course And the study too so they did long enough study to let people kind of get used to it progressively overload them And they showed here and one of the clearest fashions that I've seen that if you remove the eccentric from your rep If you die on your reps, so you're not you're not controlling that eccentric You're losing out at a very important aspect of What produces muscle growth yeah, especially those type two fibers it's nice to see it muscle mood. Yeah, it's nice to see it. Yeah, it's nice to see it because I I've learned that you've obviously learned that You know, I don't know man. I think I think part of that comes down to the ego lifting thing Because people want to keep pushing the way you have to use a lot it takes a lot of energy man to control a weight on the negative Psychological energy But but but in terms of metabolic cost it doesn't it doesn't so if I were just to Say get on the squat and just do we had this right here in the Midwest called the demon drop And I thought of it recently it was like a little box at the best theme park It just drops down and then Wow and refalling for like two seconds Yeah, like I've seen some people squatting like I probably did years ago, too So you're telling me that the metabolic Expenditure of doing that versus really controlling it down isn't much different Yeah, so here's what happens when people die bomb things yeah You get a stretch shortening cycle that play here. Yeah, yeah, so it's kind of like like the the best example of a muscle that was engineered To make use of the elastic energy that comes from that Is is the Achilles ten or the the calf muscles the planar flexors that are attached to your Achilles yeah Achilles ten and it is just a long spring And you'll see in some of the best sprinters who have a lot of the factors all rolled into one to make them really fast They a lot of times we'll have small calves The calf muscles aren't big because you don't need a lot of muscle there What they have with having small calves is a very long spring So they have a lot of Achilles tendon with which to harness elastic energy and and use that So they can spring forward I Heech each step I see where you're going and and you see people to get on like the seated calf raised You just bounce all over the place Yeah, take out rage as long as you don't tear your Achilles you could take out rage as weight and just bounce it all over the place Sure, sure just slow that down the like a four second rep, you know two up and two down Totally different story yeah, you'll feel it in the muscle you're not you're not training your tendon You know you're training the muscle so to speak so you can you can like if you think well I get lot more reps when I go fast like that Yes, you do Because you're basically harness the energy of the free falling weight yeah It's as in an elastic sense and there's a reflexes involved. There's a myotatic reflexes involved and We may have covered this on one of the I know I covered on one podcast, but this is what for instance you see in people like volleyball players and people who've trained to do a lot of plyometrics Is they have trained themselves to disinhibit and Remove the inhibition from like really high drop jumps normally like you were me like you know It's the only way you jump off something kind of high yeah, and you hit the hit the ground is like oh shit It would just like a giant shock Where if someone is pretty nimble or athletic they drop down and they just bounce is they just land softly or they bounce right back up Sure You can see some people who are really good in plyometrics. This is a really cool phenomenon They have them drop jump off a box do a drop jump and then spring back up and the higher the box Higher their jump yeah, yeah So they actually like they could maybe they have a 30 inch vertical But you give them a drop and they can you can drop them off a 40 inch and they can go 35 or 40 inches You give them a 50 inch they can go 40 inches Yeah, I remember when when we talked about the Central nervous system That's where we yes, I do recall that now Yeah, so if you if you train that way with like dive bombing and like harnessing that stress shortening cycle You learn how to use that energy to your advantage to move the weight through space and do reps Yeah, that's cool that's good But that doesn't you're not using the eccentric the point is to use the weight as a way to stimulate Simulate the muscle in terms of force generation and then metabolic demand in the muscle Not just to get more reps So form and tempo does does matter to some degree Yeah, you know the the general they looked at them you know like between like 0.5 and Two seconds or so per rep there's no difference on average that you'll see But I'm pretty sure if you took someone and just ask them I don't think I have the I don't remember seeing the study It may have been done where like they just said go as fast as you can You'd be kind of dangerous to be honest and compared that with someone who did really controlled reps With maybe even like an infotestably short pause between between between the eccentric and the concentric So they're using muscular contract valve power as opposed to the elasticity of the muscle in the tendon and those elastic components in the connected tissue so Anyway, it'll it'll look like You're getting a lot more work out of Diabombing the weight Because you get a lot more reps doing that and That's because you're harnessing the the energy of the falling weight Into the elastic recoil that lets you bring it back up. Yes, and what what you see sometimes too is If you do repially fast like that when you come when you reach a fatigue point You'll just come to a screeching hole sure sure Yeah, so eventually eventually you you you you're in in capable of getting enough elastic recoil And then the two two sources of energy the muscular fatigue catches up and eventually boom like you just can't get it up if you just can't move the weight anymore That's scary when you see somebody benching and you can see that coming They've got the barbell on them and you're they And then they stop and they're ready to get one more and my question isn't are they strong enough to push it up But are they gonna be able to get enough bounce? You know Right right because you you can tell that the bounces what's moving the weight as much as Muscular strength yeah, where someone is slowly controlled you'll see if the key curve yeah McDonald's we didn't know if you watch what Lyle's been he's been just tearing into Mike is or tell in particular No, um about we have reps to reserve and all that but he's he makes a very important point And he's demonstrating this in in videos that have been sent to him in some of his own training That rep speed or bar speed slow is as you reach fatigue if you take a set to Muscular failure with a good slow tempo without it out There's and he has even like I think he's waiting to throw this card because there's a whole body of literature looking at bar speed And how that as associated with reps and reserve and RPE and he hasn't even called on the research I know he knows it's there he's just looking at like in the in the gym This is what sets look like and you see the person like the reps start to slow down and if you're spotting them then you're like Okay, like this person's got to control the weight And they have a grinder and then like they go here and like this is gonna be the one and then the the weight doesn't just all said fall back down on them Because Basically when you're here's the way to think of it is when you're using that recoil that stress shorting cycle It's free falling here and then it's only going up because it's been bounced back up sure It's it's in free fall on the way up to yeah, unless you have enough strength to bring it up And if you if you're requiring on the bounce to get the thing moving rather than muscular power You only get as much as you get out of that bounce. I agreed with you from the start I think that I misunderstood you but it was still nice to hear you explain it Yeah, you know I wasn't I didn't think of it as that is I've enjoyed it That would be what unless people recognize what you could just talked about Yeah, it would they would think that they're getting a the better the performance the better the gross stimulus Yeah, and if you just performance it's just the number of reps Then you know get them however you can yeah, yeah, and everyone you know not to do that Yeah, but that's some science underpinning this and this is why having an controlled eccentric From just this study and generally what you see in the literature the eccentric are important You just don't want to do too much of them So it's it's an a measured amount And that's sort of the the bottom line here is that it's all a matter of finally like and so this is why this slide the last one was up was but don't avoid the negatives So I think this takes us to the summary here. All right, let me grab that last one That is up So this is just I'll just kind of read through this but this is sort of the basic idea We're talking about training finding the training dose for an individual so Damaging mount damaging bouts so the ones we get sore from They may not set in motion the protein balance in a trajectory that produces growth So you do too much this is from that very first study you may be just using up your protein synthetic reserves to balance the breakdown that you've avoid that you caused Yeah, and you can avoid this view this protective effect this repeated about effect by easing Just a misplaced I'm just telling the easing into a program I didn't even correct easing as a I frankly that's a word easing to go east So easy into a program you can you can still get the growth of you just in a couple extra weeks or so Work your way into it maybe even less Training variety the change in the reps the second figuration can alter training volume and muscle protein synthesis But this might not be to your advantage So in that for last study the training the the muscle growth was inversely correlated Your training volume when they buried things around and this increase the training training volume So the variety is great that's awesome for making training fun and that's super important But if you end up doing too much In that for that for an individual that can go against you yeah, so more importantly look at the big picture Training volume slash frequency how am I spelling was awful? I can't type I can spell I just can't type Training volume slash frequency when training failure That's worth noting they were taking these sets to failure are the parameters of greater import here So in that study comparing five times versus two or three times a week There was a substantial difference between those two conditions Yeah, and he saw substantial difference for many people in terms of how much growth they made on one versus the other So if you're thinking about like what do I really want to experiment with to figure out if my program is working Think first about total number of sets and how many times you're doing that over a week or several weeks So frequency or total training volume and and maybe even how you distribute that versus Well, I'm gonna do you know I'm gonna do muscle rounds. I'm gonna do pumps sets. I'm gonna do some of Johns and tense patient techniques Somebody restpotsets et cetera et cetera et cetera Those those things are nice and those are good those that's that's a is a form of variety which is important but if you're doing too much volume It doesn't matter. Yeah, it's just too much So you might be better off with the more simple program or or it's just a lower volume program or higher volume program So think of the big rock sort of speak so the variety in terms of the sets Is important I think For a more advanced person especially Find the exercise that work for them. It's a tour advanced training way perspective to have but Think big picture first am I doing too much like if I go in I do every cool exercise that I've seen on the people that I fall on Instagram show me You know all the weird weird things and I have lots of those on mine Yeah, just don't don't do 15 of those and it worked out right you know Yeah, it's not to just do more is better and make it all sort of funky and weird Think big picture in terms of volume and frequency And then but the last thing though to consider is Don't avoid again another type of I'm gonna correct all this stuff we can even Don't avoid the eccentric they in the right amount or a vital component of the of the grossed in this those eccentric reps Are what you want Yeah, you need to be there to some degree So As people have said and this is just the the data is there now people can see some evidence of this Is having a good control of your rep where you're controlling the eccentric is something you want to have in place And then you can then of course once you've got that as you're sort of singular unit the rep itself Then look at the big pictures of the total training volume and the frequency et cetera And the second figuration whether it's a cluster set or a drop set or Set or et cetera et cetera et cetera Gotcha, so Yeah So those are some things that I think people probably dig knowing Yeah, yeah, scientists aren't like off their rockers, you know, doing shit That's so esoteric and unpractical like stuff actually applies Yeah, I'm gonna move you a little bit here again. There we go got you centered My brain is full Scott that's some good stuff. This is the kind of podcast I feel like I want to go back and Maybe watch this one a couple times I know we we have covered some of this stuff before Uh, and I appreciate how you kind of tied it all together today And if I were to summon up from my bro perspective is this to what I've taken from it so far It would be to well as we mentioned at the end consider how I'm performing my reps But then really considering my volume Actually my my my my frequency my volume and And then from there man just how much variability there can be within that That'd be like kind of the big stuff I'm saying Yeah, and it insight to the kind of tease apart is that and this but didn't have any studies look at the Strecley is that if you if a certain how you train with what frequency you train a given amount of volume Is gonna impact how sore you get for those workouts. Yeah, yeah So I mentioned earlier you take those 15 sets and do it a spider over five sets a day for three days When it was a Friday yeah, that's gonna avoid that excessive damage that would come This is where the the topic of junk volume comes in a play sure And somewhere in there I don't think I read it but I put in the the famously he- He- quote of stimulate don't annihilate yeah, so You know, in terms of like Trying to work out for workout basis after your past that protective effect or if you're someone to get so get sore There's some sort of optimal Stimulus to Prepare yourself forward in terms of the protein balance you get each time yeah, so and this is the Don't take you to say this all the time that these are growth used to call them growth opportunities That's why he like these he trains more of a higher frequency type of training Is that you want to get find the optimal volume puller workout To create the maximal propulsive force so to speak from that stimulus The maximum of smack of adaptive propulsive force will call it there's a fancy term for you I like that I'm creating shit, you know like a hashtag that the adaptive propulsive stimulus and do that as frequently as you can recover from So and and it may be for some people and here's where he's kind of figuring this out that they do a given like a the 10 set workout for a muscle group and If you if they wait five days The first couple days are sort of in the hole they're recovering then they've got satellite cell Activity that's at role here it play here, et cetera et cetera and if they wait five days and do that every five days That gives them a greater accrued adaptive for false-off force That gives them a greater adaptation by with that volume with that spacing as Opposed to maybe the same volume but space too close together Because you see everyone what I think it varies with this muscle sort of thing It's such a fascinating topic is some people get sore you've heard people say they get sore and they're sore like 8 or 12 or 15 hours later the next day. Yeah, it's gone two days later. Oh Yeah, and some people are yeah, so some people are sore for three or four days Just kind of lingers. I'm one of those. I get sore and it just lingers for a long period of time. So that's something considered too Is you know how long or if you if you if you train really hard and dig a little bit of a hole for yourself You may come out of that in matter 24 hours. So waiting five days to do that May mean that those last three or four days between workouts are ones where you're getting ahead of the game and you're growing So let that happen don't do a workout before that's occurred Yeah, because you're wasting the The adaptation that's been sent motion from that first workout you may have just gotten back up for baseline Yeah, or you may exactly if you train too early. Yeah, you're frequently So you have to figure out will be better than like what if I cut that in half and then don't get sore at all And then I can do you know the same volume or a little bit more and this is what the data kind of shows too Is that and if you look at the twist the data around that it's been done in the reviews and met analyses is that Higher frequency training tends to allow people to train with more volume And you can imagine this too if like you tried to do 15 sets and it destroyed you you might be able to do instead of five sets three times a week Seven sets for you. Yep. Yeah, sure. So then that and that's what people find in the in the trenches And that's what the research generally suggests as well is that it permits higher training volume That you can recover from so now you're getting 21 sets three times seven in a week as opposed to 15 As long as you're recovering Getting ahead of the game before the next workout comes around You're a winner. Yeah, so the more you can get away with and still recover the better generally speaking I like it if if you're good to Finish this topic up here. I have a question for you Yes, we have that question from your patreon. Yes. Yeah. We started a patreon guys Think big bodybuilding media. We'd love any support that you would like to give I would like to make the patreon more interactive as time rolls on I figured out the message part No, so I'm able to to leave like messages to the group and I'm able to interact with everybody individually So if you do have questions for any of the shows Anybody who is a patreon member I encourage you feel free to ask me there and I'll try to make sure that we Highlight those questions to get them on this is from Dallas Paul now. Do you know who Dallas is this he does he post it? on fortitude, right? I I just I think I know him for a Facebook oh, okay. It's somewhere in the glory of social media names Okay, um It's cool name so I remember I definitely remember the name yeah anybody named Dallas period is I think that's it's it's a good name Tough name yeah, it is it's a yeah. It's a cool name. I like it All right, so Dallas has when he says uh I Been going back and listening to old muscle minds and blood sweat and gear podcasts on YouTube On episode 78 of muscle minds Dr Scott had 12 tips to be your best. I remember that one that was good One of those 12 was to not coach hop or switch plans before you had realized any potential gains I've also heard him mentioned before that cycling between fortitude DC training and mountain dog training Would be beneficial because of the different styles how do you optimally balance these two And then he gives some suggestions as in like weight to switch until you hit a plateau or switch every 16 to 20 weeks or an arbitrary length the time to increase frequency or volume And possibly provide new novel stimulus. That's a good one That's a good and those he's actually already got the answers So it's good, but it has everything pretty much it's gonna depend on the person okay, so So some people Some people who like more frequency maybe they One way to this could be explained biologically. There's some variants in the The dopamine receptor like there's like seven seven different major isophorms the dopamine receptor Which determines your your sort of need generally speaking from a personality perspective for novelty and newness and and thrill-seeking activity Okay, so if someone needs something new and novel for them they might be going along and making good progress And start to get bored even though Things are going well yeah, in that case, you know as long as it's not two weeks in right? You're still doing okay They probably should switch just to keep the novelty in place because for those people Who want them desire that novelty that's could impact their training efforts So they might end up doing let's say one dog one mountain dog training program last 12 or 16 weeks And then then they could pick up another one and keep going But there are to getting a little bit tired of of John's training program for and this is the lead of John the person just needs new novelty Yeah, some people just need something different all the time So in that case switching would be a good thing. It's not that the deep of the mountain dog training has stopped working per say it's just it's gonna it's gonna start working stop working for them Because they're gonna start getting a little less enthusiastic about the training yeah Or simply because even if they're able to buckle down they're sort of discipline and they could keep doing them out another mountain dog training program If they can switch to DC and keep gaining and be happier doing so Do it yeah absolutely So make that change because they're just kind of keeping their mojo working and moving from one program to another Some people and this is dependent on the person's experience while I'm just thinking of another scenario where someone Lot of John's programs it depends on which ones but a lot of John's programs you'll have like a baseline of like three workouts that you might do in a week and then he'll have another three or Maybe two different number of pumps that's a sorry if I'm bashed by his and I've I help John with right his book But I haven't done a lot of mountain dog training until recently But so you you can you can vary the volume of training that you do Depending on which one of those optional workouts you do So he has flexibility Sort of in the way that I have volume tears. He's got flexibility in his program So someone else is going along might Have to do several of John's training programs to figure out how to Appuette apply those to their own recovery resources Yeah, to best make the gains So if they do one of John's programs and they just do everything he says Which is probably something I would do just like I'll just do it all and it's way too much Yeah, well, then they should they might think well, you know what John actually put these options in here for reason Probably because some people just can't they train so hard that they can't recover Yeah, you know for them a set of a RP RP E of 10 is really an RP E of 10 where some people are leaving three or four reps in the thing sure compared to someone else They do better to stick with it to try to learn how to tailor John's programs to get the most gains for themselves Okay same thing goes with with DC training or or for to do training some people just love my training program and some people like I've had a number of people when they first time they did it And they realized this for the most part They just said I'm gonna it more as better. I'm gonna do volume tier three The turbo version and they just destroy themselves And they're just like they're a rack after five or six weeks. Yeah, it's just not the right version of the program for them So I wouldn't just do like a typical I suggest somewhere around an eight-league full Blast and cruise period. That's where most people land but it's not always so if someone does that and they're just a wreck by the end And they just decide well, I'm gonna I'm gonna switch to DC training Well actually the DC training might for them be a a devolume And they might start growing from DC training. Well the DC training is much better than fortitude for me It could be well, you know what you just have it learn how to best apply for if you training and choose the appropriate version and volume tier for you Yeah, so they could have a learning a learning a curb to have tab there So for some people they've seen to ride it out and figure out how to about to eat out and squeeze out the best gains Depostable can from whichever one of those programs are using yeah, so Time depends on interest level. It also depend on by the time you go on like let's say you did like See you did a 16-week bound dog program a then eight-week for DC training program and eight weeks afforded to you training There's 32 weeks yeah like you started that right after a series of shows Then you've only got about you know with some breaks in there you've only got like 16-20 weeks before your chart you're gonna do a neck show absolutely so you've done all three You know you're gonna have to pick one to die it in you know, which one you use is gonna is gonna matter Just even if you did mountain dog training on your tire off season you might find that you can hold your strength You're muscle masterly well with a higher volume foritude training and you decide to do that Did I didn't for a show cuz you have that experience or You might want to say you know how can I I want to stick with mountain dog training dance with the one who brought you Which Dante said which I said a million times? I think I just heard skip say it on one of the What's what in years? Makes so stick with mountain dog training. That's what got you there and just modified it my preference would be reduced the volume Don't release the effort levels Yes, stick with the quality of the stimulus but reduce the quantity and ride it into your show So all of a sudden you're not like Okay, what the fuck do I do now? I went from you know 16 sets in a workout or 10 sets in order with John and now I'm doing like one rest-pause set with DC training This is enough like what's gonna happen here? Oh, yeah. I dropped my calories too That's just that's just a programmatic chaos Yeah, what they did that not a smart way to like a transition from off to all season of pre-contests So it's gonna depend on the person depend on their attention levels or their attention deficit levels They're desire for novelty how much they like the gains they're getting And some people you know you're only gonna gain so much too You know most people in an offseason here's the thing the reality of it is not like you can't just like continually make Notice the gains for years on end most people were diet down and they'll go again You know yeah, so you only have maybe nine months through which you're gonna like push it in offseason before you diet in for a show For most people absolutely so So a lot of ways to do it. There's no right or wrong. It just kind of depends on the person just like You know five five times a week for three sets is not the perfect program for everybody Yeah, you know Sticking with mountain dog training until you're sure you haven't made any games You should do it for three years straight You may not be the smartest move for some people whereas others might have they might like that That's what happens with games the more advanced you get is Literally just like Jordan's a perfect example of this You know he's actually switched years now very recently. He's gonna some dropback kind of a TRT approach Yeah, he just posted this on his yeah, I don't know if you heard this but but you know for years Eat me out like one or two reps for workout is a total victory You know so for someone at that level Trying to progress from you know 98 to 99 percent of his Genetic protect enhanced genetic potential There there is no like you can't just be hopping around for things from one thing to another Right you need to be very very precise and controlled and stick with the same programmatic design and just Very it so you can gradually move up Rep by rep over the course of months You know an extra 10 kilos over two years is substantial for him on Basically core exercises if he comes back to for sure though Anyway, that's a prolonged answer, but it kind of depends on you. It's good. All right well in that case let's wrap up here For another podcast here.
