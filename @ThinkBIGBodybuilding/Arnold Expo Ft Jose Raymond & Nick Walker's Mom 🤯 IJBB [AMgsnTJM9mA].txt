I told him this is his stage and everyone else is visiting. Oh, here we go. That's what I'm talking about. Okay, see we should have had her on a long time ago. All right, exactly what I expected. Okay, so what's your, your, your advice to everybody who's going to bet money on the show tonight? What's your advice? Should have been on me. Should have been on me. That's it. It's a very wild little experiment we're doing here. Yeah, yeah, this is. Like we're literally doing what we would normally do. You know, streaming out, you know? Yeah, literally doing what we would normally do. I'm just going to ignore, I'm just going to have to ignore this. Are we live yet? We're recording. We're recording. Yeah, that's crazy. You know, it's funny without any announcement or anything like that. You just like put me on the spot. Boom, my phone. Here we go. Yeah, what you said down to the sea. Okay, well, welcome to the mutant booth at the 2023 armor classic. All right, you know, I mean, I expect a dusty to be here. But last minute, Scott's here too. So we're not all in focus arts here. I prefer to not be in focus. Dusty's in as much focus as we want. Yeah, I would say. Hey, Nikki, can you bring that camera around just a little bit more? Still a little bit. Yeah, like, bring the whole thing. There we go. Here that. There we go. And then, England, yeah. There we go. That looks good. She knows her angles. I might need you again. That might be too good. And that, that I guess looks all right. Okay. So this is what we're looking at around. We're looking at that. Okay, that's not bad. We're looking at that. You're going to get bigger. I've got to get on a good arm shot there. Scott, unintentional. I'm happy about that. And then we're also looking at that. Okay. That's like everybody out here. Okay, so we see like what's going on. Scott, so I have to, I have to thank you Scott for you. Put in a ton of work to set this up. And I know we're doing this kind of experimentally. Yeah. But wow. Like, you, you did a lot. I saw you over here, hustling. You were. I'm still sweating. I just wanted to see other things. I didn't bring up the opportunity shirt. Yeah, but I wanted to continue representing something. I had to get the money on it. You could have just asked me, wait boxes of shirts. Like right back there. It's too late now. You know, I didn't want to interfere with your fashion. I'll be peeled by tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, dry after this. So I have to remind everybody who's watching the recorded version of this. That will go up on YouTube. Yes. To like, share, subscribe, comment, and ring the bell. There you go. See, that felt funny to do live because it applies to the people watching later. Yeah. You know, let's go. Hey. We got some people hanging with this. There's no bell. We're going to go. There you go. So out of the two people standing here right now. Are either of the listeners of the podcast. Yes. One out of two. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. 50% 100%, we've got a 50%. So sorry. Probably should tell people what is this. So we just wanted to see what it would be like to do a live broadcast. Yeah, it fully exposed to the room. You know, with like everyone right up against us. And you know, some of the listeners are coming by and you know, it is see how it went. You know, see what we see what we can do. You know, real quick. Set it up. You did a great job. Thank you. You know, if we get people involved, We have a few people standing here. We should totally get people involved absolutely. Who's your favorite guest ever Josh? No pressure. I know he watches. Jay. Jay. You said Jay. Jay. Jay. Jay. Jay. That's a good answer. Well, we had some trivia. Didn't we? We did have some trivia. We actually had two trivia stories. One of them happened in Russia. And one of them happened in Ohio. Okay. And so out of the four people, plus Nikki, you kind of five people that we have watched. We want you guys to vote. Did it happen in Ohio? Or did it happen in Russia? All right. Here we go. What is the thing? This is Ohio. So Russia. The first story. Actually having here, I'm going to pull this up so that I can read a little bit of this. Let me see. I got too many windows open. Don't worry guys. I closed all the portal. It did happen in Russia. No, no, no, it's because it's not in Ohio. Yes. I know both the stories actually, Scott. You know the story. Yeah. Here's the first one. And let me pull this up here. And I'll pull this up to the people who are watching it home. Oh, it might give it away. It gave it away. Because it's not a bad idea. It doesn't say anything. So in 1929, who was Eugene the money? In 1929, the trifter who died of natural causes was involved by a local funeral home. And then put on display in hopes that someone would be able to identify them. He turned into a roadside attraction. Reportedly some 15 million people stopped by to see Eugene's corpse over the next four decades. He was put on a couch and left in a neighboring building for 40 years. Until he was finally buried in the city paid for it. Yeah. So we have to both. Did that happen in Russia? Or did that happen in Ohio? And now we give him to begin the second story now. Do we have to do it? We have to do it in the second time. Okay, one at a time. So show a hands. Didn't happen to know Ohio. We got one, two, three, four, five. We need to be people. Seven. Or did it happen in Russia? And Ohio must be hard for. What? Oh, I should have flipped to the audience. We should have been like this. That was good. That was good. That's okay. That's all right. Okay. Do we tell him around? We'll write no. We did second story. It's just second story. Second story? Okay. I remember the second one. I got the second one here too. I've actually got it like, uh, glued up. Gued up. Yes. Going up all the cows. Yeah. Going up all the cows, Ron. So here's the second story. And this has to do with dairy farming. And now the question in case anybody's just walking up. Did this happen in Russia? Or did this happen in Ohio? All right. Here we go. So, uh, let's see. This has to do with virtual reality. The herd, they use these virtual reality cameras, right, Ron? At these cows. Yep. They said the herd don't be our systems adapted to the structural features of cowheads. And we're showing unique summer field simulation programs. Now the idea of this is that they would then because they were happy. They would produce more filthy cast. What? They did. It worked. So they had cows with VR headsets on them. And they were producing more milk. Did that happen? In Ohio. What's again? We're going to do a vote here. Or did that happen in Russia? Ohio. Or did it happen in Russia? Let's see. Show it. Let's go with Ohio first. We got one, two, three over there. Real high. Real high. Real high. And now, did it happen in Russia? Oh, got Russia. Three, four. Russia. Okay. So what was that? Three Russia? Yeah, yeah, it's stuff like that. Ohio. So how do we do this now? Do we just give it a minute? There we go. It's just fine. You're Jane the mummy. Yes. And Ohio legend happened in Ohio. Which that's why she looks new. That's why she knew. You knew this. But they should know. They live here. Yeah. And the VR headsets on the cows was in Russia. VR headsets. I feel like they're ahead of us on that. I would think the cows would be here. So now does to you. We need to be our headset for you. So the ear more productive. That's how you're going to happen. But I would like to be left on the side of the road. Yeah. That would be sick. I'm good with that. I learned a lot about this incredible state researching some of the fun stuff. Did you get this show? Yeah. What else did you learn? Well remember I forgot Dave Rower's from Ohio. So what? Remember I forgot Dave Rower's from Ohio. Oh yeah Dave Rower. You know. Fairly cows. Be born here. But whatever. And Steven Spiel's birth. Spiel's. Yes. Also in Ohio. Yes. There you go. I got to go in on it. We get the overrun. We got some overrunters. We actually got a bunch of questions too. Okay. But I also have some pictures of a lot of competitors that are competing at the heart of class. Well we just watched the classic pre-judging. Yeah. Like awesome seats. Literally like feet from us. We're sitting right here. And if you just like vote right there's the stage. Yeah. Pretty awesome. But I'm going to be walking around here. We watch the wellness while we're setting up. And watch the classic while we're waiting. It's not some figure. It's all at all. You know. So. What do you guys think tonight? I'm I'm still going to go with. My call of Nick Wayne in the show. I don't want to change my prediction at the last minute. So I'm going to go with that. What about for. What about for. We got a really project. That's the. What about. There you go. I'm going to say. I'm going to say. I'm going to say. Ramon. I don't think it's that tight. You know, because that tight. There are a couple poses where I thought it was tighter than before. Okay. But I'm going to say. Ramon. He's too sliced. I got him when he's the reason. Yeah. Slice that this had and so I'll put together. I thought that. Er is actually. Had a bigger. Back double. Right. Like he he's you know what I mean. Er has a bigger back double. Yeah. With the total detail post to pose. Yeah. I do not too much for me. Yeah. You know what I mean? We had some audience questions that they sent in. We did. We did. I want those. All right. Let's see. Let's see. I'm going to. I'm going to. Start here. And by the way, you know what we should take. Any audience questions. Any one who shows up and they went and he's got a message. But love the podcast. But as much as dusty loves it because he's a free. This is more of a comment. And I went and they can top it out of it. Because he's a freak. The idea of body building was it for free. It was supposed to be the perfect aesthetic muscular physique. Supposed to be a body that everyone wants to have. Unfortunately, it's been hijacked like judges that won free. Well. Can you comment? I think it's been hijacked by fans who won free. There you go. Yeah. At the end of the day, that's what pays the bills. I mean, it's popular as plastic is and all those not love it. There's a reason that open body building isn't at the Xbox. Because fans will pay the CEO of the body building because at the end of the day, like Jose said, they're all freaks. But everyone's come see the bearded lady. Once in a freak is first and year and at this show, I think that's like welcome. Yeah. Yeah. It's the natural progression of everything. I don't really necessarily subscribe to the idea that body building was ever supposed to be about the perfect physique. You know what I mean? Like what other people would want. I don't think that was ever really like. I'm a real thing. It's always going to, you know, just even think of Arnold when Arnold was winning. Not everyone, you know, that wasn't necessarily true either. He was still considered, you know, ridiculous monster to so many people. So it wasn't like it used to be appealing to everyone. It never really was. Yeah. So I don't really think that that's a factor that I would lean into. Yeah. Because Arnold is only appealing now because we've gone so much further. We've been looking back and saying, oh, that was achievable. It's also like that. Right. So when people say, well, you know, Chris Bumsteads, the Rizzi's popular is that's something you can do. No, you can't. Yeah, I know. Oh, you can't. You could do Bumsteads, and as well as you could do Nick Walker. Yeah. Yeah. You're not going to be... Stop it. Oh, I got it. Chris, stop it. No way. Stop it. I'm going to tell you about it. What's going on? What's going on? I don't know. I don't know. I can't believe it. I don't know. What are you doing here at the Arnold? Looking good? Looking fly? You got the cutoff plan off the going on right now. I'm here with the airplane. So. Oh, nice. Your shoe. You're right now. There you go. There you go. I didn't even know you had shoes on. Are you guys training your feet, too? I'm training my feet to be beat up clubs by wearing these shucks. I know you probably hate these things. Little, the toe box is too narrow. The ramp is on and it doesn't have to towards them. Tell me more. Tell me more. Look at exhibits so much more power. Like the tendon on that big toe runs all the way up through the cap both way into this backside of this knee right here. So we've got control of the knee. It's ability. It also creates the parts of your foot and your ability to express your power. Like we spend a lot of time like on machine trying to target muscles in different ways. But that's our key into this like our connection to the crown. In our ability like our lack of strength there people want to chase the things all the time. Like I've got a knee pain. I've got back pain. I've got all the, like you're always trying to chase this. What if you woke up every day and went my elbow hurts? It's a little sore. I'm gonna ramp it with an elbow ramp. Right. And it feels better to does right? Right. But what would happen if you did that every day all day as long? Yeah. You're arm and you weak. Right? And then you start having problems elsewhere in your body. Right? We just plan simple. And so when we package up and don't use that, what is the body? Do you know? The herologically after those muscles give peak. And you're trying to try to move around it. What happens is the body starts trying to protect it. So it starts inhibiting the range of motion. Right. That's why when people squat like shit they have very little hip mobility. Right? That's why everybody seems that have like ankle mobility problems. But your foot's fucking weak. No one there. No one there. Right? And then it also reduces your power output. Now that's the money. Right. So if your power output is reduced and you're trying to do squats. You're trading deep. You're trading to 80%. Yeah. You're not even, you're not even taking advantage of everything you can do. Like, well, how do you guys, you question, how do you feel about, I don't know if I've heard people call it like when you put your foot on the leg press. And you kind of curl your toes like a raptor foot. Like to create like a solid. What? You know what I mean? Yeah. So, you know, they're creating tension in the system that way. But you need to be able to use your foot in all of all its avenues. So we need to be able to spread the toes out. So you would rather spread the toes out. You want to spread and you want to be able to press it. Push down with that. We also have to have flexibility. So like if that big toes lack in the flexibility that immediately you're going to have some inhibition all the way up again through the function of the knee. Okay. Okay. There's your quad. There's your abs. There's everything. So someone not do that. It's more about what I'm trying to say is as a whole, you just need to spend some time using your foot so that it gets stronger. So the best thing you can do is a bodybuilder. So when you time you're doing cab raises. You can't get shoes off. Actually, you're going to raise the ball the way through the ball. You're foot. And then let it stretch and open all the way down. Make sure that your whole thing goes to the up to 10x of time. Then like build the strength and function of that one. All the certain rotated around. And you're going to see your potential for strength. Go up. And your tightness and your injuries. All your issues kind of kind of go down. Awesome. So. So. So. Magic. How I get lifted. It's bought out of a thousand pounds. We had a lot of fucking shit. I get those pair of boots. Right. We're going to be a fantastic. Right. You can see how close you. My voice. Jack. I have control of it. And you know, I'm somebody and I don't do mobility work. And I get close to probably doing this pledge right now. So it's quite an end of 2000 pounds of reps. Right. So so where can they get your shoes? Where can they get your shoes? I'm like a. So. Awesome. Awesome. So. So. Thanks, man. I love the idea. That's a lot of. I'm not. You're not. Honey. Grandpa. So if not, like, just taking your shoes off, you can spend some time. Like, do some of your accessory work, your warm-ups around your house. Just spend some time outside of the show as the answer. Yeah. I probably shouldn't say that. I have an issue. We do more. It's just. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks Chris. We appreciate it, man. Well, that's heavy on the show. That's heavy on. Thanks. Especially appreciate it, man. This guy is going to do something. Oh, say. Come here. Come here. Right now. I really appreciate. I'm really happy to be Chris. I'm really happy to be on the street. Great. You're going to go down to the show just like this. What's up there? What's up there? Are you guys all doing? What's happening? We got Jose here. What's up there? What's up, buddy? I'm good. Jose doesn't need a chair. I'm not going to say this. You guys stand. What's going on here? I'm sure. What's up, buddy? Yeah. I think Ramon's got it. It's pretty pretty good. But I tell you. This is probably the biggest superstar in the division. Like, like, other than folks that he's posing. He's posing. He's posing. He's posing. He's posing. He's posing. He's posing. He's posing. He's posing. He's presentation. He sets everything up. He's so fun to watch. He poses bigger than he is. Right. Ramon's clearly bigger than him. But there's a few poses where you're like, I don't know. Right. When they turn around, Ramon was just so ridiculous that they kind of ended there. Right. Detailed. Yeah. And Ramon's gotten better. He's better than he was at the Olympia. His presentation is better. Right. He's making those improvements. He's still very interested. And he's fresh to this sport. You know, he doesn't have a better roundle on him. But I think he's winning here. He's winning here. What if we got to ask him how to see the the open go in. Without seeing anybody up. Well, I've seen one guy, so much. So really, first the foremost unbiased to Sean Clarine. Right. I think it all things considered. every little new one, somebody building Sean is the top two or three in the planet of any high of any division of anything. Sean, you could argue higher. You know, but let's see, let's see what they do. He's a hike in a herd of that much. Sean is so well put together, so balanced, so much muscle for that frame. If anyone is off, Sean beats him. It's unfortunate that we have to say it that way if anyone is off because they're just bigger versions of him, but maybe not as good. It's one of the craziest lineup issues I've ever seen. Like this particular lineup with that particular, with Sean at this particular point in his career, you know, but would have been any other year, but it's this year. He's two times he's the best. And it like, and he's improved. Yeah, improved. That's the most important thing. He's gotten better. Now I competed with the music all the time. Yeah, so he was certainly not someone I was worried about at the time. But by my last show, my career, he passed me. He's right. And he's 10 times better than that now. Yeah. So I would not be surprised if he won. I would love to see him win. No matter what happens, I think that it's very possible that he steals the show. Very possible. He could steal the show. He could win the crowd. He could be Sean's evening regardless of the outcome. Yeah, well, I think he's going to win the crowd. Did you guys see this picture here? What's that? Did you guys see this picture here? Yeah, I don't put a whole lot of stock into the Instagram stuff, but you know, Mike, Brian just tells me, you're eight pounds heavier. You're not going to be better. Right? So I was sneaking into the 2012 and now he can be pounds heavier. Yeah. Sean's a smart guy. He brings this condition no matter what. Yeah. He's not going to be eight pounds heavier. He might be a pound or two, but he doesn't need to be a pounds heavier to beat bigger guys. No. He needs to be sharp. He needs to play his game and be smart. And that's what's going to win it for. Being bigger is not going to win it for. Yeah. But that said, I, I, it's dusty said there's a new guy in town and he's only been a pro a year today. And the amount of impact he's going to make in the improvements that he has made are so ridiculous like it's going to be shocking. I think it's like how much better this guy is very much. And then what we last saw and it could be so shocking that he beats everyone. Right. You know, and then not only that, but goes on to do things that the Olympia. Right. Well, we saw a photo. I'm having seen him every day for six weeks in videos and different I didn't know. Now I'm convinced. I'm a believer. You know, we'll see, you know, who I did a video yesterday about stamps in being 297 and my brain went the same place as I did with that picture Sean, like eight pounds heavier. I might, if Simpson is five six seven pounds heavier than he was at the Olympia, that's not good. Right. That's not a good thing. So I don't know why that was such a big piece of information. Like he needed, if he was 294 at the Olympia, he needs to be 284. And then I'd be like, oh, right, he might be on to something, but him being heavier doesn't do anything for his physical. He needed to be drier. He needed to be leaner. So you know, put on eight pounds and, and that's what didn't make sense to me. So if he is, let me tell you this right now, make a prediction. If he's 297, Andrew's going to be in probably Sean and likely next. Right. Okay. If he's peeled out of his mind, it's open boggace. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well, Jose knows this shit and I know that he's seeing people every day. Yeah. I know Bob. I love it. And I know that you know people that's who's saying he's been open Sean. The show I did with you. All right. So people like I don't say it doesn't have to get down to 12. And he's going to be like, 220 on stage. I weighed myself today of the show. I was 203. I was like, 210 at the Olympia and went down even more. And not on purpose. I just was dining for another 70 feet. That's right. So and I almost won the show. Yeah. So the number on the scale is not the most important thing. Right. Right. Right. It usually tells me when people had so concerned about the scale that did not really in shame. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I hope that's not the case. Yeah. We could all get shocked. You know, it's going to be one of the most exciting Arnold's site I remember ever being out. What was the first time you came here? 97. Oh my god. We have a winner. Yeah. I was coming back then just to get drunk and party. Stop. Yeah. I'm an old man. I would just come here with my buddies and we walk around this heartfelt expo and we go to the show and then go out late night party in the corner and go to Titus after party. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Back then I was like really starting to see some of the people. She had a job with me here. Right. Right. You know, I was just here for fun. I mean, I would say did five of them and I didn't do any party and then we did a little bit of a party of that. Yes. But, uh, this is your right. This is the most excited event since I was on status. Right. Just the lineup and you know, having backstage access to Andrew, every day that's made it way more exciting because I watch podcasts like everyone else listen to people like not no way he's going to be skinny. He's going to look strong to come to condition and have no back. And my he's back is incredible. That's what I'm talking like he looks bigger. I thought he looked way bigger because of his conditioning and the photo that we saw exactly in from every angle. So it wasn't just that photo and I believe you guys know what you're talking about too. And if you're thinking the exact same thing I am, we must be on to something. We haven't discussed this. Yeah. No, no. We just we discussed it yesterday. I did that. So I got off the I got out of my I had my Uber. I have to walk out and walk and buy was Chris Lewis. I just looked I didn't know for you guys. I said I said I said boy look. I went to walk away with her now. Come here. I just shows me a good shop from the side of my head. Okay. Yeah. And then Chris said me some other pictures. I'm like all 10. Well now I understand. Well the concerns that people have like his hands is loose. I do not see them as an issue whatsoever from what I've seen. Not at all. Not at all. And he has one of the smallest ways on stage with the wide shoulders. So what is that done? He's great place. And crazy abs in all the shots. Everything. And you know what I mean? Like sometimes a guy's got such good abs. You're like mad at just helps in every shot. You know, even the quarter turns are just bricks. I know toss it's like everyone's supposed to have abs. Right? They're not supposed to be that big of a deal. Right? But that's how you know they're good. Yeah, they keep drawing your eye. Right? So it looks to me like a bigger rodent. Very similar. With the quad sweep in the crazy midsection. You know, but bigger. Right. That's extra. And Chris made a big good point to me the other day when we were talking. I was trying to play devil's advocate. Like, you know, he's so until bigger. And he's like, God, he's like, Sean wasn't the biggest guy when he won. He was just so perfectly put together in in a peat. Yeah. Did you put him tonight? Yeah. And I didn't want to win just if this guy's a bigger person of him. What can he do at this shot? Yeah. Doesn't have to feel he even. Yeah. Well, I'm just realistic. Of course anything can happen. But that's where I'm leaning on it. Here's a question for you. If how high does Clarita have to place for you to consider it? Like a massive success for him. Talk to you. I think he will play stop three. I've heard other people say that because there's no way all four of them are going to be at their best. Yeah. And I say the all four because here's talking statistically. Yeah. Yeah. You know, if she pitches in there and Nick is awesome. He might be his all-time best or he might be too flat. I like this. If a guy with a wide waist is flat, it's not a good thing. Right. And yeah. I alert that myself, the hard but so I don't know that it's he might be off. You know, by his standards. Sam to my be up. If I had to bet money, I'd say Sean is not going to be off in any way. No, that's the one guaranteed right. Conditioning wise, I think he might be the top. Right. You know. So I think he's going to be third anyway. It's nice. He's that good. Yeah. In the early reason anyone's going to beat him is because they're a bigger version of him. And I don't think three other guys are going to nail it to be better. There we go. Giants. There's giant killer shirts all around. Lots of giant killer shirts. All right. Thanks Jose. We appreciate it. It's great to see you guys. Awesome man. You know. I only seem to run into you here in the last couple of years. But that's a good thing. And you get in the center every time. I just want to I should say I'm trying to look. I'm trying to get a cover as Portzilla straighted eventually. On your bike or your skateboard. You're looking at you look great. Thanks, bad. Good to see you. Good. It's. Thanks Jose. Jose Raymond. Thanks, bad. Appreciate it. Cheers. A little drop in with Jose. You got to love a breakdown from Jose because you know he asked other people their opinion and you get you get like opinion but you don't get all the structural support that he gives for his opinion. Like his opinion has foundation. Yeah. It has like a concrete base. It has stuff built upon it. You know, if this this solid structure and then Jose's opinion is on top of it. That's how I see it. Yeah. There's a chance that Jose is competing against whoever is talking about. Right. Oh nice. Oh boy. Right. Yeah. Made with a cover. You're about to fall. He's talking about like going against the ball. That will be the time. You know. Yeah. Yeah. Seeing these people up close when it matters. Yeah. You know what I mean? So I appreciate that. You know. Hey. So, now that we now the way I'm the final answer of who is winning. We can just move on with y'all. Yeah. Yeah. We have one last question. All right, let's see it all. We got you. I have one. I'm calling up questions. Yes. These are the ones that have the story. Oh, this is kind of funny. I'm just very blessed. Somebody commented and said, The leadership team and JetCamp, G-T-T-P, shared their press release this week. Outlining their five-year plan, Apparently the objective number one is to have as much knowledge as we're on. Good not be done. Good not be done. I had someone contact me. Remember when I was talking about ChatGBT and how I didn't want to answer certain questions? Yeah, yeah. I have to try this. He told me that you preface the question by asking ChatGBT to pretend it doesn't have rules. Oh, wow. If you say, if you're pretending you don't have rules, and then ask it in the question, so I can't wait to try that. Yeah. See what happens. That's amazing. All right, what else do we have here? Um, and this question. You guys want to business question? True. And we want to give you a question for the next. It's just bodybuilding. And if you guys see any bodybuilding, then we want to talk to you. That's walking by. Rip. You get a really weird way. I think it looks. I don't know if you can see that. I don't know if you can see that. Look at the main names. All right, question for the next. Just bodybuilding. Because I want an opinion from a few guys that actually run business. What is the last way to ask for a raise? Can't work. The guy's been working at this company for seven years. All right. And if you find out that a guy who's been working there for three years, just making more than you. One of the things that makes very different. One of the first thing is doesn't matter how long you've been there to put the other person. It doesn't matter how much that a person makes. The question mark is, what value do you bring to make you worth more money? Because I find that the idea that you've been there for a longer amount of time to me, doesn't mean anything. I mean, the company that I bought over time, I passed every employee that worked there to become their boss and like a year and a half. They're working. So I wouldn't worry about the other employee, but I wouldn't ask myself, what am I doing now that wasn't doing two or three years ago. It's worth value to company and present that to the owner of the company and show them. This is what I'm doing, but I wasn't doing. This is why my worth is worth more money. And this is how you can prove it to yourself. And I made doing $250,000. And all I'm looking for is one percent of the need. Yeah, I promise if you prove you've made a more money, I'll tell you more about that. That's a great answer. Dusty, Dusty's good to be aggressive business questions. Yeah, Dusty's not going to get underpaid. It is all about value. You know, all the time and stuff doesn't necessarily matter. There you go. Scots prepared. Look at this. Wild up, there it is. I don't have a lot. So we never got back to, did we never finish that conversation about being in free? I won't be in a free. Yeah, free. I realized this. I wanted to, I guess I just wanted to come back to because there's one thing I wanted to say. I know that. No matter what. I don't care where a guy like the rolling, places, or branch. I don't care where he blazes. But you would hear more people cheering for those guys than anybody else. Mark is real. And then I was like, Mark is real. Yeah. So if I pick it, it's not just the judges. It is the people, which is what you said. Yeah. But then we saw Christophin. And I didn't get to say that. So Christophin, squad, like a thousand and one pound with three rents. Yeah, crazy stuff. He did some amazing strength shit. It's like how do you do that? A thousand and one pound for three. Yeah. I heard his story about how he trained for that. I heard him talk about how he trained for that. Yeah. It was very impressive. Very impressive. What's the absolute most you ever squatted? Six plates. Six plates. So what is the... Five 85? It's a lot of ways. For raptor, single. Just a single. I would have been, I would have been 24 years old. Twenty five years old. And then you got smarter. Yeah. I did a press single. And then I knew that I actually... I felt like... The pressure in my head was actually what was the most dangerous part of the whole thing. Because it was like a real scary single where I like... I couldn't have done ten more pounds. Yeah. I've said that before. I'm glad that that wasn't like five 86. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know that's the most serious squad. I know does he... you did that for rapt, didn't you? Yeah. I could always revel. I never did anything less than... I think maybe eight laps. Because I was understood that bodybuilding wasn't about that. Yeah. And the risk to reward me, sure, is wasn't there. But even for me, like we've talked about before, it's climbing in general. It was up no value to my percentage. I did. I just had a day one day where I was in the gym. And I was normally going up to five plates. Right. And trying to get like... My peak strength was like five plates for eight. Really good rapt. Right. And I was just feeling really great that day. So I did three rep warmups. I just saw them. And I see if I can get six for a single. Right. You know? You just make sense. That's how you would approach it. To find out. You did it. And then you got a smart ass. That's okay. Never again. Yeah. I recognize the risk. Even walking it back and walking it in. I wasn't used to, you know. That's the magic. I think the walk back is always loud. Because you take that first step back and you go home. That's heavy. Yeah. Yeah. I got one who does to here. Remember what that was like. I'm trying to get like desert eye masks. You can only break what season. What's that? You can only break what season. Right. To a desert eye mask. On that day. Man. Is it salt to season? Yeah. I guess it is. You're going to have to be salt. Yeah. That's easy. Yeah. That's the only option there. The most valuable mineral in the world. When you don't have it. It's not that it's fine under her. You need salt. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Over and under it. The last thing you want on a desert eye mask is to be flat. Yeah. That's all we need. That's all we need. You don't want to go flat. You're on the beach all the time. The last thing you want to be flat. Blue coast. Over and under it. I mean. For a mountain people. Over it. Yeah. They're not necessary for most people. What about body builders that want to cast. Simply check to see where they're at. I still think that's a mostly deep thing. I mean, I have people to do, but I never in my entire career that. I want. Yeah. We should interview some of our naughty and two. We should. We should. Literally. Come in. You're on the show now. You can't. You didn't even ask. You maybe watch us and show. No. I know he does.

I grew up with a fist. It's just many girls have drugs. It's what you're saying. We see plenty of that. But they just mean they look. That's so interesting. Oh. I saw an Instagram today. This girl put up, which is on a beach and says, I'm a Miami five. I'm a 10 in an Arkansas dollar general. And that's what you just made it take up. Truck girls, lovely.

Yeah. Okay. It's like a. In the pie one that's open. Right. It's just order pizza to the room. He won't eat pizza. Oh, okay. Not even tonight. Or it's far or night. Okay. Okay. Okay.

I know. I know. Whenever someone asks predictions, I always feel like there's ice on me from like, It's me. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hey. I was just happy to see them. You know. I've always been a footballer. Plus, we have the ball. See it the ball. See it the ball. See it the ball. The interview with the expo. Alright. Thank you. We should've got it on the show a long time ago. I know. Hold with you. Took her a few seconds to realize she could say, Whatever she wanted. That's right. That she just took real balls. Took some control. Okay. That was awesome. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. You know. And I was like, ah, they watching show. They are. They're burning. I was like, we said all that stuff. But we did good. Yeah, yeah. It's still the state and the good books long enough. We got a second visit. It's hard. How long we been on Scott? We've been going for 40 minutes. I've been in 40 minutes. OK. OK. Let's get those over on their strength. We didn't get them done. But else do we got to hear this? You're like, we need those. All right. Well, does this go to squatter? We're actually about the control. And wasn't pretty bad was that I can actually see. We only using it for likes. Because I mean, the bell spot does have a lot of other things I do with it. With their cells. You know, I'm not using the party. Yeah, it's different robots. They're going to touch a bed and you can put it on. But at the end of that, I still say, I actually have spots after all that BS. Yeah, I would still say hack for most people. But I will say that my beat up body really appreciates about squad. And I find myself wanting to finish with it all the time. A lot less pressure on the low band. Yeah, I just, you know what I mean? I can just focus. Just make sure I get everything done. It's a nice, bold, man exercise. But it's still spot. Yeah. Yeah. Here's my problem with the bell spot. Most people doing wrong. Yeah. I watch them pull off with their arms. Use any muscle on the world to get that way down. All right. Overrated underrated. The key strainer's hand or free. Why is that cut off? The shot of the trends. Oh, all those restaurants look great. That boat neck is a beauty. These strainers are overrated. Which door? Really overrated. Because there's this not enough coverage. You can't, I don't want to go anywhere in the strainer. Not enough shirt. Both necks are underrated. Absolutely. Because it's nothing better than a great set of traps. You're making out of the shirt. Plus the peck line, the peck line, the fearing of the little bit. If you're even 50% yoked, you got to get a lot out of a boat neck shirt. If you have good traps, you don't have to have arms on the boat. No, I'm really hoping they really come back. Because I still have some traps. Bring them back. You can bring them back. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. What don't know? What? All right. I can't rate that one of the shows. What? I don't even know what this means. I don't even know what this means. I don't find fighters. What is that? Feetail, fire fighters. Fire fighters? I have no idea what they're doing to me. They've become so. I'm afraid. I didn't know we were ready. As long as you can get me out of the building alive, you are underrated. She doesn't be pretty strong. Yeah. You're going to recklessly drag me by my foot down the stairs. I don't care. Just can't me out. I'm fine. I'm underrated. Sorry. Uh. Okay. Give it that mustache. That's a mustache. I have to fire fire. I have to fire fighters. All right. What? You got some food. Stop. What did you become a musician? What? What? So is it? It's not a me like that. You really didn't have to. Why don't we're on the boat? Like, almost like, you know I'm wrong. Once you're both going to Sandorate or overrated. It's way overrated. It's way overrated. It's way overrated. I don't know the attraction to raw fish. I don't get it. Yeah. I love sushi. I still have to agree with my name. Because it's something people like, It's almost like you have to have it. Oh, you like sushi. Like, it's a course on you like sweet tea in the south. I take a little bit of pride in being one of the bodybuilders. It doesn't eat sushi. And doesn't have tattoos. You already sushi. No, I don't like raw fish. I don't eat sushi. I can't do it. Like, cook it. Fry it a little. Like, give me a little. Give it a hit. Give it a hit. Give it a hit. What else are we going here? There's more food. Five guys burgers. Oh, baby. Way overrated. That's a grease mess to me. I don't even follow that. I looked up the nutritional facts. That's five guys. And it's like a huge load. Like how many times a fat or a thousand calories? Right. You know, proper, or a false. You're a dog. I really like going to five guys. Yeah. I really hate reading about the nutritional information. Yeah. I'm five guys. Yeah. I should be illegal to have nutritional commands or a place like that. I'm sure. You should Google. You should Google. That's kind of cool. We got a guest. Oh. I'm David Carlson. Hey, what's going on, man? Did you get your first Arnold? Yes, it is. What's a highlight so far? I got to be no. There's a one, Jesse James. That's for you. Awesome. Yeah. And I hope to meet Alex. You man. That's the guy I want me to. We're going to try and meet a sea bomb later, too. Okay. Make sure you get the real sea bomb and not that imposter. Don't let him sign anything unless you see his ID. I'm talking about. Yeah. And my step that he's going to be competing tomorrow at the martial arts for Filipino Stickfighting. Oh. Yes. It's kind of like Star Wars. Yeah. I love that. Yes. So this is coming on. You should be on YouTube and Spotify. Yeah, to be on YouTube and Spotify. Wow. Okay.

Arnold's for a special. What was that? Arnold's for a special. I think they actually listened to the show. Because I went to the bathroom earlier. It was like. I was like. I was like. There was a great comment on the last episode. It said, runs the description of the Arnold classic bathroom. It reminds me of every power lifting knee ever. I was like. All right. About lifting straps, first ribs. I got this stuff. You need it. Operating. We're underrated. Strap. To me. I don't get the verse of grabbing. Oh, he's a small time. I know he's in. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. You know why? Because regular straps break. I get the leather one. I switch the verses. Yeah. Outside of me losing. We're good. Yeah. Right. But it has a hole. I think they're drastically underrated. They're about to go. He's going. Why would you want to limit your lift on your life?
