So I said to Chris one essay, I want to have a family in the future. I want to have a business And he turned around to me and said You can have all of it and be a world-class bodybuilder right now going into this show I would say to Chris like my confidence is fruit or roof like I'm just happy I know I'm gonna bring my best and I'm not even thinking about the competition and now I can be born. I can my head Right, so being able to get out there and show the physique and the crowd would really Responsive so I think I just made me enjoy it more and Mild shots Welcome back to it's just bodybuilding. I'm Scott McNalley with Dusty Handsha and we are joined by IFB pro Sasan Harati, what's going on man? Nothing much. Thank you guys for having me. It's a pleasure being on the show and Been very much looking forward to this one. It is absolutely a pleasure to have you here and before we get into it I have to say like share subscribe comment and ring the bell nice nice I've heard Ron say that so many times. I'm never the guy to say it and of course Don't forget to support the programming. I am mutant. You can go to item mutant.com Use your code Dusty or Big Ron either of those codes will work even though Ron's not with us today Ron already left He's on his way to Fibo So it is the three of us today and we're freaking pumped to get Sasan on because I literally just saw him here into Troy Dusty And it was a freaking incredible show man Yeah, I'm excited to see I didn't even know that you're competing in a few days Yeah, so you know, I'm like oh, so it's good to know that you're rested You haven't been suffering in any way you're just relaxed and ready to get this rolling so Yeah, I'm fine. I'm so trained a little bit this time, but nothing like I usually do So with that I have a little plan here to go way back in time But I kind of want to start in the current first Get us caught up for those following. I know you you've worked for yourself You've worked with Chris what's going on currently for this prep So this prep has been all Chris from It's been a short prep to be honest 10 weeks out from Detroit. I decided to jump in and The initial the plan was to go with Chris to the Olympia last year I the only time I did my own prep was last year was my comeback show after six years Yeah, I started the prep with Chris but halfway through I just Just wanted to do my own thing. I think it was The family thing the routine. I didn't know how I was going to do on stage It was more the comeback was more for the coaching and The lifestyle and a little bit of business traffic that kind of thing So my goal wasn't an Olympic qualification So in that sense I had had a young baby at the time. He was only a few more told and then my second was three or four years So I wanted to plan my own time around that schedule and be able to prep and Be able to get back to my coaching clients and my family So I needed to plan ahead a few days at a time You know with the food and the just the schedule cardio and training So I didn't feel like I could completely 100% give myself up to even a Chris he would have Accommodated, you know what he's like. Oh, yeah, oh I didn't feel like it was fair to say Chris I can't do this I can't do this today. I'll do this in two days and It didn't feel natural to do that with Chris so I did my own for like the last seven weeks Oh, but I did I'm gonna give him a peeled pot It was flat and it was peaked too early and Peak week wasn't the way it should have been but it was a good show It was a great comeback had great feedback I came for a placed for to Bonak berries and Prisau which wasn't you know, it wasn't bad. I was happy with that And but moving forward the idea was just to get back with Chris and get to the Olympia no matter why I had to do This is switched off and It's been probably the best crap. I've ever done it. It's just been Every two weeks at message Chris and say like Chris this is this is super easy Let's not let's not jinx it even like four weeks hours like Chris I still don't feel like I'm dying the cardio was barely I could probably count on two hundred how many cardio sessions you made me do they entire prep Carbs were high There was no stress my sleep's been perfect. I think the only time I started to feel the bite was the last Probably from two weeks out I Start to feel like okay, I'm a little bit hungry now and I feel a little bit tired But nothing I couldn't you know it was crazy. I say to me. I'm like honestly I feel absolutely fine Peek weeks the only time I start to feel it. I think when we start to really pull Pull the fluid out and he's like to feel empty and brittle that's the only time Or than that it's been an amazing prep It's short because I was planning on doing Pittsburgh And then full-eyed message me a Christmas and said look, you know, you should think about doing Detroit It's an early show it'll be you know Not easy but it'll be you have more chance to place So I thought well, I'll do the try it's pit suppose looking to be stuck which it is now Oh, yeah, it's like an Olympia line of mine as some sense So I'm glad I did the try because It was a great prep we landed it perfectly and I got to stand next to the one act which I think Showed a lot of my strength that I've been working on agreed Yeah, so it was the plan wasn't to do another show but on the way back I just sort of something play and think you know I feel really fresh so It's feebo and I'm just I just want to jump in it. I just want to strike while the iron's hot And then Chris B. Chris said why not so here we are for these five days out But to go again When do you head over So it's Monday night. I am I fly Wednesday night so in two and two days Yeah, I'll leave me in registration is Thursday I think tannin is Friday and then the show is a one day show on Saturday So nice now I want to kind of take back to last year first off the the layoff Six years was that a retirement originally what was the deal there? Yeah, it was it was Many reasons the main one was I was tired of coming second No, I was relying on Sponsors and prize money a little bit too much Right, I didn't have yeah, I didn't have a full back so I decided to step back kind of work on social media Coaching just something to get onto my own two feet But at the same time I wanted to start family before it got too late for me and Leon So it was an easy decision to just say right I need a break that break quickly turned into I'm happy now. I'm actually coming every tire. You know you get comfortable right and um But that over there it was a six year break I think by year three I was I'm at the lifestyle still trained I didn't eat Six meals I had maybe three meals a day I still loved it just as much I was I was a bodybuilder I just didn't get peeled or stupidly heavy right fade in that middle ground But the passion and the reasons I did it in first place started to come back to me Prepping all the guys for shows Getting excited for them to get on stage then watching all the the young guys I grew up with Climb in the ranks and I just felt like okay I'm gonna regret this when I'm 60 right I didn't you know I didn't quite scratch the surface of my potential So it turned into like I think I need to get back on stage even if it's just to say I give it one more go and If I can get to the Olympia that would be kind of the seal That I could say and retire happily afterwards I was a long time I wasn't sure my body's was gonna do with it so I had some pains if it's mine now so But I have I have seen some aging in certain body parts And obviously some aches and pains but as a whole after speaking to Chris this is definitely Am I by best so For the foreseeable I'm gonna try and keep going and not for too long But because I want to be around for my kids, you know, like I said so I reckon you know the next year or two I'll give it then what did what did Leanne say when you When you said you the itch was needing to be scratched You know she wasn't 100% happy with it initially, you know early on in the in the break when I started to kind of mention You know I don't know if I'm done yet But I think she saw it in me that I still I had to I had to do it because otherwise I'd have regrets Right and I'd resent myself So she saw that in me towards the back end of the six years and Also it helps the business it helps you stay relevant on social media Sure and with me my physique has always helped open Opportunities of every time I got on stage Something opens up you know like there's a light bulb moment And I needed those opportunities to fall into my lap a little bit so it was kind of an overranger But I've enjoyed it more than ever. I've actually enjoyed being on stage Which I never really used to I always I did the prep and I just wanted to count stage and get offstage and then look at the next go Whereas now I'm actually enjoying working with the crowd and Join pose in a little bit more than I used to when I just kind of I'm taking it all in I love that The children that sense I've kind of got a question that's related to that is you know Loving like you did it before you obviously enjoyed bodybuilding before you stepped away and you came back and Competitively and you know you you have more age now right more wisdom and I think that as we get that Age and wisdom we gain more appreciation for the things that we have you know What is it like give me a couple of examples of like things that Maybe you didn't even expect to be like oh, yeah, I'm back in it and I absolutely love this part of the sport, you know So it's it was probably the part I hate the most it was show I showed it I just didn't I never used ice to be so nervous I hate it just waiting backstage and pumping up and I didn't like feeling weak and behindrated I didn't look I didn't look at it from look at how I'm looking on stage on these lights I didn't look at it from all these years of hard work months of prep and this polished Conditioned crazy looking physique. I'm inside it. I didn't look at it from that point I just looked at it as I feel like crap. I want to get off stage. I want to eat Yeah, I just didn't you know I I love the journey in between those bits But this time I remember a Spain last year I was backstage and then some of the other competitors Was saying hi to me and saying now, you know, we're a fan you know guys I was on stage with my mic class it took pictures with me and that's that to make me feel Okay, so this is this is definitely I never looked at it as it was my dream job So it hit me last year in Spain that I am literally doing something that a lot of guys would love to do a lot of guys would love Imaginetic my sponsors Be able to just get on a plane go to another country and compete with possible prize money All these other things were like all of a sudden lit lit up in front of me and Speaking to Bonach speaking to like better news last year and I thought Right, I'm gonna be the pro bodybuilder now. I want to go out there and part and show when I want to show my physique off And that's that to get with pumped I remember we got we did our individuals and I just came off stage And I and I really enjoyed it the crowd were cheering It's like I was seeing him here and things and never used to see and here back in you know 15 16 17 Yeah probably because I had these like these blinkers on that just wanted to create this physique Get my prize money and go off stage so And you miss in half the You realize that you know you've created a physique that is worth Showing off on stage and that got me really pumped and it made me proud of you know to you know Being able to show my hard work Yeah, there's a decade of hard work, so It's kind of just like all came together You know as as you say that I'm thinking about your routine from Detroit and I shot video of it Maybe I like in the post production. I should overlay that and I'm sure people have seen it And it was a beautiful routine and The the poses that you hit like it wasn't just like your standard here's a most muscular Hand of the yeah here's a most muscular like dusty he had some really good like twisting shots and here's a back shot Here's this other like it was really well put together man and I could tell that you had a passion for that routine and I don't know if you could hear the audience from up there, but there was a lot of people that were behind you at that show too I did and I'm not really the guy who Can wet the priorities. I'm quite shy. Okay. I don't see now I know he's the sea of the old hand the crowd like I said But in that routine, I know it's not a kind green, but it's also not a robotic one. It's kind of in the middle I like watching rodent Sean Ray, you know those guys who have the slow transitions Yeah, I've had this routine as like a template from day one I never used to do it slow enough. I never used to enjoy hitting shots Where is now I get I won on stage and because I was in such a good condition Every time I hit a pose I could hear the crowd So that made me slow it down even more and really hit the poses and Since then I've been working on them because some of my twisting stuff Well, it just wasn't I wasn't quite hitting so the next one will be better. Okay, but yeah, I It's funny because I had this kind of routine for my pro card win back in 2016, but I every time I got on stage I'll tweak it. I'll add something and I'll take something out But I think because I'm much more confident Right now going into this show. I would say to Chris like my confidence is fruit or roof like I'm just happy I know I'm gonna bring my best and I'm not even thinking about the competition and now I can be born I can my head Right, so being able to get out there and show the physique and the crowd would really Responsive so I think that just made me enjoy it more and That milk the shots and Use the music to just yeah, it was fun In hindsight cool now that you've got the backing of a career that you've put together in a business Do you think that that's helped allow you to enjoy it because in the past like you were saying You needed that prize money good point. It hadn't happened to Sement the doing held to live but also just to like that decided success or failure was Did you make enough money to make it worth it to wear as now? Obviously we all all could take a little extra chunk of change here there But your life doesn't change No matter what I mean 10 grand 20 grand is not gonna change your life Obviously it's enhancing but it's not paying your mortgage now have you found that that allows you also to Relax and be a little more present because you're not thinking like okay this will Pay the bills or this will make sure that you know our kids are handled 1000 yes 100 It's like back in if I were on to 2017 at it two shows Back to back I only placed in one of them So I came back in a negative foreground That's a hard pill to swallow when you know you haven't got a hundred percent secure income or good money flowing in that's enough to kind of say what's the point? You know even though you're coming second you're almost making it to the Olympia You know the numbers weren't making me feel You know safe or secure when I come back home and I'm thinking To that's one of the things that made me a little bit bitter towards It made me think I should beat in that guy You know he had no hamstrings and he had no calves why is it beat I was I was questioning stuff that I shouldn't have I should have just kind of put behind me and said right we'll come back better Right because there was this cash Like obstacle in the way It stopped me from being confident and being able to progress and And Finally just it made me just stop all together so I could focus on the security of money But where is now? Going into a show knowing that okay five place first or last I'm coming home They say I'm no no worse off I'm no better off. I'm no worse off and I can just continue doing what I'm doing And because I'm already enjoying the train and again and competing side of things I think not just in houses it brings stress levels down And when I'm happy and chill I always perform better in the gym You know it's it all just it all flows a lot easier Yeah, it's it's funny because it's something and I know you coach a lot of guys now So I'm I'm assuming you hammer a lot of these things same things home But that's a certainly I press on to guys coming up no matter how good they are is A what are you gonna fall back on but be what is left when you're done? You know like you said Doesn't you win this week obviously that's great but you will The journey and the pictures and in the fans and eventually the clients that come from it are Farm they're they're more lucrative than the prize You know, I mean and and using your Your own prep some things as a way to build that business is always the way that I saw it I see a lot of guys who are who are great pros who are making who are getting the checks consistently And I still can't help but thinking about back in my mind you have all this time Why aren't you creating something to build off of you know We just got we go way way back I actually Gave sass the not so subtle Nudge to to higher Chris okay. Yeah back in the day Okay What we talk about what's back in the day give give that breakdowns sass All right, so I used to follow dusty When he was with I false He had a he was on YouTube doing cooking videos. He had a mohawk at the time I bet didn't he? You did he did yeah He did an Chris prep to him at the time. Yeah, that was a big one of Chris So anytime I found something to do with Chris because I was learning I would fix it on it to find information about our Chris's mind work so And then Dusty came up I think he just did the nationals and Then there was all these cooking with dusty videos and training so I just thought I'd like just like watching and I was like I'm gonna minute you can make your green beans taste pretty good in prep And I was just like I was hooked on all his videos and Chris would do his high days and Dusty would go into it and I was just I was a big fan straight away and then it was body power 14 okay Yeah, 2014 mealy on We cut up to meet Dusty and You know I did the whole you know a big fan and I've just competed and then Dusty so okay. Let's have a look at your pictures and I showed you our pictures and he was like all right you work you work him with anyone you know You basically said you know you've got the potential to go pro Let me speak to Chris and I'll Facebook you how Facebook message you and yeah He message me later all the next day or a few days later Said I send me some pictures on a sentence a Chris and He sent him to Chris and then he wrote back and said this is email If you know you know, we'll work with you and I was just like I was I'd spent years just looking up Chris's Q&A's on funny little Not calm and all of a sudden Dusty who I'm a fan of as has put me in touch with Chris's E-Tow And I was just like is this real? So spoke with Chris and he said yeah, let's you know, let's get it started and I think I borrowed the morning off my dad at the time Because I didn't have anything as we got I need to I need this and I need to I need to I need to work Chris He's gonna make me grow and then that was it that the rest up done 11 years with Chris minus those seven weeks in Spain And I think it's it says all tells a lot about Chris because I don't think Dusty I will eff them So it's just so I always think Dusty whether it's in reality or in my head I've always you know, it's it's the style of my career The different story for me Scott yeah was when I opened the photos went oh Shit, oh, I know what a real body better looks If I was can do this with me I can't even imagine what he can do with this guy You know, I could imagine what you saw man because sass has like just you have incredible shape like you're even if you didn't have the size You have now like I could imagine with less size it'd be like oh, yeah, this guy's got something you've just got really round muscle no matter how you slice it, you know You can go back in the day Scott As soon as I looked at the pictures my brain went Slice overdited okay, yeah, okay, this is a guy that's not afraid to work. Yeah But he just needs someone actually to tap the brakes on him a little bit which is what Chris does so well You're pushing forward and then all of a sudden your brain you're like oh, I better I better do to plead a little harder Yeah, Chris is like go eat a cheeseburger and you're You know don't do cardio for the next week and and you're you're just like this is I don't know about this And it never ceases to amaze because And I'm sure you can relate to this ass is like I've always said there's two people that prep themselves for a show If they're less than successful it's the guy who is so worried about size that doesn't get hard enough sure or the guy who is so obsessed with being shredded He goes too far. Yeah, and That's where you kind of fell into the play. It's like It's never enough one way or the other if you're one of those two guys and you need somebody that comes in that you can trust 100% and with obviously Chris is Experience and the way he handles things. I was like I Plug these two in I almost felt bad like I wanted to like send a notice out to all the guys getting ready for Same show. I'm like hey, I might want to stay home on this one. It's it's not gonna be a good day for you Yeah, you're absolutely right Chris is Chris still to this bread 11 years on he's still surprised me this pride really yeah, like He would just feed me he would do things with supplements that I'm like that you know you've never done this before But the thing with Chris is that the dusty said you just don't question it you just You follow what he says and you know it's gonna work and even if he has no idea why he's just done something It works And yeah, even even like I think it was two weeks out I sent my morning pictures Any semi the dive for the next day and then he said send me some gym pictures tonight today Send us some post-work out pictures and say all right take a mind He went from a usual three and a half thousand calorie day to a big seven thousand calorie refeed So so just like you're still what what what made you change You mind he goes At the time I was 249 an reset because you're gonna be 247 to one over one So I know I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna I woke up 247.3 Must is Chris right yep you're right and then he literally he saved me from Probably getting on with another low-dead Yeah, and then it will give the where I would have half-lead on four more low days yep My crap lost strength in the gym and just slow the machine down and just probably just you know push the body too far So he did that all prep be just like Yeah, it's crazy. I just count some it blows my mind even after 11 years. That's cool. Yeah. It's it is something he does gotten it always drives me nuts because any time he'll say a number It's correct like every time he'll tell me oh do this do this tomorrow you're gonna wake up at x Okay, and you wake up in the morning and it's like After a while you just go step on the scale so you can laugh you're like yeah How did you how did you know what was gonna happen before hand? Yeah, so this is this sorry. This is a crazy world three four weeks out I was 256 252 552 56 and I message Chris and I said you know I still like 25 pounds above The Spain prep at this point. I was so chavya And he goes yeah, you look at and then I said And then he said you're gonna be 252 hard hard like sliced and this was four weeks out I was like now that's three pounds away right and I've got way more to lose Anyway, and now that I'm ready to go and if anything with the plea it I'm 250 now sliced Oh, I get 250 too still hard Right and he nailed it from four weeks out that was just you know any other coach would say yeah a couple of pounds a week You know we're gonna lose another six eight pounds. Yeah, but not Chris It's amazing he definitely has that that view now With that What have you been able to take from Chris that you're doing with with your clients whether it's competitive clients or just you know Red clients it you know what what kind of things have you stolen because I know Iran I have both robbed him blind of everything we've learned Ah It's probably like 95% of what I do is off of what Chris has done One thing I tend to find this off doing more and more is Sitting and just waiting to see what another few days on the plan does okay You know instead of well, there's been no change in three days instead of changing something Just say well, let's just give another couple of days Right another couple of days and then find that a lot of the time things just start moving The other thing I've used recently is Chris checks me in every day. I don't know if he was like that with you. Oh, yeah More than one today So we used to be every two to three days Well, I remember when I got with him last year we had like 20 weeks And he was doing every day so and then at one point it was like 20 weeks out said Should I check in every day still? It's like well, I think twice a day might be too much at this point I thought From 20 weeks out I'm getting my money's worth there, but I know it's So I started to look at my own coach in and think you know There's guys that I'm checking in once or twice and they're not really changing So I started to do like you know every other day and then these guys without changing the plan They started to progress Because they you know well, I've got a day or two so I need to work Whereas it's like I forgot a week to check in with us You you don't you know you might pump the brakes on for a like a day or two Oh, honestly So that's something I've taken away and the other thing was just as you know minimal Supplement and just let's see what the body does with it health. I think a healthy fresh body Rested body seems to give you more And one that's just been smashed just to get heavy or strong and And it's okay to get soft in the off season right Yeah, that was probably a hard one for you to digest you're always Your his version of soft by the way is is not soft for the record right Let's let's be clear that Soft to him is 9% body fat, but Exactly, so with the perhaps this year Have you found like what are some parts of the of the preps now that you're enjoying it more now that you're more in the moment That you've really could aren't cut in on and there's are things that you're You're kind of learning in this process and I know as a I've essentially been a step in dad for just a little longer than you now And I find that my life and the things that I learn Become things I try to figure out how to teach so that they can learn them not when they're in their 30s But maybe in their teens is there things that you're kind of catching along the way that you're passing on And hoping to as they get older. I should say your kids are so yeah There's stuff I've learned from crap or just just in general like from from your approach to prep from from doing what you love versus Just doing and you know and being in the moment that stuff I think One thing is try not to second guess and I don't think yourself too too often you know if you say yourself a girl Get it done even if you might not Want to do it in the middle just get the job dog and then Decide if you you know if you want to do it again or continue doing it I think knowing that having faith in the fact that you are of working hard Well, hey off instead of just You know sit back and wondering like what if I did it this way is there a quicker way to do this or you know Like just stop that and just get just do it you know switch that off almost and just get the task done And then look back at it sit back and look back and really while you Analyze it in that sense That's something I would like to Teach or trying to teach because mine are very young still The other thing is Just be in present and kind of just Switching off the distractions In the past in perhaps without the kids I would You know in between meals you're thinking about meals or anything in our bodybuilding you think about training or You know and it can get a bit too much especially when in prep your hungry and tired and it's game quite hard Thinking about hard it is it can really put you off and it can make it worse Where to in here with the kids You know even if you aren't like the energy you can sit there with them You know watch watch something there watching play something there play and go out with them I Think there's there's there's ways you can fill in the gaps in time To make that day go a little bit easier and more more positive less stressful Which in turn always helps the end goal I think so yeah, they've definitely made it Probably why I haven't done any cardio because then It's hard to sit down much and I think the basics I go in back to basics basics in life you know simplicity Go for walk Going out and playing physically Sit together and reading you know there's the stuff that people might not tend to do that much Just kind of shutting off like social media and the news and you know whatever else nonsense is going on and just like just being with each other. I think is is priceless I think I would like them to be Be there you know as much as they can with their with their kids and Promise that kind of thing. I think everything else for them lying if you've got the good relationships there all the time Yeah, I think that's all right Yeah, no, no, it's good because that's that's kind of what I was was looking at because Now You know as an outside just for your description You're a lot busier than you used to be. I mean you were just prepping for shows You're only job was to get ready for the show and focus on it Whereas now You've got a family you've got You know your work that needs to get down your clients that depend on you Their goals don't take a back seat to your goals Which means you have less time to just sit and overanalyze like you said You know just sit there and and judge a long stuff that really doesn't matter I know Scott you know when he first started was was working a Ridiculously busy physical job and You know, I'm sure Scott you can wear that but like you don't have time to do those things because you're doing too busy My first prep the company I worked for before I worked for the pop company They were closing and I knew what was happening and it was happening during prep So they're like we're gonna lay off you know you so you can start looking for work And I was like no man. I'm gonna be in prep I'm just gonna live the dream I'll collect the unemployment for a few months during the end of my prep and then I'll look for a job after that and Oh my god I thought I was gonna be living the dream and it was Compared to the next time I prep so the next year I prepped my girlfriend was dieting to I was working Seven up plus I had kind of like my night gig Doing a Q&A online for bodybuilding stuff So worried about her so worried about getting my job done plus I have all this other work to do online that I Realized it was her day for the show and I realized I'm like why are you two people keep asking me if I'm doing the show today? They were asking me because I was like peeled inside out and I realized my show is in two weeks Like my prep's already over You know that I was in better shape. I had a better experience and it was like I wasn't so self-focused I was you know concerned about other people and taking care of the things I need to do in life The whole time you were saying that sass that's exactly what I was thinking of was the difference of those two Preps sitting on my couch all day thinking about when I'm gonna do my cardio or like getting out and doing stuff You know I'd be much rather be busy. Yeah, yeah, it's funny because before I stopped I remember saying to Chris It was when I thought you know this is this is too much work for what I'm getting in turn So I said to Chris one essay that I want to have a family in the future. I want to have a business And he turned around to me and said You can have all of it and be a world-class bodybuilder. He said like you don't need to be Adoring yates that's a hundred percent You know taking over by yeah the routine which obviously he's on another level but I Was I'm gonna be a donnie egg so I wanted to have a family and a couple of businesses But at the time when he said it I said no I can't do that while prepping for a show I can't I can barely walk my dog 20 minutes a day Getting ready for a show there's no chance but then fastball it now If I was to go back to my old self and say you're gonna have two kids two boys on the five You're out with Ryan being coaching business. You're gonna have sponsors that you're gonna have to work for every day Too slow for You're gonna have a mortgage you're gonna you know There's gonna be people being an obviously public relationship And I would have to turn around and say there's no way I would do a bodybuilder prep in that situation no chance But it's funny because you're right that you make it work like I think knowing that I've got these plates to spin Yeah, it makes you Excel like more so than you are the fall you could and yeah, it's quite Quite rewarding and then when you do manage it you just want to be able to keep going and do more Would do you find also that With all the plates going You're more successful in all of them because you don't have the ability you know like you didn't know this But like when you and I met I still owned five stores So when when I would leave the Like when we would go to feeble When you go you get down with feeble you go back of course, you know the routine you you have a meal you had to the gym You come back you to meal with the team everyone goes to the room and goes to bed I would go to the room and then work on my business for four hours and then Say okay, it's time for bed. I can sleep for three Be up and and at the breakfast table with everyone else in the morning and It's kind of funny, but in hindsight I'm the opposite stance. I'm like how the hell was I doing all of that But it's because you you had to be ridiculously organized You know I've a I've a good friend that's just competed recently when she's a pro and and makes good money as a pro But I'll laugh because I watch like the updates and it's like laying on the couch and saying I just trying to turn to a muster of the energy to go do my cardio and I'm thinking when you're busy It's not about energy it's about time We do cardio at four fifty three in the morning. That's when it gets done because it's the only time you have And then you know you eat your meals when they have to be eaten and Everything is just on a clock and then you come home when it's 11 pm and you're like oh bedtime And you do it all over again the next day And I feel like that is an area that you the people don't understand You can really thrive and and things Feet each other because then when you're at work you're like listen I've got 27 check-ins today I have to knock out 11 of them before my next meal and then as soon as I'm done with that I'm gonna do X amount before I do whatever else is on the schedule and it really does lock you in to where you're more efficient and and operate in a higher level because I'm sure your clients notice like Okay, he's you know a week out and I just set my check in 45 minutes you want to answer Yeah, yeah, I run being on the airway on the runway of the airport in the plane About to leave and then I was using the last bit of internet To do not these emails out yeah, and we were people next to we were just watching like they're all waiting And then and then I I find that I could pay for a little bit of Wi-Fi on the plane so I I paid and I was doing emails in the air which I found was pretty crazy To be careful oh yeah on the way back the Wi-Fi wasn't strong so Again when we're landing and we had a lot of time between landing and coming off and I was I was I was I Right how many emails can I do now? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, even from weeks before I was thinking Am I gonna be that the airport how long I had a layer of rinse Paris? All right, I've got an hour and a half there to do some work and It's crazy because it felt normal to me Yeah, I was when I was on the plane and there were people napping next to me waiting to get off Fall asleep and I was thinking yeah, that's not that's not me right now And I prefer it not to be because I think when you stop It slows down and you slow down yeah, and I can't pull off the treadmill because you've built this life Like yourself you've helped out so many businesses When you slow the treadmill down everything stops the crumble around you Yeah, and if you're all really fall apart quite fast. Oh, yeah, and so just it just pushes you to keep going Yeah, I went out. I wanted to ask you a little bit about training, you know I I don't know. Do you remember sass? We did a podcast together. It was like I got 2016 and at the time you had been training with Jordan and so and that's when Jordan was doing muscle minds with Scott and I Yeah, we wanted to bring sass on and talk about it and I recall you're like, you know this training is not for me You know, which I think is a big thing to be able to say I love Jordan first of all Incredible dude incredible training, but you sit in a room with him and tell him that you want to train in a different way than he trains It's almost like when Jordan talks it's almost like there's no other way to do it That's the way it just feels to me and to be able to like have the guts to even say like I don't think this is for me, and that's what you did I I'd love to hear you talk a little bit about how you figured out That yeah that heavy progressive overload of that style wasn't for you and you know talking to Alex from a W muscle fitness you told me you've got some pretty unique training techniques and ideas of your own So I'd love to hear what you do unique I guess in the sense that they're not they're not They're not new newly invented but unique in the sense that I blend things together I think I guess I cross over different styles Just to suit what my body needs at that moment in time. I think that's one thing I've done I am able to do now is really tuning in to what my body or that muscle group needs at that Set and time in on that day in the gym But backtracking a bit yeah being able to say No was easy for me because when I go back to when I first started weightlifting I was 13 I've all set of weights in my root in my bedroom. Everyone's same story But it was me and these set of weights and this poster I had that I copied All the different exercises on it and that was it that was that was the that was bodybuilding to me obviously I start to see the physics later on in the magazines and the movies but For me it was what what was my mom cooking To put me to eat to be able to train in my room to be able to train it stronger and feel that It was about feel it was about enjoying it with no one watching And I remember like few mom saying I went to school and then the couple of the plants were saying You look like you've You know both of a bit now's the first sense of achievement and I was thinking I did that You know it was it was my training and it was in my room Obviously learning off what I've recognized So fast forward to trying different styles Every time I went into a specifically strict style training A the firstly I didn't like the fact that my Three is a bird mentality in the gym was taken away from me because I've ever been with that That was just I like to go in and like to feel like what I'm doing in the gym Set plan yeah, and then I want to be able to know I can adjust it The other side was the the passion and the feel When I was doing Congress and Global which is obviously it's a great way to train I still use it but when it was a hundred percent push pull legs In for this number on this set I felt like I was in in in prison Train in prison and I had to do it this certain way and if I hadn't covered all the variables over the last couple of weeks And I didn't hit a lift it would eat away of me and it would start to kill that kind of passion and feel that I had from day one And we've bodybuilding If it wasn't If I wasn't passionate about what I was doing it just I didn't I didn't excel like I didn't do I didn't work hard I didn't want to do it And knowing that it's Someone else is planned for us to me which it wasn't it was my choice sure Just took away that kind of this is me like I'm in control And I think that this engages my mind and mind stint You know of how what my body's telling me because I need to hit this I need to hit this number Regardless of how I feel And the way I trained that I had some niggles and injuries by that point who doesn't I wasn't In tune with that anymore so I was sometimes doing a little bit of damage without Thinking about it because the adrenaline again a big set the adrenaline will just must the pain Yeah, it was a different mentality for me so I think that I I straight away I realized that it wasn't going to be beneficial for me even if Even if let's say I followed it and I got the biggest the strongest I could have got What's the point when I'm not passionate about it you know to me it was it wasn't making me lose a money at the time It still doesn't but so what's the point when you don't love it when you don't love the fact that you're going to go to Jim And you don't love what you're about to do it took me a long time to figure that piece of it out But that's the most important part of any training plan isn't it that number one you enjoy doing it, you know Yeah, you believe in it. Yeah, yeah Because that they all work and they all work and then fast forward today that you know someone asked me what's that you probably will you when you love while you're Push-pull legs that you grow and and I'll just say look I I'm not against any of it and I will use any of it But any any time if I want to go in and just do one set on everything Work up to one big set Which I have been in this last office and I went for a couple of weeks when I was going and build up to one or upset I just felt yeah, I felt good. I felt strong. I felt like my body was enjoying it and I was enjoying it But then that it comes a day where it's like right this isn't gonna work today So I'm gonna back off and do Param it up and do three works everywhere. I'm not going beyond failure. I'm gonna stop I'm gonna have a short rest period and we're going in and then you fill in the muscle up in a different way And it feels different Then you see yourself different in the mirror and you kind of enjoy it in a different way so I kind of just Majority of time on a little bit of a higher volume Bro split but like I said I bring you know all the different all the different methods I like to be able to use them all it's like if you've got You got access to 10 super cars for a hundred McLaren push, you know, do you want to just Drive one for 12 months not really you want to be able to just go in and drive whichever one Tickles you fancy that day, you know, I mean right that's another thing I heard about you you're a big car guy Yeah, big car guy Wasn't What's more expensive body building your cars, you know The way that yeah, my most starting Bill would say because of the moment Yeah, it's never ending but it's like I said it's passion Do you find that Having the external like Ron is big on this and actually I adopted it from him but Having the external passions that have nothing to do with body building Helps around you out in a way that not only you enjoying life more, but like you said it sounds like enjoyment is the the key motivator for you the thing that makes you want to do things Do you find that having those extra things kind of Enhances body building as well? Absolutely, I think they all work together. I think that If you're happy there and there Whatever you're doing outside of your but you know, whatever you're doing with your body in mind is just gonna be Don't it's a it's a higher level More productive level you're gonna enjoy it With the cars It was my first love before body building was cars If I was if I had the mind to be a mechanic I'd probably be a mechanic Totally rubbish I broke more things than I could that's what I was gonna ask you so like you don't do my own work out your cars Yeah, I've tried okay, I'll give it up. Yeah, yeah, I just pay all the people to do it now. Yeah It's like my drive to the gym My Echemic experience of the drive to the gym is a part of it for me Being able to just get in the car hear that VA put some music on Um That starts to get me you know get me going My son loves it. He loves the sound I love I love just looking at the car. It's what makes you feel that like dusty said my I had three worth to describe myself that that I look at life I think one was happiness One was convenience. I think one was comfortable Constable right in the way that I want to be comfortable. I like to push myself out of the comfort zone But you know like I don't like I Don't like arguing. I don't like this agreement's Confentations yeah, like an easy kind of you know a happy low stress Sass those those way better than anything It was Under the right Money drives everyone but for me It's not like I wouldn't do Whatever it takes to make a million kind of thing. I would yeah Would go the right route and it's saying like Chris like if someone turn around to me said Sass if you get with Honey run bug you will be second at the Olympia in 2025 No doubt like you if someone said you you believe Chris now go with honey And if you stay with Chris you'll get eight or you get lost or whatever And not that I'm just saying hypothetically yeah, I would stay with Chris because of the relationship And the way we are with each other and just the comfort stress free Easy Work relationship friendship. I've got with him. I wouldn't let that go for You know a bigger check so trophies not at this point in my life Right yeah, so that means more to me so speaking of that and this is something that we talk about a lot at my house How do you define success That's it for you um success is I think is being able to obviously the financial freedom so you're not worried about paying the mortgage or the bills Financially being able to Be comfortable Whatever that means to the person Well the other part that is Working a job that you enjoy the passion about and Having family that You unconditionally love and would do anything for and I know that sounds simple. I don't think everyone is able to have that And I know some people don't have a choice But Being able to go to sleep With minimal stress and just fall asleep happy knowing that There's nobody after you there's just no did the tax money not after you You know you're not worrying about it You know it's I think it's hard to explain for me, but that that success. It's like happiness Pulse relationships Pluffy enough wealth to be comfortable But not stress because I know some people I have a few Millionaire friends here that just I just don't think I'll ever be happy because It's just one thing one problem after another right and they were all the money in the world But they're constantly chasing something to make them happy Right, they're not they're not happy so yeah, I hope I came across no it's perfect because that that's kind of what I In hindsight like when I when I first started Life I'll say I thought I was driven by money. I really did I was like I just want the money just pay me the money And Over time I really learned that that wasn't what drove me I Found a lot more happiness like you said in doing the things I was passionate about and then the passion ended up turning those things into pay days Where You know if I took my skill set to a different arena I would make more money and I would be less happy You know And I and I feel like when I when I look at you and kind of the growth that you've had It just in this conversation even It's cool to see and I and I try to drive it home, you know when you're meeting fans and stuff When you see the you know you'll have someone walk up to you to ask somewhere and they've got Their wife with them their kid or whatever it is And they're thinking in their head like man what what must it be like to be him to have? You know the celebrity and in our sport. I mean you are wildly popular everyone knows you But I don't think that most people realize that the best part of your life Yeah, that family has Oh, yeah, and they don't they don't necessarily see that you know what I mean like for me I I've been going to the shows. I mean this is my 19th Arnold this year Yeah, and it's funny as I'm getting ready to go to Fibot Amaro It's hard to leave home now than it used to be Absolutely and it's also more exciting to go home when it's over because it's cool as it is and I love going I love the fans I love hanging out with the boys and doing everything But you're like man that the thing that really makes me tick is actually at home I want to send and You know what's funny is over the last couple years as my coach your business grew people would say on say you know Why do you charge more or why do you do why do you do this online and why don't you travel More or and I know this coaches that might make twice as much as I'm making But those coaches are also here there and everywhere all the time all they're constantly on their laptop all their phone literally 24 seven And I'm thinking okay, so what's the point what's the point in You know having all that money when all you do is You're glued to the screen you don't have time to be there for your partner on your kids I'd like help is the I am I could I be busy. Yeah, yeah, of course I could but I can't sit down after seven p.m. Once the kids are going to bed enjoy a couple hours of Leanne I'll be having to You know answer emails I will have to but I can have the choice right now to not I can do my work load earlier If I want to go and take the kids for lunch tomorrow afternoon I can move around my work But if I was busy at making twice as much even 50% more than I'm making now I won't be able to have that Liberty What's the point what's the point when you can't make those little memories along the way Traveling kills makers are hey being away from the kids they're constantly changing But I also remember that this is what this is for them as well and it's also for my own happiness It's my dream To be able to compete trying it to Olympia so it's a good trade off when a power is happened to do that all the time just saffron making morning 24 seven 365 days a year That number didn't make sense to me right now I'm just wouldn't be happy and then I think that would have a knock on effect down the line somewhere in some way It'll have side effects you um, you know one thing I have to request as a friend and a fan I'm gonna need you to erase the If I can get to the Olympia statement Because I told you a long time ago when you were gonna go prize like what you'll do that next year And it's the same with the Olympia and that's as as a fan that's watched the sport is longer longer than you There's certain people that just have it and you've always had it genetically But I think now with the maturity you went through the growth the time away It's really time for you to just understand that that's gonna happen and you know It's it's not a matter of of if it's when and You know anybody who goes to a show that you're in knows that you could win it And you know I really do think that if you can Alter that those words inside of yourself yeah for a little while Yeah The seconds are gonna become first because It's predetermined you know what I mean like when when Jay was coming up and took a last at the Olympia I don't think he ever wondered if he could do it Yeah You know and that's what's separated him and you have all the pieces you've got the perfect Foundation I'll say between the family the things that drive you all that it's like You know for for me I look forward to you're remembering this conversation because The Olympia qualification is gonna come and You're not gonna be attending the Olympia to attend You're gonna be going to the Olympia to do damage and I think that you need to know that because I speak for all the fans We want to see you there. I mean Scott will tell you I don't know how much you watch our show But after last year's Olympia I was really disappointed because A lot of the guys didn't put the effort into the show and I'm just a fan now I go the same as everyone else. I'm sitting there just watching and I was like That was a disappointment because the Classic guys put on a show and the bodybuilders it seemed like a afterthought and this is the biggest show there is Now fast forward to the Arnold a lot of guys put on a show, but Scott shared your posing and I was like I Could have muted it and felt it. Oh, yeah, yeah, and that's the part that as a fan you want to have where Like I'm having my own experience Watching you perform And I think that that's something that you have that you got to just climb in on because it is so much fun as a fan because you're like you're watching and you're like I've never seen this before even if you've done it because there's an energy that's coming out of the other routine There's there's an emotion of in a physical thing That we all gather and Scott and I can watch the exact same routine But it applies differently to us you know what I mean so you've got that thing that that's why the fans were going nuts Because when you came out and you were feeling it They started to have their own feeling towards it and kind of give it back to you know what I mean? Absolutely it's funny you're saying these things Up until the show I just did I was of that if I get to the old pier and I know I said it today, but It was I think it was from a few days before the try I was driving and I just felt like Someone gave me some ecstasy You know like I was listening to music thinking about my posing and I just got this pause inside And I was like and I like to stay quite mellow going into a shot. I want to get excited. I don't buy into the hype I was getting excited and then the same thing kept happening every time I listened to my posing music And in the hotel after pre-judging Was practicing a bit of my routine that was just ready to explode and I've never ever felt that before So something definitely happened in those six years Me just realizing What I am able capable of doing on stage. What I can do with my physique Before I don't think I have that belief like yeah Deep down and didn't I New I was good. I know how new I had to have the potential But I don't think I 100% believe that this that's the difference this time I 100% believe it I'm my confidence has been sky high And I was ready to have to put on a show which I've never felt and I think on stage it just felt natural And I remember some syncholine up to me after pre-judging and he just gave me a big hug and he just said Shit, you just put on a fucking show like Well, he was he was buzzing I you could tell he was passionate about what he just saw. Yeah, well I agree with you. I think something has changed and I know I can't I know I'll be at the Olympia And I'm gonna well put on on a show bringing that kind of The polish and the posing and the attitude that I've grown up watching from my favorite pros and I can't wait to kind of just bring that to the Olympia's name And it's gonna be cool because you know when when we watch these There's no one like you And that's exciting as a fan like when you look like when we when we talk on the show where like Well, you got Samson you got Andrew and you go through the list of guys that are similar And then you come down and you're into the Derek and Nick walkers and then there's you And There's no one like you Not just physically, but but how you approach it you know like you said I mean you essentially Especially nowadays and this is where I feel bad for kids these days They get on the internet and there's a rule book now Yeah, it's like well you got to train this way or you got to train that way and you got to eat this and you got you know all these rules And I hope that you get out enough and get on more podcasts and stuff because You were handed all the rules and you looked at them and you crumpled them up and you toss them over your shoulder They're like I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna do it my way and I think that more people will Get something from you because I think there's a lot of people trapped in the box that they are going to be in That when they see a guy like you who chuck the rules And had massive success not just with the result but also with enjoying the process. I'm hoping that a lot of young guys and girls coming up go I just want to do this for me, you know it's like when you started building your physique You didn't say like what did the judges want? What do I want? And I feel like that shows in your physique and it's why you have such a I mean, it's just a different look like when you came out on stage for the Detroit I was like Okay, that is wildly different and I mean, I'm a huge fan of a lot of those guys But you stood out in how you carried yourself and what your physique looked like and it was exciting knowing that like I said I mean, I've never been a rule follower so seeing you chuck it and just roll with it I hope more guys hear your message and understand that They will get further doing what they enjoy than following my rules scots rules whoever's rules Well, that's true I think the other aspect is the fact that you can have it all, you know That's that's the real thing I hope some people walk away with because that's a conversation I have with people You know not all the time, but it is a conversation that you do have with people where they're like you know Me or the family, you know body body building or that you know a big thing you said too was that you know Part of it is doing this for them part of it is like you're doing this as a business for your family But you also said an important thing part of it is for you, you know because you really do have to be happy first if you were to You know if you didn't follow your dreams then then what are we and it doesn't mean that it has to take away And I don't care whether you're sassan her body or you're just trying to prepare for the Michigan State You know Championships it's like if this is your calling in your heart that's what you want to do You really can have all both you can have it all you know you really can't and be 100% plugged in for both too, you know and you're Pershing that I agree it almost It all has to come together for it to be Like I used to watch bodybuilders who would lock themselves away from their kids You know because they're hungry. They don't want to get snap-based like okay, why do you When you sit down with your kids and have a good time like that will take you mind off being hungry tired Yeah, you know, it's why just to go lock yourself away like fight camp, you know Where where where where where bodybuilders were not you know when not fires and and once I realized I can do that The family didn't become a burden it became a boost a strain together to get me through the day two my next meal To the next training session and then throwing them will stand that's my little wind for the day you get there That's that's like happy hormones and like dusty said Once you throw out these it restrictive Or at least say okay, I don't need to follow this but I kind of want to yeah You tend to do something that you enjoy with your training When the enjoyment comes in everything else just falls into place like it's like one big It's one big circle every type that I say to my guys they want to do that first prep Okay, so is everything okay? Are you all right? You know you're in a good place with your job or with your relationship? You know if you've got issues at home Maybe you're in a contest preface in the best for you and you know Everything has to almost be in line for it to be a well-oiled machine with a good outcome and then like doesky said I Definitely one of the biggest Reads one of the things I wanted to get out of this combat was to be able to give back to bodybuilding because it's given me so much It's given me almost everything I've got today So I would like to Give back to the younger generation and just say you know you can do this But you can stay relatively healthy You can pick your shows you can pick the way you train and You can do it whilst having fun and You don't need to throw your air all your eggs in one basket. You don't need to throw your career away to do it Yeah, I would love to be able to say there's more ways to train and eat There's you know you can always make something work when it comes to bodybuilding because it's a lifestyle And I would love to be able to give more information out and my own experiences so I've said no I've said no to podcasts in the past What my attitude now is say yes to every podcast So I've got a Chris total in Milo tomorrow night and I think Dennis James just the end of me I think he wants me on his Podcast so the old sauce would have been like oh no I'm traveling I'm prepping I'm just I'm gonna fit in whenever I come Nice to get voice out that well you're welcome here on this show or any other show anytime you want to come on man We're all over the world. Thank you. I'd love to come on after Feebo and talk about the win Hell yeah, so I love that idea well I want to before we before we end because I know we're so on an hour your time I just want to point out one thing that I think is huge that you're you're doing number one The more you chase your goals personal just for you The bigger your reach gets the more people you can impact and the other thing and I stole this for Evan sent upon a year ago because I thought it was so important you know when he was having kids All parents tell their kids you can be anything you want to be But I think the problem is That's only heard if you're being what you want to be so when your kids grow up and you say hey You can do whatever you want and they look at your life though go My dad did what he wanted yeah, and it all worked out But it doesn't come out as well when your kid looks and goes well you hate your life Yeah, you know, so I think that you're you're on a path to impact way more than you probably ever realized you would obviously within your own house and I've always been a huge fan and friend and I'm super stoked to see this week and I love knowing that I've just got one more reason to brag on Scott that I'm going to Google Watch you on stage and we really appreciate you enjoying that. It's man.
