That's why we love training to the extent that we do because that's where that's what makes that's what it's what completes us essentially And then that's why we pretend prepared to take the risks that we do as well because The risk no reward the bigger the risk the bigger the midi victory Looking back if you had to pick one movement for loading They asked specifically about biceps and triceps What do you think looking back on everything if you had to do one movement for biceps and one for triceps? I know how you think Maximum tension maximum overload all that stuff brutal brutal exercises. What do you think actually? Are the best For biceps in my opinion it would be probably just a single-armed Standing cable curl or a single-armed Preach of the machine curl personally. I think the only heavy Barbell dumbbell work work in the world is not gonna compare to just training your biceps What are that time? I think you literally call her wrong wing do that and then being locked into a decent preacher machine For me is just perfect and then if you have the ability to have something like a strive or a prime machine Where you could then adjust the resistance profile like As soon as you finish that set and they're like wow, okay, that's pretty perfect Doesn't feel much better than that and then first try steps and Then actually obviously I then want to load them up as absolutely heavy as I can and it'll be You've a close grip press or a heavy skull pressure sadly for me But always don't really last very long. I do heavy skull crushes But my wife was feeling really good not so long ago. I know about a skull pressure hundred kilos like four reps It'd be like pretty decent fall But then they were shot Yeah, it's been Beautifully like a narrow grip Smith something where you don't have to stabilize and then you can just load the poundage because One of the kind of the rules when it comes so creating huge progress of overloads that we want Something where we can create quite large amounts of stability and then a Smith machine With the narrow kind of just shoulder width grip is gonna allow you to really lose some decent weight and then Really stick to from that some things got a row and it should be a triceps if they don't That's interesting that you just said both the things that I know dusty totally agrees with Now it's not shocking why I haven't ever even said out loud who I was hiring to Help me grow in the softs isn't everyone already knows. I don't even say anything I'm just like so Jay, he's doing like it's it did that yeah It's a sense the contract, but yes It's interesting Yeah, you know like a lot of people still have that mentality where like barbells and dumbbells for everything like you said No, but I completely agree with you about certain exercises even on certain machines Just you can out load any freeweight exercise by removing all the You know stability factors and you know all that sort of stuff and That's that's one of the principles that attracted me to like hit training back and like the early 90s You know reading about men sir having guys training on almost all machines Yeah, and I think he was so revolutionary in his thinking I mean we we we we we we we don't know that him but then Doria and the don't hate that they were so So ahead of anyone else in my opinion When it came to really understanding how the stimulate muscles to grow I Feel like I feel like a lot of the guys at the time then just Lifted weights had good genetics and then grew kind of just Because they were always destined to look that way if they just got a pair of weights at their hands Yeah, but if you think about like curling a barbell I'll tell clients all the time like they'll say why do you like to use the cables on a curl? I'm like do a do a set with a barbell curl not do the same thing with the cable the constant tension You can't deny is ridiculous Absolutely Like the way that you could feel every aspect through the range of motion through where the cable cow is It's very very different Yeah I'm I work my way up again to a hundred kilo barbell kills or hundred kilo easy barcals Right that Doesn't your remotely compare to a single arm cable curl using a small proportion of the overall load? Yep, I still Think that you know Dorian came along. I was right there for it. I saw it the arrival of the whole thing And he changed everything and Everyone was thinking differently and then Ronnie came along All of a sudden everybody wanted to squat again and deadlift and lunge in the parking lot and it was all good because they all wanted to train hard lightweight baby But it wasn't Dorian's style of training. It was it was volume training No one two three four sets and the four set is a heavy hard one and the forms a little loose on it You know That sort of training and he was super Strong which was impressive, but he was also Ronnie and I have no idea still how he was capable of doing the things he does Yeah, it's my blow it's my like I'm strong on one set if I do singles and doubles working up to that one set He was able to do some of that after doing like 12 eight sorry 12 10 eight and then he'd then go Like I work eight or like a working 12 like it was crazy how much he was Feteving his muscles before he would then even do kind of work sets Yeah, the level of poundage that he was still able to use was astronomical The funny thing is is that when everyone started training like Dorian I saw the whole sport progress And then while everyone was training like Ronnie I didn't Think the sport really progressed as much because Ronnie's Ronnie and I think that that sort of interrupted the progress at Dorian's training Broad us in a way Took it out of the out of the spotlight and and put it in like the dark closets like where you were and where Dusty was and I was and it wasn't necessarily the way everyone wanted to train and I sometimes wonder like You know We're seeing you know the popularity of progressive training you know largely because of figures like you Obviously and I'm just wondering if if you know what would have happened if that style of training would have remained in the main stream Do you know what I'm saying oh I think we just said they seem Well, I don't know if really it's easy it's hard to say because For Wherever reason there was still incredibly muscular physiques that came along But certainly yeah Would have been interesting I think what you see is the your top guys are always your top guys? Yeah, like they're always gonna. You sure but your guys that are That next group and the one behind that those are the guys that are impacted You know, I mean let's think about JP if if guys like you and I trained like Flex Wheeler You wouldn't even know our name like But I mean nothing I mean I don't care how much drugs how much food There wouldn't have happened that's just the way it is Whereas I think some that's why hate it because I've had people say to me. I've never seen Phil he do that and I'm like I'm a white human average genetic sky And he is the best genetics possibly ever why are we in the same sentence? Sure like you know or they'll on the flip they'll say do you think Phil should have trained more like you and I'm like absolutely not Why So we're natured he doesn't need to miss it the rest reward and the rest reward per us is is a must I think is when you have a physique as talented as him He doesn't even have to consider taking those mini victories from a training session no Whereas for us Please don't take this in disrespectful way, but that's kind of what we've got Overgourmet That's a fact That's that's So I totally relate to what you just said dude Yeah, so that's why we love training to make step that we do Because that's where that's what makes that's what it's what completes us essentially And then that's why we have prepared prepared to take the risks that we do as well because The risk no reward the bigger the risk the bigger the midi victory What's the talk to the the fun like I said I mean like you if you took away all the the the fame of train by jpe And you had a job working somewhere you would go to the gym and do what you do now Because like that doesn't change and that's that's why like like people got confused because they're like no You've been blasted for the last two years. I'm like I don't know how to train in the other way That's what I like to do I wasn't trying to get bigger I was trying to beat numbers Like that was that was competitive against myself whether there was an Instagram or not I don't think most people can understand that that's just loving lifting weights Sure You know yeah, I wouldn't trade though that's what's funny. I wouldn't trade with those guys even for their wins because I don't imagine That they love it the way that I do maybe they do But I just have a hard time imagining it's as fun to squeeze weight as it is to We got one more wrap I believe that they love I'm motivated the different things right I genuinely believe that I believe that training for a lot of them is often a chore Right, I've sadly witnessed it firsthand with very special individuals The they just don't love it. It's always like they have to do it It's like fuck I've got to go train it's for us it's like yes I'm always trained So yeah, they definitely love something else I think they love them just the money the notoriety the fame Then again who would love all those things in that position yeah, I'll take those as well Okay, both please thanks
