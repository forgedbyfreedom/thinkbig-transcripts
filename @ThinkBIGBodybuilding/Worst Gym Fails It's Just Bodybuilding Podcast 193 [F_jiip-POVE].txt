the uh... we got a Q and a episode a yes yes we actually a bunch of stuff here too uh... maddie is literally moving my mouse and some of the bring her up here there we go look at that hey maddie so it's dark friendly yeah right as well come is there anything go with it we got to talk about before we do questions to talk about anything really got to take a special going on here no i just said something to start us out with an absolute bang though this is good yeah you're new me and we'll go right to this okay alright alright so really i'm most interested in the second part but the the first part from James norton is a would you rather he says would you rather a drop of forty five pounder on your toes from chest height be miss the dumbbell rack and smash your hand into the rack with an eighty pound dumbbell see walk a six plate squat out of the rack and then slip on a banana peel and then there's an extra question which is what's the worst gem accident that you've ever seen so yeah i i i i i would get to that one but we have to get through the ABC the ABC i would rather smash my hand on the rack with an eighty pound dumbbell the plate i i've seen people drop plates from like hip height unloading a leg press break a foot and have it break multiple bones in their foot like surgery required to put their foot back together i one of the craziest things ever saw was a guy it is kind of daring i'll never forget because that might hold jim and emiton he pulled a plate off the leg press i've told this story before a drop it and it hit landed on his big toe oh yeah he got just crushment so he limped to the front said hurt like you know ten out of ten walk to three run three you saw the last episode of jamey you'll understand we're trying to get nice to the other i'll be aware so he drops it on his toe goes to the front long story short starts taking a shoe off and his sock is all soaked with blood like hit like he doesn't even get a shoe off his foot and he realizes his shoes full of blood he's like oh put it back on straight to the hospital he popped his big toe right off his foot oh my gosh he had to pair of vans on he was wearing vans the plate landed right on the knuckle of the big toe and just popped it off his foot didn't cut his shoe didn't cut his sock but the pressure hit right on the knuckle blew the toe off the only thing still attached was the skin on the bottom and the tendon on the legament on the bottom so the skin and the legament on the bottom were intact but the bone was open white knuckle bone on bone completely open when they took his sock off they cut it off and it was hanging by skin and legament so they had to sew the top legament back together to put the knuckle back and then stitch the toe on and all that stuff they saved it and saved it yeah he kept his toe he had surgery on his foot and it was like a rehab time but that 45 pound plate popped his toe right off and it was kind of a mumble I think I beat the computer on and well actually the robot will heal the story and feel they're justified I mean if you wish I was the first one yeah so yeah that was so when he says drop it from from chest height I'm like no way I saw my old training partner we were squatting once in high school and we were bad asses we were squatting two plates we're repinout with two plates no problem getting up to three plates and he's got two plates on his back and he stepped out of the rack and it was one of those old open squat racks you know where you just stepped back you know and there's still like rails below you but as he stepped back he tripped his neck to heal and he fell straight back and landed on his feet between his knees oh and it just bounced off of him so like his shoulders hit his knees folded him in half and then he just sprung off of him and like the two plates flew behind him and he like sat back up and he looked at me and I was like are you crippled? like are you completely broken and he was like sat there for a minute and he like moved around and he got back up and he was like I don't know how I'm okay he was like really shaken up and scared but he didn't like didn't crush him the plates like I don't the plates like they didn't touch the floor right because he folded in half they like bent over his back and sprung off behind him it was crazy that was close call how about you dusty what would you go with first and what have you seen in the gym definitely in the hand because I've done that before and it's more like that's like an adjective you're like mother who did who came up with this design to have even if you've really broken it once now they actually don't have the hole in between you can there's actually a place your hand would still hit metal but so yeah that's for sure the one I would take there the worst thing in the gym and this is something that people should make note of particularly well people they don't have a brain I guess we'll say actually saw someone doing a dumbbell press off of a ball like a ab ball you know not thinking that that ball has a maximum amount of pressure it can handle his body plus the weights so when it popped and his elbows were bent at a 90 and hit the ground spiral fractures of both forms just exploded his arms but was it loud when it popped oh yeah yeah and it was a disaster and the only amazing thing in Ron can appreciate this the only thing the gym had to pay for because he would have owned him even though it's his dumb fault they gave him a free membership he literally paid for his own like using insurance to his own thing I mean he could have railed them over that he didn't he just was like I'm gonna do it yeah the surgeries they gave him a free membership and that was it yeah I mean so I actually then since then saw two guys when I got back actually when I moved here on a Smith machine with two 25 aside on the ball and I was like you know what and they're older guys and I could tell that they were gonna be a whole yeah and so I decided all right I'm not gonna walk right up and tell them because they'll think I'm a mass so I'm the front desk and I said hey this is not my job but I promise you this gym name will change if that ball pops so I suggest someone go tell them that this is not a good idea yeah you Americans in your lawsuits oh that's the truth I was actually just saying this yesterday I want to have my own lawsuit you have waivers not like and this is why so flannel shirts is a big thing as Scott is wearing one of the things I really enjoy a good flannel and Costco makes great flannels okay I've seen a $1 yeah they don't make them for fat people like me there's no three XL no they go to two XL they go to two XL this is the two XL they're fat shaming they're fat shaming and I'm coming for him and so I talked to a friend about it and he thinks that I need to think that I'm a tranny possibly because that'll help my case so I'm a woman that just happens to have junk you're an obese woman obviously that wants a flannel but Costco's holding me down and he thinks that based on our country that'll and I don't need any I just want them to make three XL so they'll probably just make you three XL you cheaper all of them than paying the yeah they should go through because you gotta remember like I got to buy all these shirts from Rob now Bailey and I pay like $86 for a flannel and it's a great flannel don't get me wrong but I've got like $600 in flannel's upstairs and that means I have eight of them yeah yeah yeah yeah you say so the reason this came up last night is my mom text me and says does Daniel want this flannel it's on sale for $12 it immediately just pissed me off beyond belief then she goes to register and it's on a further sale with $6.38 I want three XL I'm suing in Costco yeah not really people relax there you go and I ran to all that way without swearing once you welcome I'm feeling really good I'm feeling good that's unbelievable I have one story I've told you guys of one story I haven't and the one story I haven't I was involved in now you know the like the T-barrow machine or you stand up on the platform and then you pick the handles up we had that set up with the way this machine worked we had that set up with a plate sitting on it so that the bar didn't go all the way down to the floor and you know what I'm talking about yeah yeah yeah you put that between the foot plates and I can't remember what we were doing but it was a long set maybe there was like a strip set to a kind of thing and I'm rolling away and I have my eyes closed and I get to the end and I just let it down now I didn't look but my training partner had wanted to adjust that plate and he reached his hand down and had his hand like holding this little ten pound plate and I let that thing boom land right on his hand just splatter just thumb it wasn't changed it wasn't yeah I know man I had no idea I had headphones on you know I'm not thinking about his hand at all like nothing should be in the way there while I'm training worst case scenario I'm taking it goes down to the floor if that plate falls and that's fine too which you know anyway I felt so terrible he still trained too he didn't it wasn't like a devastating like destruction but it was it was enough to make his thumb bleed that that was not good other one though I was not there for it was the talk of the gym and I did tell you guys this about this one a long time ago it was on the hammer strength leg press that's kind of more like a 30 degree angle instead of a 45 and it has like a hundred different you know ears or pegs to put plates on and some guy who had no business probably even doing five plates on each side literally loaded the entire thing up like the entire thing all the plates so there was like 20 plates per side and when he unwrapped it it just came straight down on him and somebody I knew shot a video like right after it happened he just like turned it on it something the video what ended up happening was the whole sled came straight down on the kid it bent the the stops you know you turn the handles in and there's the stops it literally bent them so that they were broken basically went into the floor and it threw him out of the machine he was on the floor next to the machine when this happened just boom popped him right out and he was like laying face down which they had to take a lot of knees to the I don't know exactly but they had to take him out of the structure he couldn't walk so I got to know what possesses people to just do something like that like I don't need to be told my first time in the gym that I probably can't put all of that weight and do this it doesn't if I were to go I don't know jump on wrongs bike when I'm in Vancouver in two weeks I'm not going to just be like how do I spin this drowned and I said don't get me and just jump like you do how many just try to not fall just like this ride and circles for a few weeks yeah so I don't know if I told you guys about what did I say about the weird kid that came into our gym a few weeks ago? Nope, nope and we had to ask him to leave? No, oh wow so you know you get the odd person at a gym you know our front desk people are great you know they're very nice they're they you know hello how you do and welcome to West Coast you know that type of thing because that's you know that's how you train your staff to be and welcoming everyone and this kid comes in and he's like 16 approximately is like a teenager and he's got these two adults with them and you know there wasn't an owner actually did it was there but he was training right so did it was training and he comes in and he talks to the front desk and and you know they're very nice he says oh I want to work out you know I want to pay a drop in and you know these two people are with me they're just they're my like assistance and the staff kind of got the vibe that he was like like had some had some had some needs but he was very like fluently vocal and speaking and I'm here to work out but they seemed like they were with him to help him out you know what I mean and they seemed like they weren't like friends or family like they were older than him they were dressed like counselors you know that sort of thing like I think the one had a clipboard I don't know but they thought okay well this is a kid that you know when we're very welcoming right like they thought this kid that wants to come training the gym maybe he's you know it doesn't get to go to you know gym like this often so they know let him in the train it was really quiet too it was like early in like mid morning right so it was a good time to let him in they let they let they don't know there's this kind of interesting kid here I don't quite know what these people are doing with them but I think they're helping him you know that sort of thing so did those keep in an eye on him right away he like puts five plates aside on the Smith machine like he puts a plate aside Benches it two plates Benches it three plates Benches it but as he puts weight on his reps get here and shorter right but he got three plates like he's he every side of the half reps like half reps with three plates right so it's like okay he's going to release yeah and always going to four and like like Ditto's like well Jesus this kid kind of looks like he trains and he's like seems to understand how not like he seems like he knows what he's doing but his reps are getting like so he's kind of keeping an eye on him he goes up his five plates on the Smith yeah yeah yeah he goes and puts five plates on the Smith and then like unrax it and holds it and then rax it so we're like okay like Ditto's like okay this guy's trying to pretty dangerous so he they take all the weight he puts his weights away too like oh okay that's over with he goes over and starts doing this crazy stuff with dumbbells that are too heavy and Ditto kind of watches him but his reps are but he puts his dumbbells away and he starts loading up the leg press and at this point Ditto's like okay so he goes over there and he's like hey guys like because the rest of the gym he's going so heavy that people are like what's this guy doing right and finally Ditto when he gets to the leg press and he starts putting plates on Ditto's like okay like goes over and he talks to his assistants he's like hey like I don't quite sure what's going on but we're gonna like he's got to shut this down this is too dangerous like the members are getting freaked out and I've seen some stuff that's not you know not a great idea and they were like yeah he doesn't listen to us sometimes but so they like they talked to him and and they all left without an event and then the one one of our members comes over who's a cop and he goes hey you guys asked that the guy to leave because he had just gotten there so he kind of saw the tail end of it yeah and he's like oh he goes that guy can be very violent oh he goes that guy those are that he's like kind of like I don't know like maybe he's in like a halfway house or whatever and he had like a day release or something yeah but they let him go on a you know let him go do something you know what I mean and he wanted to come to our gym and work out but we don't know the full story but we just know this cop came up and said that guy's like we've had to deal with him sometimes like if he doesn't get his way like I guess he was at the rec center and like they asked him to leave or something and he ripped the computer off and asked him like through the computer and started like freaking out and everything so like he said like you just never know who you're dealing with there's like these people that are on the verge right and they're just amongst us and you know you know you trying to be nice and nice and hospitable to everybody but yeah you just never know so we didn't have any problems with them but you know he was doing dangerous had to leave yeah so you get the odd thing like that you just you never know when it's when you're gonna get something like that he's got to keep your eyes peeled yeah all right so wild move on here I thought that'd be a good one I knew Ron would have something there okay over under sugar free foods putting protein bars catchups ice creams etc well it's a funny it's hard for me because some of them I would say vastly overrated like cookies and stuff if I'm gonna eat a cookie I just want a cookie yeah I want a chocolate chip cookie made by my mom that's what I want right and um but if I'm having like catch up and I'm dieting sugar free catchups like my best friend so I'd say underrated you know what I mean so that's a hard category for me you know I'd say let's say I'll give a flight I don't want to be adequately rated I'll say I'll say generally overrated yeah generally overrated I'm gonna agree with generally overrated um but here's the thing I find that the majority of those things are terrible yeah terrible okay so you if it's shaped like a cookie and has dark specs and it is not a chocolate chip cookie if it tastes like sawdust and I I've fascinated watching people that are like oh it's pretty good for what it is I'm like it's not good you have to be just so hungry and so dieted for that to taste good yeah so but the only caveat to that is this you said sugar free which leaves the few things that I use safe I don't use sugar free but I use no sugar added ketchup yes and I use that even now because I just figure why like I because I do have the cookie probably every day um so I don't need to have my ketchup that's the full gas ketchup and I really do think that like that version tastes identical um but yeah those of you who are looking for ways to like you know not like have all these things they don't exist you know I've had those weird ice creams that they claim were the same I'm like now and you've never had like really good ice cream this is not good yeah so it's certain things in life I want really good ice cream yeah you know like one that blows my mind right when they're like oh it's healthy pizza I'm like just have a pie you'll be fine yeah you'll be a certain things I don't want you to with I don't want the diet this and diet that for certain items yeah agreed can we please get a seat on we need him one episode a year next Wednesday maybe yeah we yeah I said I'll be both he said on Mondays he goes I can't do Mondays I have to get high or drunk by noon to make it through there's too much going on so Wednesdays are better cool yeah all right I can make Wednesday we're dead we'll figure so no we got a seat of coming you know and next one was um do you think that of Dorian listened to Mike Menser 100% he would have lasted long enough to battle Ronnie well um he did battle Ronnie and he beat him 97 Ronnie got ninth there you go just not the Ronnie you're thinking of right pretty damn good Ronnie you go back and see ninth place Ronnie you're lucky to admit though like do you think that he just like I hate I hate when they say overlooked but he was getting he was losing the guys that weren't better than him then he wasn't ninth place in that show he was not I mean his his waist was so timing and the shoulder was so wide Ronnie was getting a bit of the shaft before he got the LNP I'm definitely going to go out on a limb and say that he was really good those couple years before the oh really good yeah no bonkers um no I think I know Dorian did what Dorian had to do and and um in fact if Dorian would have listened to Mike Menser less he might have lasted longer that's a great answer actually that was very true you just nailed it that's that no one could say anything else now we're done run just close it up all right JM 15 he says um if an Olympia level athlete like Nick Walker James Ian hunter approached you to be their training partner for the year do you think you could still hang with those boys day in day out through an off season and through their Olympia prep without question absolutely I would have to just want to do it that's all yeah you know what I mean I mean you know like I said there's you know I already trained with a very serious competitor you know my training partner is already a guy who's you know working really really hard relentlessly to improve and has already done extremely well at his first two shows um and has also changed his physique radically in the last three years so you know everyone's seen us training in the gym the last three years and you know I've been pushing the shit out of him to improve and it's the the results have been obvious so I know I still have it in me to train with a serious competitor obviously raising the bar to an Olympia level competitor you know you've got to be a little bit you know I mean every shows the same everybody will just trying to get you know trying to train as hard as they can so not a lot changes but within a Olympia level competitor there might be a few little things like you know there might be the odd day where I can't make it because I got something going on or I asked Braden hey can we move our training time on Saturday like the odd time whereas maybe with an Olympia guy that's off the table yeah like you never know right so but yeah I'd have what it takes easily to jump in training intensity wise no no problem I'm taking plates off if that's what they think it means then that's not really what a training partner means though people who think that hanging with someone in the gym means using the same weights are completely missing the point yep of what hanging with someone in the gym is I've had people hang with me I've had people where I was struggling to keep up with them and they didn't train as heavy as I did they were using less weight but they're paced and they're you know volume and this other thing so there's not less so many other factors but the weights isn't what I judge a training partner on some of my best training partners some of my my very best training partners were natural guys that you know bench to play an half a side you know so I literally just had that conversation yesterday run I've trained with a guy John on the weekend on Sundays for legs and I realized it through my entire career I never trained with someone that was stronger than me but I had people that I'd be noticing there because we always trained obviously progressive overload I'm like oh he's progressing from his weights faster than I'm progressing from mine right so he's pushing me and I think that that's the weather mine's 405 and the barn years 315 if you got 315 for 6 last week out for 9 today I added one rep you're closing that gap you know that is you know that's the kind of push I enjoy is that plus the verbal side you know it's funny but he was training last Wednesday I'm watching and you know I'm sure you've had this before run where you're supposed to train with two guys and a couple more guys show up and then you guys just say I screwed wall training together which is a terrible idea um I saw that and I would never do it I'm watching these guys all train and I laughed because he the guy I'm training with is doing a satney misses a set on squatting on a Smith and I couldn't help myself I like I mumbled it under my breath but the way I do it where everyone can hear and I'm like man five guys deep and not one guy ready to spot somebody I blew my mind that's that they allowed him to miss yeah with four guys standing there I'm like that's your sole purpose so it's I just told him it's funny because I'm like I can't when you train with me I don't care how strong you are but you need to be here same thing if I'm under the bar I see on your phone I will literally try to get out of my damn gym yeah get away from me like no yeah you're here with me I'm here with you that is it so don't get distracted because even if you're warming up you're distracting me yeah I see it I'm like what what's happening I got three fifteen oh my next weight is is training weight so yeah I agree with you 100% that it's not I think that there are guys that would like hell I'd love to have James talk me through a workout when I was in my prom and I'm training with me because I'd love to know what his sick mind would say and what he could get out because he would get stuff out of you you know or when I trained with Dorian that time he was he was not the Dorian he used to be yeah he was whipping my the whole time yeah yeah yeah yep yeah training with someone who who's there and present is is a big part of it you know yeah and you know wow what else please get a question all right let's see here uh question for the next episode can you give some cues to activate the hamstring in the back shots thanks yeah it's it's um it's all about the floor the hips it's all about the floor people think they have to flex everything you don't you just you create tension by sweeping your foot like you know behind you you put your you put the ballier foot on the floor flex your calf and then just create some backwards tension and everything should just flex it posing was posing the legs was always so easy to me it was always really difficult for me to understand why people couldn't understand tension through the floor up through the hips I mean we talked about the quad things but the hips I have that rant and it's the same from the back both glutes and both hamstrings should be tight and your calf should be flexed I don't see how it's so hard and you don't have to think about any of it you just have to pull your feet together on the floor you know like it's it's through the floor you're creating tension it's like you it's it's like high green I was talked about but the the main thing that I the reason I think I learned it is because of martial arts I think in martial arts every single position we were taught your feet have to be exactly in the right spot every time or it's wrong do you know what I mean like you're learning your forms and your feet have to go there and you're sitting on your you know your crouched down semi crouched all the time so your glutes are always tight and and there's all this sort of like movement that I think taught me a lot of that because it all came so easy to me what about you Dusty any cues for backshots the only thing I was going to add that I learned early on um which might be hard to explain uh without saying next to someone but I got told me same thing plant your feet turn your knees out or you know turn onto the side and then you said with your back leg the one that people tend to shake with because they're squeezing their hamstring you're not squeezing your hamstring act like there's a string on your kneecap going straight to the ceiling and just pull up on that and just feel your knee come up your hamstring just literally fires and you do nothing like it it's night and day you don't actually lift your foot I like that you don't actually lift your knee just feel it pull up and all of a sudden your whole hamstring will pro there's so many things like that same thing or like a tricep you know if you take your hand and take it for the damn thing if you do that your your tricep naturally wants to pull in a direction because all your your muscles and tendons are connected so a lot of things are just a matter of moving the body different not necessarily squeezing yeah and squeeze honestly the worst thing you can do like you know same thing with like you said with it with your hips rod it's like you're not squeezing your quads like you want to pass it on stage lock your knees it'll be exciting quickly I promise you know but planting the ground push it on your feet push it on your knees a little bit and then things will go up all the way so I think the biggest thing that I used to practice when I was trying to learn my body was being able to to fire muscles in any positions like sitting on the couch with my legs were straight excuse my hands yeah okay now sitting in a chair with my feet flying the ground I can squeeze my hamstrings because I squeeze my quads I used to do that just just to see and I think more than anything it transferred into training because you see people moving weight and I'm like I can visually see that you're not doing what you think you're doing you know and and back to that what we're talking about the last episode simplifying things is the magic if you're feeling the muscle that you think you're training you're in a good spot yeah yep I'm gonna pose in coach if you can't do it yeah that gives help a ton good posing coach will give you the cues real quick you know yeah yeah all right question for Dusty I heard you speak on a four day DC split that that was your favorite split can you tell us how that would look it's actually a three way done in four days so it's the most common one all this is essentially a push pull legs so the reason that they are confused is because you're doing the full body in three days but you're training four days a week so the fourth day is the Monday repeat so like ice train Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday yeah this week's Monday became this week's Friday again and the following week what was you know yeah everything moves around so it's it's only a three way split but you're training four days a week so it's chest shoulder strides one day back by one day legs one day that's it what do you do probably knew exactly I just so it's the other thing I altered it around because I'm not trying to I don't really need to get certain body parts bigger so like my back day I'm doing two movements for back and I'm training hamstrings completely with them so that way quads can have their own day I'm doing chest and shoulders by themselves then arms by themselves so just training four days a week okay I always grew better if I trained less so the first thing I had to do when I decided to grow again was train less yeah how many days were you training before that five okay I like to go to the gym I think that's the thing a lot of people forget is we train more because we want to go to the gym but the moment I put a goal to it I was like oh damn I really feel like you're four days again yeah because then you're standardizing everything and you're just gonna and then you can always go up and volume if you have to or you know like that sort of stuff yeah I know what you mean yeah this sort of you know I just need a base for with the with the rest and then because there's certain things like I did decide like I was like well if I'm gonna do this I don't want to just get big wherever I'm like I'll get my legs and arms bigger again so they're like the focus um because I like to with my arms were bigger like they're not small now but I look back at small pics I don't even remember them being that big I said wow I forgot about that like I mean literally there there's something came up on YouTube from you and what are doing clothes one year like upstairs in your gym and like you know I see my arms I was like how would remember them effort being good what is that happen yeah it's fun because I see some guys there's a local guy that um I really like but he had put up a number attached to how big his arms were and I mean there was like no because I knew what mine were and I'm like no you're lying yeah I love that I get feel bad because I'm like ah no no no no no I love that viral clip but you see that that classic clip of Jesse Ventura and Arnold talking about their arms size for predator you ever see that well I didn't see it rings about so Jesse Ventura was like yeah you know I went in to see went in to wardrobe you know for the movie predator and I saw when the wardrobe person put all my measurements in I saw that my arm was bigger than Arnold's and I was like oh man he's gonna get it right so I next time I saw Arnold I call him out in front everybody I was like hey looks like I got a bigger arm than mr. Olympia you'll pro x pro wrestler here's got a bigger arm than mr. Olympia and Arnold's like I bet you about to the champagne that you know in front everybody in my arms bigger and Jesse's like oh I got you I got you so they whipped their arms out and they measure them and Arnold's his bigger and he goes how the fuck and and he goes oh I told the wardrobe guy put my arm smaller to make sure that Jesse's his bigger so that he thinks his arm is bigger than mine so Arnold was like I had him he was baiting him he baited him that's so funny he baited him a number written on a measurement sheet he just left it he knew he would see he just knew Jesse would check his measurements he just knew there's no amazing look at my measurements so he pre said to drop that the couple inches put it with much smaller than that and he Jesse's arms are looking it's classic it's totally around too right Arnold goes to the mental games they work on everybody even even someone like Jesse it's fantastic we got a run play in mind games play in mind games with a navy seal just imagine I never gave a fuck did Ron ever get into fresh metal not just Metallica like slayer testament if so when did he stop following the evolution into death metal etc so I was into slayer a little bit like I had back in the day when we used to make mix tapes I had like a metal mix tape and I had like a bunch of slayer on there with I think there was a little bit of testament and I know there was a couple Exodus songs in some antrax but it was all like the you know the old school like you know the stuff that came out of the 80s and Metallica crew you know the big four and so I was into that stuff and it just you know like slayer I liked them but they were too heavy for me to like really groove too unlike you know normal everyday type of listening you know it just um yeah but you know huge metallic of fan and stuff stuff just got a little too heavy for me I'm just not into like the stuff that yeah yeah yeah what a great song yeah but I mean yeah it's like when slayer comes on the radio now because I listen to serious satellite so everyone's in a wild slayer comes on Aussie's bow and yard and I crank it but um but I never got into like the the evolution of death metal I really enjoy for for those who haven't seen that documentary um a head a headbangers journey metal a headbangers journey I think that's what it's called but it was made by Canadian guy and he he you know goes to all the festivals and stuff and he has got a documentary crew and he he he does an evolution of metal it's a documentary on like the evolution of metal and um it's really well done and he breaks it down like he goes all the way back to classical music and he talks about how metal has roots in classical music and he talks about the first classical musician to use a base that was so tall that you had to climb a ladder to play it and it was really low right so like it made like a rumbling sound and it was Wagner I believe it was Wagner did that I if I remember correctly so they sort of say like this is maybe where metal started it was with Wagner like getting that heavy low low end sound that no one else was getting out of some of this stuff and and he talks about how metal actually has a lot of classical roots like the song structure listen to those early metallic albums are like sym symphonies in a way especially just as listen to the songs on the justice for all they're very symphonic like multiple parts and lots of times signature changes and two guitar solos and one song and the songs are like eight minutes long and there's a whole bunch of connections to classical music and how complex the stuff is and how precise the players are like people don't realize that metal players like metal guitar players are some of the greatest guitar players on a planet like you know they see punk rock guys that you know it's kind of the opposite into this spectrum it's all emotion and telling stories and you know expressing yourself with your guitar and your three chords metal guys aren't like that metal guys are like precision scale wizards that know their music theory inside and out they're like their their brains think and math they're like there's some of those guys at the next level and and that's very classical music oriented and so you know it some of that extraordinarily heavy music like you know go jira and michigan stuff you listen to the guitar players and that stuff that's their distance it's not even like it's not even uh it blows my mind you know but i like music that has a little bit more space to it I guess it's the difference you know a little bit more like head bob and groove and stuff and the death metal doesn't really do that for me most of the time i couldn't really get into a lot of the death metal but when i was about 19ish years old i met this guy became a good friend of mine named Matt mat millington he had a radio show it was like college radio it was called radio apocalypse and he was meetlacker mat and his partner was juggiler joe and nice all they played was like the darkest death metal there ever was yeah met was a character we had a coffee house by me that we would hang out at and i'd seam up there we'd meet up there all the time and talk and he drove a hers he literally took a job at a funeral home so he could get a good deal on a hers and then he implanted these spikes all throughout the hers i think or maybe no he wanted to do that and then the police made him take them off or something i can't remember but this whole thing was like just a carnival on wheels and guy was a attribute and i remember like just the craziest stories you would have like you know over in like eastern Europe those people love death metal there's a whole other culture of people out there that just loved death metal and there was these two girls from Poland that were like visiting chicago and they knew of their radio show because at this point like you know internet radio it started to happen so these things are getting put out there and people in Europe knew who meetlacker mat was and these girls wanted to come out to Detroit for a metal show and they like they wanted to hook up with these girls and they just like told them like the darkest story they're like yeah we live in a band in a warehouse and Detroit and you know that's where we like we play our music there and everything and in this in that and they're like in the girls were thin they're like we want to come out to Detroit and see they show with you and they're like so he was like so what we ended up doing was we we took them that was like downtown at harpoise which is like really cd little club like slayer got banned from harpoise for several years for doing something crazy but they took them the back way they're like yeah this is how we get to harpoise and they like drove by like all because like at the time Detroit was just a mess like everything was abandoned if you went down the side streets so they like took the side streets all the way to harpoise what they could have just like gotten on the freeway and guns from the suburbs straight down the harpoise they like made it like it was this though this is what we have but it's all like right yeah match it as a character I'm still friends with them is good really added to the effect yeah did you guys ever see the old the cartoon metal aquilips i never watched it but I know what it is yeah metal aquilips was great but that was like i i watched that at the time i watched you know few seasons of that but that was good it was like about a metal band that you had these adventures and the government was like trying to get them because they're their music was too influential and you know like it was it was funny but the characters were great and and just the stories were ridiculous you know they they're metal saved the world you know that sort of thing but i enjoyed that that was a great cartoon and then when you go deeper like i learned stuff from that i would have never known like there's the long-haired metal guys and then there's like the shaved head tattooed metal guys and there are two different they're kind of like two different genres of death metal so there's a lot the warring factions yeah yeah okay does dusty not wear shoe laces with his chucks yeah i have the same i have the don't have laces they're called laceless chucks they come that way so they have the whole but they're looking exactly the same but they function because the tongue can't like fall out to slip on so he must have saw a video of you wearing those you have a pair of clothes you keep an eye shoes yeah i wore the black ones they are yeah let's do it yeah it's a mine that i can't say mine frank um i'm free i'm gonna drop a couple got a test you already did i'm letting you handle that you've got it under control i got to be over here walking the path of righteousness like usual i'm over here with a sus in heaven how is it the dust he's the good guy how is that it's been this one of the whole time i get the bad rap because i'm american he's Canadian that's all it is i don't know i've never happened all right there's a couple more in here see those we have what we did that one there's one more then oh and it's not even a it's not even a question it was a comment from page who we all met at the Olympia she's awesome oh yeah i was listening to the audio podcast but when Ron said about showing dogs i had to come on in see the youtube hello hello is so cute oh yeah we had a great we had a great nine days with three dogs in the house it was a little exciting and a little exhausting and walking three dogs is like a different task i know dusty like just has a yard so he just opens a door so it's just cool right now it's like a one pound each so yeah even when i had like even i had the condo like i didn't use leashes because i just listened so let's go back home yeah yeah that's not gonna fly um tell you guys those separate subject the other day at the gym i thought you didn't enjoy this Scott the guy came up to me and he gets hey i had introduced myself i was like oh he was i've been listening to your podcast forever but i've never watched it he goes in something happened i watched when i go oh that guy trains at my gym he didn't know who any of us were he just falls apart cast you're kidding me so he was that's amazing he saw you around the gym and he didn't know you were the guy he was listening to yeah so i've been in the gym for i mean you know he seemed to have many times i got the same time as him but i've been going there after noon my youngest likes to go train like five okay man um yeah but yeah that's you know i draw i'm lost but anyways i thought it was so funny to us like that's so amazing because it's like talking to a world like the the game has changed so much because Ron and I were talking at the Arnold last year how it's like we've been retired for so long i was like we hadn't been to a show in two years i was like i don't know if anyone's gonna care that we're here to be honest um and there were people obviously knew us from before and from the podcast and people only knew us from the podcast yeah and now we got someone who knows me from the podcast it doesn't even know it's me i was like yeah it's amazing right right you assume that you assume that okay there's all these people listening that's cool yeah but if they're listening because they came here to listen to us yeah but there's people that didn't come here to listen to us they came here to listen to a podcast and they might actually live close to us and they don't know or they're at the same gym and they don't even realize yeah didn't cross my mind it didn't cross my mind that anyone would ever listen to me who didn't already know me i think that's the greatest part because i'm like i was amazed i was like so i guess he i didn't ask because i was in the middle of them like so he stumbled on a podcast and enjoyed it instead but it was always audio yeah so i was like that's pretty freaking cool i mean i continuously realize how tiny the world is with things like that you're like you know because yeah i see all the time i'm like oh wild i got a wild a wild compliment on the show uh from a member of the gym the other day um i'll say his name i'll say his name George from the gym great member i think he's in his sixties okay George i think i'm not sure what George jizzie the late 50s or he might be 60 60 something i think he told me but i didn't know he listened to the show and he just comes up he goes great job on the show and i was like that's cool oh and he goes yeah you know he goes you know what i used to like about Johnny Carson and there go what and he goes was funny it was like chit chat you know sometimes it was informative there was the odd serious moment but it was a lot of fun made fun of himself made fun of the other people on the show gave the guest something to laugh at and he goes and you guys do all of that and i was like did we just get compared to that oh yeah no kidding yeah was a huge compliment i was like okay thanks George appreciate that you know you could have me could have tuned the he could have tuned it down he could have used like Jimmy Kimball or somebody yeah like yeah like you know like kind of like third tier compliment you know but he went john Carson he went like the kings you know with legend yeah yeah and i was like oh damn okay well we'll see if we last 30 years yeah that's the trick stop we're here in two years that's impressive yeah yeah so you know as far as like all time ridiculous comments go i think being compared to Johnny Carson was like the highlight of all the show compliments i've ever gotten so solid let's go you guys don't get it though because you you know i came to this as a podcast fan and like there's times i'd listen to podcasts just to get through my work day like oh this is a terrible work day but at least i've got this show to listen to that i really enjoy and i can do what i got to do to get through this but you know it's nice to have this podcast on and and hey i learned something in the process it's it's you know that's a cool thing it's cool thing yeah to do that yeah it's cool and also did you guys see that message we got on Instagram where's that one group message we got like a thank you you know i i know that it was a group message to all of us because i was like oh i got to send it to the guys i don't see it and i look at it because i don't open the other messages so yeah yeah and then i saw it oh yeah so here we go this is from one of our listeners i don't know if you want us to say his name or not sure to who else in the group so this is from Peter okay this is from Peter one of our listeners he said i've been listening forever and just lately i'm seeing the influence of your shows so if someone asks me a question i find myself answering an overrated and underrated format my wife asks me about going up to do something and i might tell her that that's overrated and then explain why i have that opinion we just to say it's not going very well with the wife these days oh man that's amazing that is that we're helping to change lives and and ruin marriages it's overrated that's overrated it's why i have that opinion yeah so wow i thought you know this is this sort of stuff that i never thought i'd ever have so i'm fact on other people's lives like that just start answering everything with an overrated and underrated format i i think the reason so funny is i'm literally visualizing this happen i could just see or she walks in and he breaks it down he's like well you know for the price of that stake that i got to go out of here it drast i mean i can i can work so we had to go out too yeah and then i could see him he annoying her on the underrated stuff like come on babe it's actually technically an underrated thing we should be doing it's cheap but but blodges listing all the reasons why they should do this underrated activity that she doesn't want to do i could just see it get into her yeah oh so it's okay i'm happy to know that you know so okay is that it for the Q&A guys that's all we got to go we haven't the other news i'm still desperately looking for an indoor spot to ride my bike oh i saw you wrote in the and your is that your apartment or your car oh oh it was your right in the back my no my condo park hate is like not rideable it's its way too packed with cars um that was the super store by my house and they're just happened to not be a junky there so it was right so it worked out yeah worked out that's my last resort absolutely must go because i'm losing my mind spot but it looks better than it is it's actually kind of slanted down from the middle and it's just it's the best of the worst it's the best of three it's the best patch of the park aid and the rest of the park aids kind of like just a cesspool of urine and vomit and whatever else happens to be there maybe I have homeless person in the corner making noises but that little piece there is very low traffic to it's in the farthest back corner so the cars don't drive through it all very really often yeah so it's like yeah so that's my last ditch effort spot but it's still kind of blows so right yeah but i'm grateful to have it you know gotta have everything that makes it what do you what do you go ahead does that one of the you went out one of the one you guys were possibly going on the guy turned down or what so yeah the guy's wife didn't want any traffic because he had a he had a really large it was almost a three car garage detached yeah so it would have been easy I could have just like and he had like she had quite a bit of space between his house and his garage too but the wife didn't want anybody coming over strange men like bringing their bikes over in the middle yeah whatever and I thought I thought I had an answer to it because I have a nexus card for crossing the US border yeah and I have a restricted firearms license and I showed them both I showed them both did you show me your gun? I like to because no no no no I'm like you know I was like hey look I've been like like criminal background checked you know like rigorously you can't get these two cards if you're any kind of like you know yeah yeah but the wife was like I had storage only yeah so yeah wow if you didn't want to do it I would have said it was my wife too be like I want to let you buddy but I would have been operated and underrated it to her and maybe work to be like no it could have reason we not coming here could be very you know underrated if say it's an explosion would have happened in your house after you say yeah well I thought I thought the best part was that it's been posted for two months and he's asking 800 and it's been empty for two months yeah and I was like well I give you 500 cash and I'll do a month to month so if you're rented on me for more he just tell me and I'll stop coming yeah like so I give you a good stuff out yeah like there's nothing to move you know so he was like oh that's a good deal let me talk to my wife but the wife isn't now what if they feel like you can't pick the people do that by the way so now every month now here's a thing this is what I like to think every month it goes by we're no one rented for eight he knows he's losing 500 cash out of his fucking pocket because his wife didn't want anyone fucking coming over and the resentment will build and the marriage will fall apart you will get that spot you will get that spot yeah and then once he's out of the house I'm sure she'll be happy to have me over for 500 dollars a month I don't I mean for real though I don't understand and this is always been my thing I don't know why you would have that conversation with your wife because I wouldn't I'd be like I raised you out the spot for 500 yeah that's why I think it changed his mind you know yeah I don't look you like you want the keys right now like forget I really don't know honey there's someone in the yard yeah that's a guy that rented the shed leave alone okay yeah and so yeah and here's your $250 do whatever you want with honey yeah you can buy something with that go yeah yeah yeah I don't understand how these life decisions people make I don't get a dusty I bought this house without asking I went home I was like I bought a house she was like what I'm like yeah you'll like it I don't get it this is ridiculous I know you don't have to google it but I already bought it anyways I thought yeah definitely it should have said buddy yeah yeah I just just hung up I just hung up I just put them on the wall took the whole back wall of the office and now when she's doing her client calls my shit's on the wall behind it we have her own offices so Victoria has her background which is very like zen you know some plans a couple of crystals well you got that you got that space because you live in Detroit where properties like five dollars yeah yeah three dollars yeah American three five can I use yeah yeah so it's is is property still really cheap down there it's not anymore so I got my house for a fairly good deal and if I were to sell it now I could do like really good really good on it yeah plus when I got it I it needed work so I'd like put it in a new driveway and all this so like so people didn't want it so I got a flat the what's that what's that drive way yeah you're gonna use your space be careful yeah I know 500 I know 500 I know for 500 yeah just gonna start parking our cars in the street for 500 I'll take it let me do the end of snow you know yeah fuck it that's like a legit paycheck 500 dollars to do not yeah the literally do nothing you know yeah yeah just shut your mouth woman yeah Margaret's been screwing him for years without question you probably didn't have the he probably doesn't even have any gel center ice package because she said no yeah I should have asked in that right off the bat that's wild yeah that would have answered everything if you have the NHL center ice package you have to ask permission to do things never mind I'm gonna go yeah oh I have I have one thing we could talk about real quick yeah I I use my GoPro for the first time what okay saw that how did it go yeah far as like loading it up and put on YouTube or on Instagram stuff so it's unbelievably awesome the new app and everything that go with it just like fucking awesome so fantastic I just realized after I made the video I should have done one more thing to kind of zoom in on myself better all right okay like I can see it I put it yeah so yeah so I the thing is you know I just I just turned on my GoPro and I let it ride I let it run the whole session right and then every time I pulled like a decent trick where I kind of got one of my tricks because I was pretty rusty right yeah but every time I pulled one of my tricks I would just go press stop start and then you know that the the end of that clip is where the kind of the good the good version of that trick is right so I just did stop start you know for the whole hour I wound up with like a bunch of clips and I just chopped them all off and put them into a story format and then just made a real out of it I'd never done that before from a GoPro and it was really easy but I realized now I didn't do my one step where I I screen record the video and I move around and follow myself so I'm always in the middle I have this little trick and then I use the screen recording as the story clip and I can play it is this it yeah yeah I made a real yeah okay so you know I'd never made a real before using multiple clips I've only just like you know taken a video off my phone and put it into real format you know what I mean yeah so so so doing this I just let the GoPro my GoPro wasn't quite I was kind of off to the side on everything because it wasn't quite centered but I was figuring it out and I did chop myself accidentally when I edited these clips a little bit but but yeah it was really easy it took about an hour for me to put the final the final version of this this together and you know it went it went really well it was the end parts good here I like the little wait till I you know the good little bars been right here boom there we go and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah get the mutant in there right in everybody's face so so yeah it was cool and I just never bothered buying a GoPro before and now with the app that it links to on your phone it's just crazy how easier it is to edit and chop easier to stay on with your GoPro than it is to the podcast on this program I guess everybody's gone I guess that means that we close things out what do we say like share subscribe comment and and of course go to mutant guys use our codes big round 20 or dusty 20 they both worked the same of
