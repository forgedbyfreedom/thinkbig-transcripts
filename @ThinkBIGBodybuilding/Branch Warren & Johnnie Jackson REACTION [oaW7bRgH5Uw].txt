Like how they've taken a foam squat pad and they've duct taped it to the frame there. See, so you're not, don't get crushed when you're leveraging into the... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's what that is. The one thing that companies didn't think about them, not pad. They thought people would just stand on the foot pad and push their chest on the pad, but they're not taking a branch and Johnny just leveraging into that machine. They're not expecting people to use the plates that branch. They're like, well, people use like two and a half plates on this maybe? Yeah, yeah. You can be fine. Yeah. The whole roll is duct taped on there. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, everybody, welcome to It's Just Body Building. Reacts. This one's a good one. Branch-worn. Johnny Jackson training at Arlington Metro Flex. What year is this, buddy? 2013. 2013. Remember, like, share, subscribe, comment, and... Great in the bell. There we go. I am mutant, born hard core. Get to IMU.com, get your ice of surge all in, and everyone should get on the gear. Bam. 2013. Walking in the front door. I still have never been to this gym. I'll leave her note. Oh, looks exactly the same. I was in 2018. Look like this. Yeah. I guess I was told that a few years ago, I think I might have been during the pandemic. Ryan took everything out in the parking lot, and he actually like cleaned the floor. Oh, wow. But, you know, I don't know if that was just a lie. That might have been a lie. That's great. I want to give a shout out to Bruce over at MOC. If you guys... I say this in the description every time. But if you guys want to watch the actual videos, I know some of you guys haven't seen this stuff before, we're just showing little pieces of it. But you should go watch the full video. I always try to put the links to the actual video in the comments so you can see that at the MOC video YouTube page. Yep. Yes. Yes. Okay. So, Branch with the gas-p-shirt. Same one. He's been wearing for 15 years. Ooh, Zach. They're Johnny. They're Johnny. They're gonna trap. Geez. Oh, Matt Lair. Dallas Cowboy alumni. Oh, really? Dallas knows Matt. Yeah, he played for the Cowboys, and then he trained with Branch and Johnny for a while. And I did a gas-foto-shoot with Matt. Me and Matt were doing like the street clothes. Okay. Right. You're gonna find that. Those pictures, that. Let's get to the view. Oh, yeah. I'm still be floating around in the gas barcives. So, hardest-foto-shoot I ever did. Hundred degrees, and they had us wearing hoodies and jeans and ho-ho ho-ho ho ho-ho ho. Tuicks. Oh, it's brutal. Okay. These guys get warmed up. What, what's that mean? What are they playing for music? Turn the volume up, honey. It's like overdubbed music. Oh, actually, no. They got rid of it. Oh, yeah. There you go. Yeah. There's some overdubbed music. That cables probably still on there, probably same cable. That just means a good cable. Hasn't worked. Yeah, nice and the one trying to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very key. Getting things moving. Oh, branch getting into it. Yeah, I fast forwarded a little bit so we get to the actual hard sets there. Let's hear him. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You all the critics. Yeah, exactly. What's not how you get big to the guys that looks like that. Mm. Meanwhile, he's got an enormous backpump at this point already. You know, I say this about that style of training is it's, I mean, you talk about that. You talk about activation. I mean, this explosive activation they get out of this style of training. I mean, and that's got to be so heavy. Did you see that he helped Johnny to get the bar down into position? Yeah. You know, I'll be full stack and it no problem. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the magic. It's activation like you were saying Ron and what Dave was saying. Something I never really thought of the word for is not necessarily foreign, but activation the lats are lighting up. So whether you like the way the form looks or not, every one of them will cyber. Yeah. Every single fiber is getting triggered triggered the form triggers people, but it also triggers also activation. Right. Now, I wonder if they did any like band work to get the lat moving before they got in the form. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. Sure. This sarcasm. Then I'll show you the secrets. Yeah. Yeah. So this is 2013. So let's think of when this was. So branch one, the 2011 Arnold. Okay. And then he tore his quad. Blue is quad right off the bone. How did it reattached? One, the 2012 Arnold, which is mind boggling. I've had that exact same injury. I can't imagine how he did that. That's just superhuman to me. Yep. And so now this is 2013. So it's really not that far removed from the quad tear. He still has an even back to normal. Remember, he told me it took like three years before he was kind of back to normal. Really back up his leg. But they're hammering away. And Johnny would be getting ready for. Now, I think he did 13 or 14 Olympias. Okay. Which he's on the list of the most Olympia appearances ever. I think there's only a few people ahead of them. Dexter's on that list. Sean Ray, I think. Might be ahead of him or tied. There's really only a couple people. I guess Al Beckles is on that list apparently. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember researching it because when Johnny was with mutant, we gave him a custom battle axe. I had this battle axe made by a friend of mine. Yeah. And the handle was engraved. Like congratulations on your 13th Olympia or something. I can't remember what year it was. And I remember I had to research the list. And it was very few people who had done more Olympias than Johnny. So, you know, you got to hand it to a man. Boom. Getting into it. It's a blast. You might put it down. Yeah. I wouldn't even trust it would stay down if I did that. Yeah. I don't like worried about the machine. Just assuming I might have to pick it back up because of fell. Yeah. Bounce is out in the hole or whatever. Yeah. I like that narrow grip on that. Done that T bar. It's like, you can't grab most of them that narrow. No. They all throw it down. Okay. That's part of the deal. I guess I'm not to learn that. Yeah. Like how they've taken a foam squat pad. And they've duct taped it to the frame there. See, so you're not, don't get crushed when you're leveraging into the... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what that is. The one thing that companies didn't think about, then not pad. They thought people would just stand on the foot pad and push their chest on the pad, but they're not taking a branch and Johnny just leveraging into that machine. They're not expecting people to use the plates that branch. They're like, well, those people use like two and a half plates on this maybe? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The hole or duct tape on there. Yeah. So, Ron, do you think this is the situation where you're not taking the weight off no matter what once again? But if I was 19, I'd train with them though, like you're doing nine plates, let's go. Yeah. It wouldn't even occur to them that plates would come off for the partner. Right. That's what the training partner is. You know what I mean? Like we talked about that. Like when it comes to that gym, that's how it works. You mean we're going to train with me, like plates do not come off. Yeah. You can do less reps, but you're doing the same amount. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So why would branch so sliced right now from the Arnold or what I mean, he is? This is the battle for the Olympia. So we're getting all over. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe he is. I don't know. I look it up. Yeah. He loves the shape all year. Perfect. Awesome here. I love seeing the delt and arms just be so blatantly like so rare and wrapped in. Yeah. Oh, they dropped set of that. They're pillicently. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's the most popoles. Sorry, just cardio back then. Right. So 2013 he only did the Olympia. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's all that's listed on his page. His Wikipedia page might be wrong. But you know how it goes. Right. He was fifth in 2012 and that was back when top 10 recall if I. Right. Oh, that's why yeah. Makes sense. And this was the year. I think this was the year. He worked with George Ferra. And he didn't go that great and he got 9th. Okay. But I forgot about that, man. Yeah. And I remember I heard the story. He, oh, no. He worked with Neil Hill. Sorry. George Ferra was normally his guy. Wasn't it? I think you're right. I think you're right. So he went back. The George after. Yeah. He worked with Neil. I heard he just came off stage and he just walked up to Neil and he goes, well, I didn't work up. But thanks. Shukas Han walked with. He didn't like to make a post about it. You know? No, there's no post. There's no like release press release. Right. Right. And then while that works. Because you do see. I mean, a guy is with great track records. They don't line up necessarily with every single guy. You know? Yeah. Yeah. And that's where the coach bouncing comes in as people. Feel the realized that, you know, the coach they had was actually great. You know, and if they would have just stuck, you know. But obviously branched. Branch was at George a long time and he went back to him and continue to be good with them. So that would don't really well. Well, he had that track record too. You know, I think it'd be a lot of pressure to take a guy at that level. And then be like, hey, well, why don't you work with me this year, even though he's got a whole year or whatever, you know, whole prep to work with. I'm it's, you know, a assume it's going to turn out just as good. It's a lot. I've, I've turned people down. I've said, man, I don't really think I can help you like. Yeah. You know, you did these three shows that this guy and your glutes were shredded and you look really good. Like, I don't know what you want from me like. Yeah. You know, I'm just setting myself up for, you know, if you're 1% worse and all of a sudden, right, you know, what did we do? Right. Yeah. You know, and maybe you got divorced that year. So it's not even my fault. Right. It's not, it's just how it works, you know. And I think that's a mistake coach is make too as they get super eager to just take anybody that is good. But you got to ask yourself, can you actually help that person? Yeah. You know? I remember didn't remember Chris was saying that they had somebody reach out. I won't say their name and he was like, you want me to bring you in the way you come in. You're fantastic. Yeah. He said that to a bunch of people. Yeah. So he says no. People all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I had a question the other day on my story. Someone said, like, if you could work with any top 10 Olympian who would it be. And I said, I don't ever think of that. Number crosses my mind. Yeah. Like, you know, some guys are just dying to like build a name as a, you know, they want to be like a superstar coach. Right. And they're just foaming at the mouth for the chance of someone to ask them, you know, to coach them. But that's not, it's not like, never even accrues to me. Yeah. Coaching is all funny games until you have to get some, you have to deliver. You know what I mean? Okay. Yeah. You know, it's your job to get Chris as good or better than he's ever been. Good luck with that point. Yeah. Good luck with that. Yeah. You know, his last coach had 10 shows of them and knew everything about them. And now you just like, yeah. So here we go. I think it's more fun to take a guy or girl and take them to the next level. Oh, yeah. Then to have them already right there and like, yeah, you were a little bit better. And you're a place to say, you're welcome. You're welcome. Yeah. I love taking somebody who's never been peeled and getting the peeled. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You know, they did three shows without their glue tripped and now you get their glue tripped. Rip, and they're like, thank you. And they're so nice. Take them dark. Absolutely. There's my charm. Look at that. The back man. Ooh. Get the size of the dumbbell. And this is where the turn around comes in. You know, a lot of the, the lats are just in, the backs and interesting, you know, interesting monster when it comes to body parts. No negative on that last rep, by the way. No, he let's go to the top. Yeah. You actually pushed it down if you pay close attention through the floor. Through it into the floor. Yeah. Angry at that dumbbell. Johnny don't give his shitty words as good shoes. That's the only thing in the outfit he paid for, though, in fairness. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I remember Johnny, I remember Johnny actually saying, I remember Johnny actually saying he has, he has lots of Jordan's. He won't wear it. Mattro Flacks. I remember him telling me. Oh yeah. Like he picked me up at the airport. Like I go to see me pick me up at the airport and I be like, No, there's nice kicks. He'd be like, oh, yeah. I don't wear these at Metro Flacks. You know. You know, usually work boots. If you remember these guys. Replaced dumbbells. I love that sign. No one reads it. This is not area. Replaced into this general. Yeah. They're against this wall. Yeah. But literally all over the floor. That's amazing. Those are still my favorite way to do dumbbell rows is hand on the top rack. Yeah, let me do. What's the, you know, what's the rule around when you're in a gym that's busy. And you want to get in there and do your, your dumbbells like that. Would you still do that if the gym was packed and somebody might want one of those dumbbells? I'd be very mindful. All right, you use something else to lean on. But yeah, or I'd go right down the end of the rack. So you're like, not like definitely not in a high traffic area, you know. Yeah. You know, I'm just being. If you're using like, you know, maybe you're using a, yeah, you can find down dumbbell. Yeah, I think you can put the England bench to about the same. It's not exactly the same. But when the gym is slammed. Yeah. I can't, I can't be blocking, you know, eight dumbbells while I'm doing my sets. Yeah. Good. Down on the end of the rack, maybe. If you train in my gym, you can do that all day. You can do that. Turn it up. Turn it up. All right. You hear right here branch y'all in them. There comes. There. Jump. And these two guys got crazy backs, man. Yeah, they do. You know, like exactly the same, but still a lot from the back and they train exactly the same. Oh. Remember, this is an inferior handle. Yeah, that hurt. These two nothing. Man. I love the explosion on each pole. Crazy as traps and body building for a while there. Oh, yeah. No kidding. I still remember that year. Johnny did the L and then he, he couldn't come do a photo shoot right away. He had something going on. So mutant brought him up like a month after the Olympia. And he came up to Vancouver to do a video shoot and he showed up and he looked fantastic. Yeah. Like huge and full and really lean. And I remember I said to him, I'm like, oh man, you're like really looking forward to getting, you know, this shoot out of the way so that you can like take a break. And he goes, take a break. I haven't trained since the old. And he's like, nah, he goes, I pumped a few times. This is when he had built his own gym for personal training. So he's like, I trained a few times in my gym, but I just been so busy having set up my gym and my new business and you know, busy with my daughter and just, you know, I've had hardly trained. I've even seen branch. No kidding. And I go, oh, well, you mean you look great. And he just looks down at himself. He's like, well, this isn't going to go away. I love it. That's very rare. But just to like, we are very different. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if you're the one in the way when you start to, when you talk to Dre and she says things, you're like, it's not how it works with humans, honey. Yeah. Yeah. You are not the same. I know you don't know this is your such a nice person, but like, that's how it works for us. I remember Johnny wanted to do these. I was trained with him once for a video. And we got the very end of the workout and he goes, well, it's two more more things. Okay. And I said, hey, let's do, let's just do like straight arm rope pull downs, right? Okay. Because we've done like all these heavy freeweight rows in shit, right? Uh, and they go, let's do straight arm rope pull downs. And he just extremely fast goes, no. And then just puts that bench there. And I didn't think nothing of it. He was just, he moved fast. He walked fast. Yeah. Walk the talk fast. Walk fast. But that one, the video came out. There were like 10 people that were like Johnny's so savage. He just did not run just to get you. Like let's just rip pull downs. He goes, no. Bullshit. Boo's a pin. He just came across so funny. Plus the edit was so the way it was edited. It just looked so brutal. No. Yeah. You lose your ideas. Carbage. I had to laugh. Normally I would have been like, oh, no. I look like, you know, but I just thought it was funny. He was like 10 people were like, oh, Johnny just shut Ron down like. Yeah. Absolutely. I show Johnny. I remember I showed Johnny the comments. He's just laughing. He's like, That's great. This is by no means light either. You know, this like three quarters of that stack. Something like that. Yeah. This isn't just like a finass move or something like that. The only reason they're not coming off the bench is because they're heavy. Right. No. You doing this here for these? Oh, these are pretty towards the end. I don't know what would be left. These are kind of a finisher. Oh, yeah. Oh, this this row. I use this row at Metro Flex. It's famous for being in all their videos. It is so bent. You pull back and it just dives to the right. Really. Oh, yeah. Both handles are coming towards you. And then they both just dive to the right, like sharply at the end of the wrap. Okay. And I remember thinking like, these guys just don't give a shit. Yeah. They're still using it. You would never use that again. No, I would never use it again. I'm like this machine. It's got to be taken to a welder and like fixed. Based on their backs, it does not need to be fixed. No. And the right doesn't matter. Laptor right apparently. Yeah. Yep. They show up from the front. You'll see the handles kind of dive to the side. It's funny. It's keep pile and plates on. I just always love that when the guys would train together for the same show. Because you know that's going to bring the best idea. Yeah. They probably didn't discuss it once. No, of course not. Yeah. Bam. Whew. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A little hinge move here for the lower back. That's an old school extension. Holy smokes. I didn't realize it had a pad on it. I thought it was just doing body weight. That's funny. You're looking tired at this point too. And probably like several pounds lighter. Oh yeah. It's all. It'd be August at least. You know. Look how soaked Johnny is. You get an agonizing lower back bump from that. Oh kidding. If you didn't have one already. Yeah. I think this is the last. This is the last exercise. Yeah. Oh good times. Why not many weeks out there. Champion two four. Don't matter. It don't matter. Oh, those are always my man. Yeah. That was a great era. You know. Agreed. That was a special request too. Yeah. That was a great honor. Yeah. That was a great honor. So you're just dipping into the beginning of Phil Heath's reign there. You're just a couple of Olympias in getting ready for number three. Yeah. So that would have been in most people's opinion. And he'd be greatest Phil Heath ever that year. Hmm. Twenty thirteen. You know. Isn't that when the battle with Kai was full speed two? Twenty twelve thirteen. Yeah. What have been? Yep. Yeah. That was a really cool time of bodybuilding. Oh yeah. A lot of fun to be at those shows. And I'll tell you what. I remember when he tore his quad. I felt like, ah, that's it. Like maybe we're not going to see him again. Maybe we're not going to see him for a long time. And then a few months later there he is. He does that. Wait. You know, Jace Quadstomp was at that. Yeah. But he had, he was, yeah. What was it? What song was that? It's the guy I can't remember his name. The musician Kid Rock from here in Detroit. Oh, yeah. He comes in and he said, I'm back. You know, it's maxes. Like a boy in full fingers at it. Because everybody was wondering. And they're like, oh, it's just like going to be any different. Is it going to look good? First thing he does is slam it down and points at it. You know. I remember I was hanging out with him at Fibo. Yeah. And would have been like twenty eighteen or something. Because I was like, I tore my quad in sixteen. So I remember I was really happy because I was squatting again. And I was training pretty hard. And I knew I was done competing. I was still was like really happy. My leg had come back and all that. And I was talking to him. I'm like, yeah, you know, I'm finally hexquating like where I don't feel crooked. And all that stuff. And he goes, oh, yeah, that took years. And I went, oh, well, I mean, you won the Arnold seven months later. I kind of thought you were back at it. He's like, oh, no, I was in complete agonizing for a companion. The entire prep. Wow. I just didn't, anyways. When I go, oh, and he's like, yeah, I didn't really recover for like two, three years after. Wow. And I go, oh, well, what were you doing? He's like, oh, just anything to get volume in the leg. 100 rep leg extensions. Because I was only squatting three plates when I won that Arnold. You know, like a barely squat three plates for ten reps. I was so weak and crooked. One side of my body was all messed up. But I just did tons of tons of light sets with the other leg. Just blow it out. I do thousand reps of extensions in one day. And then I come in later that week. Do another thousand reps. And just that's bogged. There's anything. Just anything. Can't train heavy. You do something else. Like yeah. I don't know if I can do anything hurt. And I'm like, oh, okay, I get it. So I'm on track then. Yeah. You know, I thought I was like, that was the hell with it. Good to hear you. He's human. Yeah. Oh, no, I was an absolute agonizing pain in the whole time. But yeah. That's amazing. Yeah, you know, it's all just branched. But yeah. And you know, those two know that break sense. Yeah. And Johnny too, like just such a, like, that those two guys, I think, I think, the thing about Johnny was, you know, hanging out with him and training with him. It's a lot of people thought they didn't pay attention to stuff. But they, they did. They just didn't give it the time of day. Right. Like people thought all these guys aren't thinking of this stuff. It's like, oh, no, they thought of it. They just, they just decided they don't care. Yeah. They waited. Right. Yeah. Doesn't matter to me. Yeah. There's so many little things that I realized Johnny, you know, people would say, all those guys don't, you know, they don't know about this. You know, but I don't know, they're aware. They've made the decision that they are not going to let it into their head. It's not going to be something they waste time thinking about. And I get that so much more now than I would have back then, honestly, I really do. Mm-hmm. Yeah, just like Johnny, what do you mean? This isn't going to go away. Yeah. Like, you know, I'm going to worry about that. You know, so this stuff like that. It's crazy to help you mention how many Olympias he had in the way he trained. Like, you compare him to like, Ducks der Head, you know, a ton of shows. But like, him compared to Ducks der Mann, that was some, like, no offense to Ducks der Ducks der Ducks der Train Hard. But you didn't train like Johnny Jackson hard. You know what I mean? No. Different hard. Yeah. And the way they thought about their workouts was, okay, well, what are like the five hardest things we can do in this gym? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, those will be the best things in. So that that rose really hard. And that rose really hard. We'll start here with my lead activation. And then after that, I need to get some additional blood. And I'll make sure I get a side. Yeah. Which part of the back does that work? Yeah. No whole of it. Yeah. I'm also at two one time I said to him, I'm like, yeah, you know, your back sort, I think we trained back. And I was like, I was like, yeah, you know what? I know I had a good back workout when I felt like Johnny would say stuff to just made you feel like an idiot with all meaning to make it. If you look at it, yeah. So when Tom said, yeah, you know, I know I've had a good back workout when like my back sore, but my biceps art. And Johnny looked at me like, like kind of like a head tilt. Okay. What? And I was like, well, you know, when you like, when you got a good back workout, but your biceps are like, everything's sore after back. Yeah. My calf's hurt after a good back day. Yeah. He's like my glutes and hands are sore after back. Yeah. And I'm like, oh, he just don't care. Just don't care about the overlap. You just don't give a shit. Yeah. And so yeah, that was just like, this is just funny, man. A lot of funny moments like that with him. And you got to hand it to him just that attitude of just put your head down and smash your brick walls. Yeah. And that's both those guys represent. So good reacts. God. I'm glad someone requested that. It me too. Okay. Look, it look like Donna. How's she doing? She's good. She didn't come over. I think we went a little long and she was like, hey, pick me up. So I did. So real quick, I see Dusty's wearing a different t-shirt. Are you trying to show us some? Is that a friend's brand? Or you just happen to have that on? Or what's it deal with that? What is it? What is it? It's Lewis barbecue. It's just an awesome barbecue place, but our house. Oh, yeah. I was like, this place is awesome. So they don't know what it'll make them look like. They'll show their fantastic. Okay. Unbelievable. I'm wearing my favorite shirt from Fibogo, this year. I love this one. That's a nice one. They always do the Germany shirts, you know?
