See you. You're on the show, Jed. Okay. Welcome to you. It's just body building reacts. There you go. Dusty Han Chas coming now. And myself, Big Brown, part of the Remember Like. Share, subscribe, comment, and ring the bell. And what are we pulling up, Scott? We've got some Ducks to Jackson. Shoulders and our work there. For the battle for the Olympia, all the way back in 2001. Let's see if I can bring this up. Two thousand one. So like early decks. The long time ago, long time ago. Keybleed. It's over 20 years now. What year did he turn pro 98? So what it was? I'm looking it up right now. I'm just just that number just flew out of my head. I have no idea why. Contest history. Yeah. 98 North American Championships. Light heavyweight and overall. 98. So so this is 2001. So he's only been pro for three years. Got those rims. Let's see. That's the road. That's before he got real money. So yeah. Yeah. That's the mid money. SUV. There we go. Let's see what he has to say here. This is the world famous. Bailey's powerhouse gym. We're going to be shooting another. This is good. We're trying to. Years. Been together about a hundred years. Best training time. Only trainer town. I'm going to try to remember. I remember. But again, the behind the neck. Yeah. The high-end school thing. My cover. I'm going to be a great week. Yeah. And with the visor. Oh. 2001 Rafe culture coach. This. They might think we could be real happy with these ladders. With little swinging there. Did I say a swing, does he? Oh yeah. Doing correct. And standing tall at the top. I also funny my anybody watching this is going to be saying. That's bad for me. He's never going to get good doubts doing that. Yeah. Swing in. So that's how I did my rear-door ladders for like 10 years. Yeah. It's 15 years even. It was just heavy kind of with the swing boom. Yeah. Dexter. It's getting the muscle tech era. Oh yeah. What an era that was. They had like a. They had like a killer team. They really did was was branch Dexter J. Is that like crazy. It was not him. They didn't even have like the the Troy Alves is and the other guy. Yeah. Mixed years well. Yeah. Oh man. I think it's been saying when you looked at him back then. Yeah. Yeah. And that's right. Like. Comparatively he's he wasn't big back then. Yeah. But it's the shape was so bonkers. I mean, I think you got eight at that year's Olympia. And had just turned pro. Would you say around three years before that? Yeah. 98 turn pro and 98. And think about the other guy low to hundreds there. Like yeah. To a six, eleven at tops. You know what I mean? And think about who he'd be competing. Like what were the 2001 guys like the massive. You know. I'm curious about this. Three weeks. Three weeks. He's peeled. He looked like that six months out too. Yeah. He's deleting fried chicken. I think there's some food stuff at the end. We'll be sure to get that in here. Oops. That's right. There we go. So that was shoulders, I guess. And now we're getting into arms. Sholog shots. I'm pulled up here. I haven't done that reverse grip. Press down, table pressed down in a long time. That makes me long for them. Are you still doing single arms? Oh yeah. Yeah. And I hit a point in my life where I couldn't turn my hand over like that. Yeah. That's not good. I hurt. So I just went to a hammer with a rope, you know. Yeah. But yeah. The old reverse grip. How about this for guys that he beat at that size? Nasser? Yeah. Marcus, Marcus, rule, Tom Prince. I mean some absolute monsters. Yeah. I think that's the end, man. It was a big era. Well lines, he's wearing a women's small belt there. For sure. I love you guys back then. He'd be the winningist pro of all time. Yeah. Yeah. He still is, right? Yeah. Yeah. He still is. The winningist pro. Was it 28 pro wins? I don't remember the number. So this is given idea. How is year goes 2001? He got 9th at the previous Olympia. Right. And he winds up moving up to 8th this year. Okay. So he's on the rise. He got third at the Australian fifth at the Arnold third in hunger. He seconded the night at champions. So he's at this point. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why is that being top 8? So at like what is he way you think? That's what did you say to 20. He's like. He would tell you 50. He probably 25. Yeah. There's no way. Yeah. What's crazy too is the amount of respect that Ducks are has by everybody in the industry. There's nobody who's like, oh, a Ducks are a bad dude or Ducks are Talked crap. Oh, you know what I mean? Ducks are just a good. I'll tell you what. I was lucky enough in 2020 to be backstage at the Arnold. Like literally right next to where all the guys are pumping up. And I'm literally there taking pictures of like Victor Martinez and stuff. All these pumping up. And that was his final show. If you guys remember, he did that posing routine. And it was emotional because it was like his final. His final routine is what he is saying he's going to do. And when he came out of stage the first person standing there when he walked on the steps was a cormere and they just like they looked at each other and they just had this huge freaking hug and Ducks just started bawling. And everybody came around just started putting their arms around him. It was I've got pictures. I'll see if I can find them. I'll drop them up here. But it was really cool, man. So I don't know if people can see that. The camera. But this is what Capitia's list of all this shows he did. Oh, um. Run page two on page three. Page four. The sense saying it just keeps going. Oh, like what? What was his first show? What year was his first show? First show ever was the 1992 Southern States third place light weight. Okay. Light weight. Light weight to Mr. Olympia. How about that? Yeah. And then in 95 he won the light heavy weights at the USA's. But didn't turn pro. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy. That's a wild. That's a wild. That's a wild. Again though. So he turned pro in 98. You said right. Yeah. So that's the thing I think again. We talked about this in the past. Like you don't need to turn pro your first go. Keep advancing. And then even when he turned pro then it was build back up again. And by the way, most of you should not be going to the Japanese statehouse. And I thought you remember the next Jackson. Yeah. Listen in the beginning. Listen in the beginning. Listen a week. I guess. Like coming here. Maybe once it twice. Wait. What should we take this up to about a week? It took twice a week. You'll take it up to October. It took about a week out. You go there. I put it in. I put it in a cookie. We're no sorting around like that. No sorting around. So. Just something more different. Lay right there. I think. Japanese steak and rice. That's a great idea. Yeah. So he can eat it. He competed for 28 years. That is why. First show to Lashar. This is 20 feet. And he was awesome. They were really tired. I think he was incredible. There's so many things about. And like not to just be like, I don't think of the bad stuff. But there's so many things to think. Dexter didn't really ever get hurt. Dexter didn't really. Dexter seems healthy as shit. Dexter looks like a million bucks now. Dexter and Jay. Dexter and Jay like somehow just escaped time. Like we saw Jay. We saw Jay in the UK. We talked to him in Nando's there. You know. We were at the end of the world. You know, we were like, it's been over 25 minutes. Like 25 minutes in Nando's. With him in manager mat and Dave. David Bay and and and Jay, I just keep looking at Jay's face. I'm like, You like. You used to be a few years old. And me and now you look like younger than he is. He's referred to. You know, he's got that that millionaires. steps to the mall. He maybe went to the mall with my twice as thick. Looks real good, you know, and at him in Dexter, both kind of have that that going on. I remember when we saw Dexter and Dubai, Dusty. Yeah, like look, he literally looks, his face looks the same. It's like, literally, he does like literally the same. You're like, how's that possible? Yeah, 10 is physique. It looks, he literally just looks like an athlete now. Still has round muscle. He's just smaller. It's, yeah, for most of us when you get smaller, then all of it kind of just goes. Like you're just a flatter and dude. Yeah. He looks like he's on 10. I use a growth still and just bubbling out of his mind. You know, the biceps are still like just bursting out of the tendon. Like when he moves arms when he's talking, he's just talking to you like this. And you see the biceps just like, probably only 17 now, you know, like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then at the opposite of the spectrum, there were guys that just came and went and came and went. I mean, how many, how many evolutions of bodybuilding did he make it through 28 years of competing? You know, that's, I mean, that's a lot. He was, so he was bodybuilding. He was working out in the gym when Leigh Hayney was Mr. Olympia. Yeah. And then he competed with Ronnie Coleman and competed with Phil Heath and competed with Shawn. And competed with Randy. Yeah. Literally all of them. That's bonkers. You know, the amount of guys who won the Olympia in a time period where only one guy was winning for nearly a decade is pretty not including himself. Yeah. And he was always in the mix. Everyone always knew that any show, Daxter did, he could win. So just saying, he saw Ronnie's entire reign as a country. And then he saw Jay's entire reign as a competitor. And then he saw Jay's entire reign as a competitor. Be the ones. Yep. And then he saw Phil Heath's seven in a row as a competitor. Keep going. Keep going. Like you're on stage for every one of those shows. He was in every one of those shows. Wasn't he every single one I bet? Yeah. Just putting my, you know, my, my favorite action. Was when they, when they did the, when they had triple H at the Olympia like backstage. Oh, chalk didn't do the wrestling thing. Yeah. And they just, they trying to chat him up and he, he comes up to Daxter backstage. You goes, all right, Daxter. I mean, obviously, you know, how do you think you're going to do this weekend? And Daxter's like, I brought it, man. He goes, all I'm saying is I'm getting second triple H goes second. He goes, come on, man. That's Ronnie Coleman. I didn't even, it wasn't even an option. Like second was winning for everyone else. Yeah. Yeah. There's two, two quotes I love. Two stories that Daxter, I love the one is I set it before it's on one of the videos where he's training. And I, I think it might have even been 2008, which is a year he won the Olympia. So that's what makes it stick out of my mind. And he's training and he's got his elbows wrapped because he's saying how his elbows have started hurting a little. So he's like, I'm just wrapping him for a few weeks. I get through the prep and and he's just talking about how he's he goes. I made a whole career on catching people when they're off. Yeah. That's my thing. I play my game. I play my game. And if the other guys don't play their game properly, I got him. Yeah. And then he looks at the camera. He goes, there ain't no runaways. They say at the Ronnie Coleman days. And I was like, oh damn, he's playing a win. Now that Ronnie's gone. He's, you know what I mean? That's a dangerous guy. That's a dangerous guy. Yeah. And then the other story I love with Daxter is he shows up at the Olympia one day and he's walking back stage. It was a 2003. The year Ronnie was, I'm not. Unbelievable crazy. And he's walks back stage. Just guys Jim bags in like he's, you know, he's there. Everyone, all the guys are buzzing around, you know. And he comes around the corner and Jason on a chair and he goes, Jay, what's up my man and Jay just except, but just except that. And he goes, did you see Ronnie? There he goes. And now, any goes, huh? Like that. Just like, yeah, Ronnie had to shirt off already. Oh, oh. Yeah. Yeah. And body won that show immediately backstage. Everyone was like, wow. Did you see Ronnie? Yeah. But it's almost going to be a relief back then when Jay was chasing because it was like, well, we don't have to wonder if I'm going to beat him this year. I just saw him. Right. Right. Oh, man. Okay. Well, good memories. Good guy too. Everyone loves Daxter. You know what I mean? I mean, we've all heard some stories about everybody. You know, there's always a story about everybody. People on bad days, you know, but I just haven't heard about story about decks. You know, he's just one of those guys. You know, he gets those pro athletes that plan NFL for 20 years. They don't go to rehab. They don't have a bad divorce. They don't have like, I just saw charge in a bar in Texas. They don't get arrested at the border with weed in their bag. They don't like just nothing happens. They just compete for 20 years. Collect the paycheck retired. Yeah. Maybe they got it man, you know, decks and they get one super bull ring out of the whole thing. Maybe, and it's just awesome. You know, and that's kind of what Daxter did. He's just one of those guys loaded up the bank account along the way. You know, he's really got that muscle. That muscle tech year. Yeah. That's so muscle. You know, even the way to show at that point, right? You get that, that you get the muscle tech money invested properly. And then the rest of your career. It's just gravy. Yeah. So okay.
