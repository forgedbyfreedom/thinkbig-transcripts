Because the roundness, like you said, Scott the waste and the joints were so tiny. Three weeks out from the Limpia just cranking 405 on the flat bench. Eatin' fish and green beans. Crazy.

Would you rather have... Off the rack? Flex Wheeler or Kevin LeVron in 2000. So here we are. We're watching the Battle for the Olympia 2000, right Scott? Yep. We've got... Well, this is a battle for Olympia 2000. We got... we got Kenneth Flex Wheeler to start here. Looks like he's at Gold's gym. Yep. Gold's Venice. Yes. Gold's Venice. The Gold's... The... Of course, get a start. Covered up. He's gonna peel down by the end. Yes. He's doing the... Oh, he's doing the... Oh, he's doing the chin... Chinnices machine. Oh, I like that belt. I'll take that waist off the rack. That waist to lat ratio. Yeah. And that's the magic mirror. Right there. So... Fashioned it. Yeah, yeah. That... You know, I see the chanelink fence. Yes, that's on the right side. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Now, by 2000, we've seen the fashion it calmed down a little bit. You know, it's like black and gray. It's like not the 90s anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like when Crocodon Tubman switched to darker colors. So, my only advice. I remember that. Yeah. It's like season to three. Season four. More dark gray. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like... Yeah. It's like season to three. Season four. Yeah. More dark gray than charcoal's. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Less salmon. Less baby blue. Yeah. Okay. Kids at home are like, what the fuck is he talking about? What's the only advice? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we've got Flex Wheeler here. Look, it just hang in. I don't know how many weeks out was this. Did you see? I guess it was days out. Yeah. Yeah. We're closing in now. Okay. So he's... Five quarters. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Get this crazy triceps that just sounded like always sort of... The whole arm. The whole arm. Ridiculous. And of course. Yeah. Off the ramp. And of course, people are going to say... Off the rack. People are going to say... It's so injections. But... Yeah. Even if it's just how it really smells. Yeah. Yeah. I'll take that. I'll take that. I love that term. The greatest, the greatest sighting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look, it's just decide. Yeah. Also, it's... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The guys that say it's all oil have never realized how many bad shots you get when you try to do that. Yeah. Yeah. We want to be seen the guys they have like... Purple spots on their arms and... You know, they're all red and swollen. Yeah. Yeah. Just looking at how it's... Just looking at how it's all... Okay. Rico's strainer with him still. Yeah. I remember when I saw Flex training at Golds in like 96, 7. You were there on the Charles. Yeah. And I remember he was... Yeah. And he was benching two plates. Like on the flat bench. And I remember thinking like two plates. You know, dumb kid, right? Yeah. A big three plates. And then he took his... And he took his sweatshirt off. Yep. And I was like, oh, I have a lot to learn. I guess I didn't matter at all, right? Three plates. Yeah. You know? What Flex was never the biggest guy. It was just like... He became big when she was under the lights. And you know, because the roundness and like you said Scott, the waist and the joints were just so tiny. The way the muscles tie in and where they are, the muscle belly is, you know, as his biceps starts to just forearm and ends of his doubt. Yeah. You know, just... I did have those... If those are NPC pants, I did have those exact same pants. Oh, they're definitely NPC pants. Yep. It won't say in the pocket. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Remember everyone, this is an exercise that's been deemed useless, by the way. Yeah. They're the NPC pants, for sure. Yeah. I'm matching jacket too. Or yeah. I didn't get the jacket. I always avoided matching track suits. I couldn't... Yeah. If I had the gray bottoms, I had to wear the black hoodie. Yeah. Which makes sense. I couldn't... I know that guys walked around, I think the purple... Sweat suit. I said they look like Barney. Yeah. Did you ever have one that you put like big round across your back? No. No. No. Because people did do that. What people did do that though, even at the local shows, you know? Yeah. Yeah. They're nicknamed that they made up for themselves. Yeah. Yeah. That was gold that it's peak right there. It's exactly how I remember it being there. It's changed a ton since then. Before Arnold took his pictures down and put him back up. Yeah. That short little stint. Yeah. Also before being on the wall was like a really big deal. Like they've really lowered the standard of who can make the wall in that place. Yeah. It was like Olympia. Professional athletes. That's it. Look at how big it is. What else we got with Kent? Yeah. Look at that. I know. Let me see. And it was for a little bit. Yeah. Funny thing is, like... We all know how Flex would show up at the shows. And at the 2000 Olympia, he looked very good and he placed, placed third actually. Okay. My goodness. He beat. Yeah. So you guys want the top. You guys want the top 10 at this year's O at the 2000 O? Yeah. Yeah. We got in 10th we got Orville Burke, who's apparently still alive. I was dead. I was dead. I know that he, he went into a coma. But he, I guess he's still alive. And then we got Dexter and ninth, J in eighth. Marcus Rul in seventh, Lee Priest and sixth, Nasser and fifth. Fourth was Sean Ray. Third was Flex Wheeler. See now he's starting to get a little more of a pump. He's getting harder. Yeah. Yeah. Like now see the ripples in the bicep. Now through the skin like it's funny. Flex had that type of physique that sort of, he's probably so depleted that he doesn't come to life until he gets like a pump. Right? Because we know how he used to like. You stopped at third. By the way. Yeah. Well that's how he used things. Top team take a guess. So top two would be obviously. Love and captain Kevin and second. Kevin and then Ron. Ron, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bonkers. So I had a story. I had a friend that competed at the USA's against Flex. And he said he went back stage and Flex had his jacket off. Yeah. He was like, oh, I don't know what the hype is about this guy. I'm going to smoke him. He said he popped up for like five minutes. And he goes, I watched him put on 20 pounds and knew I was screwed. Yeah. Yeah. I remember Flex saying that he used to like. Just eat no carbs at all. He would just eat chicken and fish. Okay. And just not eat any carbs at all because. And then every like once in a while, he'd have a subway sandwich. You know, give you a little carbs and fill out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I remember him saying that he thought he trained super like super depleted for his preps all the time and it probably wasn't like wasn't the best way to do it. But you know. Yeah. I'm actually like, you know, the way he looks on stage and the way he looks in like right now he looks pretty pretty flat. I mean like for flex. Yeah. So. But now he's coming to life. See it. It's certainly. He's getting a little harder now. Like it's really weird. But I've seen that before. I've seen guys like radically transform like a weak out and you're like, What the fuck did I do? And you're like, oh, you must have just been. We're fucking flat. Yeah. No. Imagine if he had like the knowledge of today. You know what I mean? What he could do. Yeah. Yeah. I would say this that like if we could go back. And give him today's knowledge. Even though it was Ronnie, I feel like he could have won the Olympia with that education. At least at least one. It's it's shocking that he didn't win when I think what's funny is younger guys would watching this wouldn't understand that flex would smoke most of the top pros now. Yeah. Look at the video. It's it's not the flex that shows up on stage. So just right. It's good as he looks. It's not as wacky as watching Derrick Lundsford do a pull down like this. Yeah. That's true. That's true. All right. So by the way, did you hear what the seat was said about Lundsford? What do you say? No. Why is he said he because Lundsford was in Germany at Feebo. Yeah. And Chris went and had a look at him in the room and Chris just said like, Is everybody completely hooped? He said, yeah. Yeah. Said, you think you knew you think you saw Derrick Lunds show it's not even said don't even forget about that. So we'll see what happens. Okay. Now we got Kevin. When we got Kevin LeBron. So Kevin, how far is Kevin here? How far are we out here? Did we get a number? This is from his video actually. They stole these. So this would have been within a couple of weeks as well. Okay. And he's still got four plates on the flat bench. His face. He's looking when he's doing something. He goes to the incline and does the same thing. We're losing the arms. We're losing the arms. He's losing the arms. Yeah. Also like you know the fashion. These two guys in 2000, there is a bit. Kevin's got our old rip sweatshirt on. Snowpink. Snowpink. No teal. Yeah. This is the look I'm more familiar with in body building. Kind of just like some over time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course he's got a tank underneath that probably because you got to peel down at some point right? Oh, and you know. Q the people that are upset. He's got to wait belt on because his core will be weird. Yeah. Yeah. This is like what about the psychological. I just love watching him. Trying to. Watching him train all the way to the shows was it was always. His training never changed. Offseason prep. Yeah. I'm looking at that. He looks strong. Like two. Three weeks out from the Limpia just cranking 405 on the flat bench. Like eating fish and green beans. I'm fucking crazy. It's interesting to see just how different his training is than flexes you know. Like you see an instant here. 12 reps on the flat bench without a touch. Yeah. I like how he's not even wearing his own belt. He's like his buddy's on. There's even no name on it. Says like some other name on the back. Yeah. I don't care. Yeah. It'll work. And he's training with like a mortal who's benched three plates for reps. That's not three weeks out. Right. Yeah. Fully blocked up. Smash. I like those plates. Those are my favorite plates of all time. Yeah. The big fat. My first time having. Was I good? Yeah. I'd love to have a whole bunch of those. I've got a couple. I've got a couple. So I know a guy who just bought a Sybex leg press. Yeah. And he got it a polstered. He got it a polstered exactly like that bench with the heel and purple. Yeah. Yeah. The leg press at this gym that was in the full blown video. You're kidding. Then you'll Kevin Schocker. Yeah. So he sent me a picture of it. He's like, look, it's perfect. It's exactly like the one we've grown the uses. And he got the heel and purple. Hold the straps. Oh, yeah. That control on that knee. We don't. He's on. Look at that. That's a bit of that. Big F off reps. Just. Yeah. Cranking. He was absurdly strong. Yeah, man. He really was. It's a little applause from the people standing around watching him. Yeah. I love gym plays. This is kind of gym. I can't go. This is cool. Yeah. Yeah. I believe that's a world gym too. Is that not a world gym that guys ban her up? Is it? I can't remember the location. Yeah. I want someone else. Yeah. That's smaller with that camera. It's like this. I am going to get this. I'm fine. Oh yeah. You're interesting. Is this Maryland Muslima scenes? Yeah. Does that visually impact? Yeah. I'm not sure what year it was. I'm not sure what year it was. But you know that where he's got those people making all his meals. There's a no. You missing this. Yes. back to their house. It hasn't been there. Yeah, they're beef. You know, yeah, second. They're just making them like fish and veggies. Yeah, remember they have the video in the video. It's always house and they have his no food in the entire house. The pantry is completely empty. There's like one can of something in there. The fridge is empty other than the bag that they deliver. They can't shit on your diet when you got no food. You don't want to go too heavy though. You know, coming into a show. Just gonna. Jesus. And this guy already tore his back. He this guy already tore his pack like multiple years ago. Yeah, that was so funny because he kept telling you I got it. Yeah, but he really don't. I. Because I said I got it. We can't remember. Yeah, yeah. Oh man. Yeah, what's a belt say? Kennedy. What's a name is that on there? Yeah. What ever is training partners last name is? Yeah, yeah, it's his bed. I don't need a belt. He's got one back over here in the incline still, huh? Drop him back to three 15. Oh back off set with everybody else's fucking mat max. Right. Eight. Nine. She's. So remember Kevin said he didn't train to failure like purposely a lot, but we already saw him go to failure with four plates. And then that was like no R. I. R at all. Yeah. Yeah. Basically like failed into the rack. There's a movement that I love that is extinct currently. I wish I could still do those. Then they hurt my shoulders. Oh, God. 40 pound dumbbell 40 pound dumbbell doing that. I just I just just give up and drop the dumbbell. Not technically an ideal peck movement, but just one of those things are like Arnold did these. I'm doing them. Yeah. Yeah. You know, like if you're a little fun in the gym, it's fine. How you get some extra lat. You get some long head of the tricep. Oh, yeah. Like, you know, a little love for the compound. You know, you think it's an isolation movement, but it's actually like multiple muscles. No, we did those as part of John Meadows plan. Yeah, a ton of this exercise in my I would tell you man, my tricep screw is a result like they definitely got bigger. Yeah, you put a band on your legs to cross the across the bench too instead of instead of being perpendicular. You'd be like on the whole bench. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And really focused on the stretch kept in the lat, you know. Yep. I'll be right back. Perfect. Good out of here. We don't want to mirror anyway. Now he's got a delivery. Donald should probably go on ape shit. Nice. I mean, he's killing this, too. Oh, yeah. He's grinding them out. I mean, he could have stopped there. Oh, yeah. Boo. This is a hell of a workout. He feels down here shortly. All right. One video shows that he feels down in a minute. I love how dusty you know the play by play. I think I already know who you pick. I think I know who you pick. Oh, enough. Physiques. This is Kevin's got my favorite physique of all time. I would his physique at the grand pre. Oh, what year was that? I can't remember. Is it the, we're completely out of control. Was it when he was like super big? He was in North and he, I mean, he wanted as soon as he walked out. It was obscene. Head shaved, will thrown you at that time? No, I don't know. Okay. I'm trying to place it. I'm trying to place it. But he had a rage against the machine going for the music. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's the one I was thinking of. I think he did have the shape. I've had at that time. Was it okay? Yeah. He was absolutely obscene. My favorite pack movement fly movement of all time right here. Is it really? And it also seems to be extinct. Yeah. I did him to that. Yeah. Yeah. What did I say on your, what did I say on your, on your post, SD? Yeah. Like best movement ever fight me. I said best best crossover variation ever fight me. I know everyone's doing all these fancy like just standing straight up and they have no bracing behind them at all. And on this one, the bracing is your body weight. Yeah. No. Like that's why they're the best. Like I just, I've tried crossovers with the police adjusted in all different positions. Yeah. And I just, there's nothing like just old school high pulley crossovers cranking out most musculars. I mean, I've done there though. Gonna do some peck deck as well. Is he stand? Oh, no. He's got to see. I thought he was standing in the machine, but he's got to see it. I just thought so that's an old flag. Got the whole stack and he's just slamming it together to band. Yeah. Beautiful reps. Yeah. That's the hair. He's not the whole stack. Yeah. He's making it look easy. Better. It's a better dude. 20. Verifying because that was just doesn't seem heavy enough. Right. This crank. All right. I'm going to roll it forward here. All right. Here's where we get some, uh, imposing. Oh, it's almost not fair because I feel like he looks a lot fuller than then flexed it here. Yeah. I'm not saying. I'm not going to roll here. I guys looking for lighting. It's like, dude, it doesn't matter where you stand. Right. See. Yeah. Just, I'll see that detail. Yeah. So like off the rack, he wins this one. I mean, maybe maybe flex needed like, you know, a whole pot of rice or something. He needed a subway sandwich. Yeah. He needed a subway sandwich. We need a 12 inch. But yeah. Yeah. But oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, it was always just for me. I mean, like the shape of the tries. Yeah. Shout right here. When it gets this ball. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. Yeah. It's try. It's our so crazy. Oh, yeah. He shredded. Lats are all fiberdote. We'll lower lats on him. Just hang in there. You know, when you're doing a rear lats, bread and I see your triceps, there's something going on. Yeah. You know, but I don't know. I don't know if there's enough RIR. Oh. Gross. Yeah. Well, you were away around Scott answered the question for me, because he knows what's my absolute favorite. So he wins my all take his degree. Oh, one of the planet. Yeah. Yeah. Plus also another thing about the throne is like walking trees. Look at all of the neck of the traps. Yeah. Yeah. Those traps speak of being like legit strong. You know what I mean? Yeah. I wonder who the people at home have though, because I know we have a lot of flex wheeler fans too. So I want to hear the people comment and let us know and don't just, it's hard. This is almost a ringer here, because Laveronia is so much fuller than Flex was in his video. Yeah. I think Laveronia's weeks out here and I think I think Flex was like days out when he was probably completely hooked. Yeah. But he and he had that look, you know. Yeah. And he looked dead. He looked dead. That's what I'm saying. The bench, the bench, the bench, the bench, the bench, the bench, the bench, the bench, the bench. Oh, I'm going to die. I'm going to die. Kevin's Kevin's like throwing a little plate on. Yeah. I ate five pounds of fish today. You know. Well, in fairness, the judges agreed with me the day of the show. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kevin, Kevin, it beat Flex that that particular year. I'm just going to see if the score is actually up. Oh, it was close. So Ronnie had straight first. He's 555 right across the board. Yep. And then, and then Kevin had 12, 10, 10, 10. So like he was one judge, had him in third. You know what I mean? And then Flex Wheeler had like a mix of thirds and a second and a couple fourths. So Flex and Sean actually traded some two. But it was yeah. I was a battle that year. Yeah. So we won Ronnie's legs. Even though we're not supposed to be talking about him. Yeah. Yeah. Do we have a picture? Do we have a picture of Flex at year 2000? I think I just found one. Let's see what's this. No, that's not it. Hold on. Hold on. You guys keep talking. I'll find something to do. Don't pull it up wrong. We'll get roast right. Right. I got I got one right here. That should be it. When I typed in 2000 Flex, a whole bunch came right up and they have a year written on him. So Hold on a second. Here's something. This says 2000 on an at least. It's from a YouTube video. Oh yeah. That's it. Yeah. That's the same back there. All right. Yeah. Look how much bigger Flex looks here than he did in the video. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at the how separate is all of the hip. It's iron in the picture and you can still can't ignore it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm so glad that I was starting body. Really at this time to watch these freaks. Yeah. Oh no. Still my favorite. I wasn't in it. So no one can judge me. He's another frees frame at some point from the show. That would have been like at the end of the call outs. They're probably saying I won that call out. Yeah. Right. Everyone. I won that call out. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you gentlemen back in line. You hear Wayne D'Millie. Back in line gentlemen. And everyone goes, yeah. I won that call out. Check out this early picture of Flex. We check that out. That. I mean he looked incredible. Dude like imagine back then he might have been like I'm just going to go straight into classic and win everything. You know what I mean? And I mean. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. Never put on any more weight. I'll just stay like 190 and perfect. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. Okay guys. Well, thanks gentlemen. That was fun. I like the reactions. I like the memory lane stuff.
