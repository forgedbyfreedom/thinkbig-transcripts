that you will get attached to me but as a friend on a deeper level because then sex is involved. So if you need sex just have it with me and I do with you and you'll see how it will help you. Then we will keep our coach client relationship because I don't want to lose you as a client and then she literally says I've just had all my coaches want to sleep with me so this time I don't want to add that in. Which is I mean that very there when I read that one like wow that's more indicative of the larger problem in the industry that maybe isn't being talked about enough.

Sports Nutrition they've got awesome health supplements if you guys are in the UK you already know about Strom so I don't need to tell you anything more guys we have a bunch of stuff going on we're gonna have a physique critique we have a bunch of listener questions things that you guys comment on the last show speaking of which if you want to take part in the next show comment below we'd love to have you as part of the programming by the way thank you to everybody who's watching live from the Facebook group today we're gonna have some fun record a couple episodes and hang out with you but before we get to all of that we've got uh what could be like a controversial topic I really think after talking to you Andrew this is something that really kind of needs to be said I feel like it's a type of education that um people who are going to work with the coach should have um you know as coaches ourselves they really upsets me to see uh people taking advantage of and to give our professions a bad name so really I mean what do you call the the topic here is this like like shady coaches really is what it comes down to coaches predator coaches um and I think when I first sent this stuff to you like a week ago I don't think you guys were really sold on it like I don't think you really understood what this guy was doing and what maybe some of these other coaches are doing but then I sent you some of those messages that um that I had gotten from a friend and I think it kind of became apparent you know what man I I before you even sent it to me I got it and I understood it and and I knew that the stuff happens and I just honestly I just kind of have turned away and been like well you know what I'm not a part of that that's not my problem sucks to be you know that guy he's a fucking you know loser and I hope you burns and how move on with my day you know but the reality is though that I think that they're you know what there's some innocent people that have gotten themselves into positions where they've been taking advantage of and that really does bother me and if anything we try to educate people with her programming and if we could help people to be more aware to not put themselves into a vulnerable position you know then we're definitely still doing a really good thing with our show so that's that's where my stance is at this point you know sure which probably talk about what we're talking about yeah yeah late honest yeah all right so you know many of our listeners and followers probably follow some of the same people we follow on Instagram but one of my friends John Dorsey who goes by at Goob goob you he uh well he does as he kind of highlights he's ruthless in the fitness and yeah he's worth if he got a lot of some of his stuff but you know he goes after frauds and in the terms of people editing their photos photo shopping making themselves look bigger they're ways look smaller of leaner than they are et cetera and he doesn't hold back with you know anybody it could be an amateur or coach who's using his pictures to get clients to top I have to be professionals that are editing their pictures to look better and their competitors next to them to look worse and then kind of putting it out like well you know how to this girl beat me kind of thing but one of the topics that he does I'm sorry that he did this week was on a body builder and I'm gonna use his name because it's out there in black and white you know we do hear a lot of these things in the industry but you know we can't necessarily judge or point him out because we haven't seen the direct evidence ourselves but in this case it's pretty clear uh bodybuilder Sam Kannon do he he's been he's kind of a predator to his female clients or not kind of what he is should we say allegedly like it's imprint like that you know it's funny it's romantic because the text messages and all the messages are right there so technically it's allegedly because if well I don't want to give any ideas but yeah allegedly it is but it's all right as much as allegedly as Jenny and Phil with the text messages I mean you can call what you want but it's right there and you know what people can make up their own minds because it's pretty obvious yeah yeah but anyway the point being you know asking telling female clients that they need to check in nude making sexual advances towards this female clients commenting on their physique in a way that is very unbecoming of a coach very unprofessional you know talking about talking to them sexually and I think you know the three of us and many of the coaches we know that we count as friends in this industry that is the last thing that any of us are interested in doing in terms of putting someone in a position to feel that they're being taken advantage of like these people are paying somebody yeah yeah these people are paying somebody for their expertise to get them into better shape whether it's you know your housewife who just wants to lose 15 pounds and look better for the summer to top competitive bodybuilders who you know want to one day grace the Olympia stage so I think with that I think we should show some of these pictures just in case some of the people have not been able to watch the videos that gobs done all right so I'm just gonna grab these screencaps you sent me I'm putting those up there I gotta ask you guys this when you read the comments I'll just speak for myself I guess but I'm asking you if you felt the same way it really wasn't like you were reading messages from a coach yeah it was reading messages from like an interested like boyfriend who someone who has met a woman and the complimentary creepy weird yeah that's where it comes in where when you go oh my god this is like this is a coach like for real that's a good point man now you know and some of the stuff you know he's not from this country so maybe there is a little bit of a language barrier in terms of you know some of the syntax of the language but I agree with you like the vibe wasn't you know talking to a coach it was the vibe of like talking to a potential boyfriend or something like that in a lot of this case but I think if you look at the first slide on the left you know he's asking for what he needs as a coach now me personally I don't think it's very professional to do this kind of talk through DM and text message that's just me I want to go through email but that's you know that that might just be my issue no I agree and then that's a regular thing that you're covering yourself with communication but it is to someone who maybe he hasn't been training people a long time new client new coaches they will do things a different way but I just agree with you it's it's far more if anything ever comes back on you that can be far more admissible and easier to get into court than something that you're either text messaging or you know any other what's up or any other bullshit but yeah I generally try to lay it out in an email and I'll say like here's what we want but then after that if somebody needs clarification I will go to I use what to app and I will text from there but I never use social media as a you know and like I'm just to in front of sorry I was just gonna say to like this is him explaining this is like well if you're but tell me look like let's go over this because we do have audio listeners too Andrew so what are we looking at here this is like his I would call like the first email he sends or sorry the first in his case text messages he sends people you know but onboarding basically telling them what to expect how to check in yeah do you want me to read it sure yeah so for me is a coach I need none close and this is where you need to be okay with that because I need to see literally everything to see where you're holding your fat or your underwater if you aren't comfortable with that then it then it'd be it'd be hard to work but we can still work together it's just hard for me to see it's kind of like going to the doctor to get a boob job and tell him you can't show him your boobs see what I mean photos and text will be confidential and sent to my client based phone with the number I will give you so I think right off the bat I mean it's not the same thing as going to a professional doctor who does breast it's not even close to the same that that's not a good analogy whatsoever well even if you can get by without on the first text message to compare himself to a medical doctor with that type of integrity just wait to get to the second or third text message page and you'll see that that's not the case all right yeah all right but oh actually for the other thing you don't need to see everything like I'm sorry but there's there's no way you need to see nipple fat or yeah no way you need you know I won't get as demonetized but there's no way you thank it for every area of somebody's body to determine if they are going to be in show condition or not yeah and you know maybe there are some people that are new to the sport that are naive or they just want to fall in line and do what this coach says I feel bad for one though and I hope that this yeah and that's what will help them exactly yeah yeah again about the photos will be confidential and never exposed and they are store or in a coach and client based only phone this is mainly just for me to see your progress and only me added another and me okay once once I see I'll always share with you where more works needs to be done but then again if you are not comfortable with this then by all means we can work with what you feel comfortable with that we can go from there thank you again and let me know how you want what you want to do maim have a good night I tell my clients if they aren't comfortable with the photos go to a Victoria secret and buy a disposable panties they sell and wear those so then he just continues to kind of ask that person hey you interested and this particular person was very turned off by the nude photography she said she was going to find a coach that didn't require that he was really focused on that you know like if you're going to work with me you're going to have to you know be okay with this and he's like and then he went into great detail didn't he about what you're going to have to say what he was he goes oh I never said nude I asked for none cloth what's the difference there I mean I feel like that's part basically saying the same things but I think those are good there's some other there's some other pictures or some other messages I sent you all right we're going to bring those up let's say here's another one some of the responses though I thought I think that's what the main thing okay so this woman there's a several of this from this woman and she checked in with him sorry about the beanie snowed here and it's freezing in my house so his comment responses damn babe you look hot like so good beanie looks sexy on you hell yes on the beanie I'm amazed how good you look in I love the nails by the way can't go wrong with the French now totally a medical doctor like this adds up yeah I mean I know I've gotten that from my medical doctor before you do where beanie's I mean you said there's like one two three four five five and a half to six sexual and you endos there that he's dropping on her yeah I like damn babe like you're gonna call your client you're gonna call your client but I get irritated when I go into the tanner in the 60 year old girl calls me hun yes we don't we don't know each other I don't need to patronizing I'm old but you don't need to patronize we don't need to say that shit yeah is this the same is this the same one here no this is it but there's more there's more comments I think this was I just put another one up here this is the next one down oh yeah so this is the same person so she checked in again the following week God babe you look beautiful so there's that babe again godly I think he meant the right god oh okay okay okay everything's something is wrong I'm gonna say sick so just ignore me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely beautiful not just fit and ripped but your body looks beautiful like don't take this in a pervert way because it's not what I mean but when I look at your body looks desirable if that makes sense like you don't look bulky or overly muscular or nasty drugged up you look perfect hmm now I think clans are looking for a little bit of our opinion on how they're looking but not in that respect right I honestly I'm surprised this woman checked in with them more than once tell you the truth after that first one unless you know maybe I don't know oh so this one I think she this is a continuance of the conversation and he asked her how old are you I forgot to ask and you said you weigh 120 right now I'm wondering if he's asking this is a younger person just making sure they're over the legal limit but anyway he continues I get so mad and this is just a side note but I get so mad when women want to pretend like they don't want sex even though their sex drive is high I'm single and I only have been single for a couple months and I've been trying to meet I think he continues on to say new people yeah but anyway we continue on it says anyways I'm happy your sex drive is there and your boyfriend and I'm sure your boyfriend enjoys the heck out of it but I was sorry it wasn't it wasn't high because then that means your hormones are screwed up so there's his professional there's one professional analysis of that whole conversation in the end and the technical term is screwed up and referring to the hormones yeah all right I grabbed that next one and I'm just skipped down yeah there's a lot of banter back and forth but listen Friday I want you to take photos with the same underwear and top and naked because I want to see the difference in a week also do them empty stomach please and send me your weight with it yeah just asking for another naked one let's go on to the next series if there's one where he straight up tells a girl that he's yeah she should have sex with them all right I'll just I didn't read all of them so I'm not sure which one that was was this I'll just grab them one at a time yeah it sounds on this line okay yeah just go ahead and let's put up the next one okay so anyway what we're doing is we're sharing like a series of conversations here that these women have have sent to you had sent to go oh anyway so he was also ripping off his his place of employment allegedly allegedly but you know in here it says he's telling the female client to come get some GW cardering basically he says come on Sunday night so I can give it to you super cheap when Marla wasn't there also when you come Sunday for progress you also you will come Sundays for progress picks babe so he's not there either so why would you if you're doing your job professionally not want the owner of the business to be there while you're doing your quote unquote professional progress pictures I know I know skim skip yeah I'm pretty sure you want to have sex I'm pretty sure that's what he wants yeah yeah yeah keep going off this one all right here's a nice laughing isn't attempt at levity it's yeah anyway condoning before anybody you know any listeners you jump on me for having a shitty sense of humor about it that's all it is no way can don't this behavior yeah no no all right here's this is the last one I wanted to actually the second the last one because there's one more basically he's talking to a client and he goes that you will get attached to me but as a friend on a deeper level because then sex is involved so if you need sex just have it with me and I do with you and you'll see how it will help you then we will then we will keep our coach client relationship because I don't want to lose you as a client and then she literally says I've just had all my coaches want to sleep with me so this time I don't want to add that in which is I mean that very there when I read that one like wow that's more indicative of the larger problem in the industry that maybe isn't being talked about enough and he continues to say all I'm trying to do is help you talk to you on it but you definitely need to let go of probably an exploits friends name there and let yourself define the menu want yeah the rest of this is an important that's the fact that he's yeah the fact that he A he's he's literally a one of the string of coaches she's had in a row that has have tried to sleep with her like that's just crazy yeah let me throw something in here too because somebody like this doesn't approach every female client like that what's they get about that goes after he can't he won't go after the stronghold to tell him to go fucking south and they're going to out him and everything it's a feel it's almost like this fucking vibe that they can they can almost pick out and I hate to say this word but I'm sorry because I can't think of a better one there's almost a weakness okay it's almost like I know I know that that's a shitty word because then it implies that in some way that's what a predator so a woman is is the cause they're being a victim but that's not the case all it is is it's they're not as forward and is fuck you and that's sort of thing so they can pick it's it's it's similar to a guy or it's similar to a person sexually abusing a child it's the same thing like a teenager or something where they know or they have an idea that they can keep their mouth shut or that they're in some way intimidated by them or psychophantic in a sense maybe that's not exactly the word but there is an obscene psychophantic type of vibe that they get otherwise they they wouldn't risk being outed yeah and god knows this motherfucker didn't just start doing this I will say I like this last one I like this last one because he picked the wrong chick and uh oh he starts giving it back to him yeah yeah I don't know exactly when I'm there and then but she she got he must have gotten really mad at her to the point where he's saying and all these fake ass braids L-O-M-A-O dirty ass hair of yours like she's he's like yelling at her he's a beat like this is abuse okay flat up you know this is abuse all the way down to you know using the n-word against this woman like yeah I assume this this client was of was a black female yeah um that he probably tried to get with and she probably rejected him we don't have the full you know string of comments but you can kind of deduce that something went wrong in their relationship it culminated with him dropping the n-word with the hard-ar by the way on her so I have a feeling she didn't want to play ball with that is what that came down to and she probably my gasses she called him out is what it that's what I would guess in a situation like that may least so yeah I guess I mean what are we when it go from here because one of my questions is you know what what can we do to help our community because this is fucked up and I don't want to see this continue to happen hey I don't want to see people getting hurt like this is a fun sport I love bodybuilding and I want everybody who gets into it to have the opportunity to have a great experience versus some people they might run into a coach like that and be like you know what this isn't for me and walk away and then you know get cheated out of that experience so how can we help people I think you said bodybuilding yeah you said bodybuilding is a fun sport right and it is but for the three of us on this podcast it's a professional business and we treated as such and we treated the same way as if we were carpenters or we were school teachers or whatever line of business you know and I look out of this way it's awareness like if you like okay we just had our roof done today right well if the roof starts leaking in three days I'm gonna absolutely say something to other people who maybe inquire at me about how did that company do on the roofing job so I think it's the awareness you know talking about this kind of stuff and I even like I you know talking to Google last week kind of got some ideas about maybe starting something but database of coaches and clients and I know Adam McBass started you know trying to do this couple years ago but he wanted to charge money right from the coaches like 30 bucks a month or something like that to get to get judged or whatever but maybe like a database where someone can put the coach or the clients name because I'm including clients and they're also and then just maybe you're experienced with them or you know maybe things they did wrong like hey this guy asked me for you know pictures nude or you know this guy just wouldn't not let me take 2000 milligrams of trying to weak or whatever you know yeah so yeah even and I completely agree with you 100 percent but I just think too that if clients because I think this happens a lot happens in society outside of our industry too you know something bad happens to you if someone treats you like shit sometimes it's just like oh it's not even worth it you know you walk the other way and that leads the door open for them to continue to whether it's a business a person who's a trainer a roofer you know or anything like that it it's it's all the same shit and I think when we don't it's almost feeling obligation myself personally you know some people will think well you're just going after this guy I feel obligated that we do that and if something else comes up next week there needs to be more of this but it would be better coming from the clients because when it comes from trainer sometimes it can be misconstrued to be like oh your jealous or he's got this or he's a he's a pro in his physique and he can't say I don't know there's a main different fucking things but when it comes from a client and then there becomes a pattern then that says a lot and especially with social media I think that if there was this egregious behavior and there was a pattern to it I do think that those coaches would it would it would get attention I don't think it would be lost in the shuffle but the database a good idea you just gotta get somebody to do it and you gotta get somebody to do it for free and it's hard to get people to do shit for free these days are my dual patreon okay what what do you sound about I yeah what do you think about I wanted to ask a question Andrew and I we're on the phone for a minute earlier today talking about doing this topic you would mention another situation with a coach that had a non-disclosure agreement that is clients you had to sign I'm not gonna name yeah I had a question with that that these other stores yeah just and there's a lot of other ones I haven't seen concrete evidence but let me ask you I have seen a lot of different non-disclosure agreements and stuff and I wanted to ask your opinions I mean obviously that puts you as a client into a physician where you would feel like oh I legally can't say anything now but what do you even think about those agreements do you let me and do you guys have like agreements like that or do do your clients have to post three social media posts and take you every week? no okay good client job is not going to get them right and those waivers and the disclosures I mean you're talking about at least most of us if you're good you've been around for a while you're working internationally anyway so not only are waivers useless in the United States other than them basically just being a deterrent yeah but really legally good luck with that but outside of the United States you're at the mercy of whichever international law I mean come on over a trainer look I'm not saying it can't happen I'm saying as they got bigger fish to fry another thing is going on and I think honestly I think that's what pushes some of this this behavior not only train people even scamming people what are the repercussions I mean is anybody really gonna be able to run you down probably not the only other concern I have with the database is this what if you have because I mean it it's not out of the realm of possibility that newer trainers could go after other trainers to kind of discredit or how do you keep the credibility in these are questions obviously that we need to do working how do you keep the credibility of the actual allegations literally ruin someone who didn't do anything wrong so then you have to wonder is there an opportunity for that person to come back and explain to be like are you kidding me this is what happened or is it just matter fact that's the allegation and it's stuck to that person I don't know there's some there's gray areas there a funcels with us as a lawyer and he says an agreement that violates the law isn't valid huh there you go hey guys I'm gonna take a brief

I've least blow to everything thanks for watching thanks for your support so we have a bunch more stuff including a physique or tea coos this let me find these pictures who do we have here Andrew oh well you want to give you all these pictures here let's see sure I see it's not right this rob oh yeah rob rob vansan yes it's a cool name do he should be like I did or a wrestler or something or yeah like rob van damn yeah it's like that isn't it yeah yeah what just got is a broke heart anyway that's a different he got his pro card at the 2021 NPC USA's okay and I can't remember what how many pro shows he's done I know I think he's from the East Coast because I feel like he did the Eastern USA's like I don't know four or five years ago and one the overall there but he wanted a physique critique so I'm really like the detail in the front of his quad like that it's just like I'll twist it in N'arley looking yeah I like that as I say there's almost crickets from from me and skip when there's a someone with a much better physique there's a lot to appreciate here he has a really good genetics and and I'll say too for our audio people I mean you can see what we're looking at here is a well-developed young body builder like his muscle looks young too like he's got like he could keep growing if he wants to like he's got a lot ahead of him you know fantastic quads really nice shape I will let me ask you guys this so when we do you know when judges do a critique they always start with their strengths what do you guys see as rob strings oh I mean obviously a structure I can see a little bit of his calves too yeah his shoulders yeah shoulders and you know it's funny because you said that you know he clearly does have good quads good shape which is a huge bonus yeah but I would also say that they I would I don't want to jump to the weaknesses to stay with you yeah yeah exactly yeah I don't I don't see any major strengths because I just see kind of a really good balance overall especially in that front shot and you know what this is probably the biggest genetic gift he has because he's in his offseason I believe the fact that he stays fairly lean the same throughout his whole body the only the only the only place I see that he holds a little bit of body fat is the glutes yeah yeah I mean you you could show me that front picture and be like oh he's five weeks out and I be like you know yeah yeah yeah you've even closer actually but if you I want to jump to the weakness what I'm just weakness I see is his back yep I think he needs to add more lats and carries there uh to increase that the taper and it actually would just help from the front because he has a really nice vacuum probably not the smallest waste in the world but small enough with that vacuum that with a little bit more lats from the front bang it's just gonna blow that shot away yeah that'll make him a lot more of that everything if you took everything the same and his upper body he didn't increase anything except his back width and the lats as well it would make a huge difference now that takes me to the legs though and I don't want to be the guy you know I don't want it again this is tough because he's got a better physique and I do but he's got really good shape in his quads and his hands I do think that there is plenty of room for more size mm-hmm yeah you know what I mean if I go straight and back I'm like dude it would make a huge difference moving forward yeah it's almost like the attachment um you know on the outside of the kneecap if it was just a little bit lower there I think that would might change your opinion a little bit but but yeah more size overall yeah back and back and legs I got to I will say he's tall is he oh shit I don't know because it's coming from the countertop where he's doing and I don't know he kind of looks he looks taller based because think about how tall a stove is I think stover generally gonna all be about the same height aren't they yeah and he's he's maybe a foot from the stove would you say I feel like the stove I feel like the stove like comes up to my way so it's like he's I feel like he's like foreign just taller than me I think I bet he's five foot 10 I'd see that maybe yeah five five eleven somewhere in there yeah I'll tell her you and your your taller's two and a half but now I'm six one and three quarters I guess yeah I'm gonna see we've got a couple more pictures all throw up here he's got a oh he's got an an am shot here let's see and then we've got a side shot too let's see it blow that up a little bit and then here's this side chest shot as well all right you guys stick with the lats look at his legs on the side yes I shot looks really good but I still say the last like flat in the in the app that I shot will really blow that up and make it a whole new shot form yeah and also this because I looked at a lot of his contest picks on his Instagram biggest knock I would have on him is I got to find a way to get those glutes in at the I think everything else is nice I think he just holds a little bit extra there yeah because everything else is build everywhere else and I know it's not a gluten-handling contest and the trunk's cover up most of it yeah it is a little bit distracting so I think you know it's pushing that it's just a little bit harder or trying something else to to try to get them to come in a little bit more because from the side you know he looks great from the front he looks great it can be the septive when everything else is looking that good you know what I mean like that's maybe that's what I mean yeah it can be not know I mean like it can be deceptive when you're dieting and everything else is looking at that good that you know and then and then I don't know you know it's a trick it's hard to like sometimes you have to even like sacrifice everything else to get them to come in but maybe longer diet and then it's taking a little time filling out you know I don't know I was going to say deceptive in the sense that like because everything is so dialed in and conditioned that the one area that isn't just like a cool dry peel sticks out more the other way like a sore thumb that that's kind of where I was going right I could see that all right what's what do you guys say we jump into some listener questions I know we've got a few floating around here see and if anybody had I think we had I'm gonna run to this one because Alfanzo was so nice to provide us legal counsel in order to keep him from sending us a bill I'm going to bring his question up because he had a he had something I think it was related to the assault bike so while I dig up the other ones you guys can talk about this one he says any thoughts on the assault bike improving ability to do higher rep squats 15 to 20 I've added a salt bike hit intervals just four to five minutes of 10 20 intervals and I think it's actually improving my squat I was already doing other hit with the roar and list with a stationary bike at 180 minutes a week 90 list and 90 hit man that's a lot of cardio how is it assault bike it's like it's like a spin bike but you know like the the ones that broke cells they're a little more comfortable that they're on and they give they can give you more resistance don't they have like the fan got the fan yeah they have the handles they have the salt that's in the salt bike yeah that it's like with the crossfit people use okay because I've seen those shwinn you used to make those in the 80s yeah exactly they're back yeah they're back and they're nice like they have ones with magnetic wheels and stuff they're they're good they're good not is yeah okay so he's asking any thoughts on the assault like ability improving the ability to do higher reps squats 15 to 20 reps yeah absolutely I mean think about it you're just increasing your work capacity like like tenfold by adding something like hit in so anything that's intense you know we we call squats like workout I think it's a full body exercise when you're when you're doing 15 to 20 reps and you're grinding out of widow maker absolutely so yeah you just increase your work capacity a hundred percent there mm-hmm yep I can't disagree with that who was it we were talking about that Scott not well it was when I was rehabbing we were talking about the recombin bike and doing hit on that and it's funny because I still now that I and I don't have my knee issues anymore but I'm not convinced that they're not still there but I always start off with my backwards walking and then I do my uh recombin bike and I take the intensity out to the point where I'm literally blowing like I've got a pump in my quads as I not race but I get my shit and get to the hack or get to whatever I'm gonna open with first so that when I start on there I've already got a pump and there's a lot of blood in my knees and my legs nice so over time it'll be interesting to see how hard I can go with that especially now that I'm gonna be more of a surplus where before I was in you know this deficit that was massive and even then I was getting stronger but I could tell that my capacity my lung capacity wasn't as I don't know just what it's from not training legs for so long I could have really struggled with that so it'll be interesting to see how that comes back but I'm gonna use that it's similar it's not an assault bike but it's a similar process just to see if that's gonna that's gonna help it all with oxygen uptake because let me come on when you usually well maybe it's just me but a lot of people fail because of long their lungs before they do their legs and I know that's the position I'm in right now so until I'm able to get back and start really bearing leg sessions it's gonna be my lungs for a while as I build them up before it's my my legs it actually failed. Do you guys remember or have you heard jump here of folks talk about his crazy leg training he would get on the bike for like five minutes and just ride ride ride ride ride ride or however long I can't remember but it was a short duration and then he just run over to the squat bar and he'd do a set like that it VJ was doing that for a while and that would be back and forth yeah yeah like he would get on the bike I didn't know that yeah he'd go go go go go go and then he'd go get on and go do squats right after that it was kind of made a comeback a couple years ago the the biking like high intensity sets into for quad growth I don't remember exactly who maybe Matt Jansson put it out like 10 or 12 years ago or something like that when he was kind of first you know newer in the sport and I know it was a lot of other guys kind of started doing that I don't think they were going back and forth from like squat rack to to to leg extensions squat rack to to to become a bike or whatever but but there was something about like some cyclist training and some muscle hypertrophy that they were getting and so people were trying to like incorporate that as like an exercise like four sets of like 45 seconds to start off there they're they're quad training routine or something like that okay Andrew no I'm going to increase um Andrew added sled pole and push would be great for squat strength he says this is coming from a competitive power lifter that's interesting that that is brutal too man when you start like digging down you have to get low you know what I mean when you get real low and you push with your legs those sleds can be a lot of fun the pushing I always found to be really really calf heavy I could see that yeah so I didn't come back to it until when I had knee problems and I started pulling and that was one of the first things that I did and was able to do because there was a relatively limited range of motion or you could limit the range of motion I guess it's a better way to put it and that helped me to get my first couple minimal pumps when I was still having a lot of knee pain and recovering from that right on all right let's see what else we have here so I'm going to grab these from YouTube and I know we have some at Facebook I think I have some from Patreon as well he says um question for the next show regarding blood sugar regulation so my morning blood sugar seems to run in the mid to high 90s which is higher than I'd like I test first thing in the morning usually after a glass of water and the time between my last meal and when I test is around nine hours what's interesting to me is that my post perennial blood sugar is always in the high 70s and mid 80s one to two hours after meal so my question is should I be concerned with the slightly higher fasted blood glucose if my post perennial blood glucose is good I am just experiencing the dawn phenomena I know you probably need more contact contact and a better look at my diet to truly answer this but my diet is good carbs are around 400 grams and 60% of them are pre-intra and post workout not training days carbs are 275 thanks guys love the show and appreciate all you do so my answer is maybe maybe because I mean well on the positive side he said is post perennial and post-absorbed of glucose is you know right where you want it to be yeah and what that really means is your body is ready to accept the next meal right blood glucose levels down that 70 to 80 range your cells are now receptive again to the effects of insulin carbs you know and one thing which I probably talked about because I you know we always talk about blood sugar and everything never talk about why 90 milligrams for decilitors and good number okay and it's because that's what the brain requires of constantly to react optimally okay so everything is controlled by the brain that's why you know when people are like well what does it matter if I'm 99 or 100 versus 90 like why's it got to be 90 you know so I always try to point that out to people but now so on the positive end his post-perennial and his post-absorbed of metabolism is good but he's still waking up high I'm not so keen on this seriously saying it's the dawn phenomenon and I used to I used to be like oh it's just dawn phenomenon but it could be that his body is stuck in some sort of fight-rflight response meaning cortisol levels are too high now now now I'll be honest if we if we did see that in the morning we would probably see similar patterns of that throughout the day as well but basically when you're stuck in fight-rflight you're pushing out cortisol cortisol causes a lever to dump glucose your blood sugars taste higher more than it should and there's an easy way to test for that you would there's a company called CRT which does a diurnal cortisol test where you spit in a tube you can either do it once or you can do the four times throughout the day I like people do the four times throughout the day so I can see what's going on with their cortisol throughout the day you know it should be higher in the morning and then drop throughout the day and be lowest you know somewhere around midnight and and you know you you don't necessarily have to be high all the time you can be high at couple different points you could be high at all your points or you could be normal you know or you could even be low you know but I do think that is just one thing to take into consideration here but beyond that I would say are you progressing are you looking good or do you feel like you're getting a good response or you getting good pumps in the gym if that's the case and I wouldn't really worry too much about it totally missed the whole damn thing I just had to look at my mic to make sure it was on because I would hate to be like all animated me can't hear me anyway the one thing because I didn't even catch the whole question one thing I will say is this and I I wonder I would assume you guys back up in this but hell who knows you can run higher you know with blood sugar levels and everything else and still make crazy fucking gains and you can still get crazy lean it's just not optimal and I mean I've seen some pretty bad situations where I've literally looked and gone damn like how maybe this maybe these numbers aren't even right like how can they be progressing I think we know the guy you're talking about one guy in particular you're telling us about it was like using growth and peptides particularly was having like really difficult time could this guy he's not he was he was he was real high that's true but that's not the only reason I say that I mean okay people who are just running and they're so were you know they're they're just I don't want to say obsessive about it because you don't you know you do want your blood sugar levels running optimally and running where they're supposed to but but not like shit man I'm gonna die in 10 minutes I mean this kind of sometimes the like things are not gonna have diabetes tomorrow you know it is something you need to get a hold of but there's time to figure out what's going on it doesn't have to be figured out right now or tomorrow just need to be on it to find these patterns and find and play with things and tweak things and we we'll get it figured out but that's a good example for sure because he ran so high but but I've had other kind not run that high don't get me wrong but other clients weren't running optimally and in a lot of times it doesn't get in the way like you think it would yeah I've seen where people just oh gifted that it does I see that where people like didn't even know they had an issue until they're like hey I decided you know I got a fasted I got a glucose monitor how do I use this I've had people just random people tell me that and like they never knew they had a problem they've been going their whole life and everything's same time you know sometimes it is a problem in question I the first question I was asked people to like do you have any history you know and sometimes they're like oh my mom's a diabetic type one and I was like oh okay well we really want to pay attention to that then you know obviously this might be a different case I wanted to ask you a question and you're about the cortisol thing so if if that was the case would his would it still go down during the day like because his reaction if so he would he could still get those lower levels those low readings okay yeah so you tell it it's a see a four different points throughout the day at regular intervals yeah and there's the gut there's the baseline and a range so when you get those sheet I'm trying to show you yeah where am I so like it's not just like it's not just like one line right it's like it's like a what do you call it like a shaded area yeah where anything in between those lines are it's considered normal so yeah you could absolutely be high you know at 2 a.m and then you know back in range throughout the rest of the day that kind of thing how we expensive is that's what 120 bucks I think okay no it's not something that I'm like hey every new client need to get this stuff yeah you know I'd be curious is all that's I was just kind of interested myself yeah and it actually be interesting to do like say in the summertime versus the winter time especially where in the northeast and or you know where you live where it's dark out in what's earlier and spaced darker out because that plays the role in it as well so coming there's tons of factors but I was gonna ask you in terms of the you guys the blood sugar you guys ask for blood sugar every check in or is it more like you see how things are going let's say you got a long-term client and you just start to get this kind of little spidey sense like hey let's take a blood sugar reading tomorrow or next time you check in because something just starting to add up that like I think we need to pull back a little bit or you just literally every week like I want blood sugar every single check in I ask for it now if I think something's out which is odd be kept not odd but I used to have blood sugar temperature tons of that stuff early on years ago and I think I just cut to the point where the things that didn't I don't know how I'll say this but the things that didn't usually like it ended up being worthless information the large majority of the time that I just phased it out honestly really without even meaning to it's not like I went one day I don't need this anymore it was just it got phased out over time but there are times where it is like you say almost like a spidey sense like oh something's not right what's up let's get a few other things yeah yeah yeah I've done the same thing it's not something I require every time that said I do have clients that like to keep their eye on it and they do send it literally every time but it is a good point because I have the same thing I do have lot of clients who do it without me asking them to do it and I will try to get it at certain points like say like we're getting ready to start a push you know that's like a great time to be like okay let's see where you're at we'll get a big slice here what kind of push that's sorry we're gonna start in I don't like using the word bulk anymore you know yeah mean you so they are gonna start in somewhere is push we're gonna start an upward push about that I'll use the word bulk with like my clients that are like 18 to 23 yeah because I feel like you need to have least one good solid perm a bulk error in your training career so you know what it is what it feels like to really slam food yeah and I do think there's a lot we said about putting on good size I don't think you can do it continuously I think we all agree that just put on on need a body fat is worthless but I do think that in your early formative years that for lack of better terms perm a bulk of like a you know 12 to 16 months of just being big and as large as you can eating as much as you can I do think that kind of sets the at least teaches you how to be a body builder I will say that sure you know the problem or the obstacle with doing that is the large percentage very very large majority of people even when they're young they want to be lean they want to stay lean this is about 15 years ago yeah there's like I'll fucking go big I know even myself like I was cool I look back at pictures I'm like I could not tolerate myself with a face like that now like what a mock so it's just a completely different approach than it was years ago hey we got a check-in question check this out you see Suma Klein of mine he says question for the next episode check-in pictures should they be taken immediately upon waking should you pose run one round first any fluids he's asking because I'm so diligent and I crack the whip and I'm like you're not allowed to do anything take those goddamn pictures the minute you wake up you son of a bitch oh not going to the bathroom no I'm kidding yeah no you guys I just don't want to wake up you wait picks yeah I don't what I said I just say first thing you know whatever first thing means without without eating you know I think it's kind of open if if your some of it always gets up in the first and you want to do is have a glass of water first thing in the morning I'm not going to be like don't drink that glass of water it's cold morning your dry knees or whatever you know if that's just a routine and you do it every time then fine just you want to recreate the scenario the same every time have you ever had guys or girls if you ever had clients that it for them it's just not going to be doable like first thing in the morning where they're like you know what I just I can't do them first thing in the morning I wake up at 238 and I literally have to get out my door and blah blah blah I can shoot them you know after work when I get to the gym you know something like that what do you guys think about a situation like that I'd much rather have them because they're they're just it's a it's a much better assessment if there aren't other variables in there you know I'll get the the client every now and then who can't well buy and large I mean I can't remember the last time I had somebody that said that they couldn't do them until later now they might not get them that one morning and they're like you know I'm really sorry to them tomorrow morning so I typically because you know I have skip loading so I would rather take a look at my clients condition when they are the most depleted or the most you know the flatest so if they load on a Sunday then I want them on Friday morning that way they have a day if something comes up and then we can look at them Saturday morning Saturday morning is better but yet at the same time if I have a client who sometimes may not be able to get that done you know you even go Friday to Saturday if you have a wife who gets up with you and takes your picture she may not want to get out of a bad Saturday morning yeah when you've had a response to take pictures and she'll be mad at you so you know there's a good evidence and things like that be like okay I'd link a tripod with a batter or a clicker I'm like buy this one it's $43 you know what everything that's been money on in the sport it isn't worth it to you to spend $43 to not have to wake your wife up and make her mad at you for a while that five in the morning or whatever I encourage people we didn't you had given us your whole explanation on checking in pictures Andrew I didn't even share what I tell people I was like listen if you can't shoot the pictures yourself like use a self timer I have people just use the video feature and then take screen caps which I didn't I'm sure I forgot to mention that somebody did mention that in the comments afterward but I'm a huge fan of be self-sufficient don't rely on anybody else to do your stuff you know your pictures and I'll go as far as to say like hey that's really great that your wife's willing to like take part of your prep and cook your food but I'm off for cooking my own food too as much as I can you know I've seen too many people making a fucking example that's all I was doing what got go easy it was just an example you guys suck I don't know I feel like I've seen people what wife's get resentments when they've been cooking rice for twenty weeks you for real you know I think you're point about doing as much of yourself and not not expecting I guess yeah do any of it for you I think if they if they offer to help or something like that that's great but I mean this is a you're only going on stage by yourself you're not bringing them with you so you know you're the one that can train you they only look into the cardio so you might as well you know cover all aspects of that as well but I would say this about the people that all right so it's kind of a gauge of seriousness to me on if I say fast you know I want fasted picks and someone's like oh well like I've had people say like oh but I got to be at work at eight o'clock in my mind like there's a million fucking cannons going off my head like okay so get up five minutes earlier than you normally would take the damn picks at six o'clock you know but I'll tell you story back in 2017 I was two weeks out from a show and and Nate wanted to go to the New York pro and I already told him I'd go to the New York pro with him that year and I'd go pick him up and it's a six hour drive for us right I got up and I still had 45 minutes cardio and my check-ins with meadows that day it was a Saturday I got up at two o'clock in the morning I drove over to the place where I was doing my checking pictures I drove back home and did my cardio for 45 minutes or whatever it was shower did all my meals got in the car I was on the road by 445 or something like that okay to go pick up Nate to go my point with that is it like when you really want to get something done there's no there's nothing that's gonna shortage of a bomb exploding your house that's gonna stop you from getting to die and so yeah I use it kind of as a gaugest seriousness if people come up with like excuses like oh I've got this or something like that that morning is it okay if I check I'm like you couldn't have waking up we'll kind of seven minutes earlier to go snap those pictures really like that's that's that's what's gonna hold us back here so that's just my take on it I appreciate that for sure man all right I'm see if I can squeeze in then the one more question here um man this is okay this is gonna be potentially not just like a little quick question but we'll see also we had some funny comments Omar said my wife was shooting if I will grow up at 3 a.m. and Steve told me he was so that he trains it he trains it like four in the morning you guys he got his follow him on instagram dude he's like pressed in like 140s for like 10 reps at 430 in the morning he's squatting five plates like like I got to give him major props because that's like way more hardcore than I've ever been I was got an incredible physique too like he looks really good yeah yeah all right so even one of our long time followers part of the patreon he says uh great episode question for the next episode uh what are the best ways to tell if you were over-trained is resting heart rate uh when you first wake up a good indicator that last one's a little tricky it can be but it's not like oh my resident heart rate's up now I'm over trying to take a week off I mean it's not I used to look at it a little bit more black and white than it actually is which is funny because I don't want to go off on a tangent but this brings up other things like HRV and things like that where you know depending on who you talk to those things they're important and it depends you know and another people don't think they're very important honestly I don't know about HRV but I can tell you with the resting heart rate it's not it can be an indicator but it's not a black and white type thing over training I mean I always say the first the most obvious signs for me and I have to go with me because I don't know what even my clients feel when they're over trained um obviously the most the first one is a regression or a very clear and obvious stabilization of progress in the gym from a from a strength standpoint but there's caveat there's caveats to that because you could be dieting you could be in a cut phase you could be you know if you're it's a workout later you know 10 days after an increase in calories you're more depleted things like that but when you don't want to go to the gym for a few days you're probably the large majority of a silver train because we want to go to the gym so there's a lot loss of motivation and appetite is in there too if you're not hungry I mean unless you're just again there's caveat to everything if you're just forcing and choking down food yeah you're probably not going to be the very hungry but if you're just on a regular on your regular diet and you've been hungry and you're putting down the food and then you just within a week or so you're not hungry and you're choking down the same amount of food that's a pretty clear indicator too. I'll those are the ones that come to mind mind what do you guys say. I think the most the easiest one is what you touched on is is it you know are you are you going to the gym to work out or do you want to go to gym to train yeah I think you know are you just doing it because you're obsessive-conflulsive and it's Thursday and I do my back on Thursday or like yeah okay last week I did this and this today I want to try to go and beat that but whatever it is you know I think that's the first thing blood sugar you know we just talked about blood sugar but that can be an indicator if you're stuck in fight or flight and you need a D-load are you regressing in the gym like not just on one exercise are you regressing multiple days in a row in terms of I could do seven plates on a hack square so hacks go out for ten last week and this week I could barely get let's you yeah I only get six plates lat you know for for eight and my body was just spent and then the next day I tried to train chest and instead of the 130 pound dumbbells man the 115s felt like they were the heaviest things I ever picked up are you getting a pump you know when you get to the gym and you actually start training and moving blood around are you muscles feeling like they're in court dinner they just kind of just stay in flat so I think those are probably the three easiest things that you can kind of pick up on yeah I had a great with all that all right guys well listen we got to wrap this thing up we appreciate everybody tuning in for your live viewers we're recording another episode so hang out with us we got uh we got some fun stuff next episode it's gonna be about DHB and a bunch of steroid stuff all the fun stuff uh thank you guys for tuning in as I said thank you everybody who helps to support the programming through Patreon thank you to skip an Andrew for hanging out with us you guys can reach out to them for coaching go to teamskip.com you can go to bodybarry.com you can reach me make naly diets at gmail.com join me any email and check out our sponsors trnutrition.com user code thank for additional savings like I've always said reach out to me if you have any questions about their supplements but any of their flavors uh supplements source.ca for those of you in Canada and go to strong sports nutrition uh if you are in the UK they've got some awesome house supplements over there for another episode of Blood Sweat and Gear with skip hill and you're very I'm Scott McNally and we will see you next time thanks for tuning in
