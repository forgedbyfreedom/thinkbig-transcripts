I remember that went yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We went to The factory where his supplements were being produced and that's where rich pianist stuff was being made to as well Oh, no kidding funny because John was starting off and John made a really pretty large investment and rich pianist 30 times as big as like there's John's you know a few palettes of you know the first the first bottles and and like that whole half of the warehouse is rich Be honest stuff. Oh, yeah, but the thing that you mentioned the $25 off and I remind you remember I forget the name they that they gave to this area of the warehouse, but down in the basement They had like all these left over supplements from the like from like years now of companies that were like starting to start their own supplement line Yep, and we just went down there's like he was like a museum of supplements that never were or Oh kidding. Yeah, so cool. We went down there and they were just everywhere like you find something you want Just take it. Holy crap. No, grab it. Yeah, so like I got like some there was like one like pre workout There was like I think it might have been like WTF. I think that was the first like that It's called it that and there was like another was called like brain blaster or something like that Yeah, heart you and guy with his eyes bugging out of his head. That's amazing all these hilarious supplement names You know like they're looking it's like you almost want to buy those supplements because the name of Okay, just gotta buy this just to have it. Yeah, you know Like like I have somewhere in one of my boxes that I haven't haven't unpacked I have a supplement that is probably 15 or 20 years old to actually had canadao all in it What is that and Canadaoids? Oh CBD. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, it's got CBD in it This is long before like this came on the scene, you know, and yeah and pot and came legal Yeah, and the name of this it was it was to increase your appetite and the name of the supplement was black hole You just want to eat so much you're like a black hole. You're just engulfing everything That's crazy. I never even took it. I haven't even opened the bottle, you know But I'm our topic today though our topic is like the opposite of the black hole We have gotten asked a lot all the time now one of those I think like one of the most popular buzz supplements out there right now or drugs in bodybuilding are the GLP one drugs and We had a question and actually this was from one of our Patreon people He said have you ever had a client use a GLP one Agonist like some a GLOOTEIDE or Lyricaloo tied I've never tried it personally But sounds like it could be helpful for someone doing a hard push at the tail and of a diet I know that vigorous Steve has talked about this stuff a lot I first heard about the GLP one drugs back in 2016 I didn't interview with Colette Nelson women women's bodybuilder She she had done a whole show with me about micro dosing insulin and she said But we have to get back together and do a show about a new topic because everybody in bodybuilding is going to freak out when they learn about these new Blood sugar drugs that are actually going to help you lose fat and And she was talking about GLP one stuff so We haven't really talked a lot about them on the show. It's not something that I've personally used I've known people who have used them for medical purposes including a client and I've seen issues In some of those situations But I wanted to bring it to you and maybe we could talk just a little bit of science about what these drugs are and and maybe Here's what my concern is too is that a lot of times when something new comes out Everybody always sees all the positives for the first few years and everybody's like Oh, this is the latest greatest thing and it's real easy to sweep under the rug the negatives In fact people get really upset if you start pointing negatives out of something they do they do You know and and until that drug or supplement has run its course Down the road and then people have a more balanced perspective, but I don't know Let's balance some perspectives today. That's that's my thought Yeah, and sometimes you just find like Test the time We'll we'll tell you there's so many supplements that have come and gone absolutely about a lot of the growth home when releasing peptides Yeah, you know those were so big before and you know now some people still use them I think you can still find them. They're still selling yeah, especially people who don't want to do something illegal You know, they feel it's gonna be a safer option legally Right, but if they were like if they were all that then you'd see here guys that you know Probably like they're using growth hormone for six weeks and they do which would make sense actually do like two weeks or four weeks with those Yeah, they have an organizational effect on the pituitary because they're stimulating Petuitary pituitary produces a number of different hormones and those those tend to help Petuitary organized the self there's an organization to the The cells that's discrete the various hormones that come to it very hormones So it would make great sense if there's any issue with like growth hormone recovery Which I don't think there is but you'll be sort of like doing um Kind of a PCT type of thing great right with yeah for growth hormone But people aren't doing that, you know, it just didn't happen and there's a there's a lot of truth that comes just from Standing the test of time and and you know the bro science Which I think of as as experience through trial and error in practice so to speak out of there's you can think of bro science as what someone says This works and they just make up some bullshit scientific explanation Right, that's not what I'm talking that that's that's the worst sort of hormone growth sense I'm talking about guys who've tried things out and it seems to work from experience and And they may not even know why the set that is connected in some way to the scientific understanding that we have of how the drugs work or how the Training Application may work or what have you so anyway, so this is an interesting It's an interesting Set of drugs you've got so when we are our an interic nervous system is It's just absolutely phenomenal It's connected to our microbiome with our with the bacteria that are there and that's an entirely sort of Unknown universe potentially there's there's as many Organisms of microorganisms in our microbiome as there are cells in our body Leave you and maybe more Massive number of bacteria and the spage Viruses which are bacterial viruses and our vagus nerve there's vagal activity that is mediated through the The interic nervous system and we've got when you eat for instance You've got secretin that comes from the doodinum and colisist of kinin and then these in creed and hormones Which is glucone glucose unlike peptide one and Which is vagal active and intestinal peptide that's the other one Who could find what it is it a note here. Yeah, I forgot the other one's name all the time Yeah, gastric and hepatoid and inhibitory peptide GIP so what these basically do is they Mediate the glucose signal becomes or actually potentially fats too, but the case of the increations So the GLP1 being one of those You eat and your blood glucose goes up and that will Have an effect directly on the insulin is strictly the least from your pancreas But if you eat something So you can you can test out that effect by infusing glucose in the blood we get any questions or just comments No, okay, okay, I see you look it over there. I'm like oh, maybe we're doing some good comments now my my monitors over here So I try to look this way because this is where the cameras, but if I want to look at you I'm actually over here. Yeah, you can't just make your eyes go Not on most days. I would be crazy But when you do film it because I like to see that that actually can happen So these are these are Hormones that are released from our gut actually the gut hormones and they modify the insulin release and they also modify our sense of satiety and The activity in your gut for Digesting the parasites and moving things through the gut So it makes sense like you've got a pretty bit production going on it happens all the time of course Which you eat food and then you've got a digest the food you've got to release the enzymes from the pancreas You've got to release the pancreatic hormones So you've got an enzymatic response you got a And then and and and and endocrine response and exigent response and GLP1 mediates all of that so the the medical application is for things like mainly diabetes but other related things like PCOS and And other disorders where you tend to have insulin In sensitivity or insulin resistance So you get a nice scenario where if you take it GLP1 agonist So it acts like GLP1 Normally you eat you get the stench in you get glucose that rises and then you want to Be able to control that so the GLP1 would be released to say okay, hold on We need more insulin Right so we can get the get the nutrients out of the blood into the into the cells add a post muscle What have you and we also want to slow down the food let's see if a massive like amount of your eating as fast as you can First thing you want to do is slow down the intake so it acts on your brain It says okay don't eat so much reduce the appetite because we got plenty of food coming in and also Let's slow down the movement there because we have to have time to absorb that stuff If you just ate something and it just went all the way through Then you'd have some problems because you'd have a lot of undigested unabsorb food that would get into your large intestine and That's where the bacteria have their have their way with it. So things like beans which have undigested Food part of this undigested that gets that's why you get gas people with lactose intolerance The lactase gets down there the lactose gets down there They have an issue because the the bacteria get on then you'd have diarrhea So you want to meet you want to modify and meet eight how fast the food's moving through your system So GLP one basically says hey we're full Let's make the appropriate adjustments and transit time through the G.I and Insulin release from the pancreas So here's the trick. This is why it's a cool drug so to speak Is you use an agonist that mimics that action and It slows movement through your G.I and inhibits your appetite up in your brain and because you have longer You have more stretch or a longer period of stretch that in of itself means your less hungry So it makes for you're gonna might get a little more insulin release because of it I don't know I haven't looked into the the science to see how it compares like on an acute basis to get more insulin release That would that would Move that would like send us back towards the insulin Hope hypothesis about Adapassi when have you that's all about insulin whether you're not you have body fat or not And there's not a lot of evidence is just that really in the long run It's amount of calories, et cetera So you've got a nice basically drug that tells your brain and your and your system your your G.I that you've got more food in there than you actually do Yeah, it's the easiest way to understand it tells the brain. Okay. Hey hungry should go down It's a tie is gonna be come up come on earlier. I mean you don't get hungry again for your next meal and You're gonna have food that enters into your system at a slower rate So you're basically gonna reduce reduce the glycine again decks of your food as well So it's it's a pretty nifty trick If you want to throw that figure up that I sent you we can we can kind of look at that Make that you know you just yeah my faces reach for that so Kind of shows It's what's in red there slow-skastic emptying That at the top in the middle of the brain is there suppresses appetite There's the amplifies something kind of going clockwise around the around the circle amplifies glucose dependent insulin release Actually inhibits glucose on release to So if you had low glucose you'd have more glucose on glucose is gone you release glucose So those are the main main actions I've already talked about so it's it's some It's a pretty it's a you know a pretty smart place to To put in a drug if you want to reduce if you want to reduce appetite and Slow digestion basically it's a snitty little trick into making that a very sort of principle point in appetite regulation and digestion a sneaky little spot to stick a drug in there Because it has a really primarily primary action on on those two things which dictate how hungry you get and what you're eating behavior is gonna be So for a bodybuilder this is kind of the question people are I can get in at this is you're dieting down and you're hunkering in And your your food focus is just like all if you could think about its food Yeah, well, we're not gonna be nearly as hungry and I think there's probably a dose response Mechanos of this these They're injected on a daily basis or a weekly basis so they're pretty long acting And I don't know the the pharmacokinetics of them Because I haven't had this this is this explanations are just from someone who could probably explain this Maybe a little bit better in the average person because I'm a physiologist You know and I have an understanding of how they work, but I've never I'd never tried them. I've had clients use them but it's a pretty you know It's gonna have the same kind of effects in a way totally different mechanisms You can you can take that. I think that you want That should get when you use some path of medics so use stems Like a fedron. Yeah, so you think about digestion Is parasympathetic rest repose rest and digest and sympathetic of your autonomic serve nervous system is Escape fight or flight that's sort of thing. It's the opposite so when you take stimulants You take things like a fedron. We've talked about that. It was like two podcasts back now. I think I'm clean muter all what have you they they would stimulate more activity They free up they cause like policies They may have an impact on your metabolic rate as well Like sinnafriindras et cetera et cetera and so that's those things are inhibiting your appetite and they're causing more activity And they're having they're gonna have an effect too on probably on gastric emptying. I haven't seen that with the stems But given how they work It would make perfect sense that they do so Mechner's action is gonna differ a little bit because you him means kind of an outlier there and the way that it acts It can potentially Potentiate insulin release so anyway It's sort of a different way of kind of getting the same things to some degree doesn't have that impact on metabolism Except I did find one study that shows that um One of the GLP one agonists may have been experimental one tend to cause the browning of white adipose tissue So we may have mentioned this before like when you have brown adipose This is that this is that hype that the thermogenic brown fat yeah, we did talk about that holy trail. Yeah So it may change some of your fat to I like that term browning the browning of white fat That's the term yeah, you've got white fat and kind of beige fat with some of the intermediate and then then the brown fat and the brown fat response to thermogenic drugs and general Yeah, and it's highly innervated highly vascularized Integrated whether it's sympathetic nervous system a lot of mitochondria so it's it's there it's it's a thing that you tend to have more of in people who are leaner Okay, as opposed to those who are Who are obese that that's one protection potential Clayer in why someone might have a genetic propensity for obesity because they don't they don't have a lot of brown fat okay, but it tends to cause as GLP one tends to cause At least in this rodent study that I found And he creates or shifts the white fat to brown fat so maybe even shifting you know literally body composition as well And then I think probably a direct fashion. I don't know I didn't see I didn't read that for enough You tend to assume this morning like oh shit. I forgot to look into that so There's there's evidence out there to that effect so that's the good as far as I can see that's That sounds freaking amazing that all sounds great actually that's yeah Except you can go on the FDA and look at drugs.com and you see pretty universally for For those drugs for these GLP one Agnes and then there's also a deep I think it was in that picture that we had up a bit of go the figure There's the DPP one enzyme inhibitors and those just um yeah mentions that DPP four sorry There's enzyme inhibitors that can be be given that will reduce the breakdown of GLP one So prolongs the half life and increases their activity and Those also have this negative effect one of the things that's going on here is you're stimulating the pancreas So the pankit your your your increase in that the stimulus the GLP one by agonizing its receptor At the pancreas and increasing pancreatic insulin release So pancreatitis is is a potential issue there And you don't want to have an upset pancreas that can cause all sorts of issues then you get digestive issues and then you're then you can be kind of screwed That can be that could be pretty diabolical for someone who's let's say there eight weeks I think I fuck I'm just gonna start taking one of these GLP one Agnes yeah and they build pancreatitis like two weeks after in their show And then you're not a happy camper You're adjusting and you can very well pancreatitis for the most part There's also a risk of C cell cancer it's a type of thyroid cancer Yeah, so that's a possibility too so and Also At least with those enzyme inhibitors you can get joint pain So the enzyme inhibitor is a daily pill yeah, but it can cause some pretty pretty bad joint pain Don't know the mechanism just one of those commonly Reported side effects yeah, so that's not it doesn't help either if you're trying to train hard So the devil wants to have it's due with these you know you can end up like you're constantly messing around That's the cool thing you're messing around with a pivotal point in Regulation of digestive system in your sense of satiety yeah, which is good, you know, it's a powerful lever to pull But it's also powerful lever to pull so it's gonna have potentially powerful side effects depending on the person Yeah, yeah, and I guess just like with anything I'm sure dose duration those are gonna be you know those are gonna be factors and since I haven't used these things with an athlete before I couldn't comment on that but that would be as a coach as an as an experienced person just period in in bodybuilding I would say that would be my first thought is you know using the least amount you could to get that result that you that you wanted I guess Just like with everything like yeah, if you're doing like a once a week injection There's that's nice that's super convenient, right? I don't know what the what the pharmacokinetics look does it look like does it you get a spike and then like We know we got this example like hey your TRT should be you know one mill of testosterone in right once a week right Like that's just horrible you're like you're so like you do it at the wrong time Let's say I'll just do it on Monday so I remember for being in the week and the week It comes around that'd be the worst time to have a hunger rebound come at you. Yeah. I don't know that happens So you know that's the dosing protocol They tend some a lot of times dosing protocols are There's various reasons why you might have them but sometimes the drug that you can just take once And it works for months or weeks on end is the one that most people want to do because they don't have to worry about Of course here in drug protocols is a huge issue Yes, like with exercise for any any like human like health behavior Trying to get people to follow Protocols that will improve their health drugs or exercise or whatever it might maybe prostate screening mammograms all those sorts of things adherence is just a huge huge issue Yeah, so the downside to that like if you do ideally once a day pill is okay because it's a daily thing But if you've got something that you inject and it lasts for a whole week That's imagine imagine a toxin just let's just say it's something that's literally poison That has a like as a half life on the order of a week. Oh, yeah like that toxin will take you out because it hangs around That means there's something about that toxin That in that case, you know if it's a naturally occurring toxin that that animal or that plant that produces that toxin Has evolved such that it just hangs around it takes you out like your your human system can't break that shit down Yeah, because it has a half life of a week Like our our liver is like we're we have all these p450 enzymes we talked about last time I think a little bit it's like our like we can handle all sorts of stuff, but this drug has been engineered So that it will last for a week Wow, that'd be really careful. I mean, I think that's everybody in body bullying gets that though because we all use Long acting testosterone, you know, and I mean like we know we've you know everybody who's been around They've had a shot of Deca, you know, we know what those long acting drugs can do that it's a commitment like once you take it You are you are committed so and and you know Billy Ryan had mentioned and I wasn't sure which was which I couldn't remember our fan, but he said from my understanding Some of glue tied is a once a week injection and lyric glue tied is injected almost daily So and and I remember it, you know, there's one that one that was always almost like on a daily basis So yeah, you know I would think that would be the easier one to control then, you know if you were taking it just like tre nays versus tre n e, you know Yeah, we got that you know potentially like why said why is it hanging around for a week? Yeah, you know, that's like what did they how do they modify that? Why is it working and if you are someone Let's say you start to develop pancreatitis and You know and it's related to the the doses the drug dose I'm sorry I'm safe German word sometimes everyone's likes because doses really doses is the word for dose And German it's really nice and instead of like an American wood It's related to the dose or the peak blood levels it might be let's say you do your injection on Monday and it peaks You know Monday night or next day and then you start to develop these pancreatitis symptoms Senior system yeah, we Like then this is gonna get worse like you triggered it and then then you're then you're gone So you start that four weeks out. I don't know how fast these things come on. I'm just I'm bringing You know the I'm trying to toss out potential caution so people know Maybe what to look for if it happened a big position to use these yeah, so you lose that ability to get it out of your system It's like a it's like a woman who's using anrogens and She's you know, she's gonna use Deca. Let's say exactly. Yeah, that's what I was kind of saying more times For guys, you know, I'm gonna be deal, but for almost like oh shit I just put in this I just did it actually you use double the dose and it's gonna be around for a month And I'm gonna just watch all the side effects It's evenly. There's nothing I can do about it All right, and I'll put it out listen. Let's not go to a couple of these listener questions while I got you here Billy Ryan has said I know this is typically a skip question But are there any potential Deleterious effects from using melanatin too? White is Casper and have considered utilizing it Yeah, I mean Ken can talk about melanatin and his hematicrit That was his experience and I'm we're looking at that. I dug in and I found something in a rodent Study that backed up what he had seen That's far as elevating hematicrit. I've got another buddy of the bodybuilder who's kind of substantial that's a possibility I think you mentioned too and now I have not I think about it like there's there's potential for cancer Pretty much every drug right Milion of 10 2 was actually developed as an anti cancer drugs anti for skin cancer Yeah, and I'm not I'm not sure what the issue was why it never quite made it to market I thought you would said something a while back and and this was we did it was a new year's Eve episode of blood sweat and gear And you came on and hung out with us and and you had shared I thought it was something related to cancer Maybe we should look into that one and and consider you know getting back to it, but you know Definitely definitely the hematicrit thing. I've heard that for sure I haven't let me put it this way. I hadn't attributed high hematicrit to melanatin too when I used it But hey, you know, you never know and I will say this too that I think that if you go by the old posts on the Message boards the dosing that was suggested back then I don't know how it relates to now But I think you can get away with far far less than what it used to be dose Damn I would say using it's a drug that you can see the results So I would say use the tiniest amount you can in micrograms or not Like we used to do a milligrams every day to start and load Yeah, and and I would say try to get away with much much less like hey Dry a hundred micrograms a day and see how that works and once you get there Maybe just a hundred micrograms or two fifty micrograms twice a week, you know, or once a week I think you can maintain it the the problem here's another problem. I see with it people Lose sight of how dark they actually get It happened to me. I've seen it happen to a lot of people I don't in fact, you know and and I would say it to skip space like if we were talking I don't think skip actually recognize is how dark he really is like this really dark He says dark as you can get Yeah, and I will tell you too when I used it real intense My skin was never the same since then I used to burn real easily and now it'll I'll tan it like it's had a lasting effect. I'll tan more quickly than I did in the past so I Think that happens to yeah, you mean you'll get people will get freckles and moles You got to watch for now and so you know this is where like with Maybe this is the reason I have to look into you know I have to probably find the studies that were done the clinical studies you know in root to being Available as drug but The Browning the skin is going to help with potential carcinogenic of carcinogenic effects of UV radiation that's what you know Melanin does yeah basically your skin's brown because the lights Being collected by the brown brown pigment That's good, but if you're turning on the melanocytes and they're then they're producing moles and you've got someone who's Let's say like oh my melanin, I can go out and sun do whatever want like you know I'm invincible here. I'm like Superman. I'll just get browner You may be stimulating You may have a possibility that you've you get One of those moles that turns into a skin cancer melanoma or something like that You get interaction there, but I do think it does work work that way that it has a kind of a permanent Kind of maybe even a reset of yeah of your the activity of the melanocytes or just a level of brownness that you have It's a tough tough call because You know I think Like this is mid just me personally like if if you if you know that you like let's say you've gotten on stage You know say it's Billy he's got he's he's white his Casper he's gotten on stage and and he's done everything He possibly can to get his color right try Jan Tana He's tied protein. He's like try to lick with sun rays Right, try dreaming tan He's tried combining them all and like every time he turns green and it looks like the purple hole You know like never friggin works, but if you get's a little bit of a base tan He thinks he can get it right and Does he go and like go to a tanning salon for like eight weeks, you know and work is way up to you know to that or does he Start on melanotan and not and and you actually there's a synergy between melanotan and Tanny absolutely I would I would definitely combine the two we if you're gonna use melanotan and definitely combine them Yeah, so you know at if you were to add that in and thinking just purely and I've no data to bathe this basis on it Just sort of the if some if someone was like, ah, you know, I just I burn every time I get brown and they've literally You know drop the ball on there on their stage presentation then it might make sense to throw some melanotan in there Yeah, I will say I will say that nowadays with like liquid sun rays I really think there is no need to actually tan anymore You know it used to be that we had to use protein and get five coats on you by the time you got to the show And nowadays with the thick spray tans that I think they have the color good enough That you don't need to have the base tan like you once did you might at worst need a third coat But everybody's spray tans now and they'll take care of you if you're too light They'll they'll fix that for you at the show that would be my thought This was can asked about this on in the group I think and the think big group about doing your channel I did my own channel the last couple years. I was on stage. Yeah, yeah, I used liquid sun rays It take me it literally cost me like I have a that's what we talked about that yeah, yeah, yeah, it's awesome It's awesome. It's awesome. It like I saved like hours of time $100 of money and I look just just good at it. There's better paybacks page royal There's pros and cons. I think you know it's a different conversation But and it would be a good one to have but I do think there's we did have it actually it's been a while But there's pros and cons, you know, there's I guess I could I could get into it But we're trying to get through these so hey guys I'm gonna take a brief pause to shut out our advertisers and try to make this quick But keep in mind they're responsible for helping us to put these shows out if you guys want to support our programming Of course you can do so through Patreon and thank you to everybody who supports the show through Patreon I will have links to that below as well as to all of our advertisers if you shop with our advertisers You'll get great products products that I stand behind and you'll also be supporting our programming First of all check out true nutrition.com if you're in the US I use their hydrolyzed beef collagen every day and I use their citrally mallet beta alanine and EAA on days that I train They have high quality protein powders and tons of flavors hit me up if you have any questions Use our code think over there you'll get some additional savings plus your support our programming and you'll get some high quality third party tested supplements If you're in Canada check out supplement source.ca They have blow out deals on top name brands supplements They constantly have different things happening so be sure to go to their site and check them out I recently saw a car balloon for like 30 bucks off.

Thanks for your support There was another one Scott that I think would be perfectly suited from you for you from Resa He says hi guys my question is how would you go about training for the muscle to increase in a muscle fiber size Versus muscle fiber amount So this is the old hyperplasia versus hyper trophy scenario So everyone says oh growth hormone, you know that's gonna cause hyperplasia We talked we talked about that we this was a couple of weeks ago We went into this and I showed some of the evidence suggesting that in the McDougal study That you know you've got these body builders who have arms are like three and a half inches bigger and They're fibers the same size so like did they start off was It's a bit t fibers and just spend you know all these years of training making them at the same size is the Is the guys who just trained for six months or just part of their growth because they have more fibers It's hard to say like the thing that's the thing to see here's here's why this is tough First of all people just just say hi-perch me when they're referring to muscle growth sure We've lost sensitivity to that what that term actually means this is this is like my little like I don't know it's my little kind of cork that I have my little thing that kind of bugs me a little bit Because hyperplasia means increase in cell size and or sorry hyper hyper hyper Perfectly increase in cell size and muscle growth can come from hyperch of your from hyperplasia potentially or combination there up So you measure home muscle size the changes that you see there typically if you also were to measure fiber size or much less Because the whole muscle is not entirely fiber so if the fibers make up x percent inch and they increase they double in size They wouldn't it go up and 50 percent in five besides you might see it increase in and whole muscle size is 25 percent and That doesn't even seem to match always so it's very very interesting What probably is happening when you get hyperplars a couple different mechanisms that have that have been there's evidence just from having seen What seems to be a transitional period in Whereby you go from one fiber or where you have fibers either splitting or new fibers forming both the which would lead to Hyperplasia and increase in the number of fibers So there there are images where you see little fibers that are literally like splitting off into a wise You have like two fibers like coming from one and There's also Evidence from muscle biopsies where you have small small fibers that are that are much shorter in length than the fibers that are the surrounding them It seemed like they may be new fibers When muscle fibers grow hyperchophie Sadelite cells are involved in the most part like this is kind of a little bit controversy thing. I always have to say that But you see for instance and those people who grow the best That they have more higher satellite cell density in their muscles and the increase their satellite Cell density more so than those people who are kind of moderate responders and on responders just talk about this on Thursday and a webinar I gave in German They also have an accentuated growth factor Response mgf and myogenin for instance is higher So the satellite cell activity is greater there So when muscle cells get bigger just like the the city that's enlarging you need more post offices to service the city You got a muscle cell that's enlarging you need more nuclei to service the city and those nuclei come from the satellite cells the satellite cells get turned on by the By the growth factors which are triggered by the stimulus of the weight training the injury that is involved there And satellite cells are really when there's an injury injury to the muscle there like it could you crush Crush studies the crush injuries to literally take a muscle and they just they crush it and then satellite cell activity goes sky high To repair the muscle so they're part of repair so a muscle cell gets bigger and those satellite cells Donate nuclei and then the cells get bigger in that type of energy But in other way that you could potentially have Muscle grow is you have more functional muscle cells muscle fiber muscle fibers muscle cell and that could be from satellite cells that Several of them would sort of fuse together and Or in some in the process of proliferating proliferating and differentiating themselves form a whole new fiber So the stimulus could cause them to donate nuclei to fibers to those fibers can grow or the stimulus could cause them to proliferate to the such extent that they end up forming a new fiber and That's a pretty Exenchuated process too So the question is like how can you turn on one versus the other? So the evidence we have for Hyperplasia is this things these these indirect evidence I just mentioned and you see when you have biopsies or things you see when you look at the larger muscles that have Fibres as seen like they're smaller there's that very very cool quail study that Hosing Antonio did where they progressively overload Overloads overload Stretch overload model they hang a weight off the quails wing and The quail muscle that bigger and bigger and bigger throughout the month of this overload progressive overload protocol and The fibers initially got bigger and bigger and bigger and the muscle kept on getting bigger and bigger and bigger and the fibers started getting smaller and smaller Yeah, okay, so fiber size went up and then fiber size started going down as the muscle was getting larger and larger So over the long haul What happened was in this particular study and to take this and say well, this is what happens with the resistance training is like huge leap But if we look at that that phenomenon there It suggests that long-term training like we saw in those the subject in the meddual study Maybe something which is required before some of the growth process becomes less hyper-trophic and more so hyper plastic in nature interesting and That would make sense because um and I'm gonna just spit ball something here So A lot of the lot of the body builders you know the men's lot of the best body builders that back when those studies were being done People were training the way Arnold does everyone was doing high volumes stuff not everyone's Mike Mansour was around at that time too But there's an issue with fibers just becoming like just gigantic Because you have you have to be able to have a diffusion distance so you can get energy to those Myophibros that are on the core of the of the of the muscle fiber So your mitochondria typically gonna be outside You've got the myophibros that are producing the force in there and you've got to get ATP to the myocin So the myocin ATP a so you can have crossbridge cycling you can have the force production Yeah, and that's a long haul if you have a gigantic muscle cell It's just giant there's a creatin phosphokini system that does that create and phosphates much smaller than ATP So it's real zippy it diffuses more rapidly so you can get there But eventually you get to the point where if you if you got a muscle that is you've got a stimulus that That where it would be advantage to have more muscle mass So you want hyper you want a larger muscle and You also have a stimulus that is highly energetically demanding So something like you're not just doing two sets Mike Mentors mentioned style you're doing 15 20 25 sets you got if you get this muscle fiber they get so big That it has a diffusion issue that doesn't help you with performance you can't get energy to the the myophibros and Then you've got a muscle cell where you've got energy on the periphery near the where the mitochondria and Why the glycogen is going to be throughout to but you've got potentially an issue where you've got energy availability in the center is especially when you're using this creatin phospho This shuttle it's called energy availability in the center is horrible Because the muscle fibers just gigantic ginormous and it's great on the outside Then you've got force irregularities Yeah, let me see You've got so you don't want that to want that to happen. It would be like having like a four by four truck Where you've got you know like the length of some part of the the four by four mechanism is is longer on one wheel than the other So the wheels like spin at different speeds and it'd be like that would just be a wreck for your suspension So you don't want to have better off than it may start shifting as what you're saying then then the type of growth The exactly so the so the option then is like just as we saw on the quail study the options and well We still need more muscle mass. Yeah, I've got a muscle growth stimulus here, but we can effectively create that by Having more muscle cells having hyperplasia and That way we don't have that diffusion distance issue. We sort of optimized diffusion distance some more normal muscle cell size And we can get more muscle mass by having more more cell. So the way that the thing that might lead to more Hyperplasia over the long haul again, this is a total spitball thing like you'd have to do a really long study You probably to see this yeah and measuring hyperplasia. This is a high thing the hard thing you see this in animal models You see it in rats you see it in cats you see it in quail hyperplasia happens. You know the cats thing Like there's a guy named goneya who you train cats to do risk flexion train them for like a year and they saw like 11% increase in and the Fiber number when some poor graduate student had to peel the fibers off Count on one by one and when you take rodents into that compensatory hyperplasia model You pull out the solace and you let the gastrochrome you'll see in that case some hyperplasia So And those are but those are like that's a one year study and you're counting every five or so it's like okay We're gonna we're gonna train your chests or we're gonna train one by set one way and one by set the other way And then we're gonna take your biceps out like no you're not right. That's a little bit of no really or or take a biopsy and make those Indirect kind of guests and it's like when we can when they compare the six months train versus the the elite body builders So The bottom line there is that over the long haul someone who trains it and perhaps with high volume Or include sort of a high volume more metabolically stressful type of Training Maybe sending a signal that says okay, let's get bigger and we know that high rep sets can make at least on the short term Higher-upsets can cause most of the growth as well as lower rep sets with heavier weight That lot having that component at least or training that way May give you the possibility that the signal is sent to create more muscle mass by creating more fibers Because the diffusion distance issue is something that is probably being sent to my guess just knowing generally what I know about Muscle biology is that it's muscles are bio like they're their bio energetic machines The heart is like it's its own little thing, but muscles are bad asses. So the answer You there is really really cool. So yes to answer is question though. Can you can you pick one or the other Hyperchrophy versus hyperplasia You want probably both you want to get the cells as large as they can be and they get as much muscle mass by having as many cells as possible Yeah, oh, I mean like I could probably create some system and like put together some you know of this Scientifically linked logic that says you should train heavy for you know one cycle the heavy light High-court if you high-propleasure system. Yeah. Yeah. I got some bullshit like that To apply your fibers and grow them on yes The fiber multiplication phase you know and fiber growth phase you know and Well blah blah blah you could even throw drugs in there like use some IGF one, you know But it's hard to know and there's probably genetics that are involved with the extent to which that happens I would think so Yeah, you know and there's some people that just grow crazy like like I've like I've said before You have to keep this all kind of in context too you've got Like that's I mean building a larger muscle cell is a huge overhaul Producing more muscle cells is a ginormous overhaul because you've got a very tumultuous environment there in the muscle It's not like it's an organ that just kind of sits there and does its thing You know, let's say I mean like fat cells like you know there like The force that you're producing a muscle when you train or tremendous imagine if you if you wanted like fat cells They're going to multiply and you went and you squeezed them like a hundred times a day three times a week like as hard as you could That would be severely disruptive to the tissue whenever processes are going on there so it you know it might it might be Having some rest in some recovery is going to be important just for course for a muscle hypergippy We talked about that before but even more paramount for hyperplasia to happen and This is where it's interesting. This is just kind of occurring to me like right now As we say this is that the bro the pro split or the bro split yeah, where you train once a week Would make a lot of sense if you if you respond to that first and foremost to can grow that way Because it gives you a whole week. Let's say you've trained You trained in a way that sets into motion you got enough Size in those cells so the the growth adaptation now is set in a motion whereby it would be hyperplastic in nature Right so now you need time to let that muscle rest probably as much as possible because If it's going to be a hyperplasia you're actually going to be forming new muscle cells and That's a whole new whole new deal. Yeah, like that's that's not just putting a new post office in a muscle Fiverl like adding in a new nucleus. That's like building a whole new subdivision Yeah, which is how you're going to have its own post offices So that's a whole other thing. So training training frequently might not effectively bring that about I don't know You know I don't know what you know the muscle cells super muscle super resilient too like we don't We don't we don't get the same Rack rapidity of growth with weight training that you do in some of these other bottles. Yeah, it pales in comparison I'm paired with what you see with the with the Overload stretch over load and the compensatory over load and the and the cat even well Yeah, the cat training was about normal breaks of growth But some of those models where we see the satellite cell growth or sort of the hyperplasia those happened really really rapidly Yeah, oh I don't know I wouldn't worry about it I tell you what if you get to where you're bench pressing four hundred five pounds and you're pulling six six hundred off the floor You know if you're using those exercises get to where you're just beastly strong or you can just do crazy shit with Hyerps yeah, you're going to be a pretty damn big dude, you know, and who cares how many fibers there are or how big they are at that point Right? Yeah, I wish I could answer that question. That would mean like that idea of like like Periodizing or training yeah to affect different forms of muscle will would be great and the circle plasma hyperch fie thing too is It's just being like perpetuated now is something that happens. I have like I've got a book here. It's across the way it's a it's a German It's in German. I just got it in the mail order from Germany to have hypertrophy training Got it just because being interested in the read I'm gonna learn something for sure And also I'm gonna be able to learn some German with habular while I'm at it It's a good thing to read some scientific stuff in German But they mentioned the sarco-plasia hypertrophy and it's in that study The Cody Hans study where it had the best evidence that we have so far that can happen They they took the subjects from a study where the average muscle growth was nil About half the the subjects were distributed to the where they actually lost muscle size and the other half gain muscle size So they took the they took the subjects the samples from the subjects who gain muscle size and then looked at what happened there And that's where they found evidence of sarco-plasia hypertrophy But that doesn't like like that was a that was a cherry pick sample It makes sense if you want to find evidence of sarco-plasia hypertrophy you have to have hypertrophy first and foremost sure But to say that that that stimulus the way they trained would produce unequivocally Cycoplasic herpherrophy is not would not be a true statement because that stimulus did not produce hypertrophy on the average for some people It didn't some people it didn't so for those who grow from extremists they were some sarco-plasia hypertrophy But that doesn't mean it happens universally just like we don't know to what extent hyperplasia happens universally You know, yeah, so it's really it's and some people just don't grow There's other options for improving muscle performance like the enzymes we talked about Gludge flow Shifting the mice in forms you've got a more efficient or economical contractions There's muscle has had so many levers that can pull to produce better performance and make you a better or stronger lift during the gym neurologically et cetera et cetera That you got to be really really crafty paying attention to how you choose your stimulus because You can actually make plenty of progress in the gym and not grow at all. Yeah, just because that stimulus for you is not a hypertrophic one You see this all the time with guys have been training to get really really strong and then they have to go do high reps stuff to make progress We're trained more frequently to make progress or the other way around like you they had a you got to get you must have to get stronger to make progress But I do think like I said before if you go from average strength to like you're the strongest guy and pretty much every lift that you do in your gym It's gonna show you may not be the biggest dude Clex wheeler was in the biggest the strongest guy in the gym and he was said one of the best physiques ever To you know show up on this on stage But there's something to say for that relationship. I would think I think so too. Yeah, it's a good response I like I knew you'd have something good for that one. Yeah, yeah, we had a couple more I know we were we had the video we were gonna do but we kind of were running lower on time What do you say we save that and then give us something to do next time Because because we did have an interesting topic here from Niven in Canada he says Actually he had a couple of them Hold on just a second We find the other one he posted This one here we go any tips on calming the central nervous system down after training But then he also asks is there any reason why you wouldn't want to calm down immediately after training? Hmm Um Why you wouldn't The independence on what you have to do If you train in the morning you have to go to work and be on your on your toes and be You know cognitively aware of what's going on then you wouldn't want to calm down But I'll tell you what's got this one kind of maybe struck something with me because I feel like I feel like after I had gotten sick which was now 18 months ago That really put me into like a real keyed up state where like my sympathetic nervous system was just like easily triggered and I found that my Ability to handle like intense weight in the gym to handle like the pain of Training drastically changed overnight like my pain tolerance went down not only physically But like mentally and and I feel like a lot of that was because I was already so Like high-strung my sympathetic nervous system was just like you know on the edge and for me to kind of get back into a place Where I can train successfully I've had to be able to kind of like down regulate that So this question kind of jumped out at me because I do feel like it's really important that we are able to Down regulate that like I'm thinking to myself even if I were to go to work after that I would want to be able to calm down maybe not calm down to the point where I'm gonna go to sleep You know what I mean, but like calm down to the point where like I'm not on edging anymore I think to myself like if you're doing progressive overload and You're at that point where you're about to do something you've never done before It's one of the greatest feelings in the world. You know what I mean? You know exactly what I mean, but it's not a place where you can live your entire life. You know what I'm saying You can't stay there. You know Yeah, I mean I talked about it before the some of the best body bills in the world are kind of renowned for having pretty chill personalities Jake Cutler's really chill guy Dexter Jackson, you know Ronnie Coleman, yeah Sean Road and with super chill. Yeah, you know So there is there is sort of a chronic stress load or chronic activity that impacts your pain tolerance Everything becomes harder if you're a stress otherwise is is elevated Like this is a big thing with like special forces guys and You know swat guys and people who are in military Military and that they they may have extreme Circumstances where they need to be totally on and up and ready to go But then they need to be able to regulate themselves back down and you know freaked out unnecessarily about things Because that will impact your performance that your cortisol levels are high unnecessarily, et cetera, et cetera adrenaline so I like yeah, yeah, so We want to know what his circumstances are like one thing that could be a comment issue is You know, you train it after work and you're using a pre-workout STEM, you know, and like okay, so you just took 400 milligrams of caffeine at five o'clock you go to bed at eight. I wonder why you know, that's that's gonna be an issue and then In meditation or finding a way to become aware or use your own heart rate and Pay attention to biophobic back to your body's giving you you can you can literally Bring yourself down from a highly excited excited state very very quickly once you become good at doing so So Brett there's tons of breath work techniques can be applied. That's what I use even Yeah, you've had to you have because I mean the thing that's interesting about your situation I get it we talked about this is that That sort of hyperreactivity that you were living in was was was I think at least partly secondary to the fact that everything was so much more difficult Because as you're breathing difficulties and the effects of Having COVID on your body along COVID on your body means that like just walking around was like a huge Yeah, it's urgent level so high so just breathing just breathing was difficult and I think that the What you're talking about too like meditation the breathing is such a to me that would be a number one thing is and you know What I use is box breathing which is just a simple inhale for four seconds hold for four seconds Exhale for four seconds hold for four seconds. Yeah, and you can find cool little memes It or not memes but like little You know animated pictures online to look at and I keep one of those on my phone and Special forces you mentioned they do use that stuff because they can't have an adrenaline dump when they're about to like bust into a room and you know Take everybody out or whatever You know, so they have to be able to stay calm and it literally will it's kind of like a hard reboot to your system And Victoria suggests is using that first thing in the morning and then to basically like set your day and then to use it whenever Needed and I've done it like in the middle of work. I just like hey pull down a second I need to stop and do this and like after two rounds which is literally under a minute I'm in a different place and it like you can feel yourself deregulate like down regulated Apple watch reminders you can get that all I'll do that. Yeah, yeah Mine gives me a little reminder in German to take a little time, you know and have do some breath work and I think the first thing We always want to think of and it kind of like referencing earlier to like you know wanting to look we want drugs You know we want it like what do I take to do this? Yeah, it truly is like in the walkers. Yeah, we can we can do this ourselves. We really can Absolutely there in there. Yogi's that can almost get their heart to stop Yeah, you know Just by just by learning how to control their auto auto non nervous system I have a ton of respect for that I don't have the patience or the interest to to do that you know I mean, but the box breathing is like I don't have to learn anything I just follow the thing. I just do that. You know I follow a plan and simple simple is that 16 seconds later I've gotten through one round and it's made a difference like oh, okay Literally is like a hard reboot to the computer There was just I mean, I like this is direct evidence that just stopping and Bring yourself from any outside responsibilities can massively impact Your mental mental state was when I was in graduate school graduate students are the guinea pigs for Studies when they're doing like pilot work. Yeah, and One of our buddies was me and Chris Gregory is actually his name. We were doing this for another graduate student who wanted to measure Cardiovascular drift and e-pock and some of the things use of endurance athlete. So we we had to do a ton of these Like like 10 or 12 minutes. Maybe it was like 10 to 12 minutes maximum exertion cycle About cycling about it's on a cycler gommeter So we figured our VHU max and he test that several times and then he put the workload so that it was hard and like you couldn't go past 12 minutes You just couldn't maintain the workload like you could just barely get the 10 so it's like it was like I wouldn't say it's same, but you know how Tom Plats would do like he'd throw a tune a quarter on the squat bar So the lower goes and he'd squat for 10 minutes with kitchen timer. Yeah, it's kind of like that Like you get a heavy workload and like oh fuck here we go and it was just like you're just going as hard You can until you slowly like eight minutes you're just grinding to a stop These were just absolutely brutal Mean like a 30 second win gate those are hard because living you got this is like it's like really really hard at the beginning Like eight out of ten and then it's just like gradually creates up to ten until eventually like that's it you're gone So we had to do multiple trials with that we had to do one where we had Electroads all over our legs to measure activity and he had a He we had an rectal thermometer in and the softest you'll thermometer in so God both ends measuring body temperature Meduring gases at the same time multiple trials because he wanted to gather all this information with the same same Workload the same trial and one of the trials he wanted to measure muscle activation. Okay. MRI So we went over and we did this maybe twice I can't remember At least twice maybe several times because he just had he was just using us in the guinea pigs He'd measuring changing some things like hey, you guys do it again So we go over and we get on the on the bike This is at the MRI like it's a sept because of giant magnets. So you sometimes they have those separate from everything else because the magnet will fuck up all sorts of things You can't wear any metal if you got a pacemaker it's a no-go These are powerful magnets so we get on the bike cycle cycle cycle cycle cycle cycle cycle cycle cycle cycle Like literally heart rate is max. It's the heart rate of 200 when I get done and then you're done Okay, get the tube boom you get in there too many lie there I'm just trying to just breathe easily It's like Oh shit, okay Like max effort I would be asleep in 10 minutes No kidding no kidding absolutely it have to wake me up every single time it's because there's nothing to do you just lie there Relax so you know how people like they do it all out like a crazy squad I never do this in the gym because I don't want to fall into that place of relaxation Yeah, if I have anything else to do and I just don't want to do it like Sometimes you get a panic effect that you finish a hard set and I stay in that aggressive like I'm not done yet Yeah, if I ever get that like that's a little chip for people who have that issue Sometimes people do when you really exert yourselves yourself but some people just laid on the ground And just like you know and they just roll in all over the place Yeah, you can really very rapidly get into a relaxed place and I wasn't trying to like you know Okay, you know, get in the lotus position of relying it lying a little tube, you know, yeah, and the MRI thing It's like it's making its noise the magnet was going back and forth Like there's no music there was no breath intentional breath work. It was just all you got to do now is lying the tube and don't move He's lie there and just just try to let your breath just do what it naturally will Don't try to hold it. We try to control it. You're saying you're saying finding a way to basically you're saying take away Take away any like need basically be in the present not worrying about Give yourself some type of moment whether it be lying in a tube or something else where you know Cardios kind of been that way for me in that I've I've told myself like okay You know, I can't go do I can't be on the computer doing this. I can't be doing that I'm gonna spend this time on the treadmill that is a very downregard even though I'm doing cardio slow steady state. It is a downregulating thing for me because yeah, I am not worried about doing something else, you know Yeah, this is just You can get in sort of a bit of a flow state probably not technically, but like there's something about you know Rhythmicity This is why rhythmic dance can be cool or running like people who like to run and they just like they get into a flow state and it just It in some sort of entrainment That's what the breathing does do that can function. Yeah, what I was talking about like the sort of more of a sensory deprivation like you do on a flow tank Yeah, yeah, but you're in I because I wanted to wrap it back around to you were initially saying Doing something where you don't have like responsibilities that need to get done right now You're is what you're saying some some sort of way that's what like I said what cardio becomes for me You're in that tube. Yeah, you're you're deprived of the entire world around you You can yeah See that there's so there's a complicating factor here with with at least with training if the cardio is not not hard It's not a problem But like one thing someone's when I train legs you can get this massive epoch And so XS post exercise oxygen consumption and Some of that is related to the sympathetic activation that you get somebody should be trained so are my my heart I wasn't I didn't feel stressed I come back home But I lie there at my heart. It would just be flying and this is what not with the caffeine and take or whatever It just because I'd stressed myself so much. Yeah, there's the sympathetic nervous system just has as a residual Elevation and some of that is just because the epinephrine has a residual effect so that will last for a while But but there was certainly an epinephrine release when I was doing those we were doing a cycling Doing a cycling bounce I bet it was yeah and like people who take maps I've had you know the cage like when I ran my gym For instance I would go because I mean if one I'm in the gym then people are always coming at asking me for stuff Either I've got clients or I've got people who work at the gym and I would just go out into my car Turn on the air conditioner because my hair is on it and just lean back Put a towel or something on my eyes and just like take a 20 minute like a little cat nap and it was like I totally started a whole new day Yeah, like that just Totally checking out I got nothing to do I got no phone. It's gonna be fat me. No watch. It's gonna be fat me There's nothing happening and just free yourself so if that no imagine like you get done it's like okay It's 550 I got to be in my car by six on six clocks. I can be home at 630 because my wife's got dinner Weighty for me or whatever right I got all night work to do or whatever I got you know kids have a football game or whatever my peak That doesn't give you that come down time great and so you know Creating those patterns and those habits and this is why like some of the best like the guys who do extreme things It's like the military guys we've mentioned before They've got an a tremendous it's just they have control over over their mental state Probably naturally they do that and it's probably they've been able to build upon that through training it working on it and That's just can be just as much a part of being able to effectively integrate Go and after it in the gym into your daily schedule As being able to going after it in the in the gym let's like you go in there and you're like you're transformed into this Whatever it needs to be you're letting your rage in you're having like this completely Path Arctic experience in the gym where you're almost shading yourself and you know Telling those please what have you and then you want to be able to turn that completely off because you recover Requires that you're able to come down Yeah, so that's another skill set that could be equally as important as opposed to like you said like Imagine if you're just like that all the time you couldn't be like right If you're terrible to be around and you would never recover You'd be constantly constantly stressed when people get like constantly stressed throughout their lives You see this I've seen the so many times like Their body comps is just go to shit like absolutely Whose muscle and gain fat the same times like how does this happening? I wasn't even possible thermodynamically, but it happens so yeah I wish we knew more about his situation to know You know what what's run if you was head what he's doing Because you just have to take it on a taste-by-case basis I think yeah Yeah, and I think that everybody listening can find something to apply from this You know what I mean like I don't care what your situation is that we can all We can all do a better job at finding that that mindfulness for a moment to be able to to unplug and be able to reset and we you know We owe it to ourselves too. I think be present. I I like to spread this little little trick I might have mentioned here before I mentioned it somebody just the other day and Actually something we mentioned John Meadows and early on in the podcast You go a recording when I was talking about John It's my rule of five. It's not my rule. It's the rule. I call it the rule of five And the number is sort of the material Okay, but it's a way to be mindful and evaluate what other wise be a stressful situation and There's no right or wrong way to do this. You'll figure it out sort of depending on what's going on That might potentially be stressing you so let's say you've had it could be an incident where someone like sort of actual on the road Or you've got a business deal that's not going the right way and there's nothing you can do it just kind of that It's gonna go south So you think to yourself and Five is just an easy kind of an humble to remember. I got this I stole this from someone I don't know where I got it from which I did Well this matter what's going on now? That's upsetting we'll this matter in five seconds in five hours Five days and five weeks five months five years and it's like okay This will matter in five years I probably should be a should probably pay attention like someone's someone's choking and they might end up dying And they won't be in my life. I need to be it. It's time to be able to take action Focus yeah if it's like if it's like if it won't matter in five minutes like someone's Reject you on the road.
