That's why this I love this video for back training. It's just you know watch the back moves. See if I break their stand. Yep. That's just elbow drive to the floor. That's what everyone's talking about now elbow drive to the floor. Bring in the handle down in front of you instead of like down to you. And then we'll learn the sooner. Hey everybody. Welcome to it's just body building reacts. Today we are watching one of the greatest Golden era 90s videos. It's about of the Olympia 99 and it's the Flex Wheeler Chris Cornier segment. This is like this is I remember seeing this everyone just being like oh my god. So this is some of the best footage of these guys at their best. Just wait till the t-shirts come off. But yeah, here we are. Gold's Venice. It's Flex Chris Charles Glass and I think Rico's in there too. Okay. Doing some chins at some point or doing some rows of them. I can't remember if he shows up but anyways. Straight to chins once again it's on. So yeah, there's Chris Malone. What's on the jersey there? It's yours. That's marketing real quick. Oh he's got his own shirt on. Real deal. Who has a picture of their face on a shirt? That's weird. Oh, why not? Maybe Rico's not in this one. I was just used to recouping in other videos. Maybe Rico's not there. Oh he's definitely there. They just didn't film. There's got never no problem. Impossible. So Flex looks like he's on no food. He's like this one. That's when drives me crazy about Flex. When you just look at the joint size. Yeah. The joint size. So you can blow out of his mind. Also just had a meeting with an office supply company. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. When you got an office supply company meeting and then an arm workout. He used one of my favorites by the way. Just abs. Oh yeah. Ben and as thickness. So reach extension over the bench. He doesn't have much for weight there. 13 days out. Yeah. Yeah. This is this is how gold was when I first started going that I almost all the way. Yeah. It was just like that. It was literally the greatest thing ever. I like the pants made of plastic. That's good. Remember those? I'd pair two of those. T-bars used in the 25s for better range. This is where things get wacky because it takes a shape. You can really see how nasty the detail is on these. 13 days out. Arms just busting that shirt until they come out. Getting the wraps. Lot of volume. I know. I don't even hold any down to the bench. Yeah. That was just he's getting his money worth. You know. Show wise. So look at the shit show starts here. Yeah. This is crazy. The triceps on him. Just nuts. Yeah. His shape is just freaking just nutty. There's no words for it. You don't even. Yeah. The aerial shot at the back here is just. So when you guys are training back next, everyone listening when you're in your next workout, think about this mess. You know, you're moving your back and try to like think about using it. You know, opening it, closing it like that. Hmm. I finally mentioned that you have some doing different movements for this. Yeah. Make sure one nerve like. If it makes me be like, Chris is lower back, father and number, something like you never know, right? There's for the most part that this is the one that I remember. There were crosshairs. The veins. I always loved his vein. That goes across the lower trap. What part of my back does this work? What? What area am I back in my working? I'm trying to hit this little part right here in the corner there. Is that working? Is that working? Yes. The whole goddamn thing is working. Bring it back. Look at that. Your whole back man. Quit worrying so much. I need this and I need this. I missed my that square inch below my shoulder blade. No, you didn't. Sorry, guys. Am I wrong? A little bit of a soft subject here for a run recently, but it's fine. I don't disagree with him. I love just the, I mean, both of these guys, what I love is they're depleted as hell and look like this. So there's a point in that gold chain that permeates wearing. And it's kind of going parallel to the floor across this chest. You notice that? Yes. Just being a bridge. Yeah. A bridge. Yes. What is? And next time you do your pull down, everybody, that's why this, I love this video for back training. It's just, you know, watch the back moves. I'll break their stand. Yep. That's just elbow drive to the floor. That's what everyone's talking about now. I'll go drive to the floor, bring in the handle down in front of you instead of like down to you. And I'm just going to learn the sooner. I can feel it right now. Just watching him. I always had to like the elbows out. You know what I mean? Elbows are coming. Yeah. You know, it like all the, Yeah. And my armpits are sore at the end of that workout. I don't know why. Yeah. We get the meat underneath the arm on that when he pulls it down. Yeah. And everything's just, see that. And he's not, he's not cutting his range short. He's not worried about losing tension or anything. He's reaching for the roof. Yeah. No full stretch, full activate everything. You know, that's the one that I don't, I don't do that when it does now. Is that like, the stretch has, they've decided it's no longer necessary. I'm like, I just reach as high as I possibly can. Yeah. It's tight. Yeah. I like to feel it ripping. You know. I think what's wild is, is in this particular video, you can see how bonkers flexes. Yeah. Chris, come here. It's like, what if the greatest ever. Yeah. And flexes like, yeah, just to warfing him in this. And again, obviously, it's 13 days out. They're probably in different points of their, of their crap and what they're supposed to look like. But, you know, there was just a gap at least in this moment for sure. And it's like, you know, it's a great thing. They all train together, too, because like, what a great way to make sure you're best out of each other. Yeah. You're leading up, competing against your competition every day. You know, with them and against them, you know, here, you're doing that. And then we'll just have to be each other. Imagine the one of the show, being backstage with him going on stage with all that. Get that whole experience together would be really cool. Again, in the middle of his back, see how it's stretching across the ground. Yeah. Well, because there's such a deep cavern and the skin just won't go in that far. It just pulls out. Like, Christian. Yeah. You know, my Christian at that point, you know, ten years removed from the Olympia. And he's still in their training, you know. Big, too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. God, all the detail. It's tension, tension, tension, tension, tension, tension. You know what I mean? Driving those elbows down. I just find these pump workouts are the worst at the very end, because you're just, it's exhausting for me to do ten easy reps like that. Yeah. Yeah. It's like literally all they have left in the tank. And I know exactly how they feel. Like, we looked at that last rep and we thought, oh, it looks like you could have done more. But he's probably like at that point barely feeling it. He feels like he's yanking on it. Yeah. You know what I mean? Every single certain shutdown. Rains only half working at the moment. That's just, that was, yeah. Well, part of his back is he working. Yeah. Yeah. This is the Smith beds. I love the top of these on every rep. Cross-shakes. Yes. You're probably just going to say. Looks like he's driving the bar back against his hips at the top, you know? Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? To create like even more tension, like, little intent there to pull back, you know? Bang. It's a great video. Yeah. I've only seen it with 726 times. Yeah. See the entire back all the way down the spine from the neck to the lower directors is folding over with those rows, you know? Like the, the whole back. Come on, come on. Four plates on the Smith. Oh, barbarian brothers are the back. Yeah. Yeah. Still there. Still around. The feathered hair. Oh, yeah. All the pieces are coming together. We've watched enough of these videos now. Yeah. Yeah. Flex going bizarre, bizarre. You know? I was surprised I never noticed he was over under on that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know nothing happened, but it still makes me worry about it. Yeah. Look at the quality on those wraps, right? So yeah. I just hope people could watch this and just, you know, take a little bit. And everyone's really into their back training right now, but just seeing the muscle moving like that, seeing the whole lat and everything that he's doing. Yeah. Yeah. Just keep in mind this is 13 days out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You guys are always talking about high intensity training. They're just stopping. Right. That's where they are at this point in their prep. That's not what we'll put all that muscle on there. Well, Flex talks here for a bit. All right. That's what he says. I can tell. Turkey. Turkey. 3 hours. Maybe 3 hours. We've been out for 15 hours here. That is gone. Craven. A sundown. Craven a sundown trophy. Oh, that's right. He's a little brain-duddery though. No carbs. Yep. 15 ounces of ground turkey. That was amazing, man. He said every meal, every meal was 15 ounces of ground turkey. That's what he just said. That's his diet right now. 15 ounces of ground turkey. You can't digest that much. You can't digest that much. Yeah. What's your next meal? 15 ounces of turkey. What about after that? 15 ounces of turkey. What do we see before bed? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. I always like that video a lot. I always show people that when if I felt like they needed like a little motivation to get peel or, you know, train back with better form or something. I've done that video in many clients over the years. I'm like, this is 13 days out. These guys are dead. But just look at their back moving and just think, you know, just add it. You know, yeah, put it in there. Drop, put that in the in the in the blender. Put this in the blender. Yeah. Right. You know, just. Yeah. So let us know what you thought of that video. And let us know if you found that motivating and you know, definitely drop. What are they dropping? Like shares. Subscribe, comment. And oh, they could also ring the bell. They could do that. I know. I think they did it. You can help this out. But yeah, let us know. Yeah. Yeah. Let us know what you think of that one. I we love these old videos and we lovely doing the react. So remember, it's just bodybuilding reacts. Yeah.
