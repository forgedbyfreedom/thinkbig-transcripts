But too, every once in a while I remember, I have had lunch with a murderer. Yeah, right? It was an amazing athlete, the nickname was Flying Ryan. Craig and Kelly had enough sense to plant the debit card by the lighter fluid, burn the drag war, and falsely accuse Melissa of stealing money from that. Is that Edgar Fletcher beside me? Sure is. It sure is. Again. Look at these guys. Pretty many Matt to fall there. The late Matt to fall. Yeah. He was a big dude. And that is a classic early 90s, 90s era outfit that Matt's wearing. And he said, he goes, oh, you know what? I don't take direct anymore. No, what you do. He's just, you get a bit of blow. And you just have a nice relaxing evening with your girl at home. Vegas 8. Those two up from the moment they got there. Hey, everybody. Welcome to It's Just Body Building. react. I'm your host, Big Ron Parlo. Of course, Dusty Hancha, the producers got me now. Remember to like, share, subscribe, comment, and bring the bow. Yes, I am you and dot com. Get your ice search, get your all in, get your mind FK. And everyone should get on the gear with Dusty and Big Ron are your codes. Avoid people. Stay home. Go anywhere, get it delivered to your doorstep. You're going to have to put clothes on. If you train at home in your garage, you're totally set that way. OK, so we've got to react today. And we are reacting to classic memorabilia, Craig Titus. Yes. Oh my goodness, sakes. We've got a bunch of stuff here too, Ron. So this is the documentary. So yeah. So Craig Titus was like, he was in the body building scene from like, you know, 93, 94. He showed up at USA's. Yeah. And he turned pro in 96. Yeah. At the USA's. And he was convicted of murder in 2003. Well, that is a full arc. Yeah. And we're going to watch it in reverse. This is the date. Clark County corner, Mike Murphy, had a mystery on his hands. A charred corpse discovered on Sandy Valley Road. So you have a body that is burned at the on recognition. You know, it's female, but you have no idea what this is. I've never watched this. Fingerprints were not cross the ability because of the burning of the body. You know, the facial recognition was not a possibility. He named the body, Sandy Valley Jane Doe. It would take weeks to make a positive identification. It was found that the face was covered with duct tape. So the next question is why would that occur? I can tell you that there was evidence that there was some type of an accelerant used. An accelerant, like lighter fluid, used to start and spread the fire. In our investigations, the sooner you can identify your victim, the sooner you can identify your systems. It was done on December 14, 2005 that lost a very calm aside detective. He doesn't have a solution. And he no Kelly came upon the smlovering car. The fist is as it was. The whole dash was burned away. The steering wheel was completely consumed. Fire investigators that came out to the scene told us that we're looking at a fire and access to 1200 degrees. I certainly believe that the objective is not to destroy the vehicle, but to destroy the body and the trunk. I'm glad we're pretty sure she was dead when that happened. That'd be a terrible way to go. Knowing that the plates checked back to Kelly Ryan, detectives headed to the hospital. And that's the detective Wilson got his first surprise. One of many to come. So I just went ahead and knocked on the door. She says, well, I'm Kelly Ryan. What a crazy story. The most famous fitness athletes in the world. She was an amazing athlete. The nickname was Klein Ryan. Megan Foley trained with Kelly and was her. She briefly at the top of her game. She didn't even show up. They're airing crazy. Different things in the air than nobody else. Back when fitness was like huge. Yeah. Kelly was born to be a star. She had second at the Olympia couple times. Finish. He's been itch. She was a little kid. Once in on the US. Yes, she does. She sounds like quiet. My legendary Olympics coach Bella Corolla. This is a great sport because it's a combination of everything. In a 90's sport, a little bit here. Just get to what the Craig made her a champion in her sport. Yeah. Let's get introduced. Kelly was already insecure about her looks. And it crags in systems had multiple plastic surgeries. Take a look at the dramatic change in her appearance over the years. You see this athlete that's so strong and so wonderful yet when it comes to her marriage, she was the weakest person on this planning. She would just roll over and allow him to do anything that he wanted. Including bringing Melissa a beautiful younger woman into their house. It's always the other woman's father. Yeah. In Melissa. Kelly was at her breaking point. Did Melissa ever say that she and Kelly would argue? Not really, but it was getting a little weird towards it. And then she was getting she wanted her. The parade is like an assistant, right? A frontal assistant. You could put it that way. Okay. Craig and Kelly accused her of stealing their car. Oh. The same one found burning in the desert. There's their elegant car. So you can still hear. Melissa stole that Jaguar right. And then jumped in the trunk. And that's not all. This is a little bit clear. This was Melissa's room. Except it didn't look like this. It was completely trash. The couple led detectives into Melissa's messy room to show them this debit card, which they claimed Melissa was using to steal from them. They said this is the card that Melissa had. They were really intense on me focusing in on this card. And lucky for us because that card later in our investigation became very significant. Well, as you leave the house after these interviews, what do you think? Now I'm thinking Melissa James is the one that's probably in the trunk of that car. And I'm thinking that one or both of them may have had something to do with Melissa's death. Yeah. We will long way from proving at at that point. After detectives, there's a lot. So did Craig and Kelly. The spans and the Taser goes. Yeah, I was going to say they found a Taser there. Turnied Paul police who went back to Craig and Kelly's house with a search warrant. Right on the edge here, there were some, some Taser down. So we had to do it. It's a Dio. Yes, you could see him. When a Taser is fired, it also shoots out dozens of tiny dots similar to confetti. They're identified by serial number when you look closely at them with a magnifying glass. The serial number of the cartridge that they were fired from. The dots matched the Taser. Gun Craig had given Megan. We believe the Melissa was shot with the Taser. And that's a five second ride of 50,000 volts. And that whoever was on the other end of the Taser kept pulling the trigger. And Megan, wasn't the only friend who was implicating Craig? What did Craig tell you? Well, he first walked in and he said that he had finally got to see somebody. What does somebody looks like when they get hit with the Taser gun? Huh. And he said you should have seen the scope flop. Jeff Schwimmer was one of Craig's closest friends. So he's just going around bragging. He thought it was fun. Jesus. With all that evidence, police put out a warrant for the arrest of Craig's an interview with him, then right. To have steered. Yeah. And she became in raid. She jumped him back again. I grabbed her on the neck. Strangled, choke, held, restrained. Can I'm screaming stop, calm down, stop, calm down. Just wanted to have this. That calm down, stop. Just pack your **** out of my house. That's it. It'll tell you, scream stop. And then it stops. That's it. It's the end of it. According to Craig, Melissa then ran into her bedroom and slammed the door. He then went upstairs with Kelly about 40 minutes past. It quieted down. We went downstairs and she was dead. And I tried to revive her. We seemed like a long time. And I couldn't. Craig claims that he and Melissa and Kelly had been getting high on cocaine, pain killers, and crystal meth for days leading up to the fight. I believe in it. Yeah, we're. Melissa took things too far. I heard nothing. You know what that is? Yeah, you know, these have been shooting those drugs for days. In fact, the autopsy report revealed their were enough drugs in Melissa's system to kill her, including a fatal level of morphine. But how did it get there? Well, there's Craig's story that she OD. And then there's what Megan Foley told police. He held her down and Kelly took a meal and shot a needful of morphine in the neurolog. Just tell me whether those allegations were true or it's ridiculous. Craig insists everything that happened after they found Melissa dead from the burning of her body. This was a complete shot for a bodybuilding girl. Oh, because they were scared. You said you were. Like you remember all this happening right? Yeah, Craig and Kelly had enough sense to plant the debit card by the lighter fluid, burn the drag war, and falsely accused Melissa of stealing money from that. That doesn't sound like two people that are panic sounds like you are meticulously thinking this through. Well, no, that's we were terrified and still doing drugs and continuously doing. And it was all bad. You've lied to cops. You've lied to Melissa's mother. Why should I think you're lying to me right now, Craig? I don't know why you shouldn't take a while in right now. Oh, I can do his tell you that's what happened. Well, there's really a two in his mouth. Let's kill him and make it happen. You will go through this. Sam is in. He's got a couple of ends before. In before his ends. Yeah, yeah, you had to go old school back then. I just tried to have a seat and man did Melissa's mom mora and best friend Samantha have traveled across the country to be in court. This is the first time. Cut down. I'm going to be in the room with these two people who took my friend's life. The only thing worse than losing a child. I would imagine is losing a child in this matter. If your dog, if your pet is both, they should die. You wouldn't give it a burial like this. So we know what happened. What they do? Oh, yeah, they both go to jail, right? Kelly both go to jail. Most unrecognizable from her cover girl days speaks for the first time to the court and mora. For the past two years and seven months. For her soul searching and many hours of reflection. I have questioned my own actions in my very soul. I am truly, truly, starving. That's what happens when you go for bad boys. Both in court and... You get Melissa's plan. We know where this goes. We are. I think we've both been through 55 years and prison for him. Is that what he ended up getting? Yeah, it's... Yep. Legally, Craig Titus admits to murder. But personally, he refuses to accept true responsibility for his actions. I'm assuming that I'm sick and have my actions after Melissa passed away. It was all... John and Duce, it was all. Ridiculous. I'm so sorry. This happened. I don't know what her mom is. Nothing he says could ever bring me peace. No kidding. Everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie. Could you please raise your right hand? So... It's one. Yeah. So, wow. That was a trip. Yeah. I remember people that were in the know, like in LA world. Right, right. Right, Zine's magazine world. Yeah. I guess as soon as they started dating, and they were together for years. Like when they started dating it, like went on for years. They got married and everything. I'd write it. Yeah. Anyways, when they started dating, I guess as soon as it happened, everyone was like, oh, no, it's terrible idea. Kelly's America sweetheart. I don't know what she's doing with that guy. Yeah. Right. I don't know what she's doing with that guy. It's terrible. And I guess it was like everyone in the magazine was right off the bathroom. Kelly's with Craig. She's getting it. Get her heart broken. He's such a dick. It's not a, you know what I mean? And it went all the way to that. You know, I just, I remembered this. I don't know where they're at. I have, they were given to me by Carl LaNore. The, they had the audio recordings of his prison phone calls while he was being held. Oh, and he had conversations with his lawyer, conversation with his friends. It was hours of this stuff. Right. And it was just Carl, they had it. Like a lot of this stuff isn't out. And like I think I might be the only person that has these now. But there's one point where he was talking about like quieting witnesses up. But he was like, I've got an idea for a screenplay dusty. And the main character is going to, you know, take a knife. And he's going to, you know, like, I can't remember what it was. But it was like, we weren't really talking about a screenplay. But it's like, you know, that there's a witness needs to be handled, you know, kind of thing. You know, it's, my story is called Handling that witness. Yeah. It's the name of it. It's called Handling that. Yeah. Yeah. It was a crazy time because I remember when it happened for those who have no idea how this is, there were so many things that just proved they were, I mean, beyond murder, they proved they were off their rocker. Like, they went into the store and paid for the lighter fluid and everything at Walmart the night for what happened on card. Yeah. They're on video cameras. Then you got to figure it about rope. Everyone understands it's even said in like rape allegations like yell fire and people come running yell something else. And they don't. So you got a lot of desert to get rid of a body and you up to go with a fire that can be seen from the street in a car. You, oh, I mean, just everything about it was three words dusty. Math. Yeah. More okay. Yeah. I mean, what a mess. And, you know, so the next. If they would have just left the body laying in the desert, probably would have never been found. Yeah. There'd be a better chance. Or at least a moment. It's wild. Did you get a hole? I don't know. There's a lot of desert out there. So yeah. Yeah. It's a better than it just holes in it. Yeah. A lot of holes in the desert and a lot of problems are very no. Yeah. But yeah, they were a mass Vegas eight. Those two up from the moment they got there. I got let's rewind the hands of times and see him prepping for the old. Yeah. All right. So people who don't know who it is can see the best version of Craig. All right. So I remember Craig. He, oh, I met Craig first time I went to Goldsmith. I see was one of my. My first run-ins. He hadn't won the US AZ. He had to get ready. He was six weeks out. It looked crazy. Oh, look at it. It's the same house. Yeah. The same house. And that's when Detective Wilson got his first surprise. Same house. Sorry. So you're in the run? He's actually not in the run. Yeah. So I knew Craig for like he used to. He used to come in guest pose where I lived for. He came several years in a row to guest pose. Okay. So I kind of like saw I'd see him again and be like, Oh, hey, Ron, you know? Yeah. Really funny. There he is. Better for the up here again. My head. This is. Well, this is 2002. So this is three, three years before. No more watching. And it was my wife and I moved to. But that's it. This is all right. So I remember he is doing a guest pose in one time. Yeah. And I said, hey, how is your protocol changed from when you, you know, where an amateur to it now is a pro. Yeah. Drawing out before a show. Yeah. Because he looked amazing at the USA. He's like when he got his protocol. He was like clear winner of the pro card. And he said he goes, oh, you know what? I don't take direct anymore. No, what you do is you just get a bit of blow. And and you just have a nice relaxing evening with your girl at home. You have your last meal and you get back from the competitor meeting. And you just, just do some blow and just chill out and relax and just get that Cortez on it and get to a Cortez own down. Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, get that real-time. What about sleeping? Is that part of it? Yeah. Like you don't need that. Yeah. I remember what it says you got. What a crazy guy. What a crazy guy. What a crazy guy. The Coke, it drives you out. Yeah. The Coke, drives you out. Wow. He's like, he's like, we might have been doing that backstage. So he didn't work for some year. That was years ago, but I do have the audio. He had his timing was bad though. That's what it's like. It was it's like the night before. Yeah. He drove to the watch. Yeah. Get just throw that blow-protein. Throw to call like a wall and hope that sticks. Yeah. I mean, he had a really great physique too, you know. Oh man. That time, it's the top 10 guy in a very tough era. Yeah. Trying to get everything time for Saturday. What's his hat say? Get hard. Get hard. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. That's a great hat. See. Think about Sherry to be the last year. Sherry. King come all in. King. Oh, Sherry. Remember that? You know, it's first name. Yeah. They went at it, didn't they? I was one of the greatest few. It really was. He's treated me. He met to fall there. The late, the late Mat to fall. Yeah. He was a big dude. And that is a classic early 90s, 90s era outfit. Mat's weird. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're talking about the last time I saw Mat to fall. Huh huh. Come on. Yeah. He was humongous. Right? His arms were like 23 easy. Maybe 24 like they were huge. Yeah. And he was sitting at the muscle tech booth signing autographs. And he had to sleeve the shirt on. And I think he had just loaded his arms. Like hard. Hardly stated. Because he had a little band aid on both triceps. Just left him. And then he had a little band aid on both biceps. He just left him on. And just went signed autographs. And he's just signing autographs. Talking to people taking photos with his big arm. Maybe he looks like multiple last iterations from the Razer. He had any grown hairs. Yeah. Yeah. All in specific spots. But his arms looked pretty good. Yeah. He didn't look. You know how to do it. And I was like, did you have to do that like an hour before the expo? Yeah. You know what? It's my second life here. It's a dream come to be on this place. First place. Just when I get up there and hear the broad screen. I'm already feeling it. So I think the top 10 is here, which I have every day. And he will. He killed it that year. Dusty. He killed it. I killed it later. I said he's doing it. Basically helped me. Take conditioning to another level to get. You know that draining of during you get. We could be to. His skin was so thin. Some were evil. So when he just wrapping that out. It worked. I mean, he showed me how to get conditioning. There's a first time he used going. So, you know, we didn't know how much food to feed me at the end according to his diary. But now I know once I get to the shape that Dorian had me in. I have to remember. That me as a bodybuilder. I have to eat. I don't I not remember him working with Dorian. No, I'm running after him. I had the exact right now too. To fill me out of here. So I'm going to do. I really want to show you guys when he turned. I'm going to say that. Yeah, let's see that. Yeah. The 96. This is incredible. You guys. Let me see if I can pull that. Needless to say, I was going to work. Oh, no. He's working with me. As far as my diet and a few other things. A few other things. Yes. And when I come into. Check this out. Craig Titus. Are you looking for when he turned pro? Yeah. Check this out. 97 USA. Yeah. That's what was not. This is in freaking credible guys. In a great. I remember him. It was so good. Yeah. And wait till you see because I rolled this forward. Wait till you see who he was up against. I couldn't believe this was amateur bodybuilding, honestly. Tom Prince. Is that Edgar Fletcher beside him? Sure is. It sure is. Again. Look at these guys. Tom Prince is not even. Yeah. Tom. Tom won the very next year. The time got his pro part the very next year. Edgar Fletcher. Look at that sight leg on Edgar Fletcher right now. Tom Prince blutes is just like all the way down to his. He played with his leg halfway to his knee on that right side. He made Fletcher both of my boots. Tom Prince's side tries nuts. Yeah. What was that side try here? Yeah. That's a weird. I want to roll this forward. Check this out. Any good. I want to roll this forward. Check this out. Any good. Yeah. Yeah. Gerard Dentie. Yeah. Gerard Dentie. Or Gerard Dentie. Gerard Dentie. Raise on Edgar Fletcher. Delton. That's Rott, Lonnie too. On the announcing. Oh yeah. Lonnie this swammy. Gerard's huge back then, eh? Yeah. He was a monster man. So I feel like we just kind of skimmed through all of this pretty much. You don't know how to do this. I remember in 96 when I met Titus he was getting ready for the Olympia or for the USA's. I mean to turn pro. And that was the time I met him and we did arms together. Yep. And then he's like, hey, if he goes want to go eat come back here at 7 p.m. I'll be done treadmill, go on to the firehouse. So we went back like 630 and he was still on the treadmill. Yeah. And he just covered in veins just walking. He's like, I got two hours over two hours. And he was just two hours and we finished at 7. And we went down to the firehouse and the ordered egg whites. And then he had that dude with them that helped him that alley guy. Yep. Yeah. And then I went at one point and he looks at my plate. And he looks at Adali Gagos. Can I have a French fry? Yeah. And Adali looks at my plate and he looks at me and he goes, if he'll let you can have one. And then he goes, could I have one of your fries and I go, sure. So he took a fry and ate it. And I was like, looking at Adali because they didn't get it. It was like, who? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Adali. Yeah. Because I backed that in and I'm like, you're just, you're telling them what to do. I don't know. Yeah. And then later on, you're as later we found out that was like, who's coaching him? Yeah. But yeah. And then he was a life coach more than anything because the body was under control. Yeah. Yeah. That's a shame man. He was a great bodybuilder. That, and I honestly was almost more impressed by the amateur competition there than seeing him at the old level. Like just because I had incredible that was for amateur bodybuilding. Yeah. Yeah. Different type of stuff. Yeah. Crazy. I forgot all about that occasionally. And I remember the whole thing. Like, oh, wow. Yeah. Weird. I forgot stuff that was on the message boards. And you know, you guys know how bodybuilders like drama imagine the stories that were floating around. Like today, goob would be all over that. Every day you get a new report on what was going on. Everyone's in a while. I remember I have had lunch with a murderer. Yeah. Right. And like it's weird. Yeah. Not everyone. None of everyone's done that. Can you, let's see. Raise your hand if you haven't had lunch with a murderer. See? Everyone the room's going to look at me. I did raise my hand either. Right. Okay. That's a whole other story though. Was a weird one. Yeah. I don't think any time it's you say another time. Not weird. Is it there any time I can ask you about that story? Because now I'm curious. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I can tell you about it.
