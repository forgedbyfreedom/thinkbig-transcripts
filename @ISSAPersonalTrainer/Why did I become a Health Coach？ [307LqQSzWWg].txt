Okay, well, why do I want to be on my health coach health? This has always been so very important to me. I ended up gaining a lot of weight up to over 220 pounds. I was close to 40% body fat, type 2 diabetes. So I had to fight my way back from that. But I got to be more healthy on my 50th birthday than I was on my 30th birthday. So I decided to do this so that I could reach out and help a lot of people to accomplish the same thing I did or even to accomplish something greater than I did. Almost every client I deal with, I add ways to help them with their stress. When people especially use food as an addiction I guess to get away from their stress. And helping people overcome these darn behaviors and develop new behaviors is something I love doing because sometimes my clients will come up with things I never could have thought of. And I can apply those in my life because it's all about the clients. Really it is.
