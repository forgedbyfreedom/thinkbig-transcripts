My career is, I am an employee while being coordinator for a public school system in the state of Kansas. We have about 37,300 staff members. And this is a benefit that has provided to our staff to help encourage them to live healthier, happier lives. And as a health coach, I can work with them, helping promote their happiness, the resiliency, save money, budgets, and just help them live longer, more productive happier lives. And I became a coach to basically make myself a little more marketable to help meet the needs of the staff. And then also, this is something that's becoming quite popular as a benefit that companies offer to their staff. Even doctors offices now do have health coaches that work as a liaison between the patient and the doctor. So I do not regret for a minute obtaining the certification. In fact, I'm just so grateful that I've done it because it really has helped me do my job much more efficiently and effectively.
