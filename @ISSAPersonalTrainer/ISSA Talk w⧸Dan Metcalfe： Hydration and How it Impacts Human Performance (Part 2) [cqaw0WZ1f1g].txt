Welcome back to everyone for another ISSA talk. I am Jenny Leibel. So excited to have you guys back with me. Super excited to have our guest back with us. It's second time coming on to talk with me. We had such a great time our first time Mr. Day and Metca that I asked you to come back and you have another great topic for us today. Welcome back, Dan. Thanks so much to be back and to see you again. Thank you. Awesome to have you with us. So guys I was telling you before we have done I got a lot of our last talk. It changed the way that I think about some things and hopefully it changed the way you think about some things that you don't know what I'm talking about. Go back and watch the last episode. Let's get in that gap. Today we're going to be talking about hydration. But before we dive in, Dan, I want you to tell our viewers a little bit about yourselves just in case they don't know quite who you are. Thank you very much. I'll keep this short because I don't want to bore anybody. But I've been fortunate enough to live a very diverse life. I went from professional soccer clubs done in the eight years with the raw marine soccer military training that I became a professional dancer or a suddenly ballet jazz tap and I could sing and dance and that play in the lead in Andrew Lloyd Webber shows which is the Broadway but on West End and then touring the world. Then I became a head coach on the Olympic development program. I then opened my own gyms that were fantastically successful based on movement for professional athletes. But I call everyone a professional athlete. We invest in ourselves. It doesn't matter what each you are, you're a professional athlete. And then I ended up having a brain injury. Part of my brain that had to learn to talk again, function properly and so I started studying the brain for self health. Launched a product called 60 up which is in credit was all about so people might get confused and I say I want to brain the train. People don't know don't you know you're in the brain. I'm like no no no we brain the train your power force is your brain. So we brain the training will get more success could the body will follow the brain and that's a quick wrap up of who I am and what I do. That's amazing. Yeah so check out as we talk a lot about balance and proprioception and such in our last episode really cool information you guys. But you can see like I love your background because the talk it like it shows us everything that you just learned. These kinds of musical characters go show piece of sacrifice. You've got it all there guys. So I love the path that you took to get to where you are. It's very windy but it got you all the knowledge along the way which is amazing. Now let's talk a little bit about hydration. Let's literally dive right in see what I did there. No and we know that water of course makes the world go around. The earth is over 70% water humans adults anyway are somewhere around 70% water but what do you want us to know about human hydration there? Okay so hydration is critical. I say it's the second most important part about lives with oxygen being the most important. After oxygen then you have to have water because the body won't function if you don't have the hydration. Now a lot of you amazing trainers out there were told and said well I already know this we've heard about it water water water water the problem is we presume act client or even ourselves think about it and know it but we actually don't enforce it because it doesn't have that feel good or advancement feeling within I've brought back in England where it rained all the time I was you know and happily over there so I never really hydrated properly because you're always in rain and you know over he'd not realize and you're actually dehydrating and when I became a head coach on the Olympic program we did a bunch of studies and read a bunch of studies that 3% of dehydration can lead to a 20% lack of performance. Now I'm going to take this even further I'll bring the jump in and stop me ask questions any point. If 80% of performance is mental and the brain needs to be hydrated to function at its highest level. Why are we not spending more time on focusing on making sure hydration is present because it goes a little bit more than this and I'm going to dive in a little bit deeper about okay absolutely. Okay so we know with dehydration the brain tissues will begin to shrink the brain will actually try and grab moisture from other parts of the body which means other parts of the body begin to you know be less effective because the brain has to stay functioning yeah everything else apart from the heart can die off but if the brain dies off everything's gone so now when we start looking at the hydration the brain we've got to have the oxygen flowing around through the brain carry in the red blood cells be not a function through here and keep the neurological process is going through our spinal cord but let's take one step your heart is critical to carry oxygen to the brain now that dehydrated what happens is the blood pickens it begins to congeal now the heart has to work harder to push thicker blood that won't flow as quickly around the body and so now you got a higher heart rate going on you're going to start increasing your blood pressure now you're not feeding at the cellular level everything from the brain down through your body and so everything begins to slow down and yet we push and we push and we push and so what we're actually doing is denigrate in the opportunity that our body can excel by not hydrating so think of it this way make sure the hydrations in place the heart will then feed the cellular level with oxygen and perform better as well the brain then is in a position to then function properly in giving information what am I doing reacting making sure we stand fully cognitive and then the rest of the body with all the different organs are then able to continue to flow so I can't go on enough about how dehydration is probably the biggest effect that we have on performance and yet we probably put it everything we talk about a maybe bottom of the list of actually doing absolutely so one point I want to drive home Dan we're talking about on a daily basis right not over a time a lot of things we talk about fitness are over time right the way we adapt the different stresses that we put our body under but hydration is like in every 24 hour thing we need to be paying attention to this right all the time because think about it when you've got your client in the gym and they're working you're also having you know dehydration yourself as a trainer just breathing we're losing right as the hydration we have from breathing then you're in a gym that may be a little warm plus you're standing you're walking around and about 20% of our oxygen is used in our brain and introduce drave and there's always thinking and helping our client we're actually working more than we think as we tend to go oh well I'm not working my body I'm relaxing no when your brain works your whole body is engaged in burning energy which as a result takes out water levels absolutely now you're using I want to define some terms for everyone too so we're talking about dehydration and you mentioned instead of 3% right and performance decrements genos speaking we define the dehydration as 2 to 3% of your total body water loss is that the way you would define it as well yeah absolutely I mean it's really hard because we don't have parameters to actually span there and measure what dehydration without drilling you right but we know that if somebody begins to get thirsty and then I eat your drink you're already into that 3%ile by hoping more because sometimes we train ourselves not to feel it but what I tend to do when I'm training clients is I will force them to drink right but and this is one of the crazy things you can't drink a lot in a short amount of time and rehydrate correct what happens you start flooding the body with water it doesn't get absorbed properly the water now because it can't get filtered properly through your intestines now it starts filling yourselves now your cells will also be into your brain which causes it to actually begin to swell in there and you can end up with hypernatrine here right which again is again they say it can be dangerous they can lead to death I mean that's extreme cases right where people blow too much so what I tend to do is just take a sip here's your water bottle and I'll do the same thing so I'll work with the person I'm drinking you drink and it's a little sip so you get absorbed go straight back in because by the time we realise they're dehydrated they didn't dehydrate at the 2030 minutes and the results won't be the same absolutely yes I definitely agree with that now would you say that under hydration is very very common we always like to say that at least 80% of adults in this world are walking around under hydrated so anywhere from one to 2% below their ideal total body water or you hydration would you agree with that? I would put it actually more than one or two percent okay and the reason being we did studies that you look at people that are 50 and older right so many of your trainers will be out there training older people they can't show up for your session if they're already dehydrated you can't get the maximum results and look at the trainer we love to terminate see the results we want other people in the gym to go I want to train with that trainer because look at the results they get yeah and it's a feel good as well as obviously turning down and having your client bolstering about you and loving it more than 50% of people over 50 are in a constant state of dehydration you can't function but what happens is our body was soaked brilliant with the brain and body that we learn to function dehydrate and and feel that it's normal we begin to shut down the fork capacity we can have so I see people walking around the gym very few with the big jugs of water we've all seen that they're down that whole jug and they're working out which can be great as long as they're not chucking too much like seeing most people like that don't chuck too much because they're staying hydrate you don't feel that you need to suddenly take a bunch I think it's great but as far as the dehydration levels I would say 90% of people that I see in the gym really have water and it's only really of it's between sets and they want to just have a break their water walk over the water bouncing and take a quick mouthful and then back again to better than nothing yeah I urge trainers to encourage the lifestyle change of always having water yeah I think even further I say okay if you have an eight ounce glass of water and they say drink it every hour people go and drink the eight ounces and then they'll stop and they'll go that doesn't maybe feel that I feel a little bloated I can't stand doing this instead of having a ounce glass of or water bottle maybe 12 ounces and stick it through the hour and this goes through your workouts as well this at the end of the hour see how much you drink if you didn't do it all that's okay fill it back up again and see how much you drink sip it over the act as when you break it up you'll be amazed you'll go through those eight ounces without any problems whatsoever it's just sitting there when you fill it up at the end you now have this lifestyle change that keeps you hydrated for every aspect in your life and as a trainer what's better than not just when they're there general the health and fitness but where their business begins to thrive there relationships into the relationships happen that be hydration because we know with hydration you don't have the mood swings but you don't have the mood swings because now you're dehydrated now you live a happy alive what's better than you get to all of that because of one thing agreed agreed now so it to help somebody understand how to potentially change their clients the behaviors because a lot of people they are like oh I'll just go tell them to do this right drink your water throughout the hour or whatever give them a strategy but for a lot of people I think we need to understand the why behind how they got there in the first place to better understand how to coach them to get them to make small changes right so we can't make a blanket statement about why but can you tell us about some of the reasons why somebody might be dehydrated in this wonderful modern society that we have yeah absolutely was first full stress is something that creates a negative energy within us that drains our body of energy and we also know we stress sometimes your body temperature can rise a little bit because now you feed it you're stuck in an and you feel that energy going through your body and we don't realize we're dehydrating that same time we've got heat right they say the amount of dehydration that goes on during the summer whether you're outside or even in a gym just trying to save its money by keeping it maybe a little warmer than it would in the winter because of the cost of conditioning that can go on as well it can also be the food that you eat so if you're not eating foods that are rich in liquid fluid so you've got your water melon and you've got your greens and the way that you're cooking the food and it's in microwave so you're draining all of the nutrients out and the fluid out so it's not even fluid what's the right word let's say chickens to dry you've taken even those type of things can cause a dehydration to happen because let's just say you eat some really dry chicken now it goes into stomach it's working harder to break it down it doesn't flow and then whatever liquid or fluid was in there now it's being taken into the chicken to then force it to be able to be consumed and broken down your uses the so many ways that it can affect you and not just the clothes you wear yeah absolutely and what about like the beverages that people choose right a lot of people don't drink straight water guilty I mean I have my cup right here but I will tell you it is sometimes crystal light in here but we know for about when I was getting coach on the nip program we stopped using gay to rate yeah that gay using gay to rate pre-game right there's a lot of sugar in it but also there's a ton of sodium so what we found was that the body was actually and looks fully amiss important in the right levels we'll talk about electrolytes and the different types of drinks that are specific for weather conditions if it's really hot you are going to have to rehydrate more often looking triathlons on my Americans and even in stock games now they have water breaks because of the negative effect but certainly the drinks you have too much water in too short of time would to clean your electrolytes and not be good for your rehydration that's where you can then end up like I say with the hype and the trivia but you then have a low with your sodium and obviously the solvent the blood as well so I think this even coffee right when you start looking at what's in coffee and the effect that it has people think because I'm drinking I'm hydrating yeah yeah so I actually heard as this is like we did some research on this a couple months back because we are a student in our boot camp as how much coffee they had somebody who drank like 30 cups of coffee every day which a why are you drinking 30 cups of coffee like what's going on in this person's life that they need that but this person drinks at ton of coffee and they're like are they dehydrating themselves right and then I so I did some research on it again I want to get your opinion on this because there's probably people out there with questions on it so I've heard that caffeine of course can dehydrate you right it can pull water out of yourself and generally speaking the most issues come from if you're taking like a supplement of caffeine like a pill form where there's no water involved right you're just taking a tablet of caffeine and depending on how much you take into depending on the person or all you need it can have dehydrating effects but if you're drinking coffee yes there's a little water in there you're still getting the caffeine but generally speaking I saw something that you need something like 40 cups of coffee or if you do 40 times about 200 milligrams of caffeine do the math right that's a lot of caffeine in the liquid form to cause issues what are your thoughts on that like there's a lot of information like that out there sure so again I would go back to your first point why he drinking 40 cups of coffee yeah because we know caffeine is not a tissue stimulant helps with you stay in a wake with helping you be a la theoretically but also can create a crash we get the body shakes then you can't sleep properly at night as well so I agree with you 100% Jay that if you're drinking that much and there's that much water that's been put in there then yes you are hydrating over the day and again I haven't done studies on this so I'd say that much caffeine how much can actually be absorbed by the body or taking in by the body that has a negative effect and at some point the body stops absorb and it says it happens but I would certainly turn around and say on the hydration that if you're drinking 40 cups of coffee that's like drinking 40 cups of water with a stimulant in there so it's pretty heavy but you're still getting 40 cups of water and there is studies that show the water or hot water does get absorbed into the body faster because the weight of the open of the pillories and everything gets absorbed in but I would be more concerned with what's that caffeine doing to my body how a reliant is it what else is it shutting down in my body that says oh great I'm being kept awake artificially and so why should I stop you know taking away all the inside the body because why should I continue to work to keep myself cognizant like there's other ways to go so apparently I'm not anti coffee there's a lot of coffee drink is out there I personally don't drink it myself no better or worse I it's just my personal choice I'd like to feel what's happening my body and I'm tired I need to wake up I've got to change my mindset and say I need a little bit more sleep so the main body continues to function as it's made and not relying on an outside source absolutely I agree with you Dan and that might be our next topic for our next one let's talk about mindset activity because I do not like people ask all the time about pre-workouts and stuff like my husband has a bunch over there but I don't take them because I listen to my body yeah and if I show up at the gym or I'm about to go and I'm tired fatigue don't feel like I'm going to get a great workout maybe I need to address those things first right how did I sleep when I hydrated did I eat maybe I should worry about that first versus forcing myself to take a stimulant and go knock it out when I was working on what would be considered the best shape my life's like very muscular and you know 50 modeling and all the other stuff without trying to sound like oh so I used to take all the immune I asked it drinks beforehand sugar leaving I've gone out and pump it out I felt great until it started right in my teeth right there's always a side effect to everything you take so I found now you know for me big potatoes plain baked potatoes probably 40 minutes before I worked out because of the slowly you have it got well great I had the best workout situation but I put a little bit of soul on them as well and then have the water obviously take down it woke me up and it didn't have that rice and the crash and then I wasn't relying on other things plus psychologically I would do with mindset or me meet again but sometimes you have that placebo effect but I'm working out great because I'm taking this then you become addicted to it I think when I was a soccer player was going to a game one day and the guy sitting next to me on the buses or the coaches they were driving us there gave me a sandwich and I had that sandwich and it was ham and mustard I never the and mustard I didn't like mustard but I ate it all the way to the game you know an hour and a half away from the kickstart again I played the best game ever that day I mean I was phenomenal talk about MVP and all the other stuff that you call it. Go after that I ate ham sandwiches with mustard every game before I played it I never played this well again but I thought if I have that because I associated rather than the fact that I was great that day I was on I was ready everything seems to go my way I was super sharp and I think that's where we got to go with the mindset is what's making you great as you rather than what am I taking that I believe is giving me the edge of the realities you're the biggest factor in what you're successes. I love that we will absolutely explore that and that actually kind of brings me to my next question Dan we get a lot of people asking about should I be taking electrolytes and things like that you mentioned Gatorade and that's something that usually has electrolytes carbohydrates sugar salts etc in it a lot of calories associated with that for a lot of people but some people I always tell people for the average person it's not something they need to be concerned about but if you sweat a lot or you're in a certain environment or you haven't issue with salt then maybe at something you should consider what would you stay for that? Yeah I was the agree I mean when I was a Iron Man I was racing the Iron Man I took a lot of supplements you know because obviously your body's being drained through the race I'd be out there training five six hours a day early in the morning and depending on the weather conditions would depend on what I had to take so if I'm out trading up in the mountains in a hundred degree whether it's very different than if I'm out of forty degrees wrapped up warm and again depends on the time of day but I would say for the average person I would look more at what are you eating because I think that would give you the right foods that will help support your system naturally and I look back to be you know our ancestors a thousand years ago they went out they're taking electrolytes they also have a beer food and this brings me on to something I just came back to an incredible convention as last weekend I'm hearing people this supplement take this how about their studies and things and I realized it's not a diet that's the difference it's the quality about food that's the difference and so you can address your food at the regular level the regular person's not out they're doing extreme sports or maybe they're going to the gym for an hour and a half having a good workout not sweating too much but making sure that they are really hydrating and eating well I agree with you Jen and you'll be fine if you're extreme or you find you're a very heavy sweater and some people are I've never seen them but I see the sweat marks left on the benches of the children but I would say certainly you know you can go and get tested you can find out how much you drop in how much weight are you losing from hydration and what would then the recommended dose be to put electrolytes back in but I would certainly go more natural electrolytes added to water than I would go and get in the electrolyte drain bits based on sugar and so you yourself got it that makes sense yeah so basically the average person doesn't need to worry about it but if you're concerned about it I agree with you go through the steps and get tested right because if we are not getting tested and for hydration and things like that a lot of times it's a blood test or your intestine or something else for the testing your health, molality and all these other things if you're not doing those actual assessments you are straight guessing and when we guess we get guests the results okay exactly and the other thing is as well and the news goes back to mind set right and understand the average people feel your body to get used to when your body is great take the time to feel what feels great so you become more aware of what happens when you begin to feel a little off you can start instead of rushing to the dogs you okay what was I doing what am I feeling and it's that fine line google search don't google search because google search you get the worst possible result there's good enough can't fair I know it's like I lost my legs three times so far but they're still both here and so I look at it and say the more you can feel your body your recognized situations early enough that you can make adaptations or you're I'm not quite sure than you change something a little bit I feel good again the more you know about you and trust you being the body is exponential what you can achieve the end of my love to you this is why we get along so well because I am of the same exact mindset I was still be well within if something you don't feel right generally speaking you can think back within the last 24 hours what did I do that impacted the way that I feel right you yeah tension and maybe even you log whatever it is that you need to do to really pay attention to your body we can figure it out really this is going back in the adgeny it's what I was talking about with tradeism selves you want to impact your clients you want to live the lifestyle you want to impact with yourself within enthusiasm yeah right so for example hydration if you're drinking while your clients work now it's happening you do it and you have that positive energy about it they will adapt to it you become your environment and then you can tell and keep track this week of how many times or how many bottles a day and how many six did you take it sound kind of crazy but it's a lifestyle change but betterment that costs nothing it's absolutely you know water pretty much with fortunate this country water is pretty much free and then you go to look at the water you are drinking I'm going to bunch of studies I'm a big believer in hydrogen water because the way that it breaks down the surface water itself doesn't go into your cells it brings the water down so then you have your muscles are going into the cell and rehydrate and you can actually wash over your cells and the wrong water and then also the contaminants but if someone says to me hey Daniel in the desert you're stuck it's been 14 hours you're out here you completely dehydrated here's the bottle of arrowhead water I'm taking it no matter what if you're not water right water so it's something better than nothing but I think looking into the quality of water you drink in this world has it direct effect on the absorption into the body of the moments absolutely well that actually brings up one more question I have for you because again I'm thinking of what our students are going to be asking but the different types of water let's explore that just briefly because there's like the pH water and there's the water with the salt Senate there's these but to me it's the pH water that is I see everywhere and I used to subscribe to it too I was an essential drinker to my core and I realized that a when you actually test that water a lot of times it does not line up with what's on the bottle so it's like how do you know unless you have pH strips which most people don't to our body has a really handy way of regulating its own pH now doesn't it it doesn't necessarily need our assistance and those things are also very cost prohibitive because to your point water is generally speaking darn close to if not free why are we spending all this money on these bottles which are also going to clog up the world right and unless we're reusing them right but why are we spending all this money buying cases and cases of water when we don't necessarily need to what are your thoughts on that what should be the what should these guys take away well it's a little tough because if I look at them that you can and what happened out there with the water and the contract yeah I know that's meant to be an extreme case but I do think there's more of that out there that we're aware of so it might be worth like you said getting out and getting some testing strips just for your own whole water because every then I do I keep a bottle and I breathe fit I'm not a big fan of plastic bottles so I try and get the ones that are a little bit thicker than thin bottles only because my thought process is they're going to be a little bit more structurally sound than the real person need personally but I take everything out of my refrigerator it's wired up and then it has the filter in there and I just use that and I don't see any difference. pH water the more study I've gone into it and then looking at specifically hydrangea water the pH is a marketing gimmick in my opinion they make you my favorite was pH 9.5 yeah for some reason I thought psychologically that's better for me and then I'll see the pH 7.0 or you start and I'm like oh god this not as good for me I'm looking for the 9 I don't even know what this one is like to outline more or I don't even know this one is on the pH but once I've looked at the picture water of breaking it down realising and I'll put this into a slightly different way in golf if you remember like I don't know if you do you put it off I do actually very good I'm not playing you because you'll beat me I'm not when I mind losing you right so remember they started having these club heads and there's the sweet spot well now let's make the club head bigger and this is the three of them now make the club head and he got to the point but the club head was so big but then reality was the sweet spot was always the sweet spot didn't matter how big the head was it's still that sweet spot so they got to this massive point but they don't hang on weed maxed out what we could do how are we going to remark it again so now this again world the club head is so big now that it's stopping the swings beat because the wind resistance is you bring it down so you need a smaller club head so they maxed out what they could do and then they started making them smaller and because they got to get sales so my personal belief is a lot of this stuff with pH's marketing hype to get people to then say I've got to buy that bottle of water because otherwise how they get a 9.5 pH or how would I get the level that your told you should have I think 7 being the minimum right it's because they stayed that sort of like you said you tested I did feed you water and it was it was it was it was it wasn't what they said it was when I tested it yeah and I had a different effect when I drank it it took me a while to assimilate to that third of different pH and I suddenly didn't feel hydrated anymore when I was taking it but once you took it for a while then your body is you said began to assimilate it were at that made sense so have you ever heard a product called a sea now I thought I could product some here yeah okay cool so there's the sea of water out there which I just started experimenting with I'm just dying and when I first tasted it it was really salty and they say when you taste the salt it means that this parts of your body that aren't functioning properly from hydration and once you take it and you stop tasting the salt then your body is in alignment and my girlfriend is now stopped tasting the salt she started that often she'd been doing it I think but it's something I'm interested in explore I can't see here is that oh if the greatest thing because I don't know enough about never promote something that hasn't worked beyond what I would expect for me yeah but I am looking at different areas and a sea of these ASEA has a great reputation with doctors and especially brain especially if you know a brain is my passion and my folk yeah in my brain and for those you know I said at the beginning where part of my brain died in a bike accident they didn't say that I didn't know yeah yeah and stuff and so I really looked at brain here because they take care of my brain the rest of the body we go so I really look at what's good for the water to then carry the nutrients around my body the red blood cells to lubricate basically the heart and then what's the effect on the brain so it's something that's worth at least exploring but I would say the takeaway okay I can give three takeaways nice take care of your plan make water part of their training not an upside or a secondary part have that make sure they're hydraven they first walk in the first they're going to do is have a sip of water before we start the first exercise even if they've been hydrated they say I've been in green there's have a sip and then see if you can get through one water bottle during your workout maybe two depending on the size of the bottle is the first takeaway second stake curious right do the research when we know how important water is to our full function every now and once a month if you're the latest research on water one we learning and be careful there is a company yeah there's a sales employee it was scientific testing it doesn't mean to say it's proven or right yeah but it's good to have that outset and the third thing that I would give us is takeaway is do it for yourself because if you can function better then I'm a huge believer that your prosperity will get better because you'll become a shining light of an example because you'll function you have this new aura because you're ready to go always I love it this has been so fun Dan like really good insights I love this and the biggest takeaway from what you were just actually just talking about for me is some of the stuff is subjective right there's certain certain people are like oh I can't drink tap water or have to drink this water that water if you have a preference stick with your the end of the day you're drinking water right if you're like me it sounds like like you I could drink water out of a hose and be like I'm fine we're going that way grow up right it was like you're running to go and now we're told if you do that you will die yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right no I'm fine like we I was saying that the other day we always need dirt when we were a little and we're just fine and like you said the body loads to adapt and adjust we won't be careful with the contaminants we put in but again on a huge believer if we don't focus on fear and negativity we would always find the solution and get the freedom for the body to recover I love it and that's a perfect teaser to end on Dan because next time I have you back let's talk more about mind sets is the brain is your special team we talked about it a lot with balance of proprioception in our first episode we talked about hydrating our brain and performance today but I'd love to talk to you more about mindset and general performance next time we have you on are you down for that I'd love to and you is a professional athlete to arriving you know you will bring a lot to that discussion as well obviously but let me ask you one question about questions before we go how old are you I'm amazing hello you're back the most the best episode you'll understand exactly yeah and guys that question and that answer is what I was talking about earlier it absolutely changed my outlook since the last time I talked to Dan like completely changed my outlook and the way that my physical body performs at at my age right I'm not it's not for at my age I'm awesome period period and that's that's our makeup moment with that we can end this thank you guys so much for watching today this is been amazing go back rewatch re-listen I'll post some resources for you guys um Dan will share his Instagram for 60 up for himself is linked in all the places that you can find him and his products but thank you so much again Dan for being here with us. That's you old thanks so much thanks Jen awesome we'll see you next time
