Hey guys, it's Jenny. I just wanted to share some strategies with you guys on how you can help your clients overcome their emotional and mental blocks that they might be having, preventing them from reaching their fitness goals. So first and foremost, we are not psychologists. So just remember that. I know we all like to say that we're a little psychologist, this trainer is, but we're really not. But we can listen to our clients. When we see people struggling you guys, we can absolutely take some time, whether you sit down or whether you do it during a training session and talk to them. Let them talk. Let them tell you what's going on and just listen. Remind them that it's okay to feel the way that they're feeling. It's okay to struggle a little bit. No one's perfect and no one gets it right all the time. So I definitely recommend listening and then seeing what you can do to help this person. Sometimes that might be, you know what? Let's scratch this training session inside today. Let's go outside. Let's go for a walk. Let's go play some tennis, right? Help them enjoy what they're doing and leave it'll take their mind off of some of the other things going on in their life. And always remember, when in doubt, refer out. If your client needs a little additional help, it's okay to refer them to another professional that could help them a little further.
