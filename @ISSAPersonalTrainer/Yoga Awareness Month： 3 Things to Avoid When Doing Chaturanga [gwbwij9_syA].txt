Here's the top three things to avoid when doing your chatter on gut. Number one, avoid using only your arms. Engage your chest and your back muscles so that you can spread the workload out more evenly across your entire body. To do it, when your hands are placed down, squeeze your palms in towards each other to engage your chest and draw your shoulders down towards your tailbone to engage your back muscles. When the hands squeeze in, you'll feel the chest flex, then bend your elbows and feel the shoulders strong back. Number two, avoid compressing your spine. The spine is either going to fall like a hammock as you do your chatter running up or you pull it top like a tight rope. To do the latter, pull your hands backwards your toes and your shoulders towards your tailbone as you lower halfway down. As the hands pull back, it's as if I'm trying to reach top of the head forward and I kick your ballmounds into the ground so the leg stays nice and engaged. And number three of the things to avoid even doing a shot around your head. Rather than looking around the room to decide how low to go, rather than thinking of halfway down or all the way down, trust of what you're feeling in your body. A good rule of thumb is when you're doing any transition, go only as far as you can come out of it with control and with fluidity. So for some of us, we might lower halfway down or less than that. So if here I lower and I start to drop and then I have to push up and be going to up top, it's too far. Instead, focus on the mechanics and the technique. Bring your knees down, lower halfway down or all the way. No matter where you go, make sure you can push up and rise back up.
