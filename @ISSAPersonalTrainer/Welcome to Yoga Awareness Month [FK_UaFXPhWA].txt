Hi, I'm Alex or Timbjack. One of the 200-hour yoga teacher training online leads. On behalf of ISSA Yoga and Wellness Academy, I'm excited to welcome you to our September online yoga challenge and celebration of National Yoga Month. All month long will be celebrating yoga with daily yoga instruction, inspiration, articles, and tips. Plus we're hosting a yoga post challenge and giving away lots of prizes all throughout the month courtesy of our partners at Alo moves. To follow along, all you have to do is download our online yoga challenge calendar and stay tuned to our Instagram channel for ongoing content. This is a great opportunity to learn more about yoga, to deepen your knowledge, and to set up a path to enhance your yoga practice, or even start your own yoga teacher training journey. I'm so excited to be hosting this online challenge and I can't wait to see how your practice progresses along the way.
