Becoming a personal trainer has been incredibly valuable not only to me, but also to the lives of others that I work with For me, it has really allowed me to help people which is something that I truly truly value I love being around people and engaging with people and also educating people That's a big part of my role as a personal trainer and what I do here with ISSA As far as others, there's a lot of people out there You guys who need help who need some structure who need some guidance Who need to bounce some questions off of someone who knows fitness and nutrition the way that we do as fitness professionals So to those people, we are lifesavers and it's a great way to build relationships with people as well
