at a low everyone and welcome back for another I. S. S. A. Talk. I promised you guys. I would have Robert Lee go back and he is back. I'm so excited to have you back with this Robert. Welcome. And thank you very much for having me happy to be here. Show me your voice today. We're going to know I'm so excited so we've talked a little bit with Robert about training the older adult which is when he he has basis career in his business around but today Robert before we died then though I want you to remind everybody who you are how you got in the training and what it is that you do. Absolutely so training the older adult.com that's our gym here my wife and Ikeegan started T.O.A. in 2016 was our first course that we offered and it's just kind of grown from there so half of our business we do training other trainers on how to work with older pops. We kept getting emails of how do we do it and what do we do and how do we not hurt them and we just kept answering that over and over again and we said hey why don't we when we make a course one of what guys I was actually mentoring was like you guys should make a course that same individual two years later said you guys should do an affiliate program I want to be T.O.A. in that's T.O.A. Portland Texas that's why he's on our shirt it was number one anyhow so that's half our business and the other half is in house training and online training for our clients which have about that's 60 clients that I work with and those clients on average it's been like 14 years each one of them I've had a long tenure group that had been with me a long time so we do that also on the board with the National Strengthing Aditioning Association the NSEA on the personal training representative there and been a regional coordinator a state director state provisional director chair for the personal training committee 15 plus years of volunteer work with them running conferences and events and stuff all over the world so spoken in Ireland, Iceland, Canada all over the US I speak virtually every day somebody in present and do podcasts like this all about education so super excited to be here and to share with all of you last time we got to talk a lot about different strategies and programming and we jumped all over it was really fun and kind of made a joke and passing and like I should show you some of the equipment sometime and you're like I'll take you up on that. Let's do it. You're right are. Yeah so I know I probably got social media and you do highlight a lot of the different equipment that you use you highlight a lot of your clients which is awesome so let's get to it rubber I want you to share with us some of your favorite equipment that you have in your studio and some different things that you can do with them. You bet so first of all there are there are some pieces that you're going to see and I'm going to be like they're expensive and then there's some ones that we were talking about a pulley system that costs like $45.50. So I'm going to show you stuff across the board. Some of them were expensive items we saved for months for the this guy for the K Boxer here that was like a year of me saving to get up to be able to you know purchase one of those so these are these are one toys some of them there're definitely some that are need toys but there's some that are one toys as well and the reason that we get them specifically is for either us an individual or a need that we are not able to achieve due to regular equipment that we have and the first one the big one I'll start with the tank right over my shoulder here the torque M1 tank this piece of equipment we I was working with some individuals that were using walkers and canes and I couldn't find a way to connect the dots on how can I do the string training work in this room that would make them better at creating a longer gate without actually being able to take a longer gate like we we kept getting stuck in a position where they couldn't quite take that step without support and I'm like if we had a way to do the walker but and not have them fall over but make it really hard where they had to be athletic and push it like that would be perfect and a couple of days later I was watching a video with Dustin Porea you have see fighter and Brian Shaw one of the world's strongman who both just happened to live in Colorado and Brian had a tank and he and Dustin were pushing it back and forth and I was like look at this thing that's really cool I wish they would make one for like regular people and so when I looked it up there was this guy which which is like the home use version of it so when you take a look at this as opposed to most sleds or or prowlers this will only go forward and back and it will only go with certain speed so right now it's on number three and if I try to like over push it it won't go any faster than what you just saw so I can either drag and barely move it or I can sprint as hard as I can like that but that was top speed but that was level three so if I go to a level two and there's tension on the way back if I go to a level two it'll go a little faster and then if I go to a level one or all the way down to neutral now neutral it just rolls it'll just go right and I can push and put as much weight on there as I want so what I love about this is with my clients and we may have them that walk you know the small Mr. Burns style of walking or type of walking where are we going to be able to take them in a regular weight room and work on like true hip extension not where just extended to neutral to standing but work through this like athletic turnover drive that I would see if someone were sprinting running uphill going up flights of stairs that's about it like that's the only time I would see somebody in this position of of that ability and it's like well I'm not going to do any of those with these folks so this became the missing piece I'm like we've got to get we've got to get one of these they were I think like eight or nine hundred dollars at the time this one's two years old they have a brand new one that now has a higher bar amounts that you can put dumbbells on each end it still has the toe strap connection at the front I believe there's another gear so there's four years now there's a box that tells you like electronically how far you've gone your tension your speed you can record it all in the handles these guys just pop up when you go to grab them the handles now I believe have a turn in lock so you can pick the sled up from the back end because right now like people try to turn it if it's not perfectly straight when you go to turn it the handles is pop off yeah so that's a little bit of annoying part of it is you have to kind of tilt it back and you do it but the the key component was having stability but athleticism in a controlled speed where it wouldn't run away from them and our older pot like they just as soon every time they're here they do this every single time no matter what and every time they seem to get a little bit better a little bit better because they're now able to practice these longer strides these longer gate variations but not feel like they're going to fall over and then I start with like a level one with hardly any weight on it it's you know 60 pounds of pressure and then I can make it a hundred pounds and I can make it 150 so when they get up to the point where it's 225 like it is now to be able to push this and then when they go to walk away they're like oh well I can take like these regular big striding steps because they've trained their body to be strong enough to do so which has been a big big part of our business now there are other ways to kind of simulate this you can kind of simulate that with with bands like NT loops work really well for that you could put an NT loop around somebody's waist and then have them push a prowler or any other sled a lawn buoy anything else and then you can kind of control the support with the band behind them so as they're pushing you're kind of walking holding the band almost to the point where it's like it's controlling their tempo and if they start to get out of control or over push it you can basically just pull them back up and stop them so that's one way to do it or we've seen people it'll take like a regular prowler or a lawn buoy and put bands around the bars and then hook them to a squat rack and then when you go to push it out the bands get tighter tighter tighter and then the bands pull it back right so you can basically go drive drive drive drive drive and then down climb as it goes back drive drive drive down climb as it goes back but it's going to increase in tension so it can't get away from the miter it doesn't get harder but it's still good tension so if you don't have you know seven eight hundred dollars doing best in one of these there's a way to do it if you have a current sled next I'll go to these ones so this is the power block adjustable kettlebell and what I love about it travel-wise it's great because you have three different kettlebells built into one four different kettlebells built into one so this is eight kilos as it is by itself here and then I've got three different weights in here I can adjust it to 10 kilos 12 kilos or 16 kilos so if I do 12 kilos and I take that out there's the extra well cool the original design of this was terrible I don't know who originally designed it but they sold it to a power block power block made it metal instead of plastic and they laser cut the inside and they magnetized the pin so when you go to push it in there it pulls it in and it locks it and it's a great design so if you don't want all these kettlebells behind you on a shelf if you're a one on one trainer or you just have a smaller space this is a great option right so this one goes eight ten twelve sixteen kilos and then big daddy over there goes sixteen twenty twenty four and twenty eight kilos so you have four built into that one as well it's steel and you can't drop it right and if we're gonna throw stuff that's where we go to this guy so this is the go rock sand kettlebell and what I like most about these is you can do this and it's not gonna damage it or hurt it so our clients can throw them they can pick them up and drop them we'll do a lot of like clean pull or high pulls and just let them get dynamic and explosive and drive it up flop it back on the ground but not really designed necessarily to be slammed so I wouldn't start you know yeah smash them on the ground but they're definitely durable enough for you to toss them throw them they use them at the crossfit games they've used them in strongman competitions where they're throwing you know up and over big cross height cross bars like pull bolt bars and such are clients really like them too because that's twenty six pounds twelve kilos and this is a regular twelve kilo twenty six pound kettlebell and you can see my height difference there of where I'm gonna pull from off the floor I'm about four five inches higher so if I'm you know seventy two year old bad back fake hips and getting all the way down here I have to round my back to get to it with these guys I can stay much higher and I can pick up and do my dead list from there so very fun for different pickups different variations with that one and then our pulley this guy here let me show you one that's unattached you know I'll show you these guys too I got all kinds of stuff in here so this is a angle's ninety pulley and I'll show you the angle ninety grips here in just a moment so most of these pullies have a metal piece right here and I wouldn't suggest putting a a 550 cordage of any kind of rope into a metal pulley because it's going to wear away and eventually splinter and it'll break while you're rowing on it well angle ninety made a plastic hard composite pulley on the inside so it won't rub the the material of the rope onto the metal the plastic actually means it really really well so this particular pulley same one that I have up there works really well for wherever you want to perform any pulls it's easy to click in I've got mine hooked in to just a regular little eye hook up here and then the angle ninety handles we'll talk about the ergonomics of those in a moment the 550 cordage I can cut and make basically adjust to whatever height works just right for me so right before we went on I was telling you I like to do kneeling pull downs I like to do these guys a lot and so the regular cable pulley is so long that the handles are right here so for me to do a pull down I have to back way up I have to lean all the way over so I just got my own cordage and connected it on there and I can cut it and make it and adjust it to whatever height that I want from there pretty well so those are rather inexpensive and then let me show you again not I don't I should have said this at the beginning I don't have any financial connections to any of these companies that's ever just like this stuff yeah of course you're you're gonna plug this one you get some money from them I don't I have a couple little discount codes that they give us because they like us and we share a lot so here's a regular handle okay and that's most of us see in the gems where we're at the same distance same width all the way through for clients with arthritis hanging on to something in many cases that is either too big or too small for their grip can really be problematic so I started looking for other grips I found these guys and if you notice the angle 90 handle it's batter in the middle and then it's tapered at the end and so when a client grabs onto that to row they basically have something that fills up their palm but their fingers can taper in smaller around their thumb their pinky and when they go to row this guy it's got a curve to it as well that's a lot more comfortable for the arthritis can this company design this initially Simon and the company their Italian the design this for athletic performance he wanted people to be able to do rotational pull-ups and do dead-lifts and all that and they were great for that but our clients have found the arthritic component of having such a comfortable curve for them to really be specifically more comfortable for them all of our clients we have again almost 60 and I would guess that 55 of them have their own pair of these at home I don't know just yeah they'll just hook them up like right to the bands you know they all have bands like this at home so they'll just get a carabiner and they click right into that and they can do their rows with a comfortable handle on rather than just grabbing the band or using any other kind of general one so we love those handles yeah angles are great um this guy is called an am core system I think they call it anchor when I talk to the CEO he just called an anchor but I call it an core because I want to make sure there's a difference where people I understand it's not an anchor system it's an an core system so it's a ncore and basically these are if for a lack of a better explanation like little many flywheels these two gentlemen both had elbow injuries and they were both I think like triple a baseball players and they met each other in a rehab center and they were using bands and doing all of this and they're like we need something that's heavier but as we move further away it'll actually progress in tension but it's heavier and more consistent than a band is and that they could you get scale in way and so they got with a buddy of theirs who's an engineer and they started building this and basically these guys they just twist and unlock and so you can go I want 10 pounds of pressure no no I want 20 pounds and want 30 pounds and they all just interlock in this little web and there's a big loaded spray on the inside so you can load up as many of these as you want up to like a hundred and 20 pounds but you can see like I could take all of them off one side and I can still row it doesn't matter where I have them set up I've got a tension of row and then this guy on belt rose here you can hear the belt row right I can undo that and adjust it to whatever height I'll put it on a bench and then you sit the stands with a belt so our clients will sit up against it we can hook it onto the tank put a block on it and anchor it and do rows from there pretty it's a pretty well design piece of equipment it's super super durable I've put thousands of reps through it and the tension has not changed which is usually the case with a lot of these once you get a couple hundred reps in there everything starts loosening up and so that is tight or it's didn't anymore so that's been a key component for us it's like if I'm going to invest in this which again this is kind of a higher price ticket item I want to say 450 is the smaller version all the way up to like eight or nine hundred depending on how many of these guys you get and they have like a whole unit that you can pull the pin and the whole thing will adjust and slide up and down rather than having to velcro and unvillacrow it you know that kind of thing so this guy pretty cool in terms of that like eccentric constant tension kind of pulling back I don't want to say flywheel because this is a flywheel but it's pretty close to a flywheel as best you can without it being a flywheel and that brings us to the flywheel so the this is the original design of the first flywheels for squatting I'm going to show you with just like a little bicep curl here but the the belt squat I believe was the first design of this this one is from a company called eccentric exx and they are out of Sweden and I'm a bit of a geek and a bit of a door when I come to this stuff where I'm I kind of obsess a little bit over where and how and what they do you have up here so everybody can see me a little bit better there you go so this whole little unit it weighs about 45 pounds and the idea of the flywheel is if I can create momentum that spins this wheel okay this is like a two kilos so four and a half pounds it's going to spin this four and a half pounds you know like four and a half pounds that's no big deal this will create hundreds of pounds of pressure as fast as I can spin it so think of like a kid back in the day they had those little wooden like tops and you go straight around it and you pull the string and flick it and it would spin spins bend right now imagine if that was secured in space and the string didn't come off so if you pull it and create a momentum and it kept spinning eventually it would top out and it would re-wheel it would like reel in the handle right so that's kind of the design of the flywheel is if I'm going to pull and create this momentum that momentum is going to go to the wheel and it's going to pull back and so if you're not ready it'll just rip out of your hands and it'll it'll take off so it's like a concentric pull with an eccentric deceleration so it's not isokanetic because there's movement and there's movement in both directions under tension so it's this dynamic concentric, eccentric, controlled, contraption and the really cool part is if you're going to do eccentric trained focus lifting typically you need a lot of load more like 110 or 120% of what you actually lift like on a bench press right if I can bench press 100 I'd put 120 on there and I would do the down really slow and then my buddy would help me lift it up and then I do the down really slow I can create that much tension with this and get way more work into it so I'm going to pull and create 60 pounds of pressure and because I created it ideally if I know how to do with it I can slow it down it can never be too heavy for me because I'm the one creating the momentum of it that's kind of the beauty of it or people like oh this might be too heavy and won't be because you're the one that's creating the momentum if you created it you can decelerate it and you can stop okay all right so enough talking all right so you adjust the the height of the strap there's a little press release button then I'm pressing here that releases the strap and then when you're ready to grow go you just give it a little pre-wined and as that comes down now I can start my curl and you see the wheel start to spin into a concentric eccentric a concentric and he's centric and so I have this constant tension of the wheel pulling me back down and needs a little oil a little squeaky right as we go and you see the momentum of it spin in this guy down here so I could go waist slower if I wanted to if I'm just like oh it's a little too much for me I could kind of slow down a little bit and just take my time and go all right I'm going to control this eccentric and there's only you know 15 20 pounds of pressure right there or I could really give it a heave and that thing's going to pull him really make work every time I get after it that's a little much change because you want yeah it's one of my favorite devices and I'll tell you it works exceptionally well like we'll do every Monday my big leg day so I did think a hundred and I did seven sets of 20 on this guy via Beltsquad this morning it was just smoked when we got done I was so toast because it's unforgiving and if you go like as aggressively as dynamically as you can the amount of momentum that you create on this is very very great you have to deselerate it and then change the direction is the part that's really hard it has changed the momentum to come and when you get the feel of it you get the rhythm you get the technique down and it's hard but it's exactly what we want so this particular device I was kind of shopping around because one of my other clients had a hip replacement recently we were having a hard time getting her hip to bite to engage and work through a full range of motion it would kind of shut off like halfway down she bit older she's in her in mid 80s and so I'm like I'm going to find something that will allow her to basically create and like accelerate as she comes up and then she's got to do something with that momentum and I came across this video guy with this and I was like okay that looks pretty cool I looked at the price and I was like oh no I get that thing that's way too expensive and then I started having the same issue with my hip and I went okay because I've had both my hips replaced and we talked about last time like all right so maybe it wouldn't just be for my client maybe would be for me too and since we've got it it's like 80% for me. I used a lot with the clients but I use it almost daily so yeah this guy this unit by itself it comes with two different plates that handle a belt a pair of ankle cuts, ankle cuffs, a handle this handle I showed you earlier and a replacement strap and a little ramp for the back foot so you can do kickstands and such and that was $2,000 that's the biggest ticket price item I've ever purchased. If you just get the platform in the wheel I think it's like 1200 but I got a bunch of toys to go with it so my point in showing you all that is some as little as you know $4 rope with a $45 pulley right all the way up to $2,000 flywheel there's all kinds of different options different ways and all of this is just I'm looking at people and I'm trying to solve a problem and I'm like why would a cable pulley? Why would why would this rope pulley be different than if I just got a cable stack in here? Well this guy number one is portable and I can move it wherever I want. I can adjust my loads so you can put a kettlebell and or there's a little net there's a little net basket that goes in there and you can put a bunch of weights in or take them out but I can also hook bands to that which I can't do all that well with a plate stack sometimes so now as I'm pulling it with 35 pounds on there but in additional 20 pound band it's going to go 35 45 55 65 pounds of pressure and then come back down or something like that right like you would be able to accommodate resistance onto that but with a stack machine and maybe more of an issue then not adjustable I could move it around and the gym I've got multiple eye hooks all over just works a little more efficiently for me in this space but I could go around the room and go through all that. You look at something that takes up a lot of space or has a big footprint probably the biggest one we have is the skeer most people can see it here at that concept to the one we're there. That's a concept to skeer right there right and for that it's like most of my clients have back in hip issues so a regular rower wasn't all that efficient and the standing skeer that cross-country motion works great it tracksions the back displaces the hips good upper body action and most of our clients can do more upper body cardio than lower cardio at at this older age so that was kind of a no-brainer for us but we use it so much it's there's such a commitment to the the action that it earned that you know three by four foot little space over there it's worth it for me to have it in there other things I can adjust and move around. Oh I forgot to show you the ramp. Yeah I don't know about the list. Yeah so this is I'm gonna trademark this I don't know what we're gonna call it there's a couple of two by four's underneath there and we thought about calling it the fit by four so maybe something like that. All right so we have a client who who doesn't Mr. Burns walk right can't take these big steps every time they try to step forward they get unlawful and we're working with the tank maybe we don't have a tank and it's like how could I get them to take this longer bigger step but not have a regular step if this is too difficult how can I make this easier okay just a regular two and a half or three foot step. Well if I brought the floor up to them not just higher but I put it back at a ramp we're actually pushes them back to where they came they could practice the depth of the step then I could add load to it and they could start to develop an overload working at an easier angle and push themselves back to when I take the load away and I put it to a harder angle could I overload and over-trained them to be able to do that and we have done that successfully like 10 different people so it works anecdotally very well I don't have any research to you know spout off about so well of clients it will start here and basically just take a step on the ramp and push off take a stamp on the ramp and push off and then they can start working a little higher and then they can start going a little deeper and that's pretty easy I would guess about 30 or 40% easier than doing one on the floor okay so we're gonna adjust that high easier by going up more fit by force or we make it a little harder by going down and then we'll start to give them weights to hold on to while they do this and it could be as simple as like a one foot step like they're literally only taking a 12 inch step but it's an easier step it's a vertical step not super high but it is a vertical step and so you know grandma grandpa great grandma great grandpa anyone who's starting to get to a point where we're looking at him going you're becoming a fall rest is standing there let alone trying to walk about we don't want you to be dependent on your walker or your cane that might be something that you use but you're not dependent on it and we'll have folks that will use their walker to get in here but once they're in here we're training they're walking around they're capable they just use the walker as like a safety device I want to get them to the point where they're like I don't need this thing I feel really confident what I'm doing so teaching them the split squat or step up or any of that we're so far away from that you know that steps 5 6 7 where steps 1 2 and 3 okay walking gate is tiny a lunge step to the floor is huge what what do I do in between that so we got going on this ramp here kind of by accident one I had that board out and we were using it a little I'll break the fourth wall here for you that means I'll give you an insight look this is a converted garage so in every garage there's a little runoff on the floor there's a little taper to the gym so if you look at the black baseball behind me you see how it's bigger over here oh yeah it's really small it's really small right there right so the whole room tapers that way and it goes downhill just a little bit but if I stand perfectly straight my left hip is off by like a quarter of an inch so I got that board and I put a quarter inch piece of rubber under one end so when we would do our Olympic lesser deadless we would pull off a level platform so we would just stand up that one day I had a client in here and it kept I kept getting stuff in the way so I just took that piece of wood and I laid it against the the rack back here and it was that a little bit of an angle and I had them start throwing a ball against it to do some reaction and as we were doing that I was watching them kind of walk around and I'm like I really need him to like if he could walk uphill that'd be a lot easier and I saw the ramp and I'm like let's let's just try it let me just try having him lunge against it and he did like a full need of the floor lunge it's like 80 year old guy and I'm like what happened right like this blew my mind in a moment like this guy he could barely even walk and then he did this and I'm like all right we're on to something so since then we've used all kinds of different stuff we got butcher blocks so it's a much thicker, more stable board it's a little prettier right and what we use and it's a great piece all of our T.O.A. affiliates they've all assembled in built ramps and they all have them in their jims and they help out quite a bit so there's a little behind the scenes look inside the gym other than that I've got dumbbells over here these are regular dumbbells down here these are two and a half all the way up to 15s and then these are fat bells center mass bells which means your hands in the center of the weight which is really really good for people that have wrist or hand issues, arthritic issues, and rapethes anything like that center mass bells or fat bells there are two companies sore necks and rogue they're the only two that make them and apparently I think is named Donnie Thompson and Bert Sorin were roommates or something and they thought of this thing together and they both have like napkins with drawings on it saying that they created it and so they're the only two that are allowed to create them so it's either center mass bell, sore necks or fat bell, rogue so these are fat bells I love Bert but I everything in here is rogue so I stuck with them and then we have regular kettlebells or on this side these are the torque little plow boxes I have 12 and 18s this is a 14 inch wall mounted monster light wall rack from rogue I love that rack we hardly use it at all to bench or bench press out of or backsplot out of it's a huge anchor system basically for us to hook everything up to I think that's about it I got a Swiss bar we used Swiss bar over here when we do bench press couple of mats on the wall different handles and adjustments a glute roller oh let me show you these two so these are very sophisticated very high tag walking sticks these guys were great so they are like $40 walking sticks right so these are fantastic for our clients too that if if I'm gonna try to do a split squad and I just grab on to a chair or bench or some fixed object my ability to try to independently support myself in space basically goes away because I was like I can't balance I can't balance completely balanced as soon as I put my hand on the wall completely balanced there's nothing for me to worry about anymore so what's in between hand on the wall and not hand on the wall we thought something that they could brace with but it was still independent to move over so it's even half an hour so we'll just use a regular hiking stick and let them kind of do some split swaths and help and then eventually we go hey why don't you just kind of hold it right and then eventually why don't you not have it touch the floor at all or if they're doing walking lunges they'll hang onto these and every step they take like if they go to lose balance they can correct with it but then kind of continue on and not use to the best of their abilities so fancy toys not so fancy toys they all work everything has a purpose everything in here serves a purpose nothing collects dust other than my barbells those are strictly for show we know a barbell work zero zero barbell work even with landmines we don't do we don't do those at all I think that's it yeah I love that a lot of the super billets and it runs the range of stars price but a lot of it's pretty darn simple pretty nice and I love that it's portable we get at all the time so we ask you on Facebook today they want to start like traveling to their clients they were like what kind of things should I have I listed off some of the stuff I have in my garage but I don't have like a pulley again easy as long as you have somewhere to anchor from right into the right size or right length according to go with it some of these bells that are super heavy are a great idea even the torque tank looks like it's something probably looks heavy but it's something that you could still pick up and take with you oh yeah we have our full sum affiliate he goes in travels to two different clients their homes and he brings his in his truck it's about 65 pounds assembled but you can pull a big abol thing and put it in there yeah it's not too bad at all I think for most most people are going to have some place outside their home where they can loop a strap from a high anchor if you can do that pull these are fantastic if you can't do that a door anchor with bands are even better bands got us through the pandemic bands can do some very good work but bands are also not allowing you to maximize tension throughout the full range of motion only at its deepest range so it's always going to get lighter or harder lighter harder where 20 pounds is 20 pounds so I think they both have their place but if you have the opportunity to be able to put up a pulley somewhere I think that'd be great a lot of our traveling trainers will use loop strap like a cm along right that will you can basically tether and you cinch it up and then there's a loop strap out of that and you can just hook up a carebiner and then you're good but it'll be a loop on like on their deck or their shingle hangoffs you know that the little main support beams that stick out you throw a cm along like you would use in your truck right to like cinch up stuff and or toe another vehicle those are those are called cm so you throw one of those on there cinch it up and you're good to go those are geared for 5,000 pounds whatever you could dangle from it you and your client could both swing and it would just fine right like that would be completely fine those things are very very safe they're tested it it's super high tension to say with the 540 it's not 550 pounds that's just the name of the tension and the and the 10 cities in there it's like 2500 pounds of pressure like those things aren't breaking less they're rubbing against something else very very durable good pieces of equipment I'm all for paying for quality I've got a shed outside full of junk equipment that I thought was going to be good and it wasn't and so I just don't talk about those I'm not a big fan of like smashing or punching down at something that's not good but I will definitely promote in high light stuff that is great and well that stuff that's great it's all in this room right now so yeah when someone like you you're like can you show us the toys I'm like hell yeah I can show you the bunch out there though that are not good so if you're not seen in the peer here either I don't know about it and I haven't got to try it out or it's not so good yeah and I would trust your experience like with that only your time trading people but with what you do with NSCA like you have some experience you you're not a product there's there's a device out there I won't say the name of it but I'll just kind of give you an idea of what it is okay which I thought was genius I was like all this would be great okay it's a bar and at each end it has an attachment point where you could hook dumbbells or kettlebells to it and I thought okay I could take a 16 kilo kettlebell and a 16 kilo kettlebell hooked this bar to it and I could do deadlifts right with my clients or something along those lines I could hook two 15 pound dumbbells and I could clean and press it or whatever I went by one to have like an adjustable barbell I would I would have one so I invested in this it was decent amount of money more than $100 and it was absolute junk plastic it was the most like if I asked a fifth grader to create something that's what I was like never seeing such a good idea performed and created so poorly because that could have that could have been a masterful piece of equipment for me to use in here how great would that have been you don't need a barbell I get his hook other weights to it and adjust my like that would have been great you know for those that have kettlebells and dumbbells and don't want to buy bars and plates and man I would have promoted the hell out of that thing but it was garbage so it's sitting out there yeah collecting dust and not being talked about and there's quite a few things like that that are out there the the one thing I haven't tried it may be somebody else has and they can comment on here I'm not a huge fan of elevating heels when you squat sure I know that's the baitable topic right now but there's a kit out there that has a 15 a 30 and a 45 degree angle wedge block series that it all like folds together into a box it looks really cool and I'm like oh it's portable it's mobile I'm thinking like this but smaller right I could put this against the wall and have a 30 degree ramp to step on because it's fairly you know they're fairly big like big enough to put a foot on yeah and I thought okay rear leg elevated kick stands rear leg elevated Bulgarian split squats etc I'm like I think that could be a pretty cool piece so that's one I'm gonna be investing in here shortly I think I'm gonna get a pair of those in here and see see where we go um I think else that I've been looking at recently D-blocks have you heard a D-blocks maybe D-blocks is either a 12 by 12 or 12 by 16 inch block that's two inches high and you can stack them on top of each other and make whatever height you want they were designed for Olympic lifters to be able to put a two inch bumper block under their bar and when they would do a clean pole instead of pulling it from you know nine inches off the floor it would be eleven inches off the floor so they could pull from different heights but they were super durable you could drop thousands of pounds on these things and they wouldn't break they're so good and they're so popular the U.S. Olympic training center got rid of all their squat racks and they just have thousands of D-blocks and everyone builds their own heights that they want so it's like if you're six put your six put and you want a 54 inch rack to squat out of they're like oh you need 23 blocks on each side and so you just stack them up and put a bar on there and it would be the height you want and you could do heave jerks from that or if you want a backsquat you would take it out from there and squat so these D-blocks have a last block you can put on this flat shelf and you could step up you could do sit-to-stands you could lay on a new bench press like it's a pretty durable adjustable piece of equipment but they're like $80 for a pair of them so it really expensive to buy 20 of you right so it's like you I buy play-o boxes and then buy D-box or do I use the D-blocks as my play-o box right like you want to buy stuff that's gonna have a footprint but have multiple uses like nothing in here has just a single use with exception of probably the skewer like that's all we do on a diskier. Everything else I could use it and move it, rearrange it, attach to it even the racks the racks here that hold the weights at the bottom of the racks right there is an anchor and right there is an anchor and I can hook bands to those and my clients can do high poles or rows or so we'll even use the racks as an anchor point to hook stuff too. It's the either mobile trainer philosophy or small gym trainer philosophy whatever you're buying and investing in investing good high quality stuff that has multiple purposes and can be stored vertically. Those are the three rules or strategies that would give you nobody likes stuff stacking up on the floor so get stuff you can stack yeah you can store vertically it always makes the room look bigger and cleaner and safer and you don't have a bunch of stuff on the ground people are gonna trip on. Yes so in clothing that was one thing I was gonna say to you I love that you have actual racks and those that look like pretty straight racks like you said the anchors on them so guys invest in the storage for empty equipment that you have not only is it gonna keep the equipment longer or you but like you set it keeps your space clean it keeps people safe keeps you looking getting injured, chipping over stuff right and climb over stuff I'm working on organizing my garage and working on it but yeah the racks are they can be expensive depending on what's what you get. Yeah absolutely and you start off with people see this and like Rob I can't afford all this stuff and I'm like I couldn't either when I started you started with that this rack with dumbbells on it and then I have these four kettlebells right here that's all I had that was it in this room and you can go back to the start of the pandemic like we had this wall we just put up and we didn't have the rack yet we just have those two sets of weights and that was it then we got the racks came in then I got the wall mounted rack a week or two later and then like a month later we bought a couple more kettlebells and two months later we bought the skier again and a couple months and so you just get the stuff that you need then you can start investing in the stuff that you want just make a list and Alan Cosgrove was my is is my business coach was my business coach especially when I first started out we did a ton of stuff with him like 2008 to 2012 I went to almost all of his business courses they're fantastic I didn't know what gross total income was I didn't know what a net total income was I didn't know what ROI meant I didn't there were so many things that I didn't know going to school to be a canese grad you didn't learn a lot about business so I'm like I need somebody to teach me this so going to him he taught me a lot there's a lot of business coaches I'm just saying he's a good one and one of the things he talked about a lot is with the equipment you could take one client and be like every time Jenny comes in when she pays me that money goes into the equipment jar right and then when Rob comes in that goes into my vacation jar and then when Alexa comes in that goes to my education jar and then all the rest is for running the gym paying me doing all the other stuff but those three jars get filled up and I literally had envelopes with all those things written on it and they were taped to the back of my front door so when people came in the door open they would never see I was worried I was college student and poor and not in a great neighborhood so I'm like where would they never look they won't look behind the door they just came in right so I taped them to the back of the door and every time that client would come in I just take that fifty dollars and slide it in there and slide it in there and I had the next piece of equipment yeah then I wanted and when I hit $200 I took the 200 bucks put in the bank bought that piece of equipment and I just every time whatever was next I put the number all this one's going to be 350 for this you know pulley system that I wanted and so I'd save up and then get 350 I'd scratch that off go to positive and make that purchase and I just did that over and over and over again still do it today I just I don't I don't use envelopes so use a safe yeah yeah so it's been good yes well thank you so much for sharing that's the great business because you're right you're always enjoying we will definitely have you back you know I think I'm gonna put out a little survey and ask everybody to put in the comments on this video what else you want to hear about from Robert too um because we'll definitely have a back he's a wealth of information for you guys I can talk we can go into programming we can talk business we can talk marketing we talk referrals we can talk injuries physical limitations we talk about future and goals and retired I I have no problem talking we can talk a lot of it well I think there next topic should be programming because that is something we got a lot of questions on that something that a lot of people it takes longer than you can do that it maybe that'll be our next topic Robert I think you just figured it out that's what we got all right guys but comment away let us know what you want to hear from but thank you again Robert so much for trying to help us this is an amazing thank you and thank you guys for watching and of course sounds like we're going to be talking about the programming and coming up soon it's okay but I hope for the next episode we'll be talking to you guys soon
