Welcome back everyone for another ISSA talk. I am Jenny Leiball and I am super excited to have a return guest who always has so much great information. Very much research-based was absolutely love about our guest. Welcome back Mr. Robert Leiball. How are you? I'm doing great. How are you? Thanks for having me back. Absolutely. So I love connecting with you because you always have again your very research-based mostly because of the affiliations that you have and just the way your brain works. Obviously you guys can see behind him the other is a training space he works with training. He is training the older adult that is his company. He's been licensing out that brand and what he does to other people as well. So I'd love to hear in the beginning here tell everybody a little bit about that as well. But I just want to call one thing out of you guys as I'm talking to Robert today. We're going to be talking about bone density training and rocking specifically. And he has some really great research about some of the things that he's going to bring up. He did send me some screenshots of that research and just some information. So at the end of the episode we're going to put those up on the screen for a few seconds. You can always pause it and grab the information. So keep an eye out at the end of the episode for more on the research. All right. But Robert as we dive into this today for people who might not be familiar with you, tell us a little bit about yourself, your backstory and TLA. Yeah. Real quick, as I do want to make sure we get into all this good stuff. So my wife, Keegan and I run TLA training the older adult.com here in Schengel Springs, California just outside Sacramento. And we're kind of a half and a half business, half trainer education, the other half client training. And they work really well together because this is kind of the beta testing environment here where I get to bring all my clients in, take them through a eight-week training program. We pre-imposed tests and kind of assess how the programming goes. And then if that works well, then we send that out to all of our other TLA affiliates and our junior affiliates and our mentees. Everybody else that we work with as this is a proven program that has worked well. And we kind of continue that cycle as we go. So we give them workouts. We give them mentoring, coaching, business practices, health, troubleshooting clients, whatever they need across the board. And then clients in house, I've got about 60 clients that they work with here either in studio or online or both. So I get a really good opportunity to work with all kinds of aging bodies, different limitations, injuries, clients that are going through treatment or different diseases and figure out how to build a program that accommodates them in their needs. And then I help deliver all that out to all of our people and all of our consumers on our YouTube channel and our Instagram and everything else. So always dish them out in information and always obsessing and researching and packets of content that I'm flipping through and reading all these articles and always trying to find the best way to do this and bring it to our people. Constant pursuit of the perfect program and does that exist? I don't know, but I'm in the search of attempting to find what always evolving. So that's that's us. I love it. So guys, if you're interested, definitely check out the YouTube channel. Because when Robert says he's an educator, he's absolutely an educator and he puts out a ton of free content on his YouTube channel. So check the description of the episode. I have the way that you can get to his YouTube channel. I have the link right there for you guys. I have the link for his training, the older adult website. So if you want to find out more about the training that he does for TLA and how it licensed it, if you're interested and then also the education that he provides. Obviously, I have to say, is an education institution but there's tons out there and if you want to learn from people like Robert, who's through the link in the description saying, can. But without further ado, Robert, let's get into it. Let's do it. I think probably the most important thing that I would like to share with this is the specific focus on aging populations. Let's just call it at 30 right now. Because we used to think of an older adult at 65 and then it became 50 when the ARP started sending out catalogs to 50 year olds and they're like, now you're old. You're like, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Really the research is kind of drifting into the early 30s for sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and function. So we're beyond after feet. You're getting to a point where you're actually losing your ability to do something. Walk, skip, jump, lift, carry, posture, and new name it. You're losing ability right around early ages of 30. If you're living, they're completely sedentary like. On the opposite of that is bone density. So we are seeing, especially the ladies, three to one, overmen, having bone density issues, osteopeenia early onset of bone density issues, leading into osteoporosis. And we're seeing that happen as early as 30 and this can become a nutritional component. This could be a sedentary component, a combo both. There are some links to hereditary components as well for both, but mostly for bone density. And so when we look at that, we're also seeing a combination of the two in these sedentary lifestyles leading to increases in cardiovascular disease. So VO2 health and VO2 capability is very low. On the opposite of that, basically, lens towards additional adipest issue or body fat. So we have obesity components. So you have osteopeenia, you have sarcopenia, and you have obesity. So osteo sarcopesity, right, are kind of the big three concerns that we have right around the early ages of 30. And again, more for females than that early onset. And as we continue to age, if we don't do anything about this, we're going to start to see some pretty severe issues. Start to kick in probably around 50, where postural be very poor health concerns and rest will be very high. And abilities are going to be rather restricted. By the time you get to 60, you're going to be the deconditioned 90 year old, right, at 60. And so we're living longer, but we're aging quicker is a way that I would say that, unless you're doing something about it. So we get a lot of clients to come in and they go, well, I don't really like to lift weights, but I know that I should. And you know, I just want to play golf and I play tennis in this and that. And so it's like, all right, you've got all these things that you can do that don't really participate or utilize additional load or progressive overload, which we know we need for all three of those. So where is there a happy medium? And that's why I brought this topic to you. And I said, hey, I want to get on and talk about this because I just don't think a lot of people know about it. And when we concern ourselves primarily with bone density health, you need additional load. It's some type of outside load to assist in that. Anybody in everybody that is capable of walking into a weight room is capable of walking. So if we put load on you while you walk, you can increase bone density. You can with a couple, with a couple of research articles that I'll show you from the military all the way through pre-metapausal women, you can increase bone density and hang on to and or build muscle mass. And at the same time, increase your VO2 mass. And if you're nutritionally handling things like you should in the kitchen, we're going to see increases in mass, lean muscle mass, bone density decreases in body fat and increase in cardiovascular health. So we're kind of checking all four boxes by doing one thing. Now does that mean that that's all you need to do? No, but if this is an introduction to your body's first step to additional overload training, then that's great. And so we call this rocking. And a lot of people don't really know what it is or if they hear rocking, they think of a rock sack and so you think of like bear grills, the military, you know, British, you know, the rock sack, right? And that's kind of the idea. And that's it's a military inspired strategy for for training. Now I don't know the whole story, but I know that the business, the company Go Rock has kind of spearheaded this whole thing. And they come from the owners and such, come from a military background. And in the military, they've got this tight community in this group and their own language and their own styles of training and all this. And so once a lot of them kind of cycleed through the military and they were done, they wanted to continue to train and be together and do this. And so Go Rock came about. And Go Rock, they create rocks, axe, backpacks and then they got into footwear and they got and everything else you might need to go out and rock safely and efficiently. Really all you need is backpack, okay? And you can get all the fancy stuff later. But what you really need in the beginning is just the backpack. So go grab your Jansport backpack and throw all your schoolbooks out of there. And then you can get, you know, a couple of beach towels and a five pound or a 10 pound plate and wrap it up in there, pack it in nice and tight and then put it up as high on your back as you can. Ideally, you would have a little hip support belt that goes around to you. So a lot of the good, you know, single day, you know, like two to five liter packs that you could wear on a overnight or any of those, they're all going to come with some type of hip support and harness that comes on. And that's great, right? You've got your shoulder straps, you'll click in the middle and then you've got the one that goes round your waist. So now we're kind of distributing the load everywhere across your body. And the more surface area in contact with hip support, you get the less stress on your back. So you go for a walk, a mile or 10 minutes at each direction and come back, start off real simple, really light. Five to ten pounds. Get out there, give it a shot. And come back and see how your body feels. And ideally, if you are walking on a regular basis and you add this a little bit overload, here's what's going to happen. Okay, five pounds that you put in this backpack with every step. That's five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Right? And you take this mile walk and come back and you just move 4,000, 5,000 pounds. But you did it five pounds of a step and you only moved it this far but that's fine that you're still moving load. And you're going to experience that load via axial loading over the shoulders, over the hip. So you're spine, shoulders, your hips, your femurs, your leg all the way down to your feet are all going to experience some type of overload that is not normal. And you just took steps, steps, steps, steps, so they're all going to respond. You're going to be able to push yourself ideally, we call it hillseeking. So you will find some hills to go up and walk up and down and you'll get a cardiovascular health from that. And then at some point, if you start to either carry weights or you use sticks, right? Hiking sticks when you go, you can incorporate your upper body. And you'll start to experience a full body resistance training granted lighter weight but it is a good introduction to this that allows you to feel safe and stable. Basically you're walking, you have sticks in hands so that it helps you with balance. If you're older, if you're not great at this yet or if you're on uneven terrains or your on hills and your in a DG or dirt hill or paths or grass or whatever you're on, you've got some additional support to assist you and not falling down. So now we're addressing all of our primary concerns from our bone health, to our muscular health, to our cardiovascular health. And we're getting outside and we can go with other people this can be social, this can be a cognitive engagement. All of this is kind of working at like a zone two. If you know your zones, your one through five zones, your zone two is that zone where you can still have a conversation with people about it's a little challenging to keep your air, but you're not gastro like, you can't get anything out but you're also not able to talk like we're talking right now. There's that one little level up and that's usually where you can kind of go, all right, this is zone two, we can talk, we can engage, we can reap the benefits of everything we just talked about and all I'm doing is going out for a walk with a backpack on, right? Do that, see if you like it. And if you do, then you can get into, well let's get the right footwear and let me get the right backpack that that fits me and it's size to fit on me and all this and then you can go from there. But I think it's a great way to start off and if you don't want to wear a backpack, you could wear a vest, a lot of people wear a weighted vest and there's a lot of different companies out there from TRX to Hyper-Ware to perform better everybody, almost everybody has a vest these days that you can get and if you have any lower back or the T-Brol issues and the axial loading is really challenging, a lot of people will also think well maybe this isn't for me, I can't put a lot of load on my back. Again, we're talking about very light loads and we're talking about distributing it about your body. So yeah, you'll have some axial loading but that's where the hip supports will come in and give you some pretty good benefit. So I think that's probably where I'd like and I was a long intro of introducing the idea of rocking and I would love to hear your thoughts on it if you've done it or if you've had any experiences with it and then we know a little bit deeper into the research and kind of see what some of the experiences from our military to our premonopoles of women going through studies and then just some of our outdoor experience folks what they're experienced with this because there are some common concerns and some thoughts about it but what are your thoughts and what do you think of you tried this or done this and what are your experiences better? Yes, okay so I do have some questions and I think I'm a person they have a quiet or trainer my house and questions about this too. I have done a little bit of rucking I didn't call it that I just had like my weighted vest because I did buy a weighted vest server I bought it on Amazon and it wasn't very expensive and it went from like zero pounds I unweighted it as little sleeves like little tiny sleeves that you put into like the little holes around it and it goes up to 20 pounds I've never put more than 10 pounds in it for anything but I think the important distinction that you made is you could start with a backpack but to put it as high-up as possible because of course we all know or work with kittens right at some point and they all wear their backpack so low and then they're backs her and their knees her and their hips are and I'm like oh my god well a lot of it's because their bag is hanging so low and it's like pulling them back so that's a very important distinction how to wear a traditional backpack until you get one that has the correct support but I have a question for you if somebody's using an old weighted vest right even if it's just whether it's one from like a danceier place or just a Amazon one like I have those do the weights do set a little bit lower should they just make sure the vest is like on as securely as possible yeah that's that's a little tricky so so number one the the first concern we have especially with women wearing a vest is are you gonna be comfortable and there are plate carrier vest where you literally have an iron plate or some type of cast iron plate that sits on you now if you've had any kind of augmentation and surgeries or if you know if you're just more developed that's uncomfortable and I totally get it and so then they started to make plates that have curvatures in this and that then they started to develop vest that didn't have the weights above the chest they hadn't below and I think that's probably one of the better options to pursue hyper wear makes the best one that I have seen but does that where all the weights are sub-stern and so they wrap around your belly and then they have if you put it on like like a vest and you zip it up and then there are cinch ties on the side so you can cinch it up tighter right there's small medium large but you can make it from you know six inches loose or to six inches tighter on each vest now you do want to tight like you said but you don't want to so tight that it restricts your breathing and so that's where if you have a plate that like sits on your chest and you're having a puffing going up a hill you'll see a lot of people like loosen them up while they climb and then once they get over the top and they're not having a puffing anymore they'll cinch them back up again and that's okay like that's the beauty of the vest and adjustable vest but also with the rocks you'll see people adjusting their rock all the time you'll have times especially if you're doing like a little bit heavier one you'll loosen the shoulder straps but tighten the hips supports so more of the weights sits on your hips and you'll carry like that for maybe 30 minutes or 40 minutes and then you'll reverse it you'll loosen the hips and cinch up the shoulders and tighten up and so you can kind of switch and transition back and forth as you start to experience fatigue you can do similar with the vest where you can cinch it up real tight around the ribs maybe take a little more like a hugging posture to distribute the load but then as you start to fatigue a little bit you want to take a break loosen that up let your shoulders take the load if you're going to go more than 45 minutes to an hour we suggest people get backpacks or rocks we think that's a much better product to wear for that where the vest will get you to about 45 minutes or an hour before your trap start to feel a lot of pressure and they're more or less designed for a workout than they are for you to wear for hours on end so I'm going to do you know a bodyweight workout or even a resistance training workout and I just want to make my challenge of the workout a little harder I'm going to throw an extra 10 pounds on me while I do everything that was kind of the original design of the vest then people go okay well I like rocking well I have that vest and they start kind of making the connections totally fine totally doable majority of my clients have that pro hyper hyper wear vest and it's $79 I think and it's a great investment and they're like you were saying they're a little plastic sand bags are little little cubes that you can pull out put back in and make it whatever you want they're like a half pound each so you go I'm going to start with three pounds and in two weeks go to five pounds and two weeks go to seven pounds and you can make your adjustment as you go send jump as tight as you want zip up zip down if it's hot of its cool and it basically looks like like a spandex mask that you're wearing you no one even know it's not like what's that lady doing with a bullet per vest on like it's not it doesn't look like you know those now there's nothing wrong with those those little coolest I've got two of them like my wife has one we love them you know it's got all the acronyms all the stuff on it we've got some that are dedicated to our buddies that served in there in the military and I love that but I also have clients are like I don't I don't want to have people ask me if I'm in the military while I'm walking around which my rock is camouflage and everywhere I take it with this hairdo and this beard everyone's like are you special ops I'm like no I love you guys and I support you to the umpeceteat degree I've so much respect for a military but no I that's not me and it's it's a community that you'll see of rockers like when you see each other we've got a couple people on our neighborhood and you'll see a runner and they're like hey but when you see a rocker it's like hey man like we know something that nobody else knows like we're our own group you know it's actually really cool and uh go rock plus another couple other companies there's rocking challenges there's go rock yourself there's a couple other ones that are really fun and they have these huge communities of gatherings where it's like every Saturday they meet at the high school and they all go on a rock together or they all do workouts together really really fun it's all about community and it's as simple as if you can walk you can rock you know and and any ages across the board there's great value to that emotionally and physically as we kind of talked about but it's so simple and once you kind of have the basics of your gear there's no membership there's no you know oh I gotta keep buying more stuff like once you have the basics good footwear you got your rock ahead lamp if you're gonna go out you know when it's dark and and then water bottle you know reflective vests you're good to go you know by new shoes every year that's about it the weights are always gonna lay the same and you can go wherever you want I've got routes planned all over my neighborhood like if I have 90 minutes if I have two hours if I have 45 minutes I've route it you know I've got routes you know where do I want more hills I'm gonna carry a little more weight today a little less I'm gonna go for speed I'm gonna go for climbing you know you can create all kinds of different styles of training out of it I know I'm jumping the gun and so based on the routes part what if you I'm indoor for city so I've wrecked a couple of times I have had do I enjoy it I don't enjoy the outside let's just put it that way I don't like bugs and I'm not a fan of it so if somebody wanted to do it indoors because they use like a stair mill a treadmill on in-cline like what are some options for someone who's indoors maybe the weather doesn't permit them being outside yeah yeah a lot of people will ask to like well I don't live in the city I live out in the you know I live in a city and I rock like some of the biggest rocking groups of cargo in New York like they're in the cities and there'll be thousands of them that all get together and they walk around the city together but even if you don't want to go like outside you can rock on a treadmill if I'm on a business trip or whatnot my work backpack is a backup rock and so it looks like a regular backpack but on the inside it has a plate carrier and a carrier wrap behind that from my laptop to go into and so I can take that with me find a couple of plates in the you know the Mary-Out weight room for a couple of dumbbells in there or later whatnot and then hop on the treadmill and away we go I prefer people to get the value in the benefit of being outside the sun exposure you know here in the birds in the trip but if you're a New York city and you got to stop every other block to wait for the stop lights let's you go yeah I get hop on the treadmill get your workout in you can do the stair mill I think the stair mill is a great where you're literally picking your feet up as opposed to the stair stepper's where you're just pumping your feet in place and I think more damage occurs from those than good and the elliptical is kind of the same thing this is just my opinion I don't know if there's a ton of research to support this I read one research article that basically suggested unless you're five seven to five nine and unless your legs are 39 inches long or whatever it was then the elliptical is not designed for you and so I do said that because I am six feet tall rubber and when I get out of an elliptical every time every time they get tight and then I have to stop and like do hip circles to pop that just because it's I tried to explain this to my mom who's also pretty tall she's five ten and a half I was like do not with your artificial need get out of an elliptical because if you think about it it's this your feet are in place yes you can move in the foot pedal but there's only so many inches left right forward back that you can move and so it's a set range of motion and women especially have wider hips and it varies by the person so you can't tell me that the foot pedals I'm an elliptical are the right with for every human being because they are not so my hips are like crazy when it's a little too fast there's there's a lot of the download in that because you're a hundred percent right if you're over five ten then you're going to be taking these little you know these little awkward steps that are under your regular stride length and if you're shorter than five seven then you're taking these huge striding lengths and you're overstriding and so yeah the shorter people their backs are probably going to hurt us taller people I'm six four so I'm my hips hurt when I do it and when was the last time you watched somebody walk that didn't put like their feet are stuck in this perfect rail road like we walk or run our feet swing in towards our midline so the machine can't do that so now you're like forcing your feet to turn out which internally rotates your hips and causes more uncomfortable that's in damage to that and then yeah you're right you can't put your feet where you want to when you there's no striking of them on the ground so maybe I like to turn my feet out or in I guess you get a just that on the machine but the best one that I've seen is the sidebex arc trainer and that one kind of allows yeah there's a freedom to it where you can move it into some different positions but I'd rather you just walk on a treadmill you know I think that's so much better especially if you've had a joint replacement allow your feet to land where they want to land and if you're gonna get on a treadmill any woodway treadmill is definitely preferred the woodway treadmill is a herd of the bomb yeah and you know yeah you want at least a 1% in decline and then typically I would say whatever you're actually walking at let's say you're a pace you're a regular walking pace is like three miles an hour whatever the treadmill is gonna be it's gonna be a little slow so you you'd actually want to walk it like 0.2 more than what you might be clocked at regularly because you have to wait for the belt right the belt has to be turned underneath you that's the beauty of the woodway treadmills is you're the one turning that there's there's no motor right the feeds it so is it more work and does it take time to get used to it yeah but it's it's a way better product in my opinion so yeah if you're gonna do something more about that's and that's awesome right so like that's I think if you're gonna be indoors and doing that absolutely I think it's a great it's a great thing and it's just keep in mind that that analogy I gave you of the 1020 30 40 pounds right with the 10 on like how quickly that can add up and value so you're like well I only did it with five pounds yeah but you move like 567,000 pounds while you did that three mile walk that's amazing right that's awesome work that your body is not used to doing it's going to respond to that if your outdoors or on a treadmill or on a stair mill it's gonna respond so this is a very inexpensive way to check a lot of boxes of what we're trying to pursue especially for females especially when you're younger but for anybody with bone density issues across the board I just don't know of a lot of people know about it or if enough people feel comfortable implementing it so that kind of leads you said you had another question did you have one more before? Well I was gonna say let's start with a basic client how would we say talk to them about this potentially how to understand the benefits and get them gold? Yeah the the the introduction of rocking can be tricky and the reason I say that way is some of the resources you'll find online say start with 5% of your body weight or start with 10% of your body weight and don't go more than 30% or ladies should be 20 pounds or under guys should be 20 pounds or over like there's a lot of just numbers that people kind of throw out there I'm a fan no matter what who you are how tall you are, unexperienced isn't if you're going to start rocking for the first time you don't know what your body is going to be like and I'll give you this example I've got a client big strong muscular guy played football he's you know 255 he's just studying trains with me three days a week can handle any weight workout I throw out him I invite him to come up and rock with me and we're going out on a five mile loop two and a half out two back he does uh elk hunting all the time so he's used to distance and all this and he goes I'm gonna take 65 pounds and I'm like whoa like why don't you take like 30 I'm only taking 30 I do this all the time I got this I got this 15 minutes in we're dropping plates on the side of the trail to pick up on the way back because he's just way too heavy you don't take into account 65 130 190 whatever that you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like you know it's like 10 steps in you're at a thousand pounds that you moved already it's like due to it's way too much right it's way too much so start really really light start with three or five pounds and go for a mile walk or a 10 mile out and a 10 excuse me a 10 minute out and a 10 minute back because that's the average person walks a mile about 20 minutes so if you like I don't walk I don't do anything but I want to start doing this just go out for a walk walk away from your house 10 minutes walk back 10 minutes okay that's gonna give you a bottom mile if you're just kind of moving out of decent clip if it's lesser more I don't care just do 10 minutes out 10 minutes back and do that two to three days a week for a couple of weeks let's let's say two weeks just get used to go on and walks every other day and then you get to add three or five pounds do a backpack or a vest and do it again and in some cases you'll get out and you'd be like damn I'm tired right this was hard good thing I only brought three pounds and not 10 because then you're dropping out weights on the side of the trail and you're driving back to get them later okay so just take three pounds right go out and come back I have some clients that do like a two or three mile loop and so they'll go out of mile come back drop off their vest and go do the rest of the walk with just their body weight even better right like that's a good way to kind of introduce it and then slowly kind of get a little more a little more a little more until you're doing two or three miles of what you normally do but you're wearing the vest the whole time and then you can bump it to five pounds and then maybe ten pounds and if you get to like ten or fifteen pounds I'm happy you know I think that's great I think that's a phenomenal load to be able to carry over and over and over again will you go heavier and could there be days yeah but I'm talking like months if not a year down the line where you might want to do more now if you have something that you want to train for like a backpacking trip or something yeah you're going to have to carry you know I took 65 pounds up rainier with me when I climbed it and it's like you're going to have to train for some heavy overload but that's not what we're talking about here I just want to introduce a little extra load to you on regular basis and now I'll get all these responses bones muscles cardio foot contacts coordination balance cognition outside sun exposure vitamin D all these great things all this is going to come from me just going for a walk every day and adding a vest or a backpack onto my regular practices so if you're doing that two or three days a week and then you start to introduce just the most basic resistance training program on the other days even if it's just a little selectorized machines right I'm going to chest press and I'm going to row and I'm going to do some pull down and do some over head press and then I'll do quad extensions leg curls in the leg press okay so seven exercises and you do three sets of 10 on each one it takes you 20 minutes I would be you number one you'll see massive change in your abilities massive change and you do that for three to six months you'll see if physical logical change right as long as you're your nutritional habits don't change much right you're either eating to your your nutritional demands every day if you burn 2,000 you're eating 2,000 and then we do everything we're talking about you're going to lose some really good body fat you're going to increase bone density you're going to gain some muscles and you're going to start seeing your abs and seeing little cuts in your arms and your shoulders and you're all in the sudden hey man I got some muscles here this can happen in any age okay at any age as long as you're doing it right but what happens is we'll go out and be a little more physically active and what happens we get a little more hungry and so yeah I'm doing a little more and then you eat a little more and nothing really changes other than I'm getting stronger right and then your bone density etc but maybe we're not losing the belly fat that we want so that's where the balance act kind of comes in you're still going to need to find some type of caloric deficit but allow your exercise to do that rather than reducing the amount of food you eat just get the amount of food you're supposed to have every day and allow your exercise to be your 2,300 calories of burn and now we're winning across the board you get it stronger you're getting more dense you're getting a cardiovascular health for your heart and your lungs we're starting to lean out a little bit you rid of some of that body fat and we're having fun while we're doing it but really what are we talking about going for a walk every other day in 20 minutes of weight so let's say the 20 minutes of weight actually takes you 40 because you got to drive to the gym you got to drive back and then your walk takes you know 20 30 minutes out 20 30 minutes back let's call it an hour every day just let's just for fun call it an hour every day that you got to commit so now we're looking at 7 hours out of 168 that you have in the week 7 hours to have all these great benefits that we just talked about okay we need to talk about cognitive return for this okay cognitive return your body's ability to function in the bedroom your body's ability to perform better in sport right all of these things are going to come benefit if you've ever looked at the list of benefits of resistance training they're 30 bullet points deep okay there's a lot to improve there and so you're going to get all that with 7 hours out of 160 so you got 161 other hours to do whatever the hell you want let's say a third of that sleeping you still have what is that 112 out whatever right what it used to have a ton of hours to do whatever it is you want to do so when people go out on really have time to do this come on right especially if you're even close to retirement you've got time to put in 30 40 minutes every day to go for a walk and lift a couple of weights to have all this benefit there's definitely time you just need to present the people and arm them with this information so they go oh yeah this should be a priority we have clients to come and lift two three days a week I don't like it but they know how good it is form and then they see the benefits on the other end and they're like I'm in I'm in keep me I want three spots every week I'm not changing the thing they're like okay they've seen the return their investment now they're committed even though they don't like it yeah I think well that point is what is going to make two is that there's a lot of people out there clients out there that don't like lifting weights they don't want to go stay in the freeway section they don't want to use a machine they walk in and they say no to all of this right but this is just a fun interesting different way to get them to to do exercise and they're getting all these benefits whether or not they think about them we know that right so there's often going to be clients right right that we don't necessarily want to bore them more than with the details of what they're getting out of their training we just want them to be interested in it and engage and want to do it consistently so whether it's outside inside but again getting outside like you said for some people if you just told them hey put this on it's got five pounds in it and we're going to go for a walk most people most people wouldn't fight you on it you'd be like straight this is what we're doing and then maybe they only train like two or three days a week instead of five or six days we're doing something that they despise so I really had that aspect of it because there are so many clients out there who don't want to be in the weight room yeah and I didn't get that you know there's there's resistance to it for many reasons that it's intimidating or they just feel uncomfortable or like they don't belong here and even if you find a gym where it is all women or all men or all bodybuilders or all 65 and older whatnot you may still just feel intimidated like you don't know what to do what everybody knows how to walk right and everybody can get their own kit of everything we just talked about and they can start with this and this can be a very non-intimidating very simple very easy way to introduce some resistance to your life good resistance right and start to reap some benefits from that and I think most people will go on these rocks and they'll come back and go this was really fun in terms of I feel challenge and I get this in doorfin rush and then you say take off the vest or the rock and they go oh shit I forgot I had it on and we call that unconscious load okay and this happens almost so Tuesdays in house here all of our clients wear vest when they train they all come in on most of them come in a Monday so when they come back the back our second strength our second day back the back it's a almost bodyweight workout but with the best time and so we break out all the best most of our clients have their own they bring them in they call them their boyfriend so they bring their boyfriend's they throw on their vest we do the work out and at the end I go okay before we do the finish or go ahead and take your best off and you see them go oh yeah they almost every single time they do that they kind of forget that they're wearing it right and so that's showing us that their body is getting used to this load this overload but it also shows that it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna turn unconscious for them when they're not gonna have to think about this is so heavy this is so heavy like you're gonna get going and you're gonna think man I can feel this this is this is something and then you guys will start talking or you'll start looking around or you'll start investing whatever you're listening to if you're on a treadmill or watching or whatnot and you kind of forget about it but the benefit of carrying the load is still occurring and then when you get down you're like oh yeah I'm gonna take this off and you feel light as a feather and you get that little endorphin high and almost like a lifters high and a runners high kind of mix together right so we introduce you to that and you're like see off on this one you can get an even better feeling of this if you come and lift with me now let's just find you a way that you'd like to lift and some people want a set of adjustable dumbbells like some power blocks right and they'll just use those and they're like I want to have my spot in my routine cool others want to have a set of kettlebells in their own space others want to have a whole gym with all their own selectorized stuff there's all kinds of different variations of resistance training in a class semi private one on one at home online in person there's there's there's gonna be some way to connect the folks and a lot of our clients will say well we we like to do it in like a competitive or a fun environment where it doesn't feel like we're lifting necessarily more like we're competing cool we have workouts to do that too you know in different styles that encourage that so there's a lot of different ways to introduce resistance happy resistance in your life where it's not gonna be seen as this negative poor thing and maybe rucking could be that first step that kind of disarms them to the idea of I don't want to I don't want to lift weights I'm not gonna do that or they can certainly they're gonna get hurt because you could be like came in we could go do all these machines and you'll move like 2,000 pounds but the rock you just did move three times that like you're not gonna get hurt okay your body can obviously handle it right moving loads moving load right if I deliver a thousand bricks to you outside you have to move each one or one one thousand pound brick either way we move the same load it's just a bite at a time right your body's still gonna be able to reap the benefits from this we're just gonna gradually transition it's like let's do a little heavier and a little more the further we go with that the greater the bone density return the greater the muscular return etc it'll all just start to add up and we'll get to a point where you're like hey I'm 55 and I could pick you know 607080 pounds up off the ground and I can carry 3040 pounds in each hand and I can go up and down stairs and I can get up and down off the floor and I can push pull and press a pretty you know decent amount of weight and every direction kind of ready for whatever life frozen you know doesn't need to be more in that and I think that's another thing and maybe deter's people is like well I have to constantly pursue the next way you don't you can get to a point where you're like I'm strong and let's just not go backwards yeah let's have fun yeah absolutely was there any other research you want to highlight on yeah yeah so this is a fun one I'm just kind of looking at my notes here and this we got this from Go Rock and I mentioned it to you right before we we came on so one of the questions that comes up is how is this gonna if I'm doing cardio how am I gonna not lose muscle mass in the act of doing this because there is a common misconception but it's it's not maybe terribly a misconception because it is very difficult to cut body fat in build muscle mass that's why the elite of the elite body builders and such even when they're cutting for a show they're still losing some muscle mass right that's why they bulk and they get really really big and so when they cut a little bit they still look fantastic but they're not as big as they were three months ago right and so it's it's a really challenging thing to do so if we're gonna introduce this form of cardio how can we not lose muscle mass at the same time and so this kind of came about they had a group of individuals that went out on a 12 day rock back country hunting and rucking they were gone for 12 days there were 30 plus people every day they rocked between eight and 10 miles a day and they assessed everyone when they left when they all came back on average the group was down 14% on body fat they were increased 8% on VO2 max and they decreased their bad cholesterol by 28% all while losing 0.1% of lean muscle mass so they didn't lose any muscle mass okay they improved their heart they lost body fat and they reduced their bad cholesterol all while being out there the whole time right now granted they're they're rucking more than the average person's gonna rock on a mile walk but the point is they can work at an intensity where they're not gonna lose muscle mass but still reap the benefits of everything else that we've we've kind of addressed because of the intensity rate in the additional load you're not sprinting right you're not working at a higher than a level two or a zone two and you're carrying some additional load so it's kind of the best of both worlds yeah you're using your muscles exactly and especially if you're using sticks which a lot of people feel like that's a that means I'm not good at this or that I'm a fall risk or they feel like if you're using sticks it's somehow seen as a notch down and it really isn't but I was going through getting my master's degree um or my undergrad at tax date I was one of the athletes in the class and so anytime we had to do one of the tests were one of the the assessments I got volunteered to do it so I got to do a VO2 max test the Bruce protocol test and a VO2 at the same time and so I get on the treadmill and it's like every two minutes it goes up one mile per hour and two percent in climb and I'm harnessed and you go and you go in like 15 18 20 minutes you're like you sprinting and then you just fly off the machine and once you're just like I can't do it anymore and you're swinging from this thing behind you're done and so you literally go to failure okay so I did that and I made it for like 16 minutes or whatever my time was and they gave me a VO2 max and then the next week when I came back we did it again this time on a wider treadmill and I got to use the sticks and what I found was I could work at a higher intensity because I was using more of my body earlier I used my thumbs up earlier in the in the test I actually had a higher push on my VO2 because I was now recruiting my arms I had more muscular involvement now did I burn out earlier yeah I only made it to like 12 and a half or 14 minutes but it's because I was using more of my muscular my heart was having a more blood to be able to feed it all point is when you're using your arms and you're out hiking walking it's harder you're using more muscles you're engaging more so that's not a bad thing like that's that's what we want I'd rather you be able to go out and rock and train your entire body rather than why did everything except my arms right and now my I got these big thighs and I've got this awesome butt and these great big shoulders and no arms right little chicken arms so yeah you can do something called extremity loading where you either hold weights or strap you know two or three pound weights no more than three pounds on your arms while you're out doing your rocks and now you've got some upper body engagement while you do it you could also do ankle weights some clients will do ankle weights mind you if you've had a knee or a hip replacement I don't advise that okay but if you if you have all your original joints then you could do two three maybe four pounds on your ankles and have some extremely loading there and it's just a way to make things a tiny bit harder and guess what my arms get tired what do I do with the weights I throw them in my backpack right and I keep going I've just got the same load on me right but I was able to train my upper body for the first half or you know the first mile or whatever I did so there's a lot of fun ways to introduce this and and implement it and kind of daily practice it doesn't cost a lot you got a lot of great return it's a lot of fun there's there's not a lot of negatives that pack up to this I just wanted to get an opportunity to share it and and expose everybody to it so they have an idea of how to implement it in with their clients introduce it to them you know kind of a selling discussion on here's all the great value that can come from this and if they're already out doing regular walks let's just talk about adding a little load and you're only going to get more benefit out of that other research kind of looked at long-term exposure for women going through menopause and being able to either maintain bone loss if not increase it and they followed them over a 32 let me bring this one up real quick a 32 week three times a week for 32 weeks they went out on walks wearing their weighted vest and by the end individuals had either maintained these were all folks over average age 64 as high as 72 and as low as 62 somewhere around in there or 58 and yeah average age 64 trained for 32 weeks nobody lost any muscle mass or any muscle mass knowing decreased in bone density they all improved either in muscle mass or maintain the same their bone density either maintain stay the same or slightly increased over those 32 weeks they all reported under self assessment improvement and mood and and smooth swings in temperature regulation across the board because they were exercising on regular daily basis and majority of the women chose to participate in the extended program that lasted another five years so not only did the 32 weeks go so well they all volunteered the majority of them all volunteered to keep going over the five year assessment and and just continue to see how how valuable it was for them to wear their weighted vest on their daily walks so and then that led all the way over into the military and looking at the military their bone density muscle mass across the board military will have like three standard ruck weights there's a i'm gonna get this wrong but something like a 50 pounder 90 pounder and like 130 pound kit that they have to be able to carry and do certain distances at certain times and so if you have a light one you have to be able to go six miles in three hours or something like that and each one has kind of a standard and so they look at those individuals same thing of that original only talked about nobody lost muscle mass they either maintained or increased bone density huge increases in cardiovascular health all their VO2 maxes went through the roof and they decrease their bad cholesterol decrease their adeptist ubody fat across the board like these were all winds and and so concerns just to kind of wrap this here concerns that you you can't have is doing too much too soon and if you have a bad lower back or hip issues or a niraptcy in your feet or any kind of foot Achilles tendonitis anything like that planar fascia is the additional load can be aggravating so you definitely want to introduce this slowly okay and and then you also want to take in the content into into consideration the shoes that you're wearing in the amount of brown contacts that you're going to have if the average person can cover 5,280 feet you know two and a half feet per stride so you're looking at like 18, 100 to 2200 steps right somewhere around in there to get to a mile if I did my math right there 1500, 1800 steps something around there that's a lot of foot contacts is my point and you want to make sure your feet are contacting the ground properly the shoes that you're wearing are cross trainers or hiking shoes or something along those lines and they're geared towards being able to go forward or multiple direction ankle support with additional load you don't want to wear your tennis shoes is my point you don't want to wear clogs and go you know like you need to wear good supportive athletic shoes when you're going to do this and understand the demands that you're placing on your body when you do it so you don't have any of the negative returns on the other end right blisters you know that kind of stuff anything you would have from if you went from nothing to old bunch of something so a lot to take in a lot to take in with Rocky but I think there's really great value to have there and I'm just happy we got the chance to sit down and talk about it absolutely so I'm looking forward to sharing the research with everyone that feel like a lot of our viewers are also research minded and it's nice to have the research to back up to share with clients too because a lot of our clients are going to be research minded but a lot of it is going to be anecdotal evidence when they get out there and they try it and they see the benefits and they're like oh this is nothing life is easy but this is simple right I can do this or I will do this consistently I think it's lights out because to your point there's tons of benefits to it and it's just a matter of getting them started so they can see the benefits and feel them from themselves yeah we are we are taking information benefit information and kind of assuming as we lump it all together that this is going to occur because there's only like five studies out there that have really looked at rocking three of them big time for the military the other two similar of what we just kind of talked about with backcountry and with the ladies there and some of those were wearing vest not even a heavier load and by the vest they're talking you know five to ten pounds it wasn't a ton of weight but enough to make a fairly significant difference so yeah I think as this becomes more common and more mainstream we're only going to get more and more research to support it but the little information we have now shows great results and great benefits of doing so very minimal risk and great social and cognitive components to go along with that that it would seem you know kind of silly for us not to educate and teach people about it but I can only see over the next five to ten fifteen years as people continue to this becomes more mainstream you're going to see people walking all over the neighborhood wearing vest and backpacks being like what's going on here it's already happening and so many different in city out of the city is et cetera you're already going to see this all over and as that continues to grow I think we'll just get more and more research really to kind of support that and back it up and you'll start seeing in universities and thesis and everything else as people start to see really great value in introducing this so yeah I think this is just the tip of the spear and as as the decades go we'll see more and more of this is a really good thing to invest in it's a low barrier entry and it's just such a great thing to incorporate on regular basis I think every thing lines up really well for people especially if they're aging this is such a good fit. Awesome very cool so guys stay play at the end of this we'll put up some of that research that Robert was talking about take some time to utilize the pause button so pause it and breathe some of it and then you can follow some of the leaks in the description of this episode to get to the research and also to get to Robert but thank you so much for coming to sharing this of this is been awesome. I pleasure my pleasure I have three other videos on my YouTube started to give a little plug here real quick but one is how to start rocking what equipment you would need and then another one that's just a basic explanation of what is it to like if I were talking to your mom or your dad so if anybody out there's like this could be great for my parent or if you want more information on how to get your clients to understand what we're talking about feel free to look at those videos they're all on there I don't have a subscription look there's this you can subscribe but I don't have like a money what they call it a financial wall right yeah you have to be for anything yeah yeah you guys can just pop on there and enjoy them and yeah there's there's one through five I did the most common questions on Rocky and I just want to get more information out there so feel free to check all that out and if anybody has any questions direct feel free to reach out to me Instagram Facebook you can message me on there I'm happy to help. So thank you for making yourself available as always. This has been super cool and we will see you again remember anyway I love chat with you. Yes YouTube so guys do the research check it out so glad you guys stopped by go back and re-lessing this get some again some tips and ways to talk to your clients about this that simplifies what we're talking about here in most clients don't want to be bored with the details so find a way to simply explain to them the benefits go check out those couple videos Robert has to offer about explaining this to clients as well and make good choices out there guys we'll see you soon. you you
