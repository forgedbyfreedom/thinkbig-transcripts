So I decided to become a health coach because I feel like there is a lot more to being healthy than just your diet exercise. While those are very important, there are other areas of your life that you also need nourishment and encouragement like your career, like relationships, and being able to empower other people to take control and take hold of those aspects of their life as well in order to live their best possible life was really a passion of life.
