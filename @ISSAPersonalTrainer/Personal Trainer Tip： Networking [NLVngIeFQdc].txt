I get everyone to talk about our content developer at ISSA and today I'm going to share something that I wish I knew when I first started in the industry. I wish that I knew the power of having a strong professional network or networking in general. I probably spent the first six or seven years in my career not really building a network. I was relatively successful as a trainer, but I didn't have much of a network. So in terms of learning about other opportunities, getting mentorship from other professionals that have been there and done that before me, I didn't really have that going for me. So it wasn't until about that point that I started to branch out, start to gain a little bit more of a network. And a lot of great things came from that. A lot of great education, a lot of great friendship, some great opportunities came my way. So again, if I can go back back to the late 1900s when I started, I would tell myself, hey, I'm going to start building that network now because it'll pay off later on. So please do get in the comments and let us know maybe something that you wish you would have learned when you started your own personal fitness journey.
