Something that always worked really well. You just have to make sure that it's not too much. Is the McDonald's, sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. Because my thing is more, it's not about like needing a bunch of carbs. It's the combination of there's some carbs, there's a bunch of fat, and there's a bunch of sodium. All right. What's up, guys?

I think we've got a couple of Patreon questions. We're going to take questions off the livestream, but selfishly I have a question for Skip because he is the resident malanitan expert. And here's the thing. So we were talking about malanitan on muscle mice. And Scott said he feels like malanitan has a strong benefit of fat loss for him. Do you see that skip? Well, I don't know because I've been on it pretty pretty pretty much straight for I don't know. I do think there is. I don't know to like to what degree it helps. I think it's not exactly like green tea. I remember one of you used to do the green tea thing and you had to have green tea in there because you know fat burning properties. That's miniscule. But you know it's not exactly clean either. So I think there is a benefit. I will say this though just to piggyback off this because this is important. It just came across this and I didn't believe it. Even though I respect the person that I saw posted this information, I still wanted to do my due diligence because I don't believe things very easily. But there is evidence now based on studies that say that malanitan too will lower your calcium score. That's what Carl the Dorm was just talking. I wasn't going to that's who I heard it from and I just wasn't sure because I do respect the things that and I thought I got to check on this. Not because I didn't believe it but I'd never heard that before. I had heard this idea there but I'm glad you said that. Oh you did. I didn't check it. Now I didn't do a deep dive but I was like, I'll be there. This is okay. There is something here. Now how convincing it is. I look. I've said this a million times. And you know what's this big. I read studies and I need some type of an app to translate the big words. I can't understand them. Like I need to pay someone to like edit it down and give it to me in layman's terms. So and I think I have a pretty good vocabulary but that is not something that I can do. I cannot give it a language. Yeah it's really it's over my head. Well I'm glad that you say that because a lot of people I think in our industry would just dance around it. Pick up a few of those keywords. Oh we lost the answer. And he's like I'm out of here. Pick up a few of those keywords and then start you know using him in conversation as though they're experts in the field. Yeah. You know what I mean? There's there's a lot of that. But we do have a bunch of literature questions. I was curious. I'm thinking about I'm thinking about getting back on the planet and I haven't used it in years man. Like literally years. I was thinking about the nasal spray. I know they've got it that the amino place which shall not be mentioned on YouTube. He's back. Oh yeah. He just stepped out for a second. You're back. Something just something disconnected the cable with my microphone. So I was trying not to pull away from the answer and just come back and launch a lot. Yeah yeah. We weren't going to let you do that. You guys make a deal out of it. I'm like. Oh and you're out. We had a bunch of listed questions already popping up in the live stream. We're going to see what we can get through plus. I know we had a couple from Patreon. We had a few from the last show and guys who are watching this like the edited final recorded version. Leave us questions because we're going to need questions for the next episode. So load us up plus all your comments, all your likes, all that stuff. Those things are super helpful to us. They definitely make a difference. I see the statistics and when you guys comment more, when you like more, all that the show gets shared more within the YouTube algorithm. So I appreciate all of you. We'll just start with an easy one. Wood massaging or using massage gun on your injection sites be helpful. If you have a knot, would it help to disperse the oil better? I mean, yeah wood, but I don't know if you necessarily want to disperse the oil better. Here's why if you did happen to have an infection, you do not want to spread the infection out over the rest of your tissue and then it gets in your blood stream faster and then you become septic. So if you're sure, and one of the tests you can do is you can start taking your body temperature. You have a fever, like a day or two later. If that's not the case, then you can probably rest assured you just have some inflammation and whatnot. I guess it's okay to do it, but I really don't massage, you know, what do they call it, PIP or like bad injections. Honestly, I could say I never really have bad injections too. I think you got to pick your carrier oils correctly. You got to pick your sources correctly, but theoretically, you could massage in it, maybe. I would actually be more apt to put a tens unit on it to try to like confuse the nerves from that pain signal. That's what I mean. It works. When I get dry needling, I always tell them, stay away from my gear because I don't want you messing with it. Or even cupping. I literally told them, like, don't cupping. You're going to pull all the gear out of the muscle and you started laughing at me. I understand you're a doctor and everything in your good friend of mine, but don't be a jerk. I remember I was going to say episode of Muscle Minds where we looked at half-lifes of a test sip. And one of the factors is what muscle you put it in and when you trained that if you were to exercise after say putting in an adult muscle, that that test is going to dispersal out faster than if you were to put it in a glute and sit on it. You know? Good point. Let me add something real quick because I think this is important and I've had a lot of clients benefit from this. One thing that I do, I was going to say do, do. One thing that I do, I've started doing it within about the last year or half is, and I need to be careful because if anybody hears this and they go, that's a good idea. At least reach out to me so I can explain it better. I take because I preload my syringes at the beginning of the week. So what I do is I leave it as much air as I can in it. When I get ready to take my shots because I always do bilateral. It doesn't matter what. If I go into adult, I'm going into both delts. So I have two pins. I will not be sore or swollen or different. I have a symmetry, OCDness issue with it. So what I do is I take, I'm going to put my hands at, I take a bear and I have needle is a little bit higher and I run it under a hot water out of the faucet, but it's just like a kind of a low stream and I run it over the barrel of the syringe and I rock slowly rock the, and I do this for about three minutes. I rock it back and forth a little so that it can mix and it can kind of be dispersed, even leak as I'm OCD it probably doesn't matter. And then I lie the syringes down on the, like a paper towel and I pat dry them and I, so my thing then I inject. The reason I do this is because I live in Florida and everything, you know this too, and everything is cold. Like air conditioning or anything else. So that tends to make your carrier or carrier oil a little bit thicker. So it makes it a little bit thinner. Now I'm not saying microwave it so don't do something stupid and then come back to me when you're, you know, or, or, or, or, it just it turns it up a little bit. It takes the temperature up so that it's thinner and I'm telling you I have my injection sites and soreness has gone down from a 7 to a 3, 4, 3 probably and it all the difference in the world for me personally. And I don't know, I told you guys a couple of years ago I had horrible, now it's longer than that. It was back in 2020, but I had horrible injection like I couldn't come back to that site for like a week and a half. I used to get that massive information no matter where I went that I started getting good gear and never had a mess in the world. I'm going to go on record and say that that whole thing that you describe skip while completely logical and awesome. I would never do that because I'm just too lazy. I would rather sit there with pain in my shoulder than take the time even though it's only two minutes. I'm going to tell you I've done literally exact same things get literally two of t the exact same thing. I've also used a hair dryer because you go in the bathroom, take the hair dryer but you got to be careful because you could really heat that up with a hair dryer. You know what I mean? I just heated up fast enough that like you if you dump it a couple times you could see how fast it's moving. You heated up for 10 seconds and then you watch it and it's faster and then I know the viscosity's lowered enough. I've got to it. I've been done in a long time. I think like your hair dryer better because I always do thing I don't want water. And at the plunger I don't want it around the needle even though the cap is pretty tight and everything else. I still you know you never know. But that's why like I don't I've never told people like do the water thing because for that very reason you know because I don't trust them I trust myself you know or take the risk but I don't want it. Yeah tell somebody else to do it. And I've done it for quite a while and I don't have any like any I haven't tested for high arsenic levels or high floor like I'm injecting fluoride from tap water or something like that. Yeah. All right how about this one? Michael says uh thoughts on PPC 1-57 and TB-500 together for plantar fasciitis um had it for seven years and been through several doctors and PT's nothing else has worked. Absolutely I would use it but I would actually look at your footwear because I was having really bad plantar fasciitis for like maybe not at seven years but maybe I had a good like six months stretch and then I went and saw a PT that recommended I get these like dorky ass a6 like old white guy walking shoes and that's what I this is when I was still working the floor on you know working the gym you know 10 hours a day or whatever and honestly it cured it within like four days I feel like I had relief within four days just by wearing these like particular a6 so my point is is that you gotta get your foot mapped and I think you gotta get the right either in-sole or the right type of shoe for your foot. I like the sense of that. I don't know what the question was because I was distracted by conversation that was outside of this podcast. Well I'll say this so plantar fasciitis I think that BPC TB would be a temporary solution that if the foot improving your footwear could potentially be like an actual potential fix you know what I mean. Do you agree that the footwear is far more important than a lot of people give credit whether you're tining legs whether you're doing cardio even on your feet at work and things like that if you're like an e-r nurse near on your feet for 12 hours these things are but I always use that example though I don't know why but anyway vitally important and I think a lot of people pick their shoes based on how they how cool they look. Yeah I decided not to do that but I've always gotten like these I always there was certain certain I like to the old Metcons like Metcons and I turn around can we all agree they just look like crap they just don't like they're going like modern alien looking weird stuff I went literally looking yesterday and like I'm not gonna buy any of this this is horrible horrible stuff. Yeah I bought some brooks they're like super basic black shoe with black sole brooks and they're comfortable as hell like I put them on I didn't have to get used to them my foot's not like falling off the side because it's too big for the Nike's and stuff like that you know I'm wearing most of the time I'm wearing these shoes I got off Timo dot com you know like if that I would like to do their 10 bucks and I originally got them so I'm like oh shoes that I'm just gonna play outside with the dog with I don't care if they get dirty and I'll beat up and then I'm like wearing them I'm like these actually feel really good and they're they're kind of perfect for training in and so I've been wearing them every day to the gym they're not special to just all black but they're 10 dollar shoes so all you guys out there with $250 Jordan's eat it. We need Dr Joe on here he's a podiatrist and he's always got something to say he hates my crocs for instance because Ron and Dusty give me crap about having crocs it it's like my slippers you know around the house and and he said like people who are wearing crocs all the time that's like the worst thing for your foot basically really yeah one of the common questions we get asked by you guys is what would you do differently with your body building if you could go back in time given all the experience and education I have today there's a number of things that I would have done differently one of them is that I would have started using college and sooner college it is one of the few supplements that will actually rebuild connective tissue it took me tearing my super spinatus in 2021 to get with the program I use true nutrition's hydrolyzed beef collagen I get the unflavered version I pay for it myself just like you guys do I use 20 grams a day makes it into my coffee it's totally unflavered you don't even taste it plus I use 10 grams of their micronized creatin. Creatin has been shown to improve brain health especially for the aging brain I need that and of course you know we've always know about the muscle building effects so this is my morning routine every day and I'm encouraging you guys to do the same. Use our code thank for savings plus it's the only way for them to know that this advertising is being heard otherwise they just think you're some random dude that click that an ad. I want to point out because it looks like I think it's step in I don't know if I'm saying that correctly I'm sorry if I botched it but he says guys turn pro and then never compete again and it's strange and honestly it's not that strange because turning pro and being good and competitive on the pro level are two very completely different things like you can squeak by and get a pro card especially if you're like a light heavy or even like a heavyweight well if you maxed out your body building progress is a heavyweight that you know little under two 25 what you're going to get on stage as an open at like 230 maybe and you're going against guys today that like the average weights like 250 to 55 for these guys on stage now and they're still looking pretty so it's not that weird that guys don't continue to compete after they turn pro because for a lot of them the goal is to make it to that pro status and then to say hey I've got this next stage of life that I'm trying to get to whether it's family business work and just knowing that like you're not going to be competitive and you open like I squeak by and got a master's pro card right as a super heavyweight I had maxed out all the muscle like it probably put on you know there that for the compounds I was willing to take and how much I was willing put into it there's the way I'm going to go stand next to you know theoretically a big ramen you know like are you serious you know I mean or even like a very low level but good pro like people are realistic I should say if you turn pro usually you're very realistic about what your successful chances are and I don't you know just credit anyone for saying hey I did my thing I got my pro card I'm yeah hey yeah it's a little bit stressful yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah very generous a good example exactly well that too and he's like you know what I got to the finish line I have no mad respect exactly exactly I got one from the from the questions from last week and it's one I can actually throw up on the screen here skip that 90 gram postworkout shake interested talking about it do you have your clients doing this same thing and then open up to all three of us what is the the highest you take someone's protein per meal yeah I was just using the 90 gram when I say 90 gram 90 grams a protein just as an example of if I have the other meals that 60 grams a protein that I would increase it by 50% postworkout so as an example if I you know I might be doing 50 grams per meal and my postworkout might be 75 grams it's typically not the number it's a 50% increase usually for the vast majority of my clients not straight across the board nothing's ever straight across the board you know with anything that we do but I would say certainly the majority of the time and if I have to cut it back then I'll cut it back but it typically will be like that the large majority of the time yeah if you know I wait I don't know how you guys do it I wait out my powder I don't go by scoops and it's just something that the scoops are close but once you start to get into you know like a postworkout that's 120 grams of protein powder that's not going to come out exactly with the scoop ratio or the scoop measure that's not going to work very well and it's a lot of it's a lot of protein powder it's quite a it's quite a drink I can't really say yeah I can't really say that I have like a protein requirement like anything it depends right like if if someone comes to you and they're eating a lot of protein and you think it's helping them then we'll probably do it or maybe a little bit more I had a guy this year though that was eating and he's a big boy you know 280 we've got him up to like 305 now before we started his prep and he was eating something like four 20 now like it was like 480 or 490 grams of protein a day right but his carbs were like 120 grams a day and I'm like there's a distribution that's just not working there and it was in his off season so my first move was to easily pull 100 grams of protein and add in 150 grams of carbs and yeah that's his conditioning stayed the same if not got better while we pushed him up to you know we added an extra 25 pounds to his frame before we started his prep he's probably was easier to eat for him too you know what I mean that's a lot of guy I mean we've had um um who do we have on was it dusty or who we have on they're telling us that who worked with Chad Ron big Ron sorry big Ron and he was telling us about how you know Chad had a meeting 12 ounce protein portions six or seven times a day that's just not feasible long term I mean I don't I don't think people can really visualise or do it unless they've tried it to put 12 ounces of protein on a plate and then another you know 300 grams of rice and then to repeat that two and a half hours later and repeated again two and a half hours later like most people would tap out after that first day or they wouldn't even get to that six meal so the diet has to be feasible like the diet has to be obviously we're pushing things we're challenging people with food but like the diet has to be something that someone can adhere to regularly to continue to see progress if you write this ridiculous plan with with 500 grams of protein and it's just not something someone can stick with and they're not going to make the progress they're going to move on to a different coach yeah and if it's a short term you know if it's for a period of time and it's just a phase to you know change up the diet and everything else cool but you I can completely agree with you I would not want to be my digestive tract I would not want to you around me quite frankly if I was going to put down that amount of protein I think there's also tell me what you guys think of this I think there's also this this idea that when you're getting lean oh I can't cut my protein because you know I'm going to lose muscle something you're taking in too much protein and you get those ratios on the wax that's protein stuff and the carbs are real low you gotta look look put it pull some protein for you yeah I mean just pull it and see what happens you'll be surprised no one's going to walk away losing a bunch of muscle now yeah now I find that's actually a great move with women like if they're eating somewhere in the 160 grams of protein and they're dieted they're just stuck and they can't lose often times we'll literally pull 30 grams of protein out and replace it with 30 or 40 grams of carbs and just what they start to get some movement on the on the scale oh yeah you know I have a client that two things one is the when come all met um uh Chris Aseto that was the first thing Chris told him Chris what I don't even think they're working together but Chris looked at his diet and he said I'll you're eating too much protein pull that back and he pulled it back in all of a sudden he just started getting peeled you know there the match made in heaven from there but um I have a client who had a genetic kidney issue kidney disease basically growing up so and he needs to be and he came to me like not doing a bodybuilder diet at all okay so me like now trying to get him out of bodybuilding diet I'm terrified of adding too much protein with somebody who has kidney issues but he sees he sees his kidney doctor a couple times a year and he's doing blood work he can like threw out consistently and we've slowly increased the protein over time but I was surprised to see how much progress he could make with much lower protein than I would have put anybody on it was actually like a cool experiment for me to get to see this where we're doing like four ounce portions you know five times a day and I'm like oh wow and we're still we're still growing and then guess what we reached a point where we wanted to then tighten up later and it was so much easier to tighten them up when the protein was already lower than I would have traditionally gone with anybody before yep 100% must be half here we got a bunch of stuff I saw one that was about to grab but I guess I'll just hit this button because I how about this one um um arbs what do you guys think about tell me certain in terms of reducing blood pressure how long should it be taken to notice the first effects I think it's overrated do I do for blood pressure and I think that's why I think the industry gave it too much credit at first and it became popular but I think it's remaining popular more because of the positive effects on the left ventricular size I know that's why I keep it in and I only run it at 80 milligrams but if I have I admit I don't have you know high pressure issues if I did I would be going to something else I have not split my dramatic impact on blood pressure it'll impact it but it's not it's not it's not it's dramatic or is impressive as I thought what do you guys think I would say it's 50 50 out of it really works versus if it kind of works um and I would also say that it usually takes like two two and a half maybe even three weeks before you start to see the blood pressure number really start going down it's not like you take a dose and then you go check your blood pressure next morning it's not like a beta block and it's not like a beta blocker but also to touch on the point I think it's it's stood the test the time in our industry because it doesn't really have a lot of negative side effects that some of the other compounds that we would use like beta blockers or whatever else to lower blood pressure does and it has other benefits you know helping with your blood sugar helping with insulin sensitivity so I do think I guess I just haven't really seen negatives with it yet so and I'm sure some point some point we might you know we might find oh it's leading to this or oh it's doing that but I mean I think a bodybuilding group is a great population because when we find out about something everybody jumps on it and everyone starts taking it and so we have a pretty good quote unquote clinical trial going on right now and I feel like it's been around four maybe getting to five years now so I think we're going to be able to see if it stands a test of time but careful when you careful when you label this is science though because we're going to be reminded by at least a few of these pounds that up up in the you know the troll the YouTube that this is pseudo science it doesn't matter which you know we we do these experiments on you know for long periods of time on our selves and our clients have seen the data if you will sorry I'm loosely I'm trying to you know that's why I did the air quotes which I guess you can see that it's already sorry to I'm upset you about this kit but we don't have a lot of trolls that join our shows in fact you've got a bunch of really cool people hanging with us now don't definitely have the show no definitely I'm talking about the comments afterwards though when the video is posted they can you know skip the lovers come out of the woodwork sometimes I can't take it I can't take tell Miss Art and I tried and I I'm a weird person just flat out my body is super strange and I I couldn't handle it I started it one twenty yeah I started it I thought you were just going to brush up that sorry yeah yeah I started it at twenty and I didn't really notice much of anything so I went higher I figured I'd start with the lowest those possible right went to forty and I started noticing just like everything was like my ability to feel anything emotionally was just like going away like my interest in life was just going away my interest to communicate with people was going away my wife noticed it right so I stopped it and I felt just kind of crappy too I felt like something to my body was wrong and I felt very lethargic blood pressure was fine so I'm not seeing any changes there I stopped taking it and then I come back and I was like well you know what I really want this to work so I started it again just at twenty and a few days I started noticing it at a lower level this time like it was probably happening the first time but I didn't notice it you know what I mean but just the twenty I was running as I had it doesn't I'm not feeling good I'm feeling for so I've got three bottles of it sitting behind me yeah I can't give that away so anyway I got three bottles of it that I can't use now yeah but I've only talked to one other person that had an issue that was like that but everybody else seems to be doing great I have a weird thing with certain medications I think that like my side of kinds are different I'm I'm planning to get some genetic testing to see how I process stuff because it's not normal it's interesting let's see it's took my injection last night I warmed it up under the faucet easy injection how about that's good should I cycle my carbs when bulking or just hammer the carbs I had to say it that way what are the benefits and disadvantages of both I think we just kind of talked about carbs cycling and the last episode didn't mean yeah yeah I definitely watched that episode yeah what else do we have here do you guys see anything that came up let me look over it or other questions because I think I'm missing some remember there was the life insurance one too though oh yeah yeah let's go to that let's go to that so we we had a good friend that is look interesting getting life insurance he uses P. D's I know he's not a competitor any longer he used to compete and you know he's concerned because he does use some level of gear when I say some level of a it's a level of gear I think he's doing like TIRT plus at this stage of life what do you think skip I know you've had experience with this yeah I am my quick little story was I got my in-run round of 04 03 something like that and I was speaking with my brokers right after shell because I wanted to be as lean as possible so that my BMI was because you get different tears for you know basically what you're your payment is going to be and I wanted to get it as good as I could but I told him I said you know I will have some things in how extensive is the blood and urine and everything else and he said it's pretty extensive but if you let them know what you're doing you know as far as supplements and everything else they take out any consideration so I waited a few weeks for you know gear to kind of you know start to come out and I listed everything and they did my blood and they they just literally did not they didn't even give me a crappy tier or a big payment they just denied me and I was like that sucks so I'm like you didn't tell me the truth here like I went with what you told me to do so I spoke with him and I said listen you need to beg them give to give me four weeks and I want to redo and they said they wouldn't because nothing could change I could and I said just do just just give me the four weeks so I ate like crap which is a normal person I made sure I was hydrated I took none of my OTC supplements and was already obviously I had another four weeks coming off the show for you know gear to clear and I kept my portions low so my BMI I might wait with stay low so my BMI was good and I got tier two payment you know level and got into a really good life insurance policy pretty pretty good size one with a pretty good payment you have to be very careful to make sure that you have it's it's just so important and they will deny you for even sometimes OTC supplements so you need to be very careful and this has been a while doing any wrong I would assume that the testing is even more significant and more advanced now you know if you tell them you're not taking nicotine and they take a hair they'll catch that like from four months ago or five months ago and yeah and you deal because of course there's you know they assume that you're smoking but still even if you're not you know like with myself with a nicotine salt it's not tobacco it's just nicotine salt but it is if I were to take a test for that then they would assume naturally up he's a candidate for heart disease or mouth cancer or whatever form that he's using when that's not specifically my case but it I could be denied for that yeah very very care because it's I mean life insurance isn't just a really it's not about you it's about your family it's about your kids it's about your wife and it's a it's a big deal and I was glad that I did it when I did because I was in my young my early 30s and I had to actually check my term because we're going to buy house in the next couple years and I thought wait a minute what if I what if my term is coming do and it's funny because I've never bought a house and had to think oh when is my life insurance do you're going to die now person yeah it's very old person we consider like I might die I'm going to make sure my wife can you know it's going to get paid out yeah you got anything on that one Andrew it's not really my specialty honestly I mean I I would just detox off everything and become a normal average person do tons of cardio make sure my living enzymes are doing makes just make sure my blood work was perfect and yeah I'm not going to do a basic rudimentary you know see the neck and a go digging and they're not going to test you for gear yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so what I would do I would do cardio to make sure my blood pressure was gray and I would just do all the things to make sure yours I'm things we should be doing anyway honestly but I would just make sure that I'm not using any compounds that would affect those things that would make my blood pressure higher or you know affect if they do a full CBC my liver enzymes or my HDL cholesterol friends my LDL cholesterol I would just make sure I was in as good you know blood work shape as I could be yep yeah I'd go with that and I think like I couldn't I was looking for questions skip but did you mention anything about like BMI because I think they still go by that as well oh they they absolutely they always will that's stupid benefit to do that it is stupid but it is to their benefit to do that oh and it's just like they're like we don't really care we just want to charge you as much as possible because you know we're gonna have to pay out on some of these yeah yeah yeah if you guys do you know what your BMI is like where you're at or what range you're in because I at last I checked I was more of a Leo B still yeah what I'm I am I am obese but when I'm in the off season I am more of a Leo B's but I'm not you know I've said a many times before I'm not big and I'm just not your bigger than yeah I'm not an average size body builder I'm not a bigger like I walk around the oh my god he's huge that doesn't happen yeah just to you're in a string tank top I would like that picture you post the other day and then everyone's just right you get a good idea where to where to where to that come from yeah all right I think this one isn't gonna be as exciting as a body by burns once it to be but so maybe we should maybe we should come up with like a second version of this question but he says what are your favorite foods for carbing up before walking on stage I mean honestly I kind of look clients tell me what they like but if you're asking me personally it was either nutrient bars rice crispy treats with peanut butter and salt I think that was usually it and if we're talking about like right before going on stage they did that that's what it was but up to that point typically it was just your typical breakfast of chicken and rice before you know two meals of that before you know on showday and even like though for a lot of people sometimes I won't have me at anything until they do just that backstage carb up because I want their stomach to be as flat as possible and it's like if you if you didn't have to suffer to make weight like you just walked in and you made weight there's not a lot of carbing up that needs to do to happen I know a lot of newer clients or newer body builders think that there has to be this like magic you know that they're gonna sometimes like look 200% better and it's like what what we're bringing is probably what you looked like last Saturday just a little bit drier maybe 5% fuller and a tan you know like you're not gonna walk out there looking like Ronnie Coleman I'm sorry you know but because you ate the right thing yeah yeah like we we can't transmogify you like in like you know five minutes or even two days I like I love that reference that's a count as an absolute factor thanks I think I've seen you use it a bunch too I do I have tried to transmogify programs you know that's right yeah for nine competitor yeah nine competitors but um because I'm a die hard-given up span anyway I think that the distinction is a good point and it's actually something that I've had to do and will actually do if I ever get back on stage as I'm gonna have to be very very limited in the amount of food that I take in but in the past something that always worked really well you just have to make sure that it's not too much is the McDonald's sausage egg and cheese biscuit because and my thing is more it's not about like needing a bunch of carbs it's the combination of there's some carbs there's a bunch of fat and there's a bunch of sodium and sodium if anything will have much of an impact on you's very very quickly especially for vascularity which can give the impression that you're a little bit drier than you know and you will get a little bit drier but it's not gonna be dramatic in an hour it's something like that the problem with that is it's individual because you never want to put something in your your system that you're not gonna tolerate very well so you know if you have some type of glutinous if you have some type of just a lack of tolerance for that specific food it can make the the show kind of rough and not very not very fine. Don't be run into the bathroom every five minutes. Right exactly exactly you go out on stage and you turn around to a back double buying you go up you just took a shit like an hour ago because I can see the toilet running on with hamstrings you know what I mean so no it's not a very good look I do get a kick out of and I know this is cheap because I don't like to you know talk down about other trainers but it is funny when I because we all see the shows you're like you know they'll be looking at them like yeah eat half a banana and then they eat it and they come back 10 minutes so you know oh that did the trick. Yeah you know you're pretending that you have an eye for something that you just don't nothing was changed in the last 10 minutes and you're gonna give yourself an hour there's not gonna even an hour and there's not gonna be much of a change that is gonna be obvious now it could be something that you noticed that is subtle but believe me when I say the judges are gonna go oh yeah oh yeah he's on he wasn't an hour and a half no yeah it's just a silly thing and I appreciate that you're feeding a client that confidence but it's kind of a it's a bit of a lie well to your point though because because you just said the timeframe right like nothing you're gonna do in this 30 minutes or an hour is gonna make that much of a difference but how many times do we see guys that come out for the morning show and look vastly different better or worse for the night show because they've had and some of that's obviously the stress and the cortisol going down because you did the thing already and now you're just out there for fun etc but oftentimes it's because good coaches they're like okay we have this look now let's play a little bit and see do we need to get you fuller do we need to so then they can use that information for two weeks later when you compete again okay we just need to move this timeframe back about eight hours in terms of what we're feeding you so I think you know yeah I think that's that's the way to do it yeah and I completely agree and here's a lot of thing too if you're listening to this near competitor and you go oh I'm not in the running you know after pre-judging or you know I'm not gonna win this show and you know all the judging is over please don't think that going out and throwing down a bunch of food because you're like oh it doesn't matter anyway it may not matter to you but it does to your trainer because your trainer wants to know if you can get fuller if you can get drier if you're gonna spill we a lot of times it's like okay there's a lot to learn between pre-jet for the trainer stamp and for the competitor too but the trainer wants to learn what can we what how are you gonna respond to these changes before the night show that can be huge huge invaluable information for the next time you get on stage so don't just dismiss the afternoon and be like oh I'm not gonna eat it I don't feel or now the one thing that will make a huge change is fluid you want to see a change in 15 or 20 minutes change your fluid into increase your fluid intake because sometimes a lot of people have enough food in them but they don't have enough fluid and as soon as you put that fluid I'm here like oh my god like this is this is dramatic this is changing quickly yeah yeah we had a question about supplements for crones oh and I also wanted to mention I remember being backstage one time at a state show and this guy what we're pumping up for the night show and he's like oh yeah I knew I wasn't gonna do anything so I had a burger in three beers put the man's in putting down three beers I know yeah I don't know the set it from beer we should have Jose Raymond on because when he got his last pro card because he got like three of them basically when he was last one he was pissed drunk like him and our other buddy Matt Puglia went out the night before just have a drink to dry out like like a lot of people do a glass wine or you know like I was like I like to do a shot of vodka because I didn't use a lot of dioretics and whatnot but he won drink turned into two two turned into four four turned into them stumbling into the bedroom and four clocking the morning and he told me the story he walks out there and gets under the lights and was like but he was bone dry and he was I mean Jose Jose man he's he's got one of the wackiest physique you'll ever look at with the straight yeah he does he just hands down you know one of the best athletes out there so rest of us would look like shit and embarrass ourselves yeah I can see like I'm just gonna get hammered I can see like a family guy uh skid of this where he's out there posing and it's like what he thinks is actually happening versus what's actually happening. All right so Crohn's in Supplements for Crohn's or anything we can think of that could be beneficial. I would say more than Supplements it's food choices yeah you need to find yeah you need to eliminate the foods that don't work from you and just because what I find is this people with Crohn's we get their diet set and then whether it's for a free meal or when they have some variety of variability they pick a food choice that they know when the past hasn't worked for them and it sets them back for like four to six days because their stomach is just so it just means you got to take that food and put it on the shelf and literally lock it up never go back to that food again but in terms of supplements you know it's hard to say because is it an issue with like is the mecocial lining is that the issue okay aloe vera glutamine zincel carnazine stuff like that oftentimes you know a lot of times we see people with Crohn's they have very low levels of B12 animals of iron low levels of vitamin D calcium so that's where doing lab work and looking at those values that might not necessarily be attributed to Crohn's because I find a lot of gastroenterologists don't pay attention to that kind of stuff making sure they're not deficient in those nutrients and then potassium magnesium zinc like you gotta have good levels of those beyond that you know it's dealing with flare-ups you know that's what stands out on the blood what stands out in the blood panel if you're B12 as well would depend so like several things I mean you're you're you're already W could be high you're you're which is your red blood cell distribution with I mean there's several values but which one are you going with MCH okay yeah so so right on your CBC that one is like just right there in your face and where did I you know where I picked that up Scott we were sitting there talking when it's with when Serano and I was like oh hold on a second and because I did not make that connection he was matter of fact it should be right there at 90 and if there's a boar yeah if there's a big variance there then that's a that is a 100% B12 issue that's like oh yeah your MCH is low and your RDH is high you can 100% attribute that that to B12 being an issue if your RDW is low it's actually not a bad thing I mean you have very uniform blood cells so you know you don't bring B12 into the mix but honestly you gotta have the right it's kind of like making a soup right you gotta have the right combination of like your vitamin B your vitamin D like all these things they it works synergistically with the others they help your thyroid if your thyroid's in dysfunction that could lead to digestive issues so there's just so many moving parts and that's where I think trainers and coaches are getting a lot better today at understanding that relationship versus just being like well your labs look pretty good but there's some things that are low on here but I don't really know what that means so I don't know what I think what I think something that trainers getting better at too is understanding that blood work is a puzzle it's not oh this is at a range oh yeah that's at a range too it's looking at how it all fits together and sometimes there may be added components that are not at a range but they're close to being at a range that need to be factored into because it all fits together and you go oh this is what I see and I know I've done that myself over the years where I see connections and things so it's bigger than just whether there's a flag or not you have to fit it all together absolutely what about uh where was this one what do you guys have thoughts on I think we might have talked about this yeah I believe we did super draw for the last week of prep we did that whole thing on orals yeah so I think the Casey Schloss back and check that one out uh Gamboni Law he says great show guys uh any thoughts on work or life stress affecting calorie expenditure even if amounts remain the same I feel like stress increases expenditure and stress in strength decreases okay yeah stress increases expenditure and strength decreases thoughts I think you can go both ways though yeah and also ruin your appetite but it can also get you amped up and hyped up too so I think I think it's more dependent on the person and the stress level and just the how the how the what the entire situation looks like and I've seen uh boys lean he's certainly pictures we're talking about body fat level he's in oh get Gamboni Law who is that what's his first name do I do I know him? why can I um zilfer he's yeah he follows us on Facebook I always know him as Gamboni Law yeah okay it's and it's bad that I can't then I can get the name off um is he a lawyer or yeah and off yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah good good thought yeah he's a lawyer yeah yeah um no I mean stress can absolutely decrease your clerk expenditure because when you let's say your liver stress right well what happens then you're getting more t-vo-t-vo-t-vork converting to reverse t-3 so you have less t-3 so your metabolism is drop completely and females this is like one of the main reasons why they just stall out all the time you know like cortisol goes up cortisol is made from a steals from progesterone so progesterone's are tanked they're in a state of estrogen dominance their liver gets clogged and then they're having less of a metabolism boost because they're making or they're converting less t-4 to t-3 on top of that they're having digestive issues typically when people have digestive issues they're having lower caloric expenditure as well so it's it's kind of like a merry-go-rounder problems there's not like one cause it's like there's like these things and there's all these different entries onto the ride and trying to think out of finish this little metaphor you kind of got to just grease the wheels and you know if something's wrong over here it can be affected that it's like anything with with what we do you know we're just talking about the blood work thing it's very similar to that but I find that stressful more often than not decrease caloric expenditure versus increase it you what he might be thinking is that he can eat more calories when he's stressed but that might be because it's running through him because his gut is yeah his gut is just pushing it and he probably going to the bathroom more I use the analogy of the 440 or even in 80 versus like a steeple chase is a called a steeple chase when they have to jump over you heard all then they have to jump over a little pond or a puddle or you know all these things point is you have yeah all these hurdles it takes you longer to get to the finish line and you just running with no obstacles in front of you it's a far more efficient process when you can eliminate those those guys what are these messages that you sent me injure these are just questions like some of the things I saw on the side here that I pulled out and sent out okay I already done one or two of them we've done one or two of them okay I didn't see for Michael Devereau do you think that Ronnie was the cause of a lot of physique imbalances and injuries today because people tried to train do you think that was the okay I said he said was the cause of a lot of injuries and imbalances today because people tried to train the way that he did especially in the back department what do you think I'm assuming Ronnie Coleman my answer you guys already know it he didn't cause any problems the anybody who trained incorrectly or poorly or too heavy whether it was influenced by Ronnie Coleman that's and that's on them that's just yeah but let's see let's use an example of your your college kid you just got exposed to bodybuilding and you ran into your first Ronnie Coleman the cost of redemption tape and you see him slang and weight right or even here's a better example someone like Branch Warren I think it branch too so I think I'm okay that's I just got to move weight you know like every kid everybody back then Andrew you know everybody back then was slamming weights around just like right whether it was good for their bodies or not we just have to try to do you know I did the same thing so what I'm saying is when that's the when he's the best bodybuilder so you want to look at who's who's the best and how do they do it I think I think Michael's point is I think he agrees with us too is that Ronnie could have contributed to a lot of guys who don't have his genetic capabilities training in a certain way that might have held themselves back whether his creatinization counts as that kind of thing I can agree that there is certainly an influence there's no question I'm just saying I don't want to blame Ronnie for poor mechanics or he's too heavy away that's all you can also say the alternative though that Ronnie hyped a lot of people up to try some things that they wouldn't have normally tried yeah yeah that's true too you can't keep working a lot lunges what happened had it not been for Ronnie Coleman seriously how about we get a couple more and I've got some too from the previous episode so I don't want to leave those guys out oh this one was for me I think kind of he says hey Scott he says the first video that I ever had listened to from your channel you were talking about prison and jail workouts and interviewing a guy who had been to prison can you go over any of that episode and why you may have done it I just thought it was a good idea like at the time because I was fascinated by I was trying to think of ideas I was doing this like advices radio it was called like advices stories and each one was a different topic and on that episode I had like three guys four guys that had been to prison John Romano was one of them and I would have done it differently today if then then how I did it before because I put John at the end because it was like the grand finale now I would have led with John you know what I mean versus seven he sits through 45 minutes of one guy told his story about how he found protein sources in prison another guy told his story of how he did his training another guy had a story of seeing seeing a dude like his training partner he said he was training with these two younger guys and he has like these two younger guys that you know they they just come in and they were in a gang and he's like you know and I didn't want to get messed up with gangs but I figured you know they want to train with me we're in the gym we can train together one day I come in and it's back day and they're just over here like just doing something different they're like curling and just standing around I'm thinking of myself whatever you guys do whatever you're gonna do I got a train back he said 30 seconds later somebody else walked in and the two guys went over and just started shanking that hell out of this fourth guy I mean it was like oh so they were yeah they were waiting for him he was like you don't want to get tired out they want to be a little yeah yeah they were they were not trained and they were just pretending to be there you know well I'm gonna shank somebody I want to do it with a pump I want to look good well I usually get my pump while I'm shanking you know what I mean but it was it was a fun it was a fun episode I did that one I did one about eating disorders and people talking about like disorder eating a bodybuilding we had a doctor bodybuilding yeah bodybuilding general yeah yeah we had a yeah we had a doctor on there we had people who had needing disorder we talked about like the disorder eating the happens in the sport um we did a bunch of cool little stories it was more like an NPR type like uh expose what's that woman that goes she gets embedded with these different groups like she got embedded with like the Mexican cartels she got she oh yeah yeah she's been on broken and she's gotten bedded with like um I don't think she did like sex traffickers but she got she gets into like these fringe groups and then like somehow she gains their confidence keeps them their their faces and names you know very anonymous but gets as real as the story as you possibly can yeah it sounds like it's kind of like those little exposés yeah yeah yeah was it are you thinking of the um the not trafficked is that the the show you're thinking of that's it I think that's it that was a good one that was a good one you know what I'll tell you what I'm gonna be completely honest when I started bodybuilding you know I came from the world of photography right and I left photography and I just was like I don't know what I'm gonna do now like this is what I went to school for this is what I've done all my life like art and I'm like I'm not gonna do that anymore I just lost the interest and I got clean and then I started lifting and when I started getting into it I'm still on the outside I'm not part of bodybuilding yet I'm just a guy who likes exercising now and I thought to myself I want to get involved in the sport to the point where I can start documenting it one day where I can infiltrate bodybuilding and be a part of it and then show other people what it's like and I kind of feel like it's kind of come true in a way you know what I mean yeah no for sure for sure yeah those are good times sure I'm really excited that he that he went all the way back that far you know what I mean it's been a long time it was like 2016 that show came out would you find Andrew so I see your does Andrew still recommend the fog map diet so I think someone might have seen like maybe one of my detox recovery plans because I do recommend highly when if there's digestive issues going on or we're in a detox phase or even a lot of times post show where I want to get digestion work in a hundred percent again I will put them on a very low-fod map plan and really you know will pull away explain everything for anybody that doesn't know what low-fod map is yeah honestly all the foods are listed if you go to www.ibsdietz.com I think it is there's all the guys who put the WWE WWE in okay why is this HTTP that's why that's why that'll be www um no so you know greens good red is bad but you know basically fod maps are you know for the fructo oligo malto saccharides I think I said all that right but they're particularly type of carbohydrate source that long story short they're not good for your gut not good for your bacteria necessarily yeah that's it okay and so you know my version of it is look it's closer to more like the Mediterranean diet but we're gonna pull you know dairy and way products you know we're gonna pull caffeine we're gonna pull all the foods on that list like for example there's a lot of fruits you can't have you know like bright bananas or uh certain certain types of not nuts certain types of vegetables you can't have a lot of the process foods that you certain weeks you can't have you can like for instance if we're doing bread you can do a sourdough bread but you can't do most of the commercial breads that are out there so anyway the idea here is to reduce that population or that that food group to reduce you know poor gut populations and to eliminate digestive stress more less yeah like the green list here that those are all the vegetables you can have it's still a really large list it's not like you're stuck eating chicken spinach and just rice you know which is what honestly most body builders are eating anyway right so it actually and during that time frame I actually have people increase their variety of foods usually so I give normally I give like macros I might give them guidelines but I give them like macros really and they can pick and choose the foods they eat um during this time period because we might stumble upon a food that they just digest really well that I hadn't thought of using before you know oh you can eat kangaroo oh yeah yeah yeah but but but you know the main take home is that like most body building diets are almost completely fond map like to begin with you know unless you're eating like like white bread toast several meals a day or you know some of the fruits that we're talking about like certain apples certain certain bananas and stuff but overall you know you're just trying to eliminate that portion of carbohydrate from the diet yeah how about this one question for the next show how would you set up an effective mini cut currently six weeks on tier T weighing 97 kilograms what to do a mini cut for six to eight weeks to drop to about 90 92 kilograms during this period staying on tier T and trying to maximize insulin sensitivity I don't know I mean it depends what do you eat right now yes right exactly I mean it's I mean like any coach and anyone that says okay eat these five or six meals with that limited information they're they're what you call it a cut and pace coach right so like we need to see what you're eating are you eating you know 150 grams of carbs a day and 300 grams of protein or are you eating 100 grams of protein and 400 grams of carbs and having you know two or three cheat meals a day first up might literally just beat it eliminate some of your free meals right off the bat you know and you're gonna get a really good bird boost right there so like anything we always say this and it's annoying but it's true it completely depends yeah yeah just like if you're gonna start to die at period right like if you're in an offseason and then you're it's because that's pretty much what you're doing right like I mean that's what a mini cut is it's not anything different at least it's not for me at least yeah I mean I think a lot of us now like we build the mini cut into the regular diet in a sense of we don't we just don't ever want you to lose insulin sensitivity so yeah you know we might you do it like I'll typically do something like two weeks higher one week pulling back you know just in a cyclical fashion and that might be okay on that pulling back week we're gonna pull 75 to 100 grams of carbs out depending on what meal it is or meals those are and we get that response there where from track in their blood sugar okay we were creeping up to 92 now we're back down to 84 85 right another two to three weeks high and then we'll just kind of repeat that process over and over again we got a fun one here and I think this comes from us talking about the advice of stories and by the way prank no stories was not with David Johnston he wasn't in that that was a different program that was beyond driven radio with David Johnston how about this one top convicted bodybuilders of all times we're killed for a kid who or till fox or till fox oh true that one was always that one was always there was always some questions with that though but I agree yeah that's true what was the story again did he I think he murdered his his his girlfriend and her mother yeah yeah but yeah but I think there was some shady dealings with the police involved with that so like do I think he did it yeah but like I don't know there's I remember reading in the flex magazines back in a day and then this and that and just like this isn't a clear cut case I don't but I never came ever wrong you only maybe what four or five years ago and I was fascinated by some of the things that didn't come out years ago about it and I was like wow there might be more to this than what's right here on the surface but great tightest he's up there I mean you know we stopped growing the trunk burnt the car it was he just he ate that and and oh yeah she obviously got trouble she's in touch with but I don't she got she got she had out of like two or three years yeah she was she didn't spend very much time he took the bulk of that and he's in for I think ever and ever had a lawyer right I mean I'm sure he's up for parole probably in the next ten years but because of what it was 15 years ago maybe oh and let's not forget he mentioned the next one too the killer selling oh yeah other Sally exactly selling me oh yeah and that was a big one to me because that was so long ago I mean that was just like oh my oh my god he got to be kidding me what was that early 90s I mean I was barely twenty twenty one twenty two years old I think about that one two is it's like wait a minute like he repeatedly beat her and raped her and and all this other shit oh well it's okay he has right now her yes he assaulted her and she depends herself she has enough and he comes to beat her and assault her again and she's had enough like to me that's like standard ground like yeah she was within her rights you know what even if he wasn't coming to beat her on that very moment there was enough pen up shit stuff there that and he was gonna do it again eventually I think she should be completely exonerated I don't know why she spends so much time in jail honestly I don't know either I know I had the question watching it and you never know how accurate the documentary really is I assume it is yeah I don't know any better I wondered it seemed to me that there was some a little bit below the surface there was quite a bit of jealousy that it might have even been and I'm reaching when I say this but that it might have been like you know what you're just not gonna leave me like this is not gonna happen but you know I don't know yeah I wouldn't know yeah Dave Crosslands on that list he's not a not famous bodybuilders but Dave's on that list he's told the whole story he was a fugitive from the law he was he was in Spain and like fleeing the country he was in he wasn't he lived in Canada for a while but when he was he was in Spain and he had a story of like he thought that the jig was up that this is it and that he was going to jail they had him get out of the car and they saw a kid there was like a handle to a weapon underneath the seat and they like got him out of the car they had they weren't speaking English they refused to even though he's like I knew they would speaking English and they like hands and everything up and you know down on the floor on the ground all that cuffed him up and then they pulled it out it was a kid's toy like club and that's the reason and they knew nothing about him and they let him go but yeah that was really history Dave Plumbo he's another one who was addicted he did some time and a lot a lot of people john did as well john remodel he was on the show told us whole story yeah absolutely absolutely absolutely yeah I thought I had something here oh I lost it completely lost it I saw one and it was gonna grab um oh Kelly spent nine years in prison that's what it does he just sounds right yeah that story was probably the biggest one out of like our era you know yeah oh man that I mean that that made like fox yeah and that was I mean they were just they were like yeah we're out had to talk I get the fun the hardest I mean it is important I get my done every two weeks but if I was on the lamb I don't know if I'd do them uh skip one or you come back to Colorado that was a question oh yeah I don't have any family in Colorado anymore I had to have you know friends some good friends but we travel we go to Milwaukee and I would feel guilty going to Colorado when I could go to Milwaukee and city kids so our trips are almost exclusively to Milwaukee these days but I would love to get back out there I do miss it it's beautiful and the food and everything is it's it's it's great I do miss it not enough to go back but I do miss it very fine memories of Colorado speaking of Colorado did you guys see uh the documentary uh breaking Olympia yet not yet not yet it's worth it it's good that's what people have been telling me I want to watch it I you know while I really admired Philheese physique throughout his career I kind of thought he was a dick but yeah a lot of people did it is yeah and I don't think he helped himself during his career but you know you kind of leave with a more personal side of things and you're like you know it must be hard to be the best guy in the world going for your fourth and then your fifth and then your sticks and then you know what I mean like so it was definitely a good documentary I enjoyed it a lot it's only like the five locks and it's on the rhyme yet it's like five locks and it's done it's done by universal studio so it's a super professional it's not like a no offense generation iron type I didn't know it was out yet when did it come out it just must be just just like just like a two weeks ago or something I saw a day in Solomon promoting it you know the I debut was totally behind this whole thing too they were they were up and up so great interviews with Jay and Dexter you know all the guys from that you know coming up what's his name who's his nemesis uh that's really on now before that big guy from a big black guy with the ponytail oh okay I think said guy no Kai yeah a lot a lot of good stuff yeah I don't bicycle pose I mean come on that's kind yeah yeah my brain wasn't working for me he's down here in West for all he was he was trying to train it redcon but I don't know if he's still here anymore yeah oh skip you still doing the one week on one week off no I'm in Pratt now and everything it did work well but it didn't work as good as I thought I will tell you this though and this is important it certainly worked every bit as good from just a result standpoint not psychologically but from a result standpoint of training every week I really was surprised by that it I just didn't gain I couldn't continue to milk the freshness like I would get after training you know five six weeks maybe even seven weeks then take a week off and then come you know come back you know ridiculously strong and stuff like that so it did work but when I got into this cut phase after the first of the year I shelved it I psychologically it's a very very difficult thing to do that was a where it was an interesting experiment um have you interviewed Dave
