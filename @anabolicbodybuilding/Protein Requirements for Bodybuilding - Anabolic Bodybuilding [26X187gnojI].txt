protein requirements for bodybuilding how much protein do you really need to maximize hypertrophy for bodybuilding? This one gets a lot of people but hurt. There are a lot of different opinions and people get very passionate about their diets. Diet is almost like religion to some people and I think we need to remove ourselves from the actual bro science and mythology and diaphylosophy and keto this vegan that and look at the science and see what the science actually says. Imagine that science. So let's dig into this just a little bit. Some protein requirements. What studies say? The most recent scientific studies and I keep in mind the stuff is always evolving but now there are quite a few studies that you can find where they've actually looked at athletes and strength athletes and you know look at what protein and take actually maximize hypertrophy and it seems to be you know all the studies that I have seen have settled around 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight which works out to be about 0.77.0.8 grams per pound for those of us in America in the metric system is foreign to us. You know so that seems to be the kind of the minimum requirement for strength training athletes. Now keep in mind all these studies they don't look at guys on PEDs they're not looking at actual professional body builders but 1.7 grams per kilogram is the number that these studies seem to point to. 1.2 grams per kilogram seems to be the minimum for the general population and I would doubt that the average American is getting 1.2 grams of actual quality protein in per day. That's you know half a gram per pound of body weight I would be shocked if if they are maybe they are I think most people are living off carbs and fat. So there's another interesting thing I found a study that looked at protein overfeeding like going significantly over like 50% more than what the the requirements you know up up to almost 2 grams per pound of body weight and you know it found the body body builders this study actually looked at body builders they were natural body builders that you know they compared to the control group that was eating 1.7 and both had the same caloric intake pretty much the same you know the same quality of foods but what they you know they were all they were all eating low fat animal protein sources so same types of protein but what they found that the people that we're doing protein overfeeding actually at the end of I think it was a 12 week study had improved body composition compared to those that ate the lower protein they they had lower body fat levels they also kind of surprising in this goes to just prove the thing that a lot of vegans and stuff for our use they you're gonna die of a heart attack if you eat a lot of protein these guys these people in the study that we're eating over eating protein over consuming protein in excess actually had improved lipid markers at the end of the study their lipids got better they were better than they were for the for the control group so and they also found no deleterious effects from protein overfeeding on the blood work so that's kind of interesting I'll put the link to the study if you want to go look at it in the video description it's pretty fascinating my thoughts you know I you know the old protein overfeeding is pretty simple to explain that protein it's the thermic effect of food and your your body will spend 20 to 35% of the calories found in the protein actually just process it and your body does not want to use protein for fuel either glucodeneogenesis kind of like the last resort and it it when it does it's a costly process to convert proteins into glucose so you know protein in the sense you just end up burning off a lot of the access you know up to a third of it of the access protein they knew eat versus carbs or fat which are going to be used for energy or stored as fat carbs do have a bit of a thermic effect I think something like five to ten percent or maybe up to fifteen percent I don't recall at the top of my head but not to the same degree as protein so that likely explains the improved body composition yeah now with that said I wouldn't want to be in the bathroom when those people are eating like five six hundred grams protein are in there that's a lot of protein the digest it's really difficult for you to digest and eat that much protein I'm so applying these studies to bodybuilding like I said these studies don't factor in antibiotic you know in about steroids or performance enhancing drugs and they're effect on protein metabolism which you know if there you should be increased with with that with with anabolic series so likely you need more you know or you can take in more protein and put it to use but you know keep this in mind it doesn't take that much protein to build muscle okay so 25 grams a day of muscle protein synthesis it's 20 pounds of muscle a year now keep in mind your body's constantly turning over protein so it's a little bit misleading but you know just and you know also we'd never know when the body is going to build muscle so we need constant protein throughout the day but you know it doesn't take a lot the moral story as he doesn't take a lot you know issue is you know you know could you eat 50 grams of protein a day of build muscle maybe but there's no way you could eat that much or that little and keep steady levels of amino acids in the body throughout the day it's so that that's the issue you just never know when the body's gonna decide to build new muscle tissue so playing it safe it seems to be the kind of accepted standard now is one gram to 1.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight for enhanced body builders you know you could probably get away with that 0.8 grams per pound the 1.7 per kilogram but you know if you want to play it safe we we've established that there's no risk for eating more protein in fact it seems to improve health in body composition so let's err on the side of caution and eat a little bit more you know what's the problem there right you know at the same time we want to think of optimizing our diet you know there there is a threshold anybody who's eating over 300 grams of protein knows it is really hard eat more than that I have gone as high as 5600 before the only way I could choke down that much protein was to supplement in protein shakes I could not eat that much meat in a day it's just I'd be miserable for a lot of fucking meat so what type of protein sources do we want we want quality protein obviously things that are actually going to be used by the muscle or the body for muscle protein synthesis okay we are concerned about the 20 amino acids that are available you know that are in the standard genetic code of the body can actually process there are 20 to proteogenic proteinogenic it mean I was by the body really just needs the 20 for muscle protein synthesis 11 of those can be made by the body and nine of those cannot those are your essential amino acids so you have to get those from some social body cannot make those on its own a quality protein what I would consider quality protein contains all 20 amino acids and nine essentially amino acids in optimal you know an optimal balance complete amino acid chains they're low in fat in low in carbohydrates we have protein sources that are low in fat and low in carbohydrates protein density per calorie ideally we want almost as many of the calories that we can get from the protein to be from the protein you don't want it from fat or carbohydrates the issue with protein powders you know a lot of people asking about protein powders they're okay in a pinch a couple problems with them one they don't don't release into the bloodstream so enough you know when you have a way it's very facially assimilated into the body it's peak concentrations I think I've read it within like 30 minutes and then then you know within an hour it's out of you so you would have to eat again within an hour to keep stable amino acid levels in the body whereas if you ate a chicken breast you're going to be digesting that over probably a two and a half three hour period of time piece of steak and staying your body for 24 hours or more so that's the issue with protein powders there are applications for them maybe intro workout or post workout if you want a quick amino acid bath you know that that might be or if you're just an attention on the road maybe maybe sip on it over a period of time that would be a way to or there are slower acting protein powders such as casian you know I've been saying they're not trying to shit all over protein powders but real food is always better and when we're constructing a bodybuilding diet we're looking for optimal not okay all right so protein powders are okay real need is optimal keep that in mind vegetarian and vegan bodybuilding oh good I almost dread even talking about this because people get their buttholes all on a clamp over this I have a tendency to piss vegans off I don't care when anybody says vegan and vegetarian diet is not optimal for sports performance it just isn't it's just the science bears out that it's not you know sure you can do well with it and you know this you know this and that documentary shows people that have done well with it yes yes yes yes yes yes you can be an athlete and be a vegan but we're talking about optimal here and you know don't treat your diet like a religion okay it's not dogma you know vegetarian and vegan diet is suboptimal you know just like a keto diet is probably suboptimal for putting on size and a carnivore diet is suboptimal for putting on size you know it's not to say you can you can so yeah you know with the thing with being vegan you need you need to mix most vegetables and plants or plant most plants plant foods do not have all the necessary amino acids for muscle protein synthesis there if you do so I'm being one of them but you just can't get all the amino acids that you need in the right qualities it without consuming excess carbs that is very difficult and you have to mix sources you have to be very diligent about it you have to make sure you're mixing the vegetables together to get the amino acids so it does have complete amino acids change but it you know it takes a lot think you know this is let's think about you know let's think about tofu which is what people most people eat for or soy protein powder tofu using tofu as your protein source it takes 940 calories of tofu to get 50 grams of protein you only have to eat 200 grams of chicken breasts to get 50 grams of protein if you're trying to get in 2 300 grams of protein a day you're going to get fat you just can't eat enough tofu I mean you're having to eat so much fucking tofu to get the the same amount that you would from chicken breast you're just going to get fat the same thing with other vegetables you know like mixing beans and rice you know it's good to take a shit tonic calories from beans and rice to get the amount of calories that you would get from a chicken breast I'm also a lot of plant products I know people don't want to hear this but it calls inflammation soy a lot of people have allergies you know or sensitivities to soy and they can cause inflammation a lot of plant products also have fight-oestrogens and we know that estrogen is the enemy of being lean and bodybuilding you know you need some estrogen but once again we're talking about optimization and then I what is ideal I would say it's almost impossible to achieve ideal body composition being being a vegan or vegetarian you know you're just going to have the protein powders and we already know the protein powders are an ideal and you know one thing I would like to point out to is you know vegans and vegetarians that don't pay attention to their amino acid intake we've all seen those vegans on YouTube that look like they're dying you know they look like cancer patients and it's because they're they have a severe amino acid deficiency and when you don't have amino acids in your body essential amino acids the ones that your body can't make on their own what do you think happens your body starts breaking down its own tissue to get those amino acids it becomes catabolic not a good place to be that's why the lot of you'll see a lot of vegans it look like their second dying they're malnourished you know I don't want to slam veganism as a choice I get the ethical make it the ethical reasons for it but it is suboptimal for bodybuilding. Optimizing your diet so what we want to do we keep talking about optimization we want quality animal protein sources for our bodybuilding diet choose animal protein sources that are easily digestible as well you know something makes you feel sick and bloated and you know that's not good for pound of food to get big equally distributed throughout the day we want to eat five to six meals a day with balanced amounts of protein and it you know the same amount of protein we need to meal and every two to three hours and this will promote stable amino acid levels in the body. Stay away from protein founders we talked about that already too fast digesting they a lot of people can digest them well they upset my stomach if I have them too many of them even the way isolates store I upset my stomach. Eat low fat as low fat protein sources as you can you can get chicken breasts 99% ground turkey white fish 96% lean at ground beef lean steaks we're gonna get our fats from other sources that give us essential fatty acids another thing you body can't bite when it's on you know improve a better health so we we want to stay away from the saturated fats that are in meats keep our arteries will be clogged up and protein we've established that we want to eat between one and one point five grams per pound of body weight with less carbs you're probably need less protein because carbohydrates and then high insulin state in the body is muscle sparing protein sparing okay and you probably need a little more protein when you're eating less carbs okay if you want to maintain muscle tissue you know those are the basics and what we want to do thank you for watching my video hopefully this was helpful please like and subscribe I can a lot of people watch my videos not many people subscribing I really appreciate it if you subscribe it helps me with the YouTube overlords I'm open the video suggestions if you need if you have ideas things you want me to record let me know I'm have muscle happy to answer questions in the comments section please leave your comments below and questions below and follow me on Instagram and Paul K Barnett thank you have a great day
