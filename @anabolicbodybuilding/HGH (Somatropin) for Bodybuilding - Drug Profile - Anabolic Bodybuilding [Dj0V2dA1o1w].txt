the human growth hormone some trope uh... this is one of one in the do for a while can i hold off on it but uh... he he he's one of my favorite things i think probably it's subtle but you get a lot out of it if you've got the money to spend on it uh... so we're going to dig into it today we'll talk about it uh... like said it's my favorite i think it's very productive for body building purposes in for longevity purposes uh... before i get into it uh... please take the time to subscribe to my channel like the video signing some offer alerts i put a lot of these videos up i haven't had a ton of people subscribing but i really appreciate it if you find the value in it if you would subscribe you to go to the channel off the ground uh... also if you went up dates on what's coming up with videos are coming up uh... you can or just what's going on with me in general you can follow me on instagram at Paul k barnette all right so let's dig into him a growth hormone so i'm a trope and property is a hd h it is a naturally occurring hormone in the body okay uh... just like testosterone is a naturally a court occurring hormone in the body it's uh... so the trope is the synthesized version of hd h using recombinant dna technology biologically it is a denical to human hd h the first fully synthetic rdna a sheath was developed in nineteen eighty seven for that they used to take the used to take a growth hormone from can i was in the they found out they're cause cutfield jacum students these i think it's what's called basically like a mad gal disease rd hd he turned into a zombie so that was a good they stopped doing that it is constructed of one hundred ninety one amino acid residues basically just a fucking amino acid originally was used to treat childhood growth disorders you know short intestines growth things like that also use currently for anti aging big in the anti aging community it flows age related cellular damage so you see the celebrities so that's a lot of talking about you that are seventy five years old look like they're forty five top crews and there's only so much classic surgery can do the rest of its a good diet growth hormone i'm not saying these guys don't work out hard and meet clean i'm sure they do but growth hormone helps too so it's very you know very important for anti aging honestly i think if you're over forty and you got the money to spend i would you know i would strongly consider a hormone replacement therapy and a protocol that consists of low-dose testosterone and therapeutic dose of or anti aging dose of growth hormone that's my two cents it was also used for anti-wasting treatment HIV patients this is a from what i understand now keep in mind this is just what i have heard that the original batch of body builders that were using to grow out in the LA were the a lot of AIDS there were a lot of AIDS patients in in that area where Venice Beach was in they were selling their growth hormone to the body builders top body builders were getting in initially it is a counter-regulatory hormone to insulin has an insulin and technistic effects of both liver and peripheral tissues we'll talk about this here in a minute that's important two notes effects of HGH it has an antibiotic effect on skeletal muscle tissue beyond being antibiotic it causes hyperplasia which is crazy you know so satellite cell growth new muscle tissue instead of actual hypertrophy which is just the growth of the existing tissue so that you're basically making new muscle cells promotes organ growth i've from what i've seen this is only in the higher dose is they used to think that's why you'd see a lot of guys with the send to guts because they're intestines and whatnot people were theorizing that they had grown and gotten so huge but these guys come off and get older they shrink back up so if it was permanent organ growth their guts wouldn't shrink back up so I think it probably has more to do with the food bloating visceral fat so i think the GH got things largely overstated now granted you know you probably does promote some organ growth if you get in a really really high doses it promotes connective tissue repair and regeneration stimulants matrix collagen synthesis which is really fucking cool so i think this you know this is a big reason why you see people marble now he's seen guys like dxter Jackson you know competing at a high level the mr. lumpy all the way up to 50 years old and you know i'm a masters competitor and there's some crazy put together dudes in their 50s and i think a lot of it has to do with the use of human growth hormone now because it does keep your joints and healthier keep your cell you know cells younger and healthier so you can continue to train hard and grow into your well into your older age whereas you couldn't do that before i mean probably before you know you didn't see many guys over 40 competing and bodybuilding now it's like pretty much half the dudes on the Olympia stage are over 40 you know so you didn't see a lot of that before promotes fat loss it does have a legogenic effect i think they're better things you can use for fat loss cheaper but it does help keep you lean increases i.g. f1 levels which is really where the the end direct muscle growth is coming from from that it is a side effects we talked about the diabetic diabetic genetic effect it can cause blood sugar levels to rise and can cause type 2 diabetes with higher doses it's a lot of ways you see older bodybuilders using your shit tonnance and it's not that there's some magic to the shit tonnance and they're just diabetics i mean i'm probably borderline diabetic myself or maybe i am i don't know i was like this before growth hormone it runs in my family but just something to keep in mind you know you run the risk of making yourself diabetic with the larger doses i will say it's generally what we're getting to it here in a bit but it's if you're taking a lower dose a lot of these side effects don't happen can reduce electrolyte levels i've had issues with that contests prep can reduce t3 and some people also sometimes people will supplement t3 when they're taking salotos at t3 when they're taking hgh can cause joint pain tingling and numbness a carpal tunnel syndrome stuffy nose here me now i got stuffy nose i don't know if it's related and i'm swelling in the extremities acromegly generally the the GH forehead and whatnot generally you don't see unless they're taking crazy high doses i have shaken a few promoter builders hands and they have fucking gigantic hands you see these cat take a look at the pictures of flex Lewis sometimes in his hands look like wrecked Ralph hands with their gigantic hands hands are like they're so fucking wide and it's you know i would speculate that it's from heavy GH use but his hands are crazy big and you'll see that with a lot of guys under high level competitors and the i have to be they have these fucking huge hands can speed up cancer growth i've read mixed things about this i've had cancer so this is certainly a concern for me um you know i'm probably rolling the dice a bit but i've read some studies that say that it does cause accelerated cancer growth others that say it doesn't i would go to reason you know cancer is an uncontrolled growth and if it promotes cellular growth and regeneration then it maybe would speed up cancer growth it doesn't directly cause cancer from what i've read and understand but if you have a pre-existing cancer is growth in your body it can it's kind of like poor in caracine on the fire uh body building uses for hg it's pretty straightforward muscle growth yeah duh uh connective tissue healing and strength i fat loss in healing or recovery i think this is where growth growth one of really shines you're not going to get a lot of short term growth from growth on people think they take it they're going to see some magic effect you know in six to twelve weeks it's one of these these things you have to commit to for a long term to really see the results from it um uh yeah the muscle growth is going to be a long term thing since it's hyper pleasure you're basically laying down the scaffolding for future muscle growth and it takes time to fill that in um it's not an overnight thing whereas like you know you take an antibiotic you're going to get the cell volumization and uh you know increase glycogen retention and bloating and shit like that you'll notice right away you don't birth on a subtle and slow um and you know the ability to keep your joints healthy so you can continue to train hard that is that is that is also you know the recovery factor that goes along with it is also it's hugely important I think that's probably the one of the one of the more important aspects of it um half life of growth hormone uh the half life is a big confusing so the half life for um subcutaneous injections 3.8 hours it's I've read it's like something like six for intermuscular but the you lose the the bioval ability goes down significantly with intermuscular injections so subcutaneous injections are going to you're going to get the most out of it but here's the thing the growth hormone itself from what I understand doesn't directly cause muscle growth in high-propleasure it's the increased IGF on levels are really what are benefiting you and there is a delayed onset of IGF one levels that raise after taking growth hormone which is up to 24 hours so the metabolic benefits and the uh antibiotic benefits of the growth hormone actually out way um or outlasts are the the actual um life of the hormone in the body so um you know so don't get too hung up on that you know I have read some things where multiple doses daily supposed to be better for fat burning I've tried it both ways taking single dose 3 doses I've seen very little difference to be honest with you I have read that that for for um insulin sensitivity that may be smaller doses throughout the day or better or taking breaks I generally take it at night before I go to bed to simulate the natural rhythm your body normally releases growth hormone at night and you know when you're repairing and growing so I generally just take it at night I've obviously I've seen no difference in whether you take it in the morning maybe a slight fat burning difference I don't know but it's it's small doses for hormone replacement therapy long-jewity I've seen most of these clinics you know prescribed one to two I use a day beginning body building two to four I use a day um intermediate you know four to eight and then advanced body buildings eight plus I will tell you I love the don't worry about the pre-menopausal women in there that was from another side doesn't apply here um another presentation sorry the advanced the eight units plus per day I have gone up over eight units and that's when the problems start manifesting themselves I will tell you that that's one insulin sensitivity get shitty that's one start having joint pain I personally think anything north of eight units is probably a waste for me personally six you know my experience six units per day is sort of the sweet spot I start getting side effects of eight you know some pretty nasty side effects my hands go numb I definitely have blood sugar issues when I get eight plus units per day and I I've looked at my blood work I see no difference in my idea of one levels from six units or anything north of you know six units really it just it you know there's no difference there's the same there's a big difference between four and six but it seems like six is kind of a sweet spot for me and really it's what we're trying to get out of it so you're basically I think if you go north of six units what you're doing is just using a very expensive fat burner of their cheaper waste of burn fat that's pretty easy to burn you don't need to spend thousands of dollars on growth hormone to burn fat so I don't know if I feel like us that are growing north of eight units are just wasting your money to be honest with you you know maybe there is some benefit but it's kind of like the curve of a lot of people are going to be a lot more expensive. I know that's more of a lot more problems less. benefit you know I bought I you know I've heard coach say there is no upper limit on growth hormone take as much as you can afford I don't know the necessary degree with that but I would have to see somebody's blood work that's taken 16 twenty units I've heard I've heard a pros I don't have the fuck they afford it but I'm not for units is probably plenty. Another thing with with growth hormone too it is a slow burn you got to take it day after day month after month for years on end to see a benefit from it. Running 12 weeks I was going to be a waste of your money. You know just don't even by the waste of your money don't even. Also if you're young you know you're nearly 20 she should have pretty high levels of growth hormone nationally you probably don't need it. If you're taking antibiotics I would eat out as much as you can with just antibiotics alone and see where you can get you know if you're knocking on the door getting a pro card then you have sure. But or just use it a contest time but I think you're probably wasted your money if you're 20 or 21 or nearly 20's. Taking it you're making enough if you're over 40 it's like I think it's a mandatory requirement if you're going to compete at least compete at a high level you almost have to have it in the mix if you're over 40 or over 35 even. For me I found that it healed up a lot of lingering issues you know I had a lot I mean I still have issues you know I might have torn a bunch of ligaments over the years just from stupid shit never in the fucking gym it's always playing basketball. Rod motorcycle is doing something stupid. Not one one I'll go tear something at the gym tonight but it seems like every fucking injury I've ever had has come from some outside activity. But I will tell you that it is helped heal up a lot of those lingering injuries. I do notice when I'm taking HDH. It does keep me leaner and I can get away with eating more garbage. I'm not encouraging you to eat more garbage but I can't get away with some popping my diet when I'm one you know hired us HDH it's just the truth. You know not a ton it's not like I'm pounded fucking doughnuts all day long but if I want to have a couple slices of pizza or you know a doughnut or a Snickers bar or something after I train or whatever it doesn't kill me like it would ordinarily. I noticed my skin the improved after I taken my skin tightened up a bit. I had a lot of loose skin before. I still do have some loose skin you know I've got old man skin but you know just the toe of my skin my skin's firmer I noticed some wrinkles went away which is pretty fucking cool you know it's subtle I wouldn't say it's dramatic but I definitely it does give me a stuffy nose when I take hired us as I think I have a cold right now but I have noticed I do get a stuffy nose that might it can cause inflammation and the signices. I get no hands at night sometimes when I take hired us as when I'm going up to eight I use my hands a fall asleep at night or weirdly like when I'm playing video games for some reason it's carpal tunnel. Some bloating too when you get on hired us especially when you're eating more food. I believe you know don't quote me on this but I believe a lot of the pharmaceutical grade HCH has a mild-directed kind of to help with that. I have noticed my glucose levels when I get north of six units a day my fasting glucose levels to go up so you know met form and becomes a necessity to counteract some of that at that point. For fat burning I have tried the two to three times a day. Those who get dusts seemed to improve some and as I mentioned before I feel like for me six units is the sweet spot I just don't know why unless you're trying to be Mr. Olympia get over that last little hump why you would spin all that extra money for a very little effect. I just you know I think you can spend a thousand dollars and taking risks with your health that are unnecessary and really you know it's not much benefit to it. It's you know maybe I'm wrong about that and feel free to argue with me and we can debate it but I just feel like anything more than I just sit here and it's six units is a waste. I heard Patrick tour who is you know coaches a lot of top level Olympia competitors now he yes this guy's all taken four to six units a day and same thing you know I heard him say the exact same thing he saw no difference on bloodwork for IGF one levels when people get north of six units. I don't know I just said to seven see the difference anyway thank you for watching my video please like and subscribe and keep pounding that and you probably get tired of him you say it but it really appreciated it helps me get this channel going feel free to ask questions in the comments section I'll do the best that I can answer I'm not a doctor so I'm not going to you know give you exact prescriptions for what you should do this is really for informational purposes only trying to prevent harm that's my primary objective here I know guys are going to do this shit regardless so I'm trying to give you good information that I didn't have access to when I was younger to keep you from damaging yourself if there are other videos you'd like me to make let me know I'm happy to make them and feel free to follow me on Instagram at pole k barna have a great day
