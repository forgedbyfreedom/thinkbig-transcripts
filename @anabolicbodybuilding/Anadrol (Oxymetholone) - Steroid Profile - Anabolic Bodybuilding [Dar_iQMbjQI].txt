And a draw, oxy, methylone, aboms. This is a favorite amongst power lifters from what I understand. And, bro's at the gym who want to get huge and bloated. We're going to go into the steroid profile today. Take a look at it. It's also one of the older steroids that I think has been around since the early 60s. Don't quote me on that, but that's what I recall. So let's take a look at an adoral. It is a structurally altered form of DHT, dihydrotestosterone. A two hydroxy, methylone group is attached to a carbon in the first cycle, alkane ring. And with this modification does, is make it a very strong antibiotic. DHT really is not, has almost no antibiotic properties whatsoever. Also has the modification at the 17th carbon position by adding a methyl group, making this a C 17a steroid. And we know what that means. That means it's liver toxic, but you can take it or away. It is very, typically similar to provider in which this crazy, because provider is very mild. And here is nothing mild about abombs. But they have very different effects. It is a super strong antibiotic, whereas DHT and provider are not. The rating is antibiotic to endogenic ratings as compared to testosterone. It has an endogenic rating of 45. milder and adorogenic effects than testosterone and anabolic rating of 320. So it is very adabolic compared to testosterone. It also has strong adorogenic effects, which is wild because most DHT derivatives do not. Actually the fact I think all the other ones do not have adorogenic effects. And what's crazy is they have no idea why adorogenic effects, because it doesn't convert the estrodiol through a romate. So there is no clear path to why it causes estroid. But it does. I just don't think it's been studied. It was originally used for treatment of osteoporosis in anemia. When it first came around there was better treatment for osteoporosis. Now there is a reason for a latent, which is mostly women for a lady. It's a bond to help osteoporosis. I can only imagine how that worked. And for anemia I think is the only thing the FDA still has it approved for. And I think that is mostly in HIV patients. Moderate andogenic effects is compared to testosterone. And it has a reputation for being very, very liver toxic. More liver toxic than the other 17 AA steroids. Although I think that may be a bit overblown. Effects of anodrol just like other steroids increase protein synthesis. Increase nitrogen retention. IDF1 production strong increase in red blood cell counts. It does have some inhibition on glucocorticoids. Although I think they are better options. And strong antibiotic action. Side effects of anodrol. There are a lot. There are a lot. It's a dirty, dirty, dirty steroid. Strong elevation in red blood cell count in hematocrate. That's why it's used to treat anemia. It's my experience and it has the strongest effect on that out of any of them. Even more than equipoys. You're going to blow your hematocrate up when you're, I've personally never checked my blood after taking it so I don't know. But you're going to blow yourself up if you have hematocrate issues. Just don't even go on it. This would be bad bad idea. As I mentioned, strong estrogenic effects and they have no idea why. And here's the crazy thing. Aromatase inhibitors. Do not listen to me on this one. Do not help the estrogenic side effects from, from, from a bombs. And that is because it does not aromatize to estradial. So therefore, aromatase inhibitors do not work. Serum seemed to work. So or help at least. So, you know, maybe take some noble decks. If you're going to take abombs and you have issues with gyno. I definitely will blow your gyno up. Appetite reduction. It has a severe appetite reduction effects on appetite in my experience. Moderate androgenic side effects. Here's another thing. You know, people will take five AR inhibitors to help with side effects from, you know, DHT. They don't work with an adro. They don't help since it doesn't directly convert to DHT. You're going to fuck your cholesterol and your lipets up if you take an adro. Fuck him up bed. So, and a study, I saw a 50 milligrams dose over a 12 week period. Lowered HDL by 23 points. Whoa, 23 points. Just from just from the abombs alone. Imagine stacking out with other shit. You're going to have no fucking HDL when you're talking. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not uncommon to see 20 to 30 pounds of weight gain in a couple weeks. You know, I gained a 20 to 30 pounds of muscle on a couple weeks. You'd be big ramen in two years. That was the case. It's all fucking water and blood. And as a result, your blood pressure is going to go through the roof. Yeah, high blood pressure and heart attacks and blocked arteries. Mild suppression of natural testosterone not as much as test. Suppressive but it's still suppressive. As I mentioned before, it has a reputation for being very liver toxic. I think that has more to do with people taking high doses than it does with the Steritice often. You don't hear anybody taking 150 to 200 milligrams of adivar a day. If you did, I think they would have the same liver issues as people taking Andadraw. It's not uncommon to hear a rose taking 150 milligrams of adivar a day. It's just fucking stupid, but stupid people do stupid things. Applications for Andadraw. Really, the only application I can see for it is for string sports. You're powerlifting, strong man, maybe I don't know a lot about strong man, maybe Olympic lifting. Powerlifting is looking to peak. It's probably a decent choice because it's going to cause you to blow it up. And I know, powerletters like to get bloated as flocks so they can pack all that meat into a suit And push more weight. Also, it's a cushion to join. So I can see some advantages there. Also, where you have situations where a quick size gain may be needed, such as explosive Sports. It can be used in high-purchasing free phases, but I think they're way better choices. I just don't see an application for it bodybuilding personally. Andadraw. Half life. The 16 hours is the half life. Each, you know, with other steroids doesn't pack half life. I'm so if you're going to dose it, it probably dose it twice a day. If you're going to start off with a 50-millimeter pill, split it in half half in the morning, half in the evening, or whatever. Cycles and doses. Male dose. Beginner dose is 50 milligrams per day. I mean, the pills are 50 milligrams. I have seen some 25-floating around, but they're not as common. Andadraw. Andadraw. 50 to 100 milligrams per day. And the advanced dose is 100 plus. 150. I think you're fucking nuts if you take that much, but whatever. And women don't take it. It just don't take it. My experience. I think it's size far. I mean, if I try to, if I try to, if I try to crate it or believe it's small because I want everyone else's 1156 plus 32 years old. So, I'm going to have to compete. For example, I'm going to 해� girdy it's a慣 for the pandemic. Right? headache. That is pretty much normal. Hot stomach, diabetes. I feel awful when I go out and fight. And if the goal is to put on size, why would you take it if you can't eat? Also if it bloated me up, I think again, 20 pounds and a few weeks, if your body builder, you don't want to be bloated and looks stupid, that's not the cool body building. If flared up my guy in a badly, I had a little bit of guy in a from puberty. I just had some natural, maybe some peace-sized nubs under my nipples. But when I took and had draw within a couple of weeks, that thing, if I could swallow up to the size of a big marble. Not a little marble, but one of the big mothers. And it got sore as fuck. Oh my god, it was to everyone in my t-shirt, this was in college. I knew I'd get what was going on. I went to my doctor, I convinced myself I had cancer, my doctor said, I don't worry about it, it's not a big deal. Later on, I had to have that thing removed. Not once but twice. My blood pressure went through the river, remember I had to have a physical done for something sports, I don't remember. And I recall the doctor commenting how high my blood pressure was and that was awful for my age. I think I only weighed like 190 pounds or something. I had no idea what I was doing, I didn't even know what it was, just out of friend the game of two men said, here you want to take some steroids and he gave me a little ziplock baggy full of some pills and I took the pills and it was a bomb. I think maybe I took it for six weeks. But I ended up losing everything again. I got strong as fuck quickly and then I lost it all. I remember being in college and not being able to bench 225 and that was like putting two plates on each side was I was a big man on campus if I could get up to that and I was just stuck at 185 and I remember like two weeks. I went from bench and 185 for hand full reps up to 225 for reps. It was crazy. It's just like in a couple of weeks. I've been stuck at 185 for a year. I will never, ever use it again, especially at my age. I don't see an application for bodybuilding. There's better choices if you want to take an oral. I would, you know, anovar is a DHT derivatives as well and it is essentially a cleaned up version of anodrol. It is a better version without all the side effects. It's still liver toxic but not to the same degree and it is actually a stronger anabolic. Thank you for watching my video. Please like and subscribe. Feel free to ask questions and comment.
