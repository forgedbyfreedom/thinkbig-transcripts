Warning, this content is for entertainment and educational purposes only. What's up, Jim Bros. Big Paul here with another anabolic Q&A. This is where I answer your questions regarding training, nutrition and responsible performance enhancement while reducing harm and increasing your results. I got some great questions lying up today from the school anabolic bodybuilding members community. If you want to join the community it's 30 bucks a month. I take questions over there and answer questions. Got a great group of people. A few of the questions I have lined up today. Could NFL stars like Sake Juan Barclay dominate in the IFBB. What's the right way to tie carbs and insulin for maximum muscle growth? How would you adjust PEDs when cutting versus blocking? Is HGH safer for older lifters? Alright, before we get started, folks, I had appreciated if you could take a quick second in a like. This video and subscribe to my channel. I get a lot of people watching these videos. Not a lot of people subscribing. Also, I just want to remind you guys that I am now up on Rumble X Instagram and many other platforms give me a follow over on those if you want to keep up with what's going on. Trying to distribute my content everywhere because you just don't know what's going to happen to your channels these days. Your question I got up here is from Cory G. Cory asked the following. What do you think would happen if elite level athletes like Sake Juan Barclay, B. John Robinson chose to play Joe's bodybuilding instead of playing football. Do you think they come become elite pros? I've always loved the thought experiment with some guys I played with at the University of Miami. Would he chicken fingers and fries for records and still be jacked and shredded? I know they weren't on gear. They barely knew how to train. Coach would just tell them the lift and they would squat 600 pounds out of bed. Yeah, I thought about this extensively and I also have worked with professional athletes as well. I've worked with guys across several different sports consulted and coached and helped dudes out with nutrition and it's why I'll see the extremes of professional sports, the elite genetics and some of these dudes have your right. Like dudes just wake up and can run a 4 or 4 or 4, not ever having to train for. Now that's not to say there aren't guys that work hard. There are elite genetics and both bodybuilding and professional sports. You know, and you got to go like Ronnie Coleman who supposedly turned pro natural and from what I heard when he was a first of pro that he never really had any sort of structured diet that he was eating denies every day and going to you know, placing you know lower out the Mr. Olympia contest 15th or something and then as soon as he got his diet cleaned up and got on some gear, sort of within the contest. Same thing is true in football there are guys that are just freak athletes that can get a buy on that athletic talent alone. Now one of the things that I would consider is the genetic traits that are required to be a great bodybuilder aren't necessarily the ones that are required to be a good football player. They're they're a bit different. For example, I know with running back that having shorter legs longer torso, lower center gravity is better for balance for guys that are offensive linemen, probably being tall and having long arms having a long reach is great for an offensive tackle say the thing one of the things I love about football is there's so many variable variables involved in what makes a great athlete at each position. So for example, what makes a great left tackle would not make a great one receiver would make say great running back might not make a good defensive tackle or what makes a great quarterback which to me is mostly just mental processing and hand eye coordination the ability to process data quickly and react quickly, sort of like hitting a baseball I would say would probably be a similar skill set to be able to diagnose something quickly and be able to process it's all very different from position to position. Now with bodybuilding it's largely the same. The structure that's required to be successful in body building is pretty much the the same for whether you're a classic or open. I would say maybe open the ability to get to a certain size would be a unique factor that whereas you don't need to be as big to be in mince physique or classic physique for example. So you know if a guy's like compete in classic might not ever be able to get as big as an open guy they may not have the genetics to be a 280 pound mass monster that's required to compete in the open on the Olympia stage but largely the structural components wide shoulders narrow hips small joints things like that are the same and I would say that the genetic traits that are required to be a good bodybuilder might not be so great for professional sports. I would give you an example the small joints the wide shoulders the narrow hips probably wouldn't be so great for football you need to be sturdy to be able to play football and I would imagine a lot of guys that are professional bodybuilders might break down playing professional football not saying all of them and for the most part great professional bodybuilders especially in the open aren't very tall you don't really see many guys that have success in open bodybuilding that are over 5 foot 10 it's it's very uncommon just because of the sheer amount of size that we have to put on and whereas in football we have all varieties there are shorter guys but they play more in the skill positions you're not going to see a 5 foot 9 270 pound left tackle on the NFL that just doesn't happen the you're not going to see a 5 foot 9 quarterback because he's got to see over this tall guys on the offensive line you know while there are some similar traits I would say that for the most part those probably don't translate well and if you look at the guys that are also the freak athletes in the NFL even though they carry a lot of muscle mass they don't really have aesthetic physiques they don't have the lines they don't have the bone structure they don't have the muscle abilities that would be conducive to being a great bodybuilder so it's a very unique set of genetics that are required for being great bodybuilding that probably don't translate that well to professional sports like I doubt Derek Lundsford could go out and run a 4,5,40 it's probably not that fast would be my guess now there have been some guys that have been quick if I recall correctly I think Kevin the Rhone was a was a Sprayner or something along I wanted that and Kevin the Rhone's pretty fast I think that's what I recall there are some guys that translate or I think brand of curry play football maybe I could be wrong about that so I probably just bring it in for a cut that incorrect but that's what I recall but largely you know these guys that didn't have been bodybuilding instead of playing professional football is probably because their genetics were better suited for bodybuilding versus being professional football player in vice versa so ultimately I'd say the genetics are a bit different that's not to say there couldn't be somebody that could make the transition from one to the other but I would say that it's a very different set of genetics football either got to be big and sturdy you got to be able to be fast if you're small if you're small you got to be fast or you have to be a highly skilled hand eye coordination type of guy like to play the quarterback position or to be a kicker I don't know that those skill sets are necessarily ones that would transition to bodybuilding I would say I do think a lot of professional athletes some of the intangibles that they have due carry across the discipline, the structure, the ability to push themselves not saying all guys I know there are some lazy guys that just get by on skill set and just genetic gifts alone but I would say that's a transferable skill and I honestly I think football players and I've helped a few of them could benefit from some of the discipline and structure that bodybuilders have when it comes to nutrition and training I would think that that could take your free athletic ability and just take it up another notch if you were a professional football player I do think that would be beneficial to professional football players and there are a lot of guys that play professional football eat like trash you know I've seen you know guys living off of gummy bears and energy drinks and you should like that and still can play fast food and still can play it and in an effort level I think if they followed more of a bodybuilding style diet maybe a carps cycling diet that they could probably improve their performance on the field but ultimately it's a game of genetics and not just genetics it's the appropriate genetics the genetics that are great for bodybuilding might not be great for football the genetics that are great for football might not be great for bodybuilding all right next up I've got two insulin questions I'm going to break them up into two parts because they are kind of interconnected from different people from the school and about bodybuilding members community first question I've got up here is from Adam T Adamask I understand the basic mechanism in full and use of bodybuilding but how much does it actually enhance growth and in practice what kind of results should someone realistically expect all right just so we have some clarification for the users here let's let's talk through the mechanisms the basic mechanisms of insulin that are performance enhancing insulin isn't directly antibiotic per se it it is a hormone that increases nutrient up in transport nutrient uptake insulin some specific things that insulin does it increases glute for transport in the muscle cell increasing glycogen synthesis and amino acid uptake it specifically increases amino acid transporters on the muscle cell increasing uptake of loosening isolucine which is going to increase muscle protein synthesis long term you know these are small little things that that it does once these amino acids are inside the cell triggers inventory and thus a corresponding antibiotic response so we have increased inventory lower day MPK increased idea 1 and a long term we have a better antibiotic state for muscle growth now what we're going to see with insulin long term is just small increases of of increased muscle protein synthesis over a long term in theory we're going to have you know increased muscle protein synthesis as a result of using the insulin and it's just small tiny bits but if we think about it if we're increasing muscle protein synthesis by a few grams every time we use it or whatever I'm just using our retiree numbers that adds up over the course of the year that might be a couple of extra pounds of muscle over the course of the year not something that you can see from week to week I also have seen you know just anecdotally it does have seen to over time increase the capacity to synthesize glycogen it seems like guys have increased muscle glycogen synthesis over a period of time and you'll see it when you guys that run insulin they get this really full bubbly round appearance that just doesn't seem to happen with not insulin users and it also allows you to push the food even higher there is sort of an upper limit of what you can achieve with eating food without insulin I mean you you know when I hear a guy's eating a thousand grams of carbs I'm almost certain that there is some insulin at play there there almost has to be physiologically for us to be able to deal with that amount of carbohydrates and glucose uptake when we're talking about enhanced bodybuilding so that's that sort of what I see and you know my thought process on it now you know at a high level with this does is increase glycogen synthesis as I mentioned increases amino acid uptake in long term increases muscle proteins synthesis and that's all a little small subtle differences it's not anything radical that you're going to see a change immediately over day but this is like one of these small things that compounds over time and you know look I you know I can't put an exact number on it but let's just say if you are synthesizing an extra few grams of if there's you know stimuli in extra a couple grams of muscle protein synthesis daily that could translate into a couple pounds over the course of a year and over the course of five years that might be an extra 10 15 pounds of muscle which is pretty significant when you're on stage think about slapping 15 pounds of steak so in your body that would make a big difference and then also the increased glycogen synthesis gives you an appearance of being full and round and if you look at body builders pre insulin and GHU skies didn't have that 3D look so to speak at least I don't think most of them dead where they had this look like they look like a balloon that had too much air put into them that to me seems to be a result of the insulin use where you have increased glycogen increased water in amino acid uptake and just to have this big full round look so it really kind of is a difference in the look and overall difference I would see this look if you're not a professional bodybuilder if you don't have the gold being a professional bodybuilder that's probably limited reason to use insulin but you know over the long term it does these whole things add up and increases the amount of muscle tissue that you accumulate in change your look on stage which is ultimately what we're doing in bodybuilding. All right second part of the insulin question I have here is from Joseph A Joseph as if we take out the risk of hypoglycemia is there an optimal timing considered for eating high carb high protein meals and taking insulin with them using rapid acting. What would be the better nutrient partitioning to eat when the insulin peaks or to take it when the meal is digesting or before you administer it or when you administer it. Yeah I you know look with rapid acting insulin you know I go back I did a thing the previous week about how I think most people use insulin and correctly when it comes to performance enhancement a lot of guys talk about using a basil insulin like lantus which really is not going to have much or performance enhancing. In fact it's really just to manage glucose levels and replace back ground insulin and most of the time what guys are using something like lantus that they already have some sort of underlying existence of either pancreatic and sufficient see or they have insulin resistance that needs to be addressed so the rapid acting insulin likely for performance enhancement is a better choice now I'm not saying to run out and use it in insulin inherently dangerous so we want to talk about harm reduction you're crazy if you run insulin and you're not a professional bodybuilding you don't what you're doing so I'm not telling you to do this but this is how guys are doing it with using rapid acting insulin personally and I'm that I diabetic but I use it on my high carbohydrate days only that limits my exposure to the insulin limiting risk of insulin resistance so if we isolated it to just maybe two high carbohydrate days and my mind that limits the exposure to exogenous insulin and we know that the more exogenous insulin that use the more risk there is of insulin resistance so that's something that we have to be mindful of in long-term insulin dependency and all sorts of downstream effects negative effects from from the insulin abuse now with the meal timing the sub-diabetic statement you don't wait to take your rapid insulin something like a novel or a human log of our call correctly starts to work you know the curve on it it hits within 15 minutes it lasts for about three to five hours I think it peaks within an hour if I recall correctly I could it could be a little bit off on that you can look at the look up the format kinetics on it but it starts working within 15 minutes so typically what I will do is take it right before I eat my meal I eat my meal and if you're like I've heard of guys waiting to use it and to try to time up the peak with it and to me that's just idiotic you're going to end up going high-pull also I see a lot of guys that I'll take it with every meal and not every other meal and then they end up going high-pull because they were like well shit I took five units with my first meal I took another five minutes units with my next meal and then I ended up going high-pull I'm not sure why I used the same amount that's because there's still some of that insulin from the previous meal still present likely effectively you know a unit or two I don't you know it's just using that as a bro way of equating things but some of that insulin is still present in your system so you don't need as much so usually what I will do is use the insulin every other meal on the high day I never take it before I sleep and it's pretty stupid to take it for your last meal make sure that there's plenty of carbohydrates present when I do take it and you know so usually I will take my human log injection and then I eat my meal and then diet bettics it's meant to deal with meal time spikes in glucose when you're eating a meal so just you know I use it the way that the drug was designed to use it I'll try to get things timed up correctly and it's going to be present for up three to five hours so there's no reason to take another dose before then it's still active it's still working and typically that's how I run it. All right next question I got here is from John W. John ask hey Paul how do you adjust your PE to D-dosing especially when cutting versus walking? PE D's will change during walking versus cutting. Usually and then off season we want to be a little more careful with health because we're going to be pushing food a bit higher. Also when we're in a caloric surplus we don't typically need as many PE D's at least my opinion I if there's some other people with varying opinions on this and the off season the food should be the primary driver of growth and we take enough antibiotics to facilitate the need there and we can get away with less a lot of times what I found in the off season as far as antibiotics go. Growth hormone is opposite in my opinion growth hormone on contest prep is essentially just an expensive fat burn at that point. IDF1 levels are not going to be high when you're in a caloric deficit. Things IDF1's going to be suppressed when acidity and suppressed so there's a really net reason to run high doses of growth hormone on contest prep. I will keep the doses a little more conservative on contest prep as far as compound choices go generally in the off season what you'll see that most professional body builders are doing is running higher doses of testosterone. Moderate doses of whatever antibody that they choose to use. Some guys use oral, some don't. I would say that most older body builders that you talk to experience ones that have been doing it for a while get away from using orals in the off season just because of the side effects and how the effect blood panels including suppressed HDL and worse in LDL they also tend to cause stomach distress. I know I used to love running anodoro when I was younger. I can't do that anymore because I get horrible as it reflects and it completely smashes my appetite and if you can't eat you're not going to grow in an off season. Now that's not to say some guys don't run aros. Let's say you know probably the two most popular roles in an off season would be debore anodoro when it comes to contest prep usually we're going to tilt the scale more towards the quote unquote dryer compounds which are usually the DHT derived compounds to affect mineral in water retention we're going to we're going to lower testosterone and increase the DHT derived antibiotics and you know sometimes guys are using things like trend towards the end of a contest prep things like anovar even when straw things that are avoided on contest prep usually nanderlone any debol anything that's going to cause a massive amount of water retention because we're going to go for that hard and dry local contest prep. Whereas in the off season we really don't care about that a little more water retention in the off season actually might be a benefit for increasing leverage in protecting joints when it comes time to lift heavier weights. So that's typically what I see a lot of times you know at least for me and my own experience when I run my highest doses when I run my highest loads of our contest prep because it's one year the biggest risk of being catabolic I've heard other guys like John Jue would say the exact opposite it runs lower apologize John if I have that incorrect but I've heard of other guys don't I just have not that is not worked well for me I find when I need less antibiotics is in the off season when I'm actually eating a ton of food and I let the food do the majority of the work with promoting animalism food and train stemming less at several but typically that's what I see when it comes to compound choices in what changes for contest prep to the off season. All right next question here is from Chase see it's the good old master on question for off season. Chase says what's your take on master on as a mass builder and the off season assuming pre-mo is an option I'm thinking about running it as my primary antibiotic alongside a test base for my next growth phase I just have not found master on to be that great or a growth promoter in the off season. You know master on in primable and a sort of cousins so to speak they do have different properties where they act a bit differently. Primable and acts more like in a room of taste inhibitor master on acts more like a serum when it comes to how it affects estrogen. Master on tends to be a bit weaker of an anabolic than primable and as primable and tends to be a bit stronger as an anabolic and it totally I have noticed that the master on seems to crush HDL worse than primable and does. Master on tends to dry you out more aggressively than primable and does yet I tend to stay a bit fuller on primable and master on has a strong effect on the mineral glucocortocoid pathway. From what I recall master on has a stronger or endrogen receptor binding affinity especially in the skin which causes collagen depletion and water depletion in the skin. If you'll notice the guys that run master on year round they look like a leather pocketbook or a dried-up proof that's been sitting in the sun. They get this ashy, oily, old-looking skin. You can take a look at the guys that run master on year run and I've noticed that it tends to make me too dry my joints get creaky. Now with that said I like master on and I would say the argument would be with with with master on in an off season really and same thing with primable and neither one I'm very strong in a ballaxe but the argument would be is they just really the compelling reason to use either is that it allows you to run your testosterone higher. I would say if you look at the guys that are the biggest dudes that do it's a most successful in bodybuilding the guys that are at the top of the Olympia stage really what they have in common is they all run high doses of testosterone in the off season and high doses of growth hormone. Whatever anabolic they choose to run home the side really is based on preference what they feel best on what their health markers look the best one but ultimately it seems to be high dose testosterone and growth hormone is what most of these guys are running the biggest dudes on the planet. The guys talking about running low doses of testosterone and high doses of antibiotics in my experience they're never the guys that are big they just aren't now you can take a look you know all you have to do is just take a look at them and I but ultimately hey look here's here's what I say pick what works for you what you feel the best one what you're making the best progress for master on wouldn't be my first choice for an off season anabolic but I know plenty of people that are highly successful that run it. I have run it in the off season before it's not my preference I like primable and I like equipoys in my old days I used to run a lot of test EQ MPP and then sprinkle in some debaul that's the count of the old school method that guys used to use to get huge. Anyway ultimately boils down to preference I would say as far as anabolic effect goes to me master on is the weakest out of all the injectable antibiotics that we have in our disposal when it comes to muscle growth. I look at it as more of a contest prep drug something that gives us a cosmetic effect to me it wouldn't be my first option for an off season compound. All right next question here is from Dave. Dave says I'm 67 years old and I have trouble putting a little muscle and I won't TRT but don't want to increase my testosterone and honestly it hasn't made a big difference. I'm considering HDH should I be concerned about the cancer risk associated with HDH. I have BPH could HDH help with sleep muscle gain at my age. How does it affect blood sugar? All right so baseline when I'm looking at hormone replacements that's usually where I would personally mean I'm not saying this is what you should do Dave. Personally for me when I'm looking at hormone replacements I want to replace the things that it declines we age that are going to help give us a youthful look help us progress in the gym help us be healthy vital and growth hormone pretty much goes in the shitter much past 40. HDH and testosterone are biological hormones we know what the downstream effects are of them and how they affect the body and to me that's sort of like the starting point of hormone replacements therapy would be to use both of those. We could argue with some people that maybe a GLP1, GLP1s are made in the human body some people are deficient there as well but I would say growth hormone in HDH would be my starting point. Now with that said if you've had a past history of cancer HDH is something that I would be very cautious with. I've had a past history of cancer myself. I've rolled the dice and used HDH. Now we can look at the data on HDH HDH itself is not directly called estrogenic. It's been well studied well documented that it's not directly called estrogenic but the downstream effects of HDH and increasing IGF1 increased IGF1 has been associated with increased cancer risk more specifically with prostate and colon cancers. Now that does seem to be in combination with high estrogen, high estrogen, high IGF1 and growth hormone use it seems to be the trifecta of colon cancer and prostate cancer issues. Now I would say a lot of its genetics a lot of its genetically predetermined but it's sort of like dumping care on the fire and then you end up with a problem. So HDH isn't directly going to cause cancer but if you have an existing adnoma somewhere that you don't know about it could potentially increase the risk of that becoming you know more rapidly growing through indirectly through increased IGF1. So that's something that we need to be aware of. So these guys that are running high estrogen, they guys that are running high GH in chasing, chasing IGF1 levels as a result of running high estrogen in having HDH and play I would say are role in the dice. There is a direct correlation between high IGF1 levels when you get your blood worked on you'll see z score on your blood panels which is associated with increased risk of cancer specific cancers from having elevated systemic IGF1. So chasing high systemic IGF1 levels does carry some risk and we can question whether or not there is any potential benefit for even having them anyway for muscle growth. It seems to be more about localized IGF1 than systemic IGF1. So I would say I would be very cautious with your estrogen levels if you do decide to go that route I would carefully pay attention to your IGF1 levels and honestly if you are concerned about cancer and if you had a past history of cancer I would be very cautious in how your approach things I would speak to your homeowner placement doctor about it and see what they say and like I said if past history of cancer and you family history of cancer I would proceed with some serious caution but to me growth hormone and testosterone are the base lines for hormone replacement to kind of get you where you're at and I'm not surprised that a TRT dose is not getting you into superhuman growth I mean it's just hormone replacement therapy bodybuilders you know as we know we have to give a little more aggressive with things if we want to have muscle growth and that's also a question you're going to have to ask yourself at 67 years old at the risk as versus the reward that's a personal thing that you're going to have to ask yourself I'm not here to chest eyes even tell you what you should and shouldn't do your grown man figure that out for yourself but I would say baseline testosterone growth hormone if I as I age I'm telling you what I'm planning on doing is probably running a replacement dose of growth hormone keeping my estrogen levels in range running a replacement or slightly above replacement dose of testosterone and then I would probably sprinkle in some sort of mild and a baliclake like like primibolein or maybe maybe even even I just should all over mass around maybe even mass around would be a consideration as well I honestly find mass around to be very gentle and well tolerated low side effects I don't know how much of a benefit it provides but that would be kind of where I would would would run things I would look at whatever's the lowest risk in the best reward to risk ratio that we have to me that would be growth hormone testosterone a lower dose of primibolein that's probably what I would run as I get older in advance into retirement. Alright next question I got here is from William P. Yes hey Paul I just turned 55 and I've been training higher for three years but I've always had skinny lugs which are opinion on high rep workouts. Here's what my quad day looks like right now single leg extensions three times 12 to 15 set reps barbell back squats 12 to 15 12 to 25 reps per set leg press 20 to 40 reps per set and hack squat one set of 20 it wipes me out mentally physically am I over doing it so here's the thing as we get all there's a couple problems here and this is always a question we have to ask ourselves is we get older one we're training and it becomes more of something that we have to be aware of is the risk versus reward ratio of training and also the the stimulus versus the fatigue cost of that training in exercise you know look if you want to do barbell squats that's fine to me they're the risk versus reward ratio and my age just isn't worth it they aren't that great for growing quadrups and my experience depending on your structure I would say there would be safer less fatigue options I would say doing the super high rep sets like that are probably very taxing when your central nervous system I would probably be more in the 12 to 15 reps range using a more moderate weight rather than didn't going balls out on that I probably would would sub something else out besides barbell squats but if you want to do barbell squats that's a choice you can make just know that they come with more risk risk when it comes to axial loading and potential risk when it comes to spine knees hips things like that there can be additional problems I think there are so many good hacksquat machines and other choices now that you could do that also I noticed that you have zero adductor work in there if you want bigger legs adductors make up about a third of your total leg size I didn't see any hamstring work in there as well you also want to work in the posterior chain you know you're missing out on about half of your leg size there but not having any direct adductor or hamstring work I would definitely incorporate maybe a little less for your quads and a little more for those other areas get that in there I would lower the rep range just more into a 12 to 15 wrap range maybe even as low as 10 reps I would carefully consider your exercise choices when it comes to fatigue consider the fatigue cost of those exercises and rep ranges consider the risk to reward ratio when it comes to choosing your exercises is this putting me at risk of injury if you're not in the gym if you're hurt you can't train you're not going to grow or progress those legs if you're beat up and these hurt all the time if you're back hurts all the time you have some sort of catastrophic injury where you ought to the gym for an extended period of time you're not going to be able to grow the legs I will consider all those factors if you want man I've got a free copy of my training program it's kind of old guy improved with it also has my leg routine on it up on my website and anabolic bodybuilding.com you can go there and download it for free no charge you know but you know it's just you know a couple different training programs up there you can download for free but I would I would restructure things the way you have it right now I don't think that's the most productive way to train your legs currently all right next question I've got here it's from Joshua P. Josh my body since here on a classic tickets are available do you have any tips for our first time trip assume I want to get what this close enough to small the protein for it's you know you know first trip I would say the gold tickets are probably plenty good if you can I would rather sit closer to this center and be a little further back then be closer and be on the side you just don't get a good look at the physics on the side I will say this with the Arnold classic really the center piece of that whole thing is the expo the expo's we're all the fucking cool shit is the expo's we're the pre judging's done you'll be able to get up close it's first come first serve when it comes to seating at the expo I think if the gold tier seats to be able to I don't think silver can get into the pre judging seats but the expo's we're all the freaks here everybody's walking around there's a bunch of stuff to see that that's really where it has I would say with the bodybuilding show the gold I think I got gold tier one I'm sitting in the center and that's plenty close enough the lighting is great at the Arnold the show is really well put together well produced it's not like the Olympia where you're out there for fucking eight hours waiting for them to get through everybody they run through everybody very quickly it's very efficient lighting is great but the expo's great man I would say if you can swing it I would stay at the venue it is a pain in the asco on back and forth from the Airbnb but you know if your bodybuilder you need a food prep and do all that shit but I would say stay at the venue if you possibly can I would get the tickets early they do sell out I just bought mine the other day and there wasn't a whole lot of the gold tier ones left they were pretty much all gone already and you know where what five months out if something like that four months out from the show if you wait much longer or all the good tickets are going to be gone so I would grab now but you know be prepared for a great time it's much cheaper than the Olympia I think it's a better bang for the buck the expo is better the show itself is better it's just a very high quality well run production the only downside is it's in Columbus and in March whether isn't great and Columbus and March but other than that the show is fantastic man it's a really great venue everything is in one place just very well run very well produced expect I would get time I like the handle better than you want the upper ceiling if I were going to just go to one premiere body building show you it would be the iron of classic it's just head and shoulders above all the other shows that out there there's just nothing that even compares to it all right next question I got here is from Stephen K he says hey Paul what's your take on Greek yogurt as a secondary protein source I can't tolerate any way isolates but Greek yogurt works well for me thanks man yeah I Greek yogurt every day I mean I wouldn't make it a staple of my diet I you know but I do have it with breakfast type these roman frets through zona podcast periodically roman it's quite a bit of Greek yogurt from what I recall mixes fruit and stuff with a bit yeah roman eats Greek yogurt Greek yogurt it's great I mean you're going to get some probiotics as long as you're tolerated dairy well I don't think there's a lot of lactose in Greek yogurt from what I recall it's very low lactose so Greek yogurt tolerated well it's a good option I do what I do personally and the morning I have I get a faia Greek yogurt I think there's about 17 and 18 grams of protein in that I will have that with some egg whites or egg beaters I use those and I'll have a little bit of smoked salmon in the morning and I get my roughly 60 grams of protein from those combined sources what I use from my breakfast in the morning works really well here lately I've been doing sourdough toast and I think a lot of guys a lot of bodybuilders end up deficient on calcium and calcium is important for also contractions you know calcium channel so we do need some calcium and a lot of guys are calcium deficient so calcium with vitamin D and K2 to make sure it's absorbed properly but yeah I like to get a little bit of Greek yogurt into my diet every single day alright Chris G ask what are the best options in cardio options for someone prioritizing leg growth no cardio I joke I joke I joke I joke I do a joke I depends on your age man I used to do the stair climber I liked the stair climber a lot when I was younger I used to cycle a lot but my knees are pretty fucking beat up now I can't really effectively do the stair climber any more or without my knees starting to hurt so I would say look lit your knees dictate which you can get away with I certainly wouldn't be out running marathon I don't think that's going to be conducive to growing your legs but I know a lot of guys really like the stair climber I would switch my cardio and I talked about this in the last Q&A I in the off season I like doing hit cardio and this is something I picked up from my coach Justin Harris hit cardio is efficient it's fast it's quick get your pulse up so you can get the cardio of the abscaler but benefits from it I would do something like 40 seconds slow in the 22nd sprint you could do that on the cycle or you can do that on the stepper the stepper if you are in good health with your knees you can get a hull of the leg pump from getting on the stepper I've noticed that cycling too shit man I used to cycle a lot I really got into cycling for a while and used to do distance cycling in some hill climbs on on the cycle man your legs are blasted and if you look at cyclists man they all have huge quads all of them do get these tiny little upper bodies in these giant quads it it's goofy as fuck yeah I would say to me cycling or stair climbing some sort of interval training in the off season I'd stay away from running running it's not great for leg size you know little light walking fine here and there if you want to do that but I would say those two some sort of interval hit style of training limiting your exposure and getting your pulse up high enough to get a cardio vascular benefit from it and and run those you know maybe like four days a week something like that all right folks that's all I got for you on this one hopefully you
