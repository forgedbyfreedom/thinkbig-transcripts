Why you aren't progressing the law of training, specificity? Andrew Carnegie once put all your eggs in one basket and then watch over that basket and timely. So what the fuck does this have to do with training? All the most successful people in life focus and tentally on a single goal. When you spread yourself thin on many different things, you never truly master any of them. If you want to be the best at something, you have to focus on that goal intently. This logic implies to the gym as well. If you say, for example, if you want to be the best bodybuilder, but your training has some cross-fit elements, power lifting elements, any play soccer a couple days a week. Maybe you like to jog here and there and run a 5k in the spring. How good do you think you're going to be a bodybuilding if you're doing all those things? You're dividing all your training resources up, your recovery ability. You're probably not going to have the best results in bodybuilding. So if you want to be the best bodybuilder, you need to train like a bodybuilder all the time. If you want to be the best power lifter, the best cross-fitter, the best soccer player, your training needs to be 100% focused on those goals. Or you're not going to be the best. Now this is not the same. You can't do all these things. I enjoy doing many different things. I like many experiences and life's about experiences for me. So I get it. I just don't expect optimal results in all those areas. But if you're generally intent on being the best at your craft, you have to train specifically for that craft.
