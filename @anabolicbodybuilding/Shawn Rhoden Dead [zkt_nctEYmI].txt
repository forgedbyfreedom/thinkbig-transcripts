I heard this morning I had Sean Rodden passed away. My thoughts of going out to his family. I don't know if he had a small child and worse for you as a father as leaving a child behind with no parent. You know, so my thoughts are out to his family. Reportedly he passed away at a heart attack. I don't know that that's been confirmed yet but I heard that through reliable sources that that's what happened. But who knows? We'll find out. It's just a reminder to us about a building to pay attention to your health. I don't want to lecture. We all take chances with our health even at the amateur level of guys, Jim Bros. What not? People attending nor health issues. The two things that seem to kill bodybuilders, the most are heart attacks in kidney disease. One of the things you really need to pay attention to when you're doing things is cardio vascular health. Most of the time kidney disease is caused by high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases cardio vascular occurrence risk. So maintaining your lipids, making sure your lipids are in check, keeping your blood sugar in check, keeping your blood pressure in check. These things will go a long way to helping you live. Not to say things can happen. Sean could have had a genetic issue where you had a weak heart or some sort of cardiovascular disease. We don't know that. Good pass away on the way. Just be mindful of it. You work take risk. Drawing a race car around a race track is risky. Playing football is risky. Climbing a mountain is risky. Anytime you leave the house, you're taking a risk. But you can do things to mitigate your risk. Make a blood pressure seriously. Keep your diet clean, do cardio. Things like that that can help mitigate smart andabolic use. Things like that can go a long way to maintaining your longevity. Anyway, I don't want to ran on this. But you know, I wish Sean's family all the best. And I hope they find peace.
