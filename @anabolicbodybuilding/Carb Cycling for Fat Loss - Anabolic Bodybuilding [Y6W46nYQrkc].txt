Carb cycling diet fat loss strategy explained. I want to go fed so many people asking me about the diet I did from a show and outworks and I worked with Justin Harris from Tripone in nutrition and I used these Carb cycling approach which you know I was loosely familiar with before I worked with him which is why I chose him to help me with my diet because it made logical sense to me how the diet worked and I needed some money to help keep me accountable and whatnot but anyway we worked together I've won a great deal from him I've done my own research as well and I wanted to share with people just kind of at a high level how Carb cycling works for fat loss you know hopefully this will help give you just a general overview of how Carb cycling works. Anyway, pitching here on the first page is this is crazy this was me eight weeks before my show and six weeks after the exact same body weight so if you have any doubts about how it works you can see the complete body composition transformation here so the very first thing that's important understand with Carb cycling is calories and calories out in thermodynamics the human body is a close thermodynamic system you can't violate the fundamental laws of physics so it is calories and calories out as much as you want to believe that it's not it is and you have to be at a deficit to burn fat it is a must a required you can't burn fat any other way now you can create that deficit in a multitude of ways you know through doing cardio fat burners, cutting calories you know there there's a multitude of ways to do it for more detail I have a video where I go into great length about the health or my dynamics works and calories and calories out it's just watching that before watching this if you haven't done so yet so Carb cycling for fat burning the the high level concept of it the way we ran and we had low medium and high days below and medium days during the fat burning phase were at a high book color they were at a deficit and they are intended for fat burning you know my experience I felt like the first initial days I was dipping into glycogen and then towards the end of the you know we would do six fat burning days and then a high day so I felt like the first few days I was missing burning off guy like a gen and then it was noticeable fat burning after the second half of the week medium days are typically training days okay days that you're lifting weights and you have slightly more carbs that help fuel the weight training low days the carbs are lower towards the end of my diet we actually had zero carb days on low days but those are off days you don't need the carbs if you're not doing anything if you're sitting around on your ass it's a rest day you don't need carbs okay you just don't it basically ends up being a wash if you factor in the amount of calories you probably burn during weight training at least by my math it is you know it's hard to say how many calories you actually burn during weight training but you know I look at my apple watch and it gives me an idea I don't know how accurate that is but you know anyway there it it one's up being in that neutral I believe the high day you know we were doing one high day a week towards the end we were adding more we were having a couple I guess not metabolism just caught fire but high days are for refilling glycogen and boosting your metabolism training days they're on training days only typically leg days you want to do it on a heavy lifting day you don't want to do it on arms or something like that probably probably leg or back would be ideal day to do it or if you have a week body part you want to bring up when you're doing off season training that would be a good day too we did once every seven days for the most part towards the end like I said we were doing a couple days a week sometimes the high day detailed how it works the okay so get understand the body on the stories excess carbs as either fat or muscle and liver glycogen okay you want to take advantage of that day by pushing the excess carbs into glycogen stores okay this fills your muscles out gives you energy to train makes you look for spikes in metabolism you know it you know Justin said that a large body motor can store anywhere between a thousand and fifteen hundred grams of carbs is glycogen if fully depleted that's insane when you think about it this doesn't violate you know so when you're eating these excess calories from carbs you would think well this how does this not violate thermodynamics in you know you're not you're not gaining fat on these days when you're pushing these carbs into the glycogen stores but how does this not violate thermodynamics simple the calories aren't going away they're just being stored as muscle glycogen okay there's still there thermodynamics has been violated another nice benefit of this is that prevents diet fatigue you know I was never at a point where I felt like I couldn't make it I only had to make it a couple more days to get to that high day and have some food and feel better protein is kept lower on the high days because carbs a high carb insulin high insulin state is muscle sparing fats are kept as close to zero as possible because your bodies in in a high insulin state there's only one place fat can be stored and that's in fat stores okay so we don't want that so we keep the fat as close to zero as possible insulin can be leverage to store carbs if you're if you're a big bodybuilder in your eating thousands and fifteen hundred grams of carbs you probably can't shut all those carbs into the muscle without insulin a sample of a basic carb cycling diet okay so let's just take basic carbs like that let's just say this bodybuilder a their base metabolic rate is three thousand calories okay this you ran six days at a deficit of one thousand calories that deficit can be created through cutting calories from the diet doing cardio fat burners whatever this should be almost two pounds of weight loss during the course of a week close to it during this time your body's going to burn through most of its glycogen and you're by day six you're going to be pretty well glycogen depleted. High day on day seven say you're at a thousand calorie surplus you go up to four thousand calories instead of eating two thousand calories it's a huge swing and you are eating a thousand grams of carbs and using this is an example those carbs if we've done everything properly will be stored mostly as glycogen and not as fat which is crazy right it's a cool trick of the body and to keep you full and keep you looking good as a bodybuilder which is what we want we want we want full muscles we want to burn fat we don't want to burn muscle tissue my experience my personal experience the high days kept me sane I've done other diets before keto comes to mind I absolutely lost my fucking mind when I did keto I could not sustain it I just couldn't think I felt like it was going to die I want it I started having crazy carb cravings and I think that's the case with most people and then they just end up binging so what happened to me you just end up binging you you can't sustain it you end up binging I always knew I only had to make it a few more days before I could be kept in crunch and gummies and pie filling I get to have fun things like that in loose body fat I got down the single digit body fat while eating captain crunch and gummy bears and pie filling and whatever you know fru juice shit like that you wouldn't normally think that you you could even I would which is crazy cool the one thing that was wild too is my weight loss actually accelerated as I got further into the diet we had to add calories back in my metabolism had just caught fire so much you if you look at the top right of the screen you can see my weight loss chart up there you can see the peaks and valleys so the the days where you see the peaks of the days after I did a hide day and then you can see my metabolism accelerated again right afterwards usually what I found is by the time I reached day five day six my weight loss started to slow down and then I would have the the hide day and then things would just catch fire again right after that you know my metabolism would kick right back off to be honest with you I probably could have eaten more than I did we probably lost too much weight towards the end and we probably could have had more food and then we did I probably could have gotten away with two hide days a week although we did add extra hide days towards the end and you know you can see the the picture down on the right I had it at the beginning we talked about it the amazing transformation and body composition the the picture on the left was pre-contest I think six or eight weeks pre-contest the one on the right is six or six weeks I think post-contest I'm the exact same weight in these two pictures like 220 to 25 the exact same weight it was just crazy right that is a completely different body composition and it was from the diet now I will see this you can't deviate you got a way in measure everything accuracy is very important it's not going to work if you're just eyeballing shit or if you're having a cheat meal it's a good little cheat meal here and there you're not going to get through the results out of it you have to follow the diet you have to weigh and measure everything you have to be meticulous with it that is a mandatory requirement thank you for watching my video hopefully this answered some questions please like and subscribe feel free to ask questions in the comments section if you have them there are other videos you would like me to make let me know I'm happy to do so and follow me on instagram at pole k baronat thank you
