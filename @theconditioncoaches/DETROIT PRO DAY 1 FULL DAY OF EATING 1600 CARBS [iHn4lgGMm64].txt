Good morning, it is officially, we'll call this one day one day one in Detroit. It is up us five in the morning, we've been out for a good few hours. I think we had the same with seven eight clock last night here. Two times which will then equate, see, midnight, UK time. So we're a bit over the place at the moment. I haven't looked at Harry this morning, he's super flat, weight is lighter than when we prior to when we flew. Little bit of water, but nothing crazy. So we're just going to manipulate this day. We're going to start the low-strait way, there's no point hanging around. I know Harry needs a lot of food, so we're going to push it. It's just shy of 1600 carbs a day. So the man is happy after 100 grams yesterday. 100 grams yesterday. Yeah, I'll say this is the first actual day for the whole prep of actually been hungry. You know, that could have been party because of lack of sleep, obviously. And the jet lag in a time difference is, but 1600 grams, obviously we use the same sources the whole time in prep. So it never goes down well, perfectly digest it with your well, no bloat, no any issues at all. So yeah, this will be absolutely fly down. Except that you've got the cookies, so we're going to have to get some cookies. Go to the manabroke pottox, maybe. We're going to get three meals in. Meal ones already in, two more meals in head to the original powerhouse gym. Which is going to be pretty cool. Meantime, I'm going to get back to my UK guys who are all checking in now. And we'll catch it in the gym. Okay, so we got 200 grams of dryweight Jasmine rice. That's a lot of rice. So we chopped up green beans, I like the kiddo vegetables in there just to keep my everything passing through in a digestion. 150 grams of chicken breast and a blueberry bagel with 40 grams of jam. Okay, so it's meal number two. meal number one. We had 175 grams of creamer rice. 25 grams of protein from way I slept. 40 grams of honey, 10 grams of almond butter and 100 grams of raspberry. Meal one for coach today is for whole eggs for egg whites and a very scrammy bagel, which is toasting quite nicely. I'm not sure if you can see it. There is no toast there and there is no cow. So I have to boil water on the hob, old school style for coffee this way. Okay, so meal number three. Another big boy meal. 200 grams of dryweight Jasmine rice. 150 grams of organic grass fed beef mince. Again some chopped up green beans in there. Further digestion. And I'm popping my pot type of ginney and the bread of pot type. So we're going to put the two of these down and let you know the are. So we are here at the original original powerhouse gym. It's a incredible place. A lot of the style to here. A lot of great athletes have come by here and trained here over the years. And this is one of the reasons why I love them. What I do come in place where they sit. We were around the world. We were a little bit more often just sharing that with them. It's crazy over here. Training a bit of pool today. Put the hurry through the rounds where q mu's deep into the load. And I'm just going to put some more off. Just give them a blood move in today. Push it a little bit. A little bit more than we normally were. Just because Harry's full of energy. So I was going to move those cars over pretty well. And then just think a good look after. So it's good to set it up. And then you can place it here. Right here they do all the family reasons. We're going to do that. What did that? I do it here. What did that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You have. Yeah. I think that's great. You can do this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. So Harry is already given this a fun ticket but prevo some fucking here. Yeah. It's incredible. Why manufacturers decide to go so off the rails and we're going to try and move it about everything. Simple things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How is it? We're here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You so good. Yeah. How's it? Yeah. Oh seriously... Oh no.... Well.. So now we can definitely steal the doll with the ass..unden Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom woah its good i have to eat running Oh, no. Nice. Can you see that one a bit? That's it. Just a tiny little bit. Just make it different. You're putting it in three as you go. You're doing it that way. Just lock it in the bottom of your head. You're doing it. Sasha and Juan are in powerhouse complete. Three adults, by set. Done. Harry is feeling great. We're in the perfect position. We're like 10 or 15 seconds alone. Just on that few round of hours in. Everything is where it needs to be right now. For far too many people get caught up in the fact that I'm not full. I'm not dry enough. We've got those that we've got for all day. We've got 70 hours till we're going to be on stage. There's a lot happening up here. It's like a matter of which we're going to meet. It's like a little bit of a point. Like the moment. Today we're going to be about 16 underground archives in. Confident of that. We've crawled it over and over again. We know Harry was so well to it. This could be that's probably my really loaded point for us. And then it's about, let's see how that goes into the next day. See how much food holds us for back end. We are utilizing some natural garbage. And now he takes it out. We need to make sure we're getting the actual�ting as well as we start that process. And then it's just about trying to get that balance of fullness with the dryness that we want to bring. Harry, we want to bring him in absolutely peeled. Harry's never been on stage. Backstimple, this is my goal to make that happen and bring more help with the package. So, I'm going to bring Harry for a ride for us. Okay, so meal number, we're at meal number four now. Post work out. Just hit a back, rear down by step session. Now this is free engine 25 grams, but unfortunately it doesn't fit into one bowl. So we're going to have to split it into two. Not bad problem to have to be honest when you're in cereal. Normally I've cocoa pops, but we're in America, so we've gone for a captain quantity. Gonna enjoy it. Okay, so meal number five, five minutes go. I'll just put down a serving of H2L, remove a little extra bit of water. Then we've got 175 grams of dryweight, jasmine rice. 125 grams of chicken, and again some chopped green beans. And then in the oven at the minute, we've got a nice big thick blue rebago of 40 grams of jam on that. This is meal number five. We're going to total about 1600 grams of carbs a day. 10 liters of water. And then we're going to assess the look, do some posing in the bed as well. The meal number six of seven. Yeah, I feel it's a 101 year. So we are now one more meal away from the final meal. So this is a repeat of the last meal. 175 grams of jasmine rice. 125 grams of chicken, again green beans. As always, and then we've got a nice blue rebago back in the oven with 40 grams of jam. So put this down and then we're on to our last meal of the day, which will be in about an hour or two time. Which is probably my favourite, which is the creamer rice, a little bit of honey, and some raspberries, a little bit of weight as well. So yeah, getting the close to the 1600 grams of carbs now, we need either. So, veg got way isolate inside here. Just for travel purposes, they didn't want to bring a whole tub away. So put it in a nice little electrolyte tub. 25 grams of that. Mix them with a creamer rice cookie dough. So they get the perfect consistency. This is cooked creamer rice almost, so it's a little bit too dry. And then, once you put the isolate in, soft ones up a little bit. It was an if you're just having creamer rice on your own. You just want to get the consistency perfect, and then leave it like that. But like I said, if you over cook it just a tad, then get the isolate in there, and it makes it all nice and smooth on a set. Perfect consistency. And two that. We're going to add 20 grams of almond butter, 40 grams of honey, and 200 grams of raspberries. Last meal, we've got 135 grams of creamer rice, 25 grams of isolate, and then we'll let you light tub. 20 grams of almond butter, marshes have it in last minute, just slow down a little bit. 40 grams of honey, and then 200 grams of raspberries. But you need to weigh them. They won, done. We're in a very, very good position. Harry's fed. He's watered. 600 grams of carbs are going in tenderly, as just over ten years of water, a couple of black coffees. We're starting to see some fullness pulling to a specific, which is good. Let me have some good water health through the day, and with the amount of carbs that you can consume, it's natural for me, it's not about being bone dry at this point. Okay, we've got three days of, another two days, and then it's showday. So it's just trying to get Harry that momentum of bringing the fullness, and then we can start by as an off-mustop, and off the water. It's a good luck for the evening. It's going to get some sleep poofy, so sleep very well last night. I don't know. We've tried a whole afternoon. Get a good night's sleep in, it'll wake up drier, and then I'll set them all in. The Saturday planned the load. It will be another big day, whether it'll be 1600. It'll be, or it'll be close, but we'll pretty much go meal to meal at that point from tomorrow. Today was like the front load of the back load, the front load of the back load. Where we sort of pulled down through, especially with the fly. Just using the 100 grams of carbs yesterday. Today we start the load, and it's just about, then just seeing how that went, trying to throw us across into morning's, looking comparison to days, morning look, and then don't want me to do. We're filled with water tomorrow, and it's a limitation. We'll see. I'm going to go to sleep in a minute. I've got one client planned to do. I'll get some zests.
