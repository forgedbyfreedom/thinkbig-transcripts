Just how would wait nicely he's sitting just below the cap for light heavies, which is carried we obviously want to go in, to see one three weeks ago so every little point we are starting about kilo of toy to them where we were for the regional so everything's fulfilling to play nicely and let's see what happens tomorrow. Same to say – Chenglen being hype and we pay very much thank you so much. So this is probably my first actual decent meal I've had in the last 48 hours. There is now quarter eight during this register during this time meal six will be going down very soon. I don't know if you can see this. And he will be harder in 12 pancakes. I'll probably go to the point, ground to the 30 grams of almond but I'll one banana. I'll give it a squeeze. So roughly 125 grams of carbs, just below 20 grams of fup, a small amount of peri. And we just hate this totem. Today, to 915 grams of carbs and a hundred grams of fups, I'm very don't know, peri. So the plan was just pre-mushed just popping up to the brim, dry them out overnight. In the morning, he will find off. We'll be up about 45 o'clock. We'll take a good look. It won't be some meal in probably around about half five six-ish. And then there will be a general meal probably just like rice cakes, almond but up there, jam. Probably two hours before stage. And then it's just a moment of just rung into the show. No G.I.S. rest, no full-use uncomfortable process of trying to get rid of anything. It's so clear, we'll get the dough from the end hand. And then not bad. See in the morning. You're on me. You're on. Trust me. I'll be fine. You're on me. You're on. Trust me. Hold on to five. What? What? Four. Three. Two. And what? So the show today is called to five. We're just about to go and make dinner. See what he looks like and then plan from there. So show started nine o'clock. Just three hours away. He should be on the end of four hours, or again. So plan first meal. And then see where he says. Go get time. Go from there. Go ahead. You did? No way. Shh. That's great. That's all me. It's all. You did for my slideshow, man. Thank you. Shh.
