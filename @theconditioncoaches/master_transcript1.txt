Day 1, technically day 1, in New York, New York. Everybody is up, it's 20 past five, we're going up for an hour. Adam has somehow miraculously slets through the commotion of the kitchen. Taking a look at Jordan and Harry both in a really, really good position. After a 70-hour flight, there's some tendency to order a little bit of water. We've flushed all the three yesterday. I'm used to not sure, but I read it, it's just a whole lot back. I had a look confident that there was bare minimum water held, which is fantastic. Just planning the load for today, we're going to start today, it is Wednesday, Saturday. So we need to get a good influx of food in both of us, soup, and stuff like soup, and so on. Harry's a prep, although today, all the time prep, low. So it's about filling filling, give these boards some food, some sort of very happy about it. So it's good, good, 3 meals in, and then hit gym, I'm not too sure, probably hit diamonds gym, or whatever, scoop around, we're up to 12 hours from bed, which is a little bit annoying. But I think what it is, I've got more to cut you in the gym. I'm going to put some more food in the gym, and then some more food. So we're going to get back to food and bring them. No, I don't know when, or when, or when, when, when, when, when. Just some food and see how we go with that, and then for that point we can just take it. Oh, I want to make it by meal, and just make some treats on me and eat soup. This is the fun part, the guys are still tired of getting food in, but everybody's against how far and they're actually to eat and drink when you're late in the summer. I know it wiped out. Thing once it gets it's like round, they're going to be okay. Give me still, give me got it! Two guys disappointing, I'm just kidding, don't worry. Give me a little bit of food, don't worry, I'll give a little bite. The food has also increased, and much more than you'll find. Cool, we're nervous. That's going to be ugly, man. Yeah, three meals in. Both flat-spuck sick, man. But in such a very, very, very good position. From here, everything is easily manipulated. They're right where I need to be. A little response from the food. Go and have a sleep and go in, you know. It's good to see both for happy. Yeah. Even the level flat and hungry. But they both know the process. They don't enough time and I was going to work out just, yeah. Locking themselves in and just, you know, just getting them easy, resting. Getting all the fluid down. That's the hardest part. Probably pushing it was fluid in. Over the food. Keep in the... Oh, man. That was good. Yeah. That was a good side. I think that was a good side. I think that was a good side. I think that was a good side. It's a little ban from England. Thank you, gentlemen. Anyone? I got someone with friends. Yeah. I've been a driver. Then it's a little... I'll see you in the perfect. Home the money for where we are. They won't nearly complete the harrow. Jordan and his sleepers, that's all looking at me now. But we're now adopted the garage. It's freaking amazing. Four people. And I'll ask the pose of her in the stove. This is Chuck and Point. It's a life-thousand quick-to-go. And Harry will be a money. They will draw a level for that. And we'll stop through that. So, on the old days, we'll go. On the old days, we'll go. So that's 600 grand before I distinct off the day. And we'll go back to the garage, rather than day. It's just fun, right? And let it go. Let it go. We'll go back. But we won't know when they're asleep. The harrow's asleep. We don't expect to be. And I wish to have a long period of time to be fit in the stage. So it's just a garage that I didn't have in my no-one. We're going to plan. You've got a good baseline off the stage because of the joy. So you know the base line run way for the next few days. And then there's the very small two-tier one now. For us essentially, I'm good for that. So we'll take it over during the second one. And see how we look in and then hit this thing. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. What are you guys? Day two here in New York. It is... Just six in the morning. I've been up for about 10 minutes. How are you? Probably been away. I was waiting for his feet. We've... But those Jordan and Harry, hopefully, they're really, really good spot. Both dry up, a little speech fell out which was good. He's still got TV, so he's a two-for-way guy to us. Just fantastic, but at the momentum, we're starting to make him up now. Now we have a solid baseline to work off. The response from yesterday was good. We're pretty much going to replicate. It's more than one. We're staying on our feet for both guys. But I've literally, there are a couple of me who's at a time and just make sure everything's going to plan. We'll be training after me, we'll get a good look in the gym. We'll see the gym. I've never quite quality American gym. I'm very, very good posing room as well. So we get a good indication of the guys can see themselves as well, which is always a good thing. Just to see how things are coming together, we have a confidence boost. At this point, you're naturally starting to get in the head a little bit, potentially. If you can start to see things coming together, as an athlete is a bit of a win. We're not stressed about the load. You're not worried. It goes a level below. The body then still becomes very responsive. So that's key for me. Just reassuring the athlete, making sure that everything's a good point. And these guys are doing a very well on the body. They're tough enough to get into their 200 grams of course, but there's a flat-chisey and peanut butter jelly sandwiches for breakfast. Adam is a serious athlete. And I'm just a bit of a bit of a plan. Then check in, man I said, so we will probably catch up in the gym. I'm going to do push today for both guys. So we'll be going to see some forward in the chat, wherever they're. Yeah, catch them. Yes guys, we're back here at Sigmundshire Fitness. What an effort place to be out with now. Why is there is crazy? Guys are in for the push session. Just move the blood around. We've been that top show set in this. And see what it looks like. Coach work out. Those are really good. So excited to see it. And that I like, again, just going to you. Left through some light exercise. Nothing crazy. We want to see who the people that would have liked it in this gym, put them to their body. So let's see what it goes. It's getting exciting. And it's a big transform and body out. Yeah, see that. See that. Okay, what do we have to read on the first? We said like, we said you're going to be 1500 knots. We're going on the first week. We've got a lot to do. We've got a lot to do. Okay. I got a lot to do. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, guys. So just had a look at Harry in the posing room in a really good spot. Night and day difference from yesterday's look when we're only three meals in. We're now. Oh, we've got six probably two thousand two hundred grand cards in. And we did very, very good amount of water. For the ex comes alive, which is what we want. We want to a delayed response. Everything's where it needs to be. God game time for the rest of today, which will then put us in a even better position tomorrow morning. First of them be able to to pack off a little bit throughout the day. Clean up the GI. And then probably spiking up any even. So, the manipulation of what will be controlled as a visual from the point to point. Jordan is just literally doing his last set now and then we're going to go and have a look. He's, I can already physically see, he's a lot fuller just wearing a t-shirt, which is a good sign. So, when we get in the pose and remember he's still going to come alive, we'll hit three or four rounds, getting working. And yeah, we go from there, then while there is all the rest of the days planned for him, see how he looks, the see of him as well, and just make some fun and adjustments that need to go into tomorrow. So, it'll be pretty cool. So, it's time to deliver it, try to see it in everybody, apart from how are you doing it. Sorry, maybe it's not. Just coming to the end of the day. Let's go as up on one wheel. Take a look at him in the garage. I'm not even literally cool, so, see where we're at. Then just make the sign and cool for tonight and down to four minutes. So, apparently, there was tomorrow, and half four, five o'clock. See where we're sitting at that point, and then just start to plan the first couple of days. But my body's responded, and then from that point, freezing. I think, it's hard and awfully scratch, it is around about six and eight-ish. So, we've done a bit of a new set, we've got a couple of hours. Head back, and that should be enough. We have in Detroit. Okay, we'll stay in Detroit tonight. It is a shake off today. I'm just a peach munchie. Delicious. It's a retired body game. Yeah, it's a shake off. It's a shake off. Hey let's continue to quit the video first. Let's do this. I'll pay you one more time.

Jamie was coming off the back end the last week shows back to back over all winds, you know, just holding a bit of fluid from that. Hello, bit of a stomach issue, which cleared thankfully as well. We've shifted over here to El Planteo, the place where we always stay here in Alicantee by the VB spaces where the show is going to be held. Jamie's in a fantastic spot, he's just getting dry, a harder fuller by the literally by the hour, it's crazy to see such a good position to be in. Very easily manageable from here, we're just about to head off to the time finnist for the last session, literally just going to move some blood around and hit some rounds of pose in. Have a good look, see where we are and then from that it is literally chilled time up until the show tomorrow we've got a massage book then just over there, then flush free other than that the mum and his literally is going to sleep and then eat and so perfect position to be in, we're seeing the jump. Yeah, oh, I love how we are like, come on my gol 뭐가e I will be there okay I'll be there We have a good, good, good, good. We have a good, good, good. We have a good balance. Yeah, it's our first time. We had to first show this to shoot the number of people. Yeah, and that's a big impact with that. That was on the show. You know, that's like how far I doubt it. You know, so you prefer to get that time and you know, you can, like, say, be friends, I would like to think to this because the body is, you know, you're reapspacing. I'll get knowledge about that. Um, do that now... Yeah, cos this is car Garcia. I'll try hiatzefEsair. I'm so sure. Yeah, see that, i think?atto. Don't tease him. It's not an added effect on the face. This is the best way of being made to love Martin. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. You can compare the taste. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. It's a good way to get rid of the dust. Jim and Dunn and Dust did the last workout here. Jim is loom fucking ridiculous. Full blown. Like we're in the power set position. So we set a rough guy like him. We guys to knew it was so today. Put three in pre. We had a reasonable day yesterday. The fullness that I seen this morning was good. It's just got better out the day. We moved some blood. Everything's held pretty much where it needs to be. We've not seen any depletes show. We've not seen any say it off. We guys are that fullness. Which person is in a given front-passed position. Just be able to pull back a little bit. We got three meals now post workout. We just had meal thighs. So there's only one more meal to go. So we're just pulling back a little bit now. With the weight of the body composition is in the moment. It's perfect. We know in the morning. The look is very, very good. And by tomorrow morning to be even better than this morning. So yeah, we could have been about to spot right now. We're still 36 hours from stage, which is a long, long time in the week. You know, especially at this point of the week. And now the Jamie's feeling good. And just happy. That's what he needs for you. He's tired. We had a late one last night. So just going to hit the sack and just chill out for the rest of the night. And then you're missing. That's all your body needs is just for rest now. And just go like this. Give you back into a position where you're just chillin there. And more I look alive for tomorrow. And then just cruise through tomorrow. Small changes here in there. The possible bargaret of fries. The tomorrow night. We know we know once we're really well with Jamie's physique. So the day he stayed. We can pull back for you out the day tomorrow, which is a blessing. Because then it tears the GI. And then we know that we can shock him in the evening. We can do a good high calorie meal, which is going to work wonders. We've traveled it last week. And the response was fantastic. So it was different scenario. We've got to back to show us. It worked just from seeing the visuals from that. We can we know we're confident going into this. That we can utilize it. So we're just finding games there. We're going to follow. So we will touch base in the morning. In the morning. In the morning. Yes, guys. It is Saturday. They were foreshows. We are just going to head out to Don't see Monica who's going to do an influx for Jamie. I'm going to show you a bit of a stiff shoulder sort of transfigure up. And then we're going to have a little bit of a stiff shoulder sort of transfigure up. And then head to registration, Tand. They're using a fantastic spot. Worker performing dry. Laying for an extra soft. As expected. Always happens. It was able to get a couple of good meals in the morning. They were just backing off again. Just keeping that balance as fullness. And then it's allowing the water to dry the body. We've just had a quick look now. These skid and dry by the hours. Just one touch. And this was one of the most fullness was a GDSA. And it's just about keeping that. And then just keeping the balance and just trying to suck all the water out. Ready for tomorrow. We still got probably. A good 204 plus hours until he's on stage. We'll just assess me or why meal. We'll see how he's looking after the side when the tans on. And just give us that again just a better indication of how things are looking. Go from there. So. Catch him back. He's going to just yeah. Move long, rather. Shift index causes negative speed. Nice. Alright, I came to fight these199 years! Break that mood to us. I've got to be looking at my soul. 10-4 years ago. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's clap. And before the boys get their bag guys, we are here at Gui Coat. I think it's pronounced in Alec County. It's pretty epic. Wait for the feed, the feast. Registration done. No turning. So, too much of Jamie's joy. Time it will be done. It's three cos tomorrow morning, which is freaking fantastic. So, we've scored a sleet. Not stressed about being sticky and sweating is harder. So, that's another of the bless. We are in a position where Jamie can be fed quite a bit. We've driven down through the day. We've kept it quite very tight. You know, if the body is there, it's pretty much ready to rough. We just want to take top up tonight. We're just going to hold it for tomorrow. It's a pull off the water. Yeah, it's going to be exciting. So, we're going to be excited. Sam is joined us. He's grabbing himself. He's immense. He's probably the tool that I have. No idea what class they're going to draw. So, probably the tool is class. He's looking sick. He's done the apples rolling himself. So, he's a now feed in himself as well. So, let me get it. We're going to get it. We're going to have a bag of this. But yeah, it's very much as a smart. It's a good show. It's very, very good. I think that's a good show. We'll see what happens. Well, that's one of my favourite. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. That's my favourite. I'm going to try it. It's not a biscuit base. It's like a cake base. It's a buttercream. Big. Nice though. It's very very. You can tell it's baked up from the crust. Let's see if we can see it in a different... ... or a restaurant. Last one you have a competition. This should just traditional Spanish tea. If you've made one, right. There you go. Hey guys, yes, it is so late. Everything's there. We're ready to rock. Really in a good spot right now. It's going to be a good show.

So we're going to get an arm session in. Being very careful. I'll slightly a bit of an injury. I've got a little bit of a lost territory. I've got a lot of stuff in the back. I've been here with a couple of weeks. So hopefully that'll be good. We're going to have an in-person check-in. See where we're looking at. I know we're in a good position. We're in a very very good position. So to see if my own eyes, then I'm going to get some content for the ground. What's that? It's down for me. What makes I think it's? Yeah, come on. You again.

You've got to watch it pull about six-bates with horse, what wide-brake, so that's exactly it. In just my outfit, I can't do it. So I've had the increase of volume. Bit more reps. Yeah. It's the same as the tempo down. You've got to train smart. Yeah. Yes. First of all, I think there's a certain train to get away of the younger, like in your 20s, you train more like, like, rather, like, sorry, and style, like, probably on failure. Then we get over 30 small, he-hainy, like, stimulate not a lot of, yeah. Yeah. Train, like, evolve with your body. He-he-he, basically, as you get old, trains smart. Yeah. Yeah. I've got my head.

We're not low. We're not low. No, coming to play by more so written than you've really drive. It's keeping the front tension on the tricep making sure that the track really doesn't come to play either. Very good movement. Very good compound movement. I always good on it. I'm low. Come on.

You're not talking about that. You're not talking about that. Keep moving. I'm just getting flat brakes. I say last week, we're just... We'll just pull last week, I'll do the first thing full. Then that immediately, we're dropping water, maybe feel a bit tighter. Yeah. And the last couple of days, right, we've dropped a little bit more. I feel a little bit slid. I know, don't, obviously, in the poor spectrum, but that hasn't prepared to what I look like. I feel like skinny fact going. I'll say, you know, we're fine. It's nice to learn how to make things. Making things. Making the life. I'm fine with it, guys. You're in fact on the moment when that's made, we're getting to share shows. You know, like, oh, yeah. It's just trying to explain it to us, it's impossible, yeah. Go away from here. SCARTS Get off. Go away! yeah yeah oh Yeah, that's been all to change. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's part of the process. Oh, I'll come up. I mean, we'll reach the boat. Yeah, but then you're always running down our own. Yeah, yeah, I'll try and do as well, make sure. You come down in like four octaves, you'll be following us two weeks and a half. What's your new trend? Zoom, Zoom, Zoom. So, and maybe you spend a half an hour. Probably, probably, that's giving us a lot of work. Yeah, yeah. I meant nobody knows about that. So all the times. I know, so that's what they want to bring them up to. So you can enjoy Christmas. It's still a wrap. But it's just what the history is. Yeah, and they've been with that. Yeah, exactly. It's the day off. We'll go, yeah, I'm fine. So I only take Christmas day off in the Greenwich Bank. Three and bucks today. Anyway, yeah. There's always a good day off. And hopefully that's a nice episode. We've got a really healthy day off. Yeah, I mean, to get through one day, and we'll talk to the new needs of the routine. Right, so yeah. I get a bonus for that. You know, there'll be a good quad. And you're back in the play. Yeah, yeah. I mean, in the needs of jumping to get better now, so I've got them well to just maintain just on the flip. You only done three sets of the leg extension, three sets in the hamstring leg rest. What you want to do, last short, three four months, which is a good, so just when we need to get there, hopefully, I'm going to be able to put back in the hamstring. Maybe I hope you'll barbell, course, my family. No, exactly. A week point. No, you want to. Thank you. You still want to feel that? You still want to support the position. Yeah. I'm going to move the blood around it. I'm blessed to have you in the doubles with the details. So we'll do tell you that we've done it. And you might let your quad-ratching, one of the last things coming from your action, you need to get virtually destroyed, least for I get those quad-cells. That's what people are seeing. When they do come in up to that, they make them look like they're big as us. That's good feedback for me as well. Like, that's what I'm trying to get. But you know, the starting, I'll be looking up for the front. Yeah, just that fucking quarter three next time. Yeah, I'm so excited to look at different ways of my back shots coming almost to a view. And we're still looking at the back. I can have straight hamstrings, to loosen up, if they lower back in. And I still have more to come up from the front, which is the way it can be, it's able to hold around you. So I just need a little bit more time for those quad-cells. You know, coming a little bit more. And that's where I'm with the timeframe that we've got. We've got that time period to bring it in. Almost solidified that condition. And it really good. So when I'm chasing our after, the kick-up, I think that's the fact that. So, especially with the amount of shoes, depending on how many shoes we want to hit. Yeah, keep it going. We want to keep going as long as we can. Yeah, that's another thing as well, like I said, that my physique generally gets better. The more shoes I do, I don't tend to burn out. I get better and better rather than, yeah. You know, doing a show and then getting worse, I'm going to go get tight and start it off. And I'll go. To be fair, mate, I'll find that a lot with the top half needs. Because I always say that you can go 100% and then start for a show. You can be a 100% but then once you've had that little bit of, you've been on say, you've never been to that little bit of respite, you've got that sort of next. So, get a gas to push it to the next show. And you can almost speed out that next year for a cent like. Yeah, so then take your on and on and on. So, don't worry, come hang some of that. Yeah, yeah. So, I always believe in that. You know, it would have get better. It was a wide barrier, it was perfect. It's like, you can only push the body so fast. Yeah, it's actually great. And you're starting up from a different start from the, you're pushing it from a different postshow and then again from the night to check your tyre, you can get down from there. So, you see it back into the time that they do. Some of them need to do what they keep with you, for example, makes it do a couple of more of your favourites. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know that, I know that, I can line up four or five shows. But know that you've put it in and put it in and put it in. It's going to get managed there. So, run it to that. Yeah. And that'll be very much like you. There's a lot of you manage this period. And give you fresh, fresh as you can be. And fresh. Yeah. You can get managed. And you just keep that for three of them in control. And then you're all in your stuff.

You're just going to have a vaccination. I was probably going to have a vaccination. I've already got about five minutes to the guys on stage. I'm going to be so excited to see some of that happening. So apparently a lot of good players come over. Wow. So we're just going to see what happens. See what happens. They unfold. Everybody's on the money. They've done everything. They can't. Can't see. You're a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, don't. No. Double mindset. Black Spray. Face front, overhand of the envelopes, and your favorite most muscular. Back in German, you can follow up. Please, long give your next competitor one zero wave for side coin. Blacks, quarter turn to the right. Face the back. Double bicep. Relax. Quarter turn to the right. Face front. Back in German, you can exit. All right, Juggie, tell you how many back you reached. That's our 35 and 40-light up. That's our boys' bicep. Juggie, face the back. Double bicep. Face front. Overhand of the envelopes. Your favorite classic for Zipos. Gentlemen, back you very much. That is pre-juggie wrapped up. So, Baron, like heavy. Just hiding a bit of in today and there were some freaks in that lineup. Jesus Christ. A lot of guys with hollow legs. Very very good standing in light heavy. So, Baron, unfortunately, didn't make the top five. Looking at probably six places in that lineup. It was ten in his lineup. Maro, heavy weight. Fantastic lineup again. We're looking at potentially second. Good squeeze first, maybe. It was like close. The column line is in that line. He's looking very, very good, very sharp. So, it's a matter of just seeing what they're just saying at the finals. Shortly, we're probably about an hour away from that. And then, ReStavis, fantastic. Took me master's classic, plus 40, class. We have a game plan moving forward to him. Today was a bit of a warm-up interview. We've worked together for such a short period of time. We now are in in to Romania. Okay, four weeks later, I'm pro-baller by Hugo for it. There's a bit of a card. We're in to see what the result is from Maro. If it doesn't come to you today, let me go again in two weeks. Germany. And Darren is on his way back to the apartment, because he is on stage tomorrow now of the PCA Finals. We've catch up in a bit, post-finals. And we'll go for that. This is how legends are made. Please welcome your next guest. See, Mooru, Mooru, move ahead. Third place fellow, Pittsburgh sent it to one, e-eleven. Brother Slav, cost it enough. That's self-remeral goes to your heavyweight runner-up competitor, one, zero-seven, Mooru, move ahead to the body building overall. Your heavyweight chat, Kielo, bye. Two rows of British finals. I'm sweet. We are done to the day here in Manchester. Smudge on the cart head down to Talford. Good day. It was good finals, Maro ended up with second place in the heavyweight. Fantastic note, Kielo. A little bit sharper again. The finals, however, they obviously didn't judge. There was no good parisans running in. So it was just a good to see how well he proved again from last week's. That came in the quarter-ghosts. Yeah. Please, with everything today, everything's gone to, well, part of it obviously not taking past places, but everybody was happy with their results. Everybody looked fantastic. Now on the TCA bridge, we'll see you. Help it. That's it. Nice. Nice bro. Nice bro. I'm going to play some of them. Fullness tonight, and then back off tomorrow, we'll be trying to keep showday as obvious as possible. I'll be able to do it. Probably get it never me in and then I'll lay back on the fly. Yeah. So we took six meals, plus the burger for us. Yeah. I think maximising the fullness. Now we'll go crazy on this last meal. We'll probably just have to chicken them rice. Or what we got. Yeah, I've got everything in the bag. Yeah, because that was a hundred seconds chicken. But it's a great rice and bingles. How many bagues do we want tomorrow? I mean, you got me the man. Then go up three or four. That'd be fine. We got rice cakes as well. We got two packs of rice cakes a sandwich, just got the one. Yeah, we got bagels. I'll definitely make a quick move. I think we used chicken and rice just for the next meal. I can cook rice for the morning as well. Yeah, if you need any more rice to it. How much rice do you got left today? I've got enough for tonight. Yeah, so tonight we'll be able to now. You're four-jump grams, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, three four-jumpers still have a little less. And it's not from should we do another rice for tomorrow? You can do just because it's going to be a long day. If you want to cook one up, we'll have probably a cream of rice meal in the morning. And then probably a chicken of rice meal. I don't have a cream of rice. I probably just do an easy one. Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't know more rice. I know you make a room cream of it. Do you like it? Yeah. Any longer drawing drawing? For the whole. Real up. You're right. You've got some, I like six, six, thirty. Yeah. You're just looking to experience a pain of butter. Never hungry butter. Yeah, it's a good one. I've got you know the cast, and we talk. Yeah, never. Keep running, you're drawing that nicely. You keep going. You hungry. Yeah, I can start. I'm really in the sense for you. So, yeah. I've been in the flowing meal. That's nice. Hardly. What would you like just make me draw a load from here? Yeah, I've got some bits to do with it. Okay. Hold on a bit. Let's have a look. Yeah. Yeah, and you saw that that you just make sure this is what it's showing. That's it. That's it. That's it. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. But at least that'd be longer than it. We've worked for you for your house. Go for him. Yeah. We've just sitting down for a lot of the car for an hour and so just bought a lot of back into the easy answer. We're going to get very close in here. Okay. That's a bit. That's a bit. That's a bit. Um. It's not just. It's going to be two seconds I have thinking. Um. What's next on your plan? Chicken rice. 154 grams chicken. So rice. Yeah. So if I was chicken, I think. So I think. I think like you can push large fries if you need. You're going to have a bit of a little bit of a bit of something. They're really digested and stressed by trying to climb a ball in. Let me think. Yeah. If I take. I'm going to stack the cheese under. And I thought you should have one slice of cheese. Yeah. I'm going to even do something. Yeah. There's going to be enough fat in the. Yeah. Yeah. Honestly, if I just have a burger. Yeah. Bread. Yeah. So yeah. I'm rather not. Yeah. There's going to be enough fat's food. We're a burger itself. Yeah. Sounds good. Sounds good. Yeah. Make sure we go into our guests in our lives. Yeah. I've got some. You know, bought some of me. Yeah. I've got some with me. Yeah. Um. If my eyes are next to it. You're not trying to. I don't know if I can do that. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, you can. You can certainly. Put that in. Um. Just going to bring you more to life. Sure. For us. Yeah. Through the night. And then tomorrow. Just hold in that. I'll see you fast in the morning. Sure. I'll make one meal in. Yeah. I'm just going to sit well. And then just grow. So we have landed now in Tauber. We are at the holiday in. And I am lost. I think we're going to speak. To reception. Possibly. Um. Just being to see Alex Andrew. And George, all of you fantastic. Wait for reception. See you. Find shack. And then see Steve. I think that's it. Who's staying here. Who's there on you. Stay in Manchester. Yeah. Everything's looking really good. Taubering on day. But everybody's happy. Just get somebody's eyes getting very hurt. Right. But every time I get. Um. I'm going to eat today. And then I'll just put it in. Yeah. Um. I'll say. Currently. Just trying to find our way to reception. So. I'll show you a bit. Breathe out out before you get into it. So we're going to. When you're here. Yeah. By the time you finish the end of your post. Yeah. You're going to be all the air out. You don't any. You don't. You don't any air here. Push it out. When you're facing this way. You want to be like. All the way out before you head into that post. Got me. Sense. Nice. That's it. Yeah. Nice. Do you feel like connecting a little bit more. Yeah. You're going to pass it for your back. We all out. Sick. Nice bro. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now you're going to want to show that condition through the midsection. Your strength is pulling that back and making your waist narrower. And your then top line is expanded. Okay. So I think working with that on your physique is going to be an advantage. You can see that you're going to benefit us. Okay. Certainly. You know I'm saying, but you don't work to our strength. But the guys that you're going to be going against. I'm going to do this. Yeah. Front double. Yeah. It's a bottom part. Perfect. And that's what we need to do. I think that's that's your strength. If we can make you this. Because we're not going to get caked in dry. Okay. These guys are assisted. You're not. You're going to be on the money. We play through the strengths that we've got strengths as your level and pop. Yeah. Okay. Your top line. The amount of tissue that you can display. Yeah. And if we can make that look crazy. X-raying. That's I think the the the the run that will approach us with. Because. There's going to be some cute guys. It's a very fun. And I mean. You condition is there. But your look is bubble. But we're going to be. That's going to be our benefit. Because I'm going to have the. I'm going to have the help of you. And that's what you have to do. That's what you're going to do. Cause that's what you're going to do. You're going to do that one. And you can do that. You can almost hide your breathe in. Does that make sense? With that front arm covering the midsection. Okay. You see that on the same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All these little things. We're going to go. And I can't. Obviously on that stage we've got somebody to go up there. little cool control your transitions steady plow within. But it's not too much now but there's a few today that's all with. Yeah, I think that's gone. Yeah, and for us if I can maximize fullness tonight then again tomorrow we still don't need food. Yeah, just an hours volume. Yeah, I mean so, hit your... So in time, yeah, do that on again. Yeah, perfect. Go on and make. I've got to go then. And if you've got to last me or me, is that if you're last me or me? There's no of them here. You're five in any? You're five in your zone? Seven, five. One. Yeah, cool. Yeah, I'm gonna see you now tonight. Yeah. Because you always use to talk about me and your fellow and then the burger and what do you think? Yeah. So just top yourself up. Okay. 75 or 100. 100, but yeah. Okay, just because I want to keep that in. I can fucking make a mess. Your side chest now mate, your chest is really... I know you probably haven't seen me ever. Yeah.

Both guys, one in the class, and everyone's heavy weights, that are absolutely incredible. George wants to see if they're heavy weights, look absolutely incredible. They both battled it out in the overall, and George came away with the pro cards. So we have had a very good day at the office today. Okay, emotional. So we'll catch you later. So we are literally about to get on stage. And our Charlotte is backstage pumping up, she's definitely saying, making this beautiful, and she's ready to make them out. So let's see what she looks like now. Hey, face bro. What a turn to the right. What a turn to the right. Face fun. Thank you, ladies. I'm just a winner on our own. And that is another day done. We are finished. I'm done. The end of that day. It's been a very good day both. Very long. I've been here since 7 o'clock this morning. It's now 7pm. Everyone, it's much super heavy, incredible lineup. Took fast pace. George, super heavy weights. Game at fun, toss it, line up, smash that first place, and then battled in the overall and George took the pro cards. So a very good day for the 13. Yeah, we should give it half to you. Because they both deserve the pro cards today. But unfortunately, just the one. Yeah, then I'll start on the evening, or see she's done masses and open. Second in her class, but she's not upset because she's put the better package to speak. And even the judges said she's come back so much better. And people are always very positive. So people are going to be a prize in the off season, and then she'll come back. We're good. That's it. We are going to head up to Stafford now because we have the PC, it's nice to have you tomorrow. But for now, we'll catch you next time. Thank you.

=== FILE: BEN WEIDER UK NPC PRO QUALIFER - NEW IFBB PRO FLORIAN TORRES [e9vUQ-QB2ks].txt ===

Hey guys, welcome back to the YouTube. It is the Ben Weed UK Pro Polifier weekend. It's Friday afternoon and registration is in a couple of hours. Less than a couple of hours now. One and a half hours. It'd be a very precise look at that. Florian upstairs here. Very, very hungry. Under his cap waiting to be weighed and registered so he can eat. Luckily, Josh and Florian are both staying in the same apartment block. It's fantastic for me, I'm following this down the road. Been more than 13 years since last night, every couple of meals to conclude your different approaches. It's just cool. We've Josh coming off the back end of the first regional couple of weeks ago because we've got some really good data. There are things for me into places as well. There's a few in honourable eased in honourable, I don't know, I can't say the word, the fat word. Going into the regional which we were able to spin around and bring one out of the lip to that stage, very condition, bubbly, physique. He's already in a bad position now going into this show, which is good, I'm so afraid. It's a very good lineup in Super. Florian, class B, class C. I already know that it's going to be a very good lineup in class B. A couple of other good guys in class B as well, so I'm excited for it. It's going to be a good show. Coming off the back end of Fibo, last weekend, I'm still very hyped on the so close so close. Two is an LMP qualification, a private input in place with him for the minute. We should be going again very soon. Don Fibo, fantastic package, Dom's best look. Two day, he's in the class of 15. Of course, that can place unfortunately. It's a bodybuilder when we enter the day. It was a close call, but he don't very well, and again, planned to be a bit of a place for potential returns to the stage at some point soon. So, I'm going to go and check out the guys now and then go from there and we'll see you at Reg. This is a good, he's about the kilo under on his scales under the wake cap. It's just about to have a look at Jocelyn. So, just checked on the guys, Florian is looking very good. He's super flat waiting for some food, desperately hungry. He's only had about three eggs and literally in total 200 gram per chicken. And about 500 grams of nut butter, about 500 ml water, all day. It's now an hour away from Reg, and we're below the cap holding nicely. Meals planned, but one meal, big meal planned to get in. You just got to be careful because I'll see you in the position where we need to get food fluid, so we're going back in and you got to get it at the right pace. It's not about just completely just overloading in with food for the foreseeable overnight into the show. It's an early show tomorrow. And he pulls a great vacuum as well, so we need midsection to be super tight. So it's about that balance of getting the right amount of water in, sodium and then a comfort of the amount of carbohydrates over the period of time. I'll probably haven't feed enough until late, smaller meals, rather than just sort of just maybe into a three meals in. That are really big. Again, just seeing how it's stomachs. It's Josh's looking really good. Very happy with the low, the body's responding. He holds fullness so well. So in a position where I'm able to even pull carbohydrates, let the diarrhea's process really sort of take effect because you're not adding carbs into the equation and then be able to spiking up a little bit later on. So it's exciting to watch the favorite part of me. I'll be yeah, that's about it. I've got a couple of guys on in Scotland tomorrow doing Naba Scotland. They're in Chris, both looking good. I'm just waiting for their update after meal number four each. I think they've got a big hook. It's all good at those things just joking. So look at that now, get his next meal planned out and then note out Chris will be checking in at some point soon and then get him ready. For his next meal and that's about it. Four guys on this weekend all hoping for good results. Lemonbuster brof. Five minutes. So it is registration time. Florian is very hungry. He's comfortably under the cap now. Well, hope he is. This guy was a reading wrong. I'm going to look mad. But yeah, everything's looking good. Josh is just chilling. He'll make his work at some point zero stress on his behalf. Very much in a good position. We're going to get this done feed Florian put 200 grams of carbs in in pretty straight away, pretty straight away with a little water in total mixed with his core and to drink. This is so the end back in him and just bring him back to life. He's smart. That's all part of the process. Funning games making weeks up. Not as fun as what we've done last week with Monzie that was a pretty damn crazy beer. That's another day. Yeah, it will go Oh, check him in a minute and then find out what Josh is. He's good. Huh? He's giving him some food. Are you his now? All right. Yeah. Thank you. Perfect. So Florian has just made way. Kila went there with T-shirt on so we just wanted to become the book because recently experiences some skills we different some people hype from. So just making sure there's additional stress and we've got to run away and drop a Kila we'll see. 200 grams of carbs are now going in and Florian is very much enjoying that from cream and rice dates. Fruit, rice cakes, honey and yeah. That'll do sit very nicely. It's very similar approach to what we've done last week. France, Ray Warnier of Rural. We'll do this. Last week we played it a little bit tentatively because of the chance of the rebound coming off the back end of the show. We've been traveling as well and just wanted to smooth process. So it was about 85% last week and now we go 101% so the peak can now become as more fun because I can deal all in with him. So yeah it's going to be fun. Josh is on his way so we'll touch base with him in a minute. The guys don't get tired for about an hour and a half or so so they'll head back to the apartment and come back in a bit. Yeah so maybe game time now. Florian Josh, yeah kilo under with T-shirt on. Is it heavy? Yeah. Are we having a view that more? Yeah we're still like, so how much do you got left Or will you't have a woman like us trying to out? Yeah, just put another grandma and she think that is swimming quite well. I can't. No, no, no, no. I'd rather just let that go through and then as soon as back on me, like, I'll work out what we're going to be. I'll have a look at you after tunting. Again, just seeing how that shift in. Okay, and then go from there. Just chill for a minute. Half an hour, hopefully you'll be in tunting for 30 minutes. That is registration done. The boys are tunting. Just some of the little and both and they are both looking very, very good. Very happy. I've got two guys, Chris and Dan now checking in Litchie as on to in this. And yeah, they're looking brilliant as well. So all the plan and Josh's joy a lot. Josh is on chill mode at the moment because we're going to plan a big meal in about an hour of 15 minutes. Slawian needs to get home now and eat. There's a couple of meals that we're going in and then we have probably a little bit more of a calorie dense meal in the back end of tonight. Just so then sit well for tomorrow and then see how it looks and that is it? We'll catch you tomorrow. Show that you. Yes, guys, good morning. It is showday. It is, possibly even telling the right time. So on the by time. It's cool past 8 in the morning. I've been up since 4 o'clock. Check them the guys early. Got a meal in super early. Just really because the only show star we just want to make sure that everything is perfect. So can't waste any time in the morning. Josh's getting tanned. It was top coat, Florian, little over there just waiting to hit the stage. He is perfect. He's ready. It's a bit good day. Chris and Danen, Scott them two guys up there for Peter's Day and then Abbas Scotland. They've checked in this morning early. They're on their way to the show. It's good. It's going to be a good time out today. It's good athletes. They're going to be hitting the stage. It's going to be exciting. I'm going to head back stage with a good backstage stage of the tanned and now we're going to check on Josh. See how he's doing. where are you guys? the right. Clutes. Quarter turn to the right.

Thank you, Steven. So that is it. Session wrapped up Maro. I'm just joined us all the way from Portugal. Just done rounds with a guy here and that is fantastic. I'm happy to be here. I believe everybody is very, very good spot. It's Thursday. This is something to Sunday. But from what I'm seeing, everybody is at their best this point. Really is the everybody in the position where they don't need a sandwich feed. And they don't need a sandwich dry enough. So it's almost just like cruising into their show. From the very easy, easy to control with meal to meal. Across the next three days and it's just landing it on the day. I'm very excited. I've literally two scums all the way through. It all feels like a big positive sign. What do you guys are happy? They're feeling at their best feed over done. You know, they're looking at the best they've done. And definitely we can ask this. It's a good to hear. But I look like that. There you two, Alacampty Cup, a striding morning. Guys, I've got a meal in. I don't look at them this morning. I'm running a very, very good position. We sort of semi-loaded yesterday just because we know the show is going to be late on Sunday night. It's actually shifted even later. They're going to probably have 910 o'clock at night. I do. But we sort of plan for it anyway. So it's not a problem. We're going to go in. They will have their final session now. Just move some blood around the upper, take a look and then plan the rest of the day. And we're going to go to some meals. We'll have a couple of meals now. So we know where we are. It's just then stoop in the hammock. I need now for the rest of the day. So we'll see you there. Me and Alacampty Cup session in last night. We're having a train. A little bit of dogs. I'm actually going to go back and train at the things that we've said. But we're going to go back and train. We're going to go back and train. And that is it. We've done it. It's done it. It's final session of the 2024 season for Mark and Lewis. Had a good look. Post post workout. I'm so tired. So loads of looking fantastic. Dryer filler. Both very happy with the position we're in with a couple of meals in. And it's all going to plan. We're going to go back. Lewis will be able to set out. Mark's out. You can hear rivals. Mark and Terry have just arrived. So we'll catch up with them. We'll catch you later. Have you done the weekend with them? Alacampty Cup. We're going to be on the right hand. We're going to go back. We're going to go back. We're going to go back. We're going to go back. What are you guys? We are back again at the train. We're going to go back. We're going back back. We're going back. We're going to be on until about half past nine. Possibly teleclock tomorrow night. The game plan is to pretty much shift. Everything. everything, a few hours back, so meals are late and they go to bed late, wake up late, it's tomorrow and it just shifts that timeline which unfolds in half a day with the show will be in later. We've come here just because we've got the same light, Abba Al-Qamaro, Lewis and Mark, all fasted, first of the morning. I can plan out today, the meal, two meals at a time will then come back here, rinse and repeat. Everybody's at different places, everybody's got different protocols, we have a forward, and it's something that we have to manage literally just as a point of just seeing how the body responds. meal, pamele and pimele were warm and a little bit in it and the other good bits. So we're going to have that now and we'll set everybody up for that first meal and then Monica has either come into us or we're going to have massage, myor is not registration, we've then got athletes meet for athletes meet at 4 o'clock, they planned out so we catch a bed all the time. Yes guys we're here at VV spaces. We have some help stumbled across a rest-living. Big man is setting up, and it's probably a bit of a start in the end. So we see how on time that will be. Everyone's on point, everyone's really, really much in an excellent position where we're just literally just taking it meal when we all... Everyone's getting dry and we'll get in there. So we'll be Friday to where we're running the ring. But that was good dry and it's getting very exciting. We are all about 30 hours up from here. It's going to be happier. Yeah, because everybody's out in the reception area. It's probably the most happiest scene a lot of Hollywood in the long-term. There's 26 open guys. There is actually more open guys in the community. I've showed some of the show tomorrow. Everybody's in a good spirit, everybody's in the same of the future, everybody's in a real good vibe. So looking forward to it. It's going to be a good backstage and a kind of way to start. See how I've been going to make those. Okay, he's long-term so we're going to share with you all. He's going to take that into that circle. Okay, looking forward to putting on a very interesting show tomorrow. Thank you, Martin. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. We're going to get out for no-no evening when I'm smart choice. I'm from the UK also. So it's a fun call that's in the little community with me, supporting NWP, but out here because we're about you and us. We're able to organise this. It wouldn't be a show basically. So this is my first show. Definitely improved on each show. So hopefully we'll get good time on stage. We'll be rest of the careers. Thank you. And I'll show to the rest. Thank you, thank you Martin. Lloyds. Good evening. Very excited to be here. This was actually my birthday view of years ago. I haven't improved massively since then. So I want to say thank you to a million everybody. Put on such an amazing event. Madison, all the judges and the IFBB because without them we wouldn't be here today. And I am very excited to showcase what I bring it tomorrow. And that's everybody wants to jump up on stage and do a preview night. Or you can wait for tomorrow. Thank you very much. Thank you. Yes guys, so we're here, we are back stage. A VB space is it is show today. First up, we have obviously, it's the region, it's the pro qualifier. Maro is pretty much ready to rock. He is the best ever. Maro said to him, when we come off stage in Romania, it was the best and he said, he can't get no better. He said, he can't get no better. I think we've troubled it and it does look really, really good. It's a good way to finish the season. We won't actually do this show in after Romania and the excitement. I think he was just buzzing to get back up on stage. And now it's time to finish the season in style. Very happy, Maro is happy. We should see what happens on stage now. We should be a couple hours, but it looks there now. We just hold it and it's good to go. We're on the boys this morning, early doors, when the Titans seem like they're set for their first couple of meals. Whilst I'm here, and then as soon as Maro is finished, I'll be running back home to check on them. And then there will be a late tonight, so they're just going to be sleeping and eating for the minutes. So, all is good. Like we do before, you know, right, just make sure this is good. Top yourself up, three, four rice cakes. Yeah, everything's there. Everything's there. Everything's there. There's nothing left. Like even when you sometimes do that, and you get a little bit here on this one, just everything's like home dry. And because you're posing better with that rear last bread, as well as holding it and nothing is spuckin' perfect. Absolutely perfect. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yes, what do you think? Writing books here in FAA' That's all we do. We don't expect four ice-creams to come. I think about five minutes, 60 minutes. Right? So we're doing a lot of work. So with the event, but I'm going to do some drives to the van to share. Everyone thinks it's going to be a lot less. So, okay, it's not worth going to do some straight-line but I must have to show a good book. It's where a lot of people are wrong. And they keep feeding themselves before they go on stage. So they're working. Right, so they want to get the money to go on a get-a. Honey, everything in. You know, we're in the Parvintz decision. But we're doing a track in the front of the van. We're doing a track in the front of the van. Well, what we do is we have to feel muscle left. So we're going to take the car. Oh, no, that's water. Is that water? Hello, hello, hello, hello! What are you looking at? Help, help it. Yours, Maru! Here! Yours, yeah! Welcome! Try something this and give them a word. Control it, Maru, control it! Come on, Maru! Yes! That's fun! It's two of us, that's two of us! I'm going to be certain. What's the Maru? Come on, Maru! Hey, Maru! Here we go! Thanks for watching. Really power free! Yes, better! You can go in there and throw it! What a moment! Tight, better! Yes, better! Yes, better! Stay there! Hold on! Follow me! Yes! Thanks! Thank you! Hey! Oh my people! What a nice adventure! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Don't try anything! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Next! Go! Go! Go! Don't make you lose! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Next one, two, three, four! Next one, two, three, four! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go there! Go! Go! Go! Let's switch off… Do it again! Go! Go! Go! Go! So, offstage, Maro so close in the overall, the one is class out of nine. I think it's nine in the class in Heavyweight. Really good lineup that we've really expected and some good guys out of Maro dominated the heavy season then went into the overall very close between the Heavyweight, like the Super 4 rounds, 4 full solid rounds and Maro left to Maro that's sentenced to the end. So heart rate went up a little bit and unfortunately they give it to the Super, they do have the opportunity to have a super happy, thank you for everything. We're in turn to the right. Thank you. Maro, thank you very much. Maro, close seven. What if it be nine? Yes, three, three. Can I hear it? One, six, ten. In the air, in the air, all that. Class, face to back. The winner. Class for a gentleman. Face to back. The dollar pose. Relax. Two, seven, six. One, six, five, six, seven, five. Tristan, in the side. Face to back. Okay, gentlemen, double-bice. Class, one, eight, you want six, ten, three, spread out. Four, spread out. Double-bice. Class for a gentleman. Face to back. Six, six, three, spread out. Yes, guys, so this is the official wrap-up from Spain. It was a very late night. We finished. We got out of half-ass one. It was a great show from both Mark and Lewis. Both, incredible package. Maro was there. He actually won the heavy weights and was that close in the overall for the pro card. Show of the year for Lewis, the last show of the year for Mark. Both had incredible seasons and I'm very excited for both in 2025. Plans will be putting place. We'll get them working and we'll be showing up for sure. A few different shows picked out probably for Lewis. Just trying different avenues, different countries. We'll catch you then. This was probably the last show of 2024. But plenty more to come in 2025. Subscribe.

Yes guys welcome back to the YouTube channel we are here at Hassard though condition coaches here in May then head we have a multi mascot we've leaned it or it's come up come with the Airbnb and other ways oh he's not happy he's not so we're already going to hang around but it is the weekend of the condition coaches kingdom classic first show that the UK season the regional it's going to be a good one I've heard it's probably the biggest starting show the year for a long period of time so I'm very excited Amanda's got a job like a company and she's a good mate mate girl she'll be her travelling not seen and so I'll look at her then that's going really well she'd been ready for while so it's okay so if them jump up for the regional she does get ready for the Ben Ween and a few weeks time so we've got touch with us we've got Jordan and we've got Alex we have more room to cut we are doing checkings we're getting some food in we're gonna then head to graphical get some content get some filming get some training done and then we are off to registration cut you there so this my first meal which is three eggs three egg whites and the hum and 20 dollars eggs I am currently on 5,100 calories per day predominantly carbs that's quite low for me last obviously I'm at the pressure up to 5,9 but I'm able to grow on a bit left this life and he's special recipe for the eggs me just new coming the pan and then take it just fry the pan mate you're setting the oven you're setting it it's still on the oven but it in the same way chaos okay I was frying morning checking days hurry it has just checked in he is looking crazy looking very very he was three weeks up Detroit Pro given my high dates more 1500 grams of carbs should be tripped nicely and put them down yeah it does in about one tripped faster to the state never been to Detroit so excited that will be on YouTube probably episode three of the season so stay tuned sneaky preview for Jordan I can very good very good anyway so that is eight so let's New York Harry's also going to be doing New York so we've got couple guys in New York I'm just gonna make some moments to Jordan's plan he's done and my fourth yeah he's far he's been on well it's not ideal in prep anyone he's an unwell in prep just gets in there head a little bit it does affect you mentally but well you have the reassurance of your coach and just knowing that you do everything you can main thing is you also need a taking the consideration as rest and recovery even though you want to go full war in a prep scenario it's something that you have to think about you know then so body's not responding you're not gonna get the results that you want to see so just a few relations never's planned we've got you guys must go in on pre-work engineering muscles passing through our control I'm not ready. You're here. We are here. I crafted some. We are going to train. All eggs. Password training? But. Please. As always. Mynda training. Girls training, please. Guys training legs. Guessing training content. Thank you. Next. So we are in hamstrings. First, little bit of a quad touch up. We've all been traveling. Satin cars for a long period of time. We've been last couple of days. So, best thing you can do before you do any sort of full leg workout is a bit of flexion. Hipaduction. Open up the glutes. Allow the connection for the hamstring to be that little bit better. Always find it works. Absolutely. One of this. Just setting your leg up. Absolutely. A lot of people miss us out and tend to take it on at the end. But I feel that the crucial exercise just to really get things going. Get the blood move around the legs as well. It's like doing calf raises sometimes when you're doing quads. Just really stimulate the blood around the lower leg. Especially if you're squatting. I find that if you have that stimulation you tend to perform a little bit better. You're not as tight through the lower before you go into your movement. Just a couple of like pointers that I always say to my guys. Like, best thing you can do is just try and set your session up for max. More optimization. By doing these little things before you're sessioning, rather than going full steep. Which is probably going to just do make real do it. But if you think smart before you go into your sessions, the progress that you can make moving forward would be optimal. Yeah, like quads mate. Speak to that. I'm not afraid of it. No. I don't know what I'm trying to do next with East Bucket. It's on my bodybuilder already. I don't know what I'm trying to do next with East Bucket. It's on my bodybuilder already. Silly. So I'm trying to do the half of the weight. I think quite work. What do you want? Drop it down. I'll say 65. 10. My figure girl. Yeah, like white. I think. Oh. Nice bro. I'm still got it. I won't even attempt to get my legs out. I'm not doing fucking quads left. Nice Alex. Good. I got it. Good. Yep. Free what? Get that. Good. Ow. Whoo. Good. Thanks, Louise. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Come on. I need a squeezing. Yep. Come on. Yep. Easy. Come on. Oh, that's. Go on it. Drop that on it. Sure. I'll put this one on. Because I feel like it makes it shorter. Yeah. You know, when you use the machine like this as well, depends on your height. It's a way your foot doesn't going to be. So obviously none of this machine moves. Where some of them, you can move your foot. You can move this this is totally set. So you're going to have to find your sweet box. Where you don't want your knees come and over. And you're also going to lock fully out of the bottom. Some find your foot. There's a way you really feel like contraction. Is it hot? I have no idea. Yeah. Yeah. So as far as I'm going to tell you, I've come a little bit slightly off to stop that new flesh as much. And what you don't make sure you don't do is tilt out the bottom. And when you're coming up, we don't want to all rest. And at the top of you down, you want to keep that contraction through the glutes. As I'm going to, good point really helps is your first couple of reps. Keep in that pause at the top. Really feel the contraction. In for like five with pauses, then really go for reps. You'll really start feeling better. Nice. It's a nice machine, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She like it. You see a hamstring drop. Ah, you see her here? Oh yeah. It's really telling me all of that. We're talking about hamstring. No swearing with you, this PG. Yeah. I've always been really slow. And really concentrate. I think the more you come to check with glutes, that's a key. As soon as I stopped trying to connect, like mind-section, I just lose all feel. Yeah. I've got to just raise the zone out and really think right, glutes, glutes, glutes, glutes. Feel the burn. Nice. Nice. What happened? She's up. Wow. Nice. Come on. Nice. Easy. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Come on. No, it's not, it's not like宝宝 • Donate It's you You forgot the noodles It was all you did I'm so tired He Tony is listening !​ Here's a baby Is that ok? Come on man. Come on man. Come on man. Let's go. Yes. Come on bro. Come on. Three. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Leave him alone. Come on. Let's go. Get it, let's go. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. 내가, wake up. Go. Let's go. I have to walk with it. I have to walk with it. I'm not. I use a tray. So Amanda's doing these for the buns. When you're handling them without a bun, the buns isn't actually doing anything in this moment. So I'm going to set it away from a little bit of feedback. And on your adi-out of what we want to put on is you want to contrast the glute. We don't want to come so we can come to ham-shakes eyes. We are going to be a sense of fully tar at the glute. You might find that you don't belly, can't come all the way at the floor. Just slightly below your knee. As soon as you come further down, if you think it ham-shakes cooking in, or you're going to just below the knee. So this ham-shakes formness slightly definitely for me. If she's at the way eyes do it, she gets too much ham-contracting because she's very ham-dominant. So by using it this way, very, very small range of movement. She's not controlled with the ham-shakes or the glute. Also, she's going to go into the soup set with the buns. So I'm not using it at a minute. Right! And now, just when the bun is that easy doing so. The buns look not anything in the face, that's nice. We do them all partial laps here again, keeping constant tension on the glute area. We're going to put the legs on top of the glute to the upper glute. to the upper glute. Masong like. I feel the same as me very well. Ah. I suppose that male choice is. So, Masong. Checking in Masong. I suppose that male choice. Well, I have protein shape for this workout. And now we have a scrambled egg. Some salmon. And the slices are bread. This is milk 3. And not probably the egg. It may have burgers like that. About the standard day prior to which I would know I've got nobody can be in. It's just, I can't say I'll just get everything set up. We'll be there for registration. I'd be at that. Very good. I'm going in. Yeah. Chaos. So, we are here. Here's a page ready for tomorrow's event. The condition coach came in the class. All the guys now have turned up for registration. As you can see, my speedy crowd. I measured myself. I've dropped. It sends me to again. It's night. Every time. I don't do the way. But I am now just under one five nine centimeters. Last time I was 160. I was going to get a smaller one. I'm going to get a smaller one. It's going to be a busy one. So, it's already looking pretty stark. So, it's going to be a good day. So, we're going to catch up with everybody. See you in a bit. So, this is Charlotte. Hey. So, she is now registered. She is tired. She is ready for tomorrow. This is also the lead up to the profile and two weeks time. Your first vision on Halloween? She is. And my first team was. Because I've only ever done. And we see it in the same. He's in the same state. Yes. So, MPCA, but in the UK. There's two birds. That's what we are today. So, everyone is going to call. I have a bit of a stressful day today. But we are going to calm down tonight. Trying to let stress be. Take a bit of a physical situation. We are going to be out badly. The 40th of a month. We don't want that. But Charlotte is going to go home and have some Zen time. It will be very nice. So, we will be a lot of sleep. Yes. It's a good night sleep. It's not a good night sleep. So, it's just like the one. Yeah.

=== FILE: DAY IN THE LIFE ： BODYBUILDING PREP COACH [_PiS94_0RSE].txt ===

Hey guys, currently we're done. Welcome back to the YouTube today we're filming a day in the life. So I know some of you always intrigued what coaches do. I'm a day today basis, it's not exciting but I'm going to show you. I'm just going to go for a walk in a minute, get some fresh air, it's burning up a little bit, it's very cloudy just morning. Go get a coffee or talk you through the day. So after the time I'd like to just go for a little bit of a walk, to the head, foam still probably not going to be in my hand for another, but it will be in my hand but I won't be working for about another 20 minutes or so just going to do and wasting the UK guys to start checking in with this handy because all of within the body or head of the time, which is very, very beneficial. Yes I've got guys have checked the information, I've cured them which I'll get back to as soon as I'm back in the room. But for a minute, just still for a walk, get some steps in, try to finish it before I have my first coffee, always like to treat the leer and a half before I have a coffee, I'll go for a few days a minute. But such you are a this is a food stack from the SN and I mean from the SN which I've got. The reason why I have a mean is as a weight, it's a little really for first two hours so I have that big of mean of dump in this drink and the aftly stack is complex, more of a bit of a more mineral and hydration formula, these works really well, takes epic. So I've been there for a five hour drink and a walk in the good behind the day and I'll have a big coffee, I've had a clever help, I've done a done cold turkey about three weeks ago and I've stopped all caffeine. I was drinking recently. Two or three cups of coffee today, two or three energy drinks today, I'm in a free workout stick, I'm not caffeine in time with this one around my family, where I just went and then I was on some take-in, which is some days my own in, to get the sleep was at least sleep, but that sleep helped with something else. It's not healthy waiting if I'm with the competencies I'm dying, I wanted a little bit of a adrenal reset so I'll put a little caffeine out here a little bit better. Tired in the morning, it doesn't get that kick, these are probably able to sleep better more effectively and what I'll probably start to do over the next few weeks is generally starting to reintroduce caffeine at a low level just to give me a good friend. I'll give myself back into this ring I think for a while I was going to be needing for the season. So this is what tends to happen, I'll look for a coffee and then I'll see what people with E.C. and the experiment that is really good, a hungry, a little bit of a two-act right, and I would devour this and then probably touch up my protein with some clear way back in the room. That's good. Done. So that's breakfast done in Dusty, but I want to breakfast, I'll finish part two and I'll get back. I'll do head back to the hotel room now, crack on with flying check-ins, certainly coming now. It's just not seven in the UK. You'll start rolling them and it doesn't get through them quite quickly. Typically, 15 to 15 to 20 check-ins a day, I do have a short walk. Then we'll go on crack at the moment, I think about 15 guys on crack three or four, five, six, seven weeks out. So their check-ins are quite regular at the moment. It's touching basically the cue and they're all pretty much on point for where they need to be. Regular, more regular, refeeding normal. There's a point for some of them, so the check-ins become again increased because all of C were where they're looking at the morning after post-war trial. A day after post-war count, the day after the, it comes in thick and fast and this is where the season really comes out. They've come alive and we are three weeks out from show number one and they are the Kuskulti's Cup. In Essex, the first two boat, two bros, NPC regional that qualify you for any profile of fire. So the illustrious player, maybe pro-card anywhere in the world in part from America and that should be in the ironwoods and a couple other workshops in the cupcake. But yeah, we'll get on with these coffee and we'll have that theory. So breakfast part two is the ice of clear from ESM. I don't like normally drinking, probably take on the room. And I'm never really like the me too way. But this from ESM is really well, tastes really well. There's no funny after taste as well, which is fantastic. This is a cherry lemonade that I think is a cherry blade, this is a moment of loss of the ice. So what I'm going to have to try and do is formulate some way of getting this in there. I think we use the whole one card with a holder to actually make a mess. Well, this is dead, just topping up. I'm going to put it there. There we go. Topping up some protein. It's only had 4 eggs. I tend to eat 4 or 5 meals a day. And then whatever else I found to you on top of it, I'm pretty flexible in my diet. I'll make pre-wreck out with the white pudding. Mix it with one of the blueberry or lime flavor and my free workout and what I'll do is have that and pick up some wheels from BIRUS and you can find that and that's enough the rest of the day. I'll do it half. Thanks here. I'll do normally cut in my little way cutter but the expert at the tip look is too tasty to this and this thing. The ninja which I'll show you in this later is a God-Sem's. I think I'm going to travel and stay in hotels and wants to cook or reheat their food. This thing is an absolute good thing. It's quite bulky the head of it but it will pack in a suitcase time. I'll fix glass dishes. It's not going to break. Make sure to shake it, get this in, start by work. Then the pre-work have been removed. My daily encroaching of tablets for the morning encroaching. The D3KT, the pressure of the cumin, the capsules, the dice of the box, the 5HCP in. The tablets and the portsiad Corneau have been glued on for warfare. We shall be avoiding the table. Take a 3N, and I'll show you the assistants right away. I'll take the mic all the time with the next meal. I'll do it again on the day, I'll make sure I get everything in there. So many of the other like the next and tablets I've got before I used to think I was in one but now I've been only probably doing about that. So that would be me doing the next lock in the middle too. We work out about to go in, but gonna make it a little bit sad, but yes, it's a good I've said a lot about this product, I don't know what I'm going to do. But there's a lot of water going to switch into this because it's subtle and it's so easy to make. The work way to do it perfect is literally in matter of just the way you have that in between three the amount of water in the water and the amount of the water. It's the same, the chocolate scales, the chocolate ball. Very handy. I don't have a lot, 60 grams. Perfect, I'm going to use this position, let it set. And then I'm going to put the line bar, and I'm going to make a series of crispy bits of syrup and actually in it. I'm going to put the jinn and a bit from there. Maybe I'll pre-work out and then have to do it myself. Because I've lost my sugar again, you're going to have to try and master the tunnels. It's going to make me work out. Pre-work out the choice is the non-stim crank pump probe again and the tray is very cold of flavour. The crank pump is good. And it's a formulation that's come out by yourself. They have just brought out the Wesley Visitors, Golden Crank Pump probe, which is again even better. Mine that I'll wait for me has just been to do it. So unfortunately it's not here anymore. Now that this is very, very good. I will take this for me and then make a whole reason for the jinn. I will use daily, okay, fantastic product from the SNP. I believe in the quality of the co-reaching, and we've heard of what we've got for a very handy, especially on the gole, and you don't have to then create a thing-loots feed collagen, which is very, very handy. And then these little beauties, the electrolyte sachets, and I will take this with me and I will pour a 1.5-litre bottle of water and dump that in to have towards the end and after training to replenish my electrolytes. So we'll try and mix all this up. We're going to make a horrendous mess. I'm going to have to buy a shake and drink. I'll go back to the dungeon and try and find my other shake. Today we're going to train at Bynos, as we'll be a push session, and we'll get it in get out of busy days. I tend to like to train on my own petions on. I'll give it a little bit of people. But when I'm very busy, I'm just going to get you in and sort of a very tight, it's more of a fact that getting the chop down and getting that hair, unfortunately. And I'm going to try and have a decent session. I'll put my food up recently a little bit. I'm going to come back from Jamaica, where calories work in a room at a higher level. I'll just try to maintain it and sort of try to train this and across the cleanest foods with your there, bargain in here and there, we're going to have to make it. I think it's good for a few kilos up. Just seeing some increase in performance, which is good for me. And it just sets me up for the start of the season, because as soon as I start, it's going to train and go down here. Just like bodybuilding, coaching is the selfish sport. If you want to do what you do at the level you want to do at the commitment to your guys, it's always done with priority, but you cannot look like a health. So just trying to get a good start point before the season is starting. I will neck this. We'll look where we have closing, but the day's very good. And then we'll have to be enough. So today's session push is going to be chest dominant. Going to run 43 chest exercises. Two out, maybe three out. And then I'm taking my day's skill, but we'll probably do one choice set in the size. Start with a good press today, because it's been okay. Normally I lower it in the needle through the basic tendons, and feeling good to start on press. I sort of will try to have between the fly and the press, but start on press today. And it's pretty old school. Four match just filled in weight up. Just really get a good feeling for it, and then probably just do two solid work in set. When I hear good weight. Do one more set in here. Then we'll probably do a flat press, and then do a fly. Just see how I feel, and moving into. That would further I do two or three exercises. We'll see. We'll see how did a little bit of an intensifier there. I've got a last set, there's a drop there, just because I'm the top load. I only got six reps, and I'm going to deliver it more free that. So just the way I've tried to get the most out of your session. Drop in the weight. Push it free. One more set, there's a sneaky tenon. Put the tenon on that one. I like the spins off, there I look there, it was the same sneaky tenon hiding. Always check your weight for please start. You're no longer a tension, and a back of that movement. Really slow down, it's quite light. I've got a lovely pet that I packed, I've got my six tenons. I always complain about, but it does limit me from pressing, so I just have to sync to mark when I'm training. And just again, thinking of a tactical way to make the load heavier. I've time in the tension, and then explode in that little ring. Yeah, you good? Yeah. Magic Electrolight Sunshine, so handy. oh ramadan at the moment so quite yeah quicky, not exactly but places it doesn't make meī very busy look at all the Vietnam Px oh give Go! Check the bottom. You know it's like trying to take that full range of motion, bringing the arms up high, trying to leave with the airway, not the rest. Just trying to fully engage the whole of the media ahead. I'm really good at exercising. I've got shit no cuts, so the dominant of my doubtwork will go towards the media. And then I'll put some anterior in there as well, just to top up with the air. Oh! One thing they don't do in half an year is a lot of 20 points, so here's a lot of 15. Fuck me! I'll do it back off, 15, so I'm in a hang-in-in-a-gift. Just drop one plate, just think smart. Be able to push through a decent set. Push done. I've already got some caston. The super set cast, standard of the C-A, hit them quite intense, lower them up, probably the best way. My opinion to do it, super set or a try set, turn on the HF. I'm actually one of the growing cast really. Frequency wise, I hit them whenever I remember. I tell my athletes probably at least three to four times a week. Well, I tend to say is if you're training up, one training day, training up, the next training day, the C-Cars and we'll take that for you program. And that's it. session done, dust it, about an hour. Grab some food, take some food home, and get back to work. So, post-work out meal today is my favourite from here. It's the Dynamite Chicken. Convenience for me. Can I have another 200, 200 rice please? Thank you. Convenience for me when I come here. It's just so handy. You can wear everything out to choice, fine selection of food. There's beef, chicken, shrimp, salmon, everything you want, and then the York. Bitch, two out to that, and then you got to take the super set or rice, sticky rice, full choice. For me, it's just a bonus, just to be able to have this all prepared. And then what I do is let people want me back up in the ninja. Back in the hotel room, fucker. Just sort of stay in the Airbnb. With 200 rice please, and could you warm that one up please? Thank you. Guys, you're good. Um, yeah, it's perfect. Perfect, excuse me, sir. Not quite. I'm sending you, because I'm going to slide back from the coping to the chicken. Okay, fine. Just to be honest, everybody's been in the hallway. It's like you can see the crash of across the fitness. And we have a week when it's closed. And I'm out of the limits. We'll know it's still getting enough out across the floor. And keep you fresh so we can be in that position too. It's going to be a good thing. So halfway through the surfing team was blocked. Time for me and one of the three. I'm working on the 20th. Stop. Stop. Do you have the hill under your free water? I'm going to ask them what I'm going to give you. So ninja, have brought out this wonderful design. Very compact everywhere. It is very, very handy on the camera. Fist in the sick case nicely. And practically I don't use it so it's full capability, because I don't actually cook them wrong. But for convenience, I cook on a re-heat. So we say it's got a re-heat, re-chris function. And that is what I use it for. I thought it actually takes some decent mirrors. War, not cold. I've got a fridge. I think they're there, which is not big. And then for the day we've got steak potato. And then we've got another fine and white chicken. We'll squeeze it in the fridge for a minute. But a little place on top. Set to... We'll put that about eight minutes. Let's go. We'll eat that. Finish off work. And then we'll head to the moon. Big so. Big ass. We'll do the big so we'll just go over it. Eight minutes. Don't have dust. It's not ready. See you. And this is what I do in my spare time. I'll train that hunting. It's not good. And these are in the sail. Two in spikes. Two in spikes. Two in spikes. Yeah, taking. Yeah, I can. And just like that. You do American Express? Yes. So that is pretty much my day done. I don't normally go to the moon. That scene is keepers here and he's not been. But we've clocked up some stats. I think I'm up about 13.5 thousand. Mostly accumulated in there. I'll go back. I've got a plan to start. Eat some food. I've got to keep rushing and get to sleep. I need some food in myself. And yeah. Get home in the master love wagon.

=== FILE: DETROIT PRO DAY 1 FULL DAY OF EATING 1600 CARBS [iHn4lgGMm64].txt ===

Good morning, it is officially, we'll call this one day one day one in Detroit. It is up us five in the morning, we've been out for a good few hours. I think we had the same with seven eight clock last night here. Two times which will then equate, see, midnight, UK time. So we're a bit over the place at the moment. I haven't looked at Harry this morning, he's super flat, weight is lighter than when we prior to when we flew. Little bit of water, but nothing crazy. So we're just going to manipulate this day. We're going to start the low-strait way, there's no point hanging around. I know Harry needs a lot of food, so we're going to push it. It's just shy of 1600 carbs a day. So the man is happy after 100 grams yesterday. 100 grams yesterday. Yeah, I'll say this is the first actual day for the whole prep of actually been hungry. You know, that could have been party because of lack of sleep, obviously. And the jet lag in a time difference is, but 1600 grams, obviously we use the same sources the whole time in prep. So it never goes down well, perfectly digest it with your well, no bloat, no any issues at all. So yeah, this will be absolutely fly down. Except that you've got the cookies, so we're going to have to get some cookies. Go to the manabroke pottox, maybe. We're going to get three meals in. Meal ones already in, two more meals in head to the original powerhouse gym. Which is going to be pretty cool. Meantime, I'm going to get back to my UK guys who are all checking in now. And we'll catch it in the gym. Okay, so we got 200 grams of dryweight Jasmine rice. That's a lot of rice. So we chopped up green beans, I like the kiddo vegetables in there just to keep my everything passing through in a digestion. 150 grams of chicken breast and a blueberry bagel with 40 grams of jam. Okay, so it's meal number two. meal number one. We had 175 grams of creamer rice. 25 grams of protein from way I slept. 40 grams of honey, 10 grams of almond butter and 100 grams of raspberry. Meal one for coach today is for whole eggs for egg whites and a very scrammy bagel, which is toasting quite nicely. I'm not sure if you can see it. There is no toast there and there is no cow. So I have to boil water on the hob, old school style for coffee this way. Okay, so meal number three. Another big boy meal. 200 grams of dryweight Jasmine rice. 150 grams of organic grass fed beef mince. Again some chopped up green beans in there. Further digestion. And I'm popping my pot type of ginney and the bread of pot type. So we're going to put the two of these down and let you know the are. So we are here at the original original powerhouse gym. It's a incredible place. A lot of the style to here. A lot of great athletes have come by here and trained here over the years. And this is one of the reasons why I love them. What I do come in place where they sit. We were around the world. We were a little bit more often just sharing that with them. It's crazy over here. Training a bit of pool today. Put the hurry through the rounds where q mu's deep into the load. And I'm just going to put some more off. Just give them a blood move in today. Push it a little bit. A little bit more than we normally were. Just because Harry's full of energy. So I was going to move those cars over pretty well. And then just think a good look after. So it's good to set it up. And then you can place it here. Right here they do all the family reasons. We're going to do that. What did that? I do it here. What did that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You have. Yeah. I think that's great. You can do this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. So Harry is already given this a fun ticket but prevo some fucking here. Yeah. It's incredible. Why manufacturers decide to go so off the rails and we're going to try and move it about everything. Simple things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How is it? We're here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You so good. Yeah. How's it? Yeah. Oh seriously... Oh no.... Well.. So now we can definitely steal the doll with the ass..unden Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom woah its good i have to eat running Oh, no. Nice. Can you see that one a bit? That's it. Just a tiny little bit. Just make it different. You're putting it in three as you go. You're doing it that way. Just lock it in the bottom of your head. You're doing it. Sasha and Juan are in powerhouse complete. Three adults, by set. Done. Harry is feeling great. We're in the perfect position. We're like 10 or 15 seconds alone. Just on that few round of hours in. Everything is where it needs to be right now. For far too many people get caught up in the fact that I'm not full. I'm not dry enough. We've got those that we've got for all day. We've got 70 hours till we're going to be on stage. There's a lot happening up here. It's like a matter of which we're going to meet. It's like a little bit of a point. Like the moment. Today we're going to be about 16 underground archives in. Confident of that. We've crawled it over and over again. We know Harry was so well to it. This could be that's probably my really loaded point for us. And then it's about, let's see how that goes into the next day. See how much food holds us for back end. We are utilizing some natural garbage. And now he takes it out. We need to make sure we're getting the actual�ting as well as we start that process. And then it's just about trying to get that balance of fullness with the dryness that we want to bring. Harry, we want to bring him in absolutely peeled. Harry's never been on stage. Backstimple, this is my goal to make that happen and bring more help with the package. So, I'm going to bring Harry for a ride for us. Okay, so meal number, we're at meal number four now. Post work out. Just hit a back, rear down by step session. Now this is free engine 25 grams, but unfortunately it doesn't fit into one bowl. So we're going to have to split it into two. Not bad problem to have to be honest when you're in cereal. Normally I've cocoa pops, but we're in America, so we've gone for a captain quantity. Gonna enjoy it. Okay, so meal number five, five minutes go. I'll just put down a serving of H2L, remove a little extra bit of water. Then we've got 175 grams of dryweight, jasmine rice. 125 grams of chicken, and again some chopped green beans. And then in the oven at the minute, we've got a nice big thick blue rebago of 40 grams of jam on that. This is meal number five. We're going to total about 1600 grams of carbs a day. 10 liters of water. And then we're going to assess the look, do some posing in the bed as well. The meal number six of seven. Yeah, I feel it's a 101 year. So we are now one more meal away from the final meal. So this is a repeat of the last meal. 175 grams of jasmine rice. 125 grams of chicken, again green beans. As always, and then we've got a nice blue rebago back in the oven with 40 grams of jam. So put this down and then we're on to our last meal of the day, which will be in about an hour or two time. Which is probably my favourite, which is the creamer rice, a little bit of honey, and some raspberries, a little bit of weight as well. So yeah, getting the close to the 1600 grams of carbs now, we need either. So, veg got way isolate inside here. Just for travel purposes, they didn't want to bring a whole tub away. So put it in a nice little electrolyte tub. 25 grams of that. Mix them with a creamer rice cookie dough. So they get the perfect consistency. This is cooked creamer rice almost, so it's a little bit too dry. And then, once you put the isolate in, soft ones up a little bit. It was an if you're just having creamer rice on your own. You just want to get the consistency perfect, and then leave it like that. But like I said, if you over cook it just a tad, then get the isolate in there, and it makes it all nice and smooth on a set. Perfect consistency. And two that. We're going to add 20 grams of almond butter, 40 grams of honey, and 200 grams of raspberries. Last meal, we've got 135 grams of creamer rice, 25 grams of isolate, and then we'll let you light tub. 20 grams of almond butter, marshes have it in last minute, just slow down a little bit. 40 grams of honey, and then 200 grams of raspberries. But you need to weigh them. They won, done. We're in a very, very good position. Harry's fed. He's watered. 600 grams of carbs are going in tenderly, as just over ten years of water, a couple of black coffees. We're starting to see some fullness pulling to a specific, which is good. Let me have some good water health through the day, and with the amount of carbs that you can consume, it's natural for me, it's not about being bone dry at this point. Okay, we've got three days of, another two days, and then it's showday. So it's just trying to get Harry that momentum of bringing the fullness, and then we can start by as an off-mustop, and off the water. It's a good luck for the evening. It's going to get some sleep poofy, so sleep very well last night. I don't know. We've tried a whole afternoon. Get a good night's sleep in, it'll wake up drier, and then I'll set them all in. The Saturday planned the load. It will be another big day, whether it'll be 1600. It'll be, or it'll be close, but we'll pretty much go meal to meal at that point from tomorrow. Today was like the front load of the back load, the front load of the back load. Where we sort of pulled down through, especially with the fly. Just using the 100 grams of carbs yesterday. Today we start the load, and it's just about, then just seeing how that went, trying to throw us across into morning's, looking comparison to days, morning look, and then don't want me to do. We're filled with water tomorrow, and it's a limitation. We'll see. I'm going to go to sleep in a minute. I've got one client planned to do. I'll get some zests.

=== FILE: DETROIT PRO! IFBB PRO HARRY HARRIS MAKES HIS US DEBUT [OPOAmpk4Fu8].txt ===

Real bad. No, it's not. But you hear what I'm saying. Day two in the Big Burma House. It is Friday. Two days prior to showday. Harry is walking up just 1.3 kilos heavier today. After 1600 grams of carbs, ten plus litres of water yesterday. Dry, fuller. Then yesterday's low, which is good start for us. Yesterday was almost like the front load of the back load. Just said yesterday. Just get what we can in showing the GI is clear and good and everything feels good. But in every position today, where he's hungry again for food and I can keep pushing hard because the hurry needs that. This was because he's not the biggest of guys, but aesthetically he's got such a pleasing shape with nice lines, conditions crazy. If we can bring that fullness with that, it's a very good package. He is just wanted off through the get-o to find a shop to get some more rice in my bar. Hopefully he makes it back. Just play her through checking the moment. It's 9 o'clock just gone in the morning, been up since 4 jalanx. Fucker. We're going to get one more meal in Harry before them in Powerhouse gym. Powerhouse gym, yes, it was crazy. I can't express if it ever in America around Detroit, get to the original. There's like three or four here in Detroit. But the original one, we went crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy. So excited to go about that. Push that shen for Harry. He's very strong from the rear. So we pushed through poor yesterday and then we're going to do push today and just try and hold some volume in that up a top line shelf for his. And just see where the look is. So we're just going to plant meal by meal. But two meals deep now, we'll see where we are. Post, work out and then I'll plant the next couple of meals for that. And then it's just a matter of just chilling, posing, chilling, posing, assessing and making the changes where needed. So very excited for that. And we'll catch a little bit. They too, the powerhouse gym we're here. What is probably one of the best gyms. I've trained up, push for Harry, his last workout. So I'm going to move some blood around. Put the 600 grams of carbs that you had yesterday and approximately 600 that you had this morning. Just to good you start moving it around, moving it to where it needs to be. See where we are, post, work out and then assess. Plum the next, one or two meals, post, work out. See where we are from there. See the look. It's looking a bit crazy this morning. It's dry and harder for that. And again, it's going to look a little bit different here in the natural light. When we wake up, it's like four, five o'clock in the morning pitch black. In the darkest place that we're living. So we'll have a look in a bit. See where it is. And we'll give them an eye on some type, mind is mumbling. Just working our way through that was fast. Just to get a blood moving, get a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a freeze of joint. Harry, once you're trying to maximize all the fullness in his chest and in the end of the workout, just so we can see how that translates when we take a look. That was fast. Quite a bit of volume free chest. And then it's just a little, maybe one or two exercises on try to set your stuff to fill them up and then have a look. It's good. Frick it all in there today. Yeah, he's just cranking around. And then you go there so weasc nh Anth a little bit. Let's just do it like a little bit more now. Here we go. Ah, but you see the fact that we have a clothe, but a clothe. you Let me go outside. Nak problema Yeah, Holy Just a little bit more. Give me a clap. Okay. Nice. Nice mate. Much better today. Try those knees out just a little bit. That's it. Good bro. A hamstring belly as well. Furnace in it. Nice. Back a little bit lean back. I'll sit perfect. Sick bro. It's nasty. I'm going to go to the next one. Just done four five rounds of Harry. And the lip is coming alive, coming alive. Really happy with where we are. It's going to be a plan. Don't need to worry. Don't need to panic. Just carry on loading as we are. Keep getting the water in as we are. Everything's falling into place quite comfortably. It's just about just time. It's just taking me a while. I'm here to see where we are. The minute everything is going to plan. So I'm going to go back. Harry's going to eat probably a box of cereal. And I'm going to chill. I'm jet lagged off. It's pretty much the end of the day now. Harry is just going through some rounds. The light in here is horrendous. You're going to get loads in the bathroom. So we're just running through some rounds now to see how everything pops through. and through some rounds now to see how everything pulled through. We'll walk into in a backfree and take a look at the light and just see where we are. Drivers, they were so good. That's it, that's it, perfect. And from that, it's just making the shooting on a couple of things before we go bed with the direction we go with things. So it's looking very positive right now. Considering we're pretty much two full days alone in touch and pretty much. 15, 16,000 calories, well over 3,000 grams of carbs. It's a full midsection which is to be explained at this point. You know, it's not an issue because tomorrow we're going to back off a little bit, clear some GIS base. Dry out even more so just the volume of calories. It's what we're doing. That's for the amount of water, water, water to stick to the body essentially, will be less. So it's an input in there. It's going to be a lot easier. But you're seeing it's physique is a lot full of now. Just good. The response is there. I can see and it's going to give it a live originally, you're caught. It's a very positive place to get right now. So one more meal to go in. Cream and rice, one of Paris' favorites. Yeah. I don't feel right. Two fabulous probably what we'll have just showed you more. It's an only show in the nine o'clock shown. The world will be five, five six o'clock. Get in here then. And then just let it set up in clear for stage. And then finals are not so seven o'clock in the seven p.m. in the universe. It's a long period of time which will manage throughout the day. So let's be sweet then but for now, all my rough harrys looking at Mira and then the Saturday. Good morning. Day three in Detroit. And Harry has woken up in a very very good position. Harry is currently shaving himself. The frosty warm blade. It's where the spillage should sponsor bodybuilders. I think everybody nowadays literally uses a warm blade. It is a god scent. I think I've tasked him to shave his back. But we've woken up on the money today. Just what like couldn't have asked for a bad position because we consumed a lot of food in two days. When you're a bodybuilder, you always have that sort of feeling that you want that flat stomach. You want the few empty and with the amount of food that we put in. Right. The only thing that was thrown today would be woken up a little bit moment but we are four out of the paint page through the stomach. Where two kilos up from yesterday's weight was a very good indication to withdraw and we can see that two kilos in full nurse which is perfect. And it's going to stick. Today is about pulling back the volume. Okay both with food and fluid. Keeping sodium levels high. Just allowing the geodic clear of such. The bodies follow glycogen, you know, glycogen isn't simply like that. So you have to position where you respect that. You know, Harry's not going to be doing a lot of movement today. Yes, he's done a lot of steps. So that with the 2K game there's a very good bonus. Today is a matter of just sitting still with your mother or chill in because I go get his beer trim, head shaved and that is it. We've got registration at three. No sorry. First time. First time at three. It's the one and a half certain. The second one and a half seven which is around about half weeks' meat time. Both days are a big good day. We're catching a bit. That's the other leaves. So this is the game that's coming. I've seen that 5, I've been searching on the walking bit. This last thing I've been wondering about like... Now a film that herself, I've been looking at beer yikes, the Donna's fashion that if I could attend the Muscoor dog, maybe it was not that difficult, but it wasn't as difficult but we had to accept any help. So it was worth any deal. Yeah, we have been there for a long time. Even if we could be because we were in the�, we were so close to an actual place, then we were scared. It was not something that could happen to the grand end. But obviously, this is a certain number of people that we've asked for, and it's quite a lot of people. You didn't have to worry about seeing this. It was often. It was just one. It was just one. It was just one. Yeah. Okay. It's coming. Nice. Nice. Nice. It's a bit flat. Yeah. That's impressive. There you go. Hey guys, we are here at the Double Tree. Okay, this is the post-to-thout where Hammond's being held. After he's been held, the venue isn't too far from here. Harry's just having his first coat done. He was white as me, if not white. So he'll make sure they're doing that very good. That really was just a top coat done. Essentially, it's just a matter of just weighing around down until later on he's got another top-up of his base. 7.5 I think, which is possibly about the time man after he's met. So, right so I'm going to say, we're already literally at 15 minutes walk from here. So, some of his outs, that's being able to walk and not get a few wet things that are treated as good. I'm just doing some work for all sorts of Harry, hungry, tired, and he's just eating some food. He's just eating some meat. So, he's getting, Harry's looking at the developing throughout the day, which is good because he's got four of what he's got. He'll be on the stage nine o'clock tomorrow morning. He'll be getting dry, holding for almost most of the day. He's good. Everything's going to be on the ground, so I think it's a little bit more. When you're quiet. Ah, it's broke. I'm very happy I just announced it on. What a good place. That's why I can get a class. It's fine. Yeah, I'll just go ahead and do that. No, listen, we expect that really good turnout. Thank you guys for coming. We've done our best to make it special for you guys. Obviously, the reason is the prize money. I'm not sure if you guys saw it. We have the best pose or award. Most muscular award and a most shredded award. So, hopefully somebody can win something. We have something for everybody. We were really good venue. We were really good team backstage. So, help you guys out. I won't be long. You guys have all been here before. I just want to say thank you from all of us. We've been in Paul. Recoming means a lot to have the first Detroit show and have you guys show up and make it exciting. So, I appreciate you guys coming. Paul is ready. He tells you on touch on. You know, really just show time tomorrow. We anticipate pros going on stage. We'll type around 11. So try to get to for 9. 3 more. Evening. We're anticipating about a 7. We're roughly 15. So, what we want to do is show starts at 9. We're going to run the men's NPC classes first. By the time they get rolling in the show is going to be 9.15 9.30. We figured they'll be able to be able to now. So, we're hoping to do the intermission around 10.30. After an admission, you guys will come up. So, you guys will be on. Hopefully, we're going to try to set it for 11. So, that you guys know exactly when you're going on. And then at night, same thing, the show starts at 5. By the time it gets rolling, it might be 5.30. An hour on stage. Intermission. Then hopefully, you guys will be on it. 7 o'clock. So, you guys have pretty set time. So, if the show is running in an odd way, we'll just stop it. So, you guys know you're on it. 11 and 7, and that's going to be your time. So, try to make sure you're here and tan to glaze. And all that good stuff. Okay. I don't really have much else to say. Ben, all. We'll leave it to Tyler then. But my disguise is only 60. So, be ready to pose a lot. We'll be giving home a show. So, I'll pose you guys probably a couple of times through. Make sure you guys are good. We'll probably do one last. One last pose down to just to get the crowd some energy and some stuff. So, that's it. Good luck with the four to see how you guys do tomorrow. Okay, guys. Thank you very much for coming. Any questions? Just a grab or what to call them? Or yeah. I'm going to try to do try. But it's a happy celebration. Um, after he's meet the second base coat, Um, Baragas. Orders. Uber, or they're heading back to the house. And we're going to chill tonight. Just had another very quick look at Harry. Um, but, yes. We'll get crazy and crazy by literally the every ten minutes and seem changing. And it's really, really good. It's really good. It's really good. So, we need to manipulate. Um, we're going to fill out quite a heavy and last meal. And now we're going to be over for, we're going to be nine o'clock. Um, we're now going to be on another level of clock, which potentially will be even better for us. All our that geitically, if fully from the heavy meal that we're going to have tonight. And then literally just top up. First of all, we want to remember good for here as we can on a way. Sure. We're going to come back and help you with Baragas. So, Baragas, huh? Harry's in a fantastic position. Harry's hungry. Harry would eat this more. More. Even more. Thanks for. Yep. Um, just to bowl in my food. I think it's getting, it's going to help them then. Just because we've taken back got a little bit today. Just after the, three thousand two hundred grand a car, we put in. We're going to have a thousand, what we did today. Um, this will then carry through nice seats tomorrow. It's a transphastosolium. Yeah, it's going to be a good, a good, a carries control. Feeling good in it. Going great, right, man. Yeah. And this is just going to look even better. Hahaha. Yeah, it's just going to be a very, very good. Yeah, it's very, very good. It's nothing wasted. Yeah. It is just gone six a.m. Uh, myself and Harry have been up since about half four. Um, just getting me a one down. Harry's book, Troy is a bone. Um, we've made well last last night. It's sat and mackily on the stomach for him. Um, no issues. My bowel movements, perfect. Place to be in right now. Best local ever seen him ever. Um, just in the, in the bathroom mirror, as you can see, we're in darkness. We have literally no, like, no lighting in this place, part of the kitchen in the bathroom. Um, but it's all gone to plan just a, um, the sort of, you know, we are touching for me or one, which will be the only me that we touch in very hundred calories, 200 pounds of carbs, that we've understood. And it's, it's foury plus proving, but all the traits proving pretty much just there. Because that very small scybos I slept to me makes him an a call. Um, she's got a couple of pot types. Um, there's been it, the American stuff. But it's freezing, you've done all through this load. The load is now totaled. I think that's what's on me, I remember. A load has totaled with this meal over, uh, was it 28,000? How are you? 20. Yeah, it's probably over 28,000 calories. Um, with such in, uh, or nearly four and a half, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, four thousand, five hundred, yeah, four thousand, five hundred, yeah. Four thousand, five hundred grams of carbs. Um, it's incredible just to see it, and think well, the hell has that gone, you know. Um, dropped three kilos over night. And that was from, well, 10 p.m. to, like, five a.m. So, it's a good side thing to move forward. Um, I'm laughing. I'm tired. Still, um, I think that catches up with just about as time we get back to the UK. And then we have to read just again. Um, but all is geared. Um, just with the fly free some check-ins. Um, then, time is at, uh, or probably, time, hurry. Uh, what do you, eh? Good, wait. So, I have to do the venue. And then just chill there. Show time is 11, which is even better. We thought it was 9, but it's 11, show starts at 9. Uh, so I said that, then the metal holder, I want you to show the rolling, they're going to literally pull it, and then the pros will be on bail on 11, which is good to know. So, we can time everything perfectly. This is going to sit nicely. Um, we won't really need to do a lot from here. Yeah, and this game time, we'll see we'll catch it out. Let's go in the way. This is a money shop. Then we'll see the engremly thing to do with yours. You've got... Yeah, but that's all we offer now. Yeah, but that's all. Yeah, I got some bonus spots. That feels full ofiously kind of lonely but it doesn't hit me. Oh, that's what it's called. Oh, that's what it's called. Back at the hotel, Harry is getting his final coat of his top coat then. Luckily, we spoke the vent because we were on our way to the venue. The venue, they're actually still doing the tanniff here at the hotel. So we're here quickly. Just had a quick look at Harry after he's had his tan. Sure, he's good. Then he had to the venue. And then she just lay him horizontal because everything now We've done just a mile of this waiting time. It's of a nice sense. But very excited. It's not a big show. I'm sorry, six guys in it. Two, six are very good guys. So it's going to be interesting to see. How things go. It's going to be a great production. The stage is amazing. Black by a truck. Great lighting. And Filespot on three extra awards. So he's got the most muscular most shredded and best pose there. So we're coming for that most shredded one. We're catching up. So we're going to do this one. That's it. Got me. Got me. On. Literally, we need now the good shot, those of us. We'll probably do like 500 mil. So put the prep on him several minutes. Get that in. It's been like 10, 15 minutes window. So we're running. You have it. Yeah, I'm happy about that man. I just had to put it on. Yeah. We're in that. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to be on the road. We should have been on that road. We're going to be on the road. We're going to be on the road. Yeah. How? Yes. Can you show these gentlemen where dressing room A is? Yes. Three whole things are there. For a post? Yeah. Yeah. I'm one of these. I'm so here. That one's coming. Yeah. That money. I'm going to see. Okay. Ready? Yeah. Yeah. We just gave it on the road. Yeah.

Good, run, run, hold the glutes. Back, couple by, sir. Go, pardon me. Back, last breath. One, one, two, three, switch, please. One, one, two, three, switch, please. There you go. So, in tradition, we're eating more burgers. Haraj is just going to stage from pre-judging the absolute incredible. I don't think the peak had gone any better. It was good to see it in the light. On that stage, probably the best way I've ever seen a bodybuilding show. I've been to a lot of other videos. It's a fair play to follow. I've put one out of a show on yourself. This is just a top hurry up. Final is going to be, set on time now. Number six of our followers, the final. Big influx of food now. We know this works really well for Haraj. It's not just not everyone has this. We just know that it works. Get it in, enjoy it. Go back to the apartment and just chill. Let it do it with some magic. And then, get a bit of fluid in. Go for that. Hey guys, we're back. We're back at the venue. Haraj is just getting his hand touched up. We are half an hour from stage. Haraj is well rested. I've got a good amount of food in. He's a little bit sharper. Just trying to bring his best again. Holding that look. We had. We've had a good seven hours to hold it. So all on point, very, very happy. Just about enjoying this now. It's going to be a fantastic production. It's exciting to see good athletes on stage. But I'm going to now give you a more in vocalic intense. It's very good to be wearing clothes or things. I think the luck at the finals when he's guys is going to decide who's going to win it. So we'll see. Back a little by seven. Back, last breath. Side try set. Up dov风 dibe. Your favourب was muscular. And we've won Scali115 Arcudsman deserved this wheal. All of the venue on step-out. So, some very close friends of ours passed in the last few years. We have a separate million John Meadows and Luke Sandow. And we want you to be fitting that our first show together, we honor them in their memory and I think it's something we're going to continue to do before just to always have them in our thoughts. So, we have three prizes. We have most shredded, most muscular and best-full. One, 75, Justin Luis Rodriguez. In third place, the spring at two, number 173, Ronald Gordon. Let's bring that to Vitali Goodby-Jell. That is Job done in Detroit. Harry, unfortunately they're made to five. Condition, fullness was all there. We knew the school going into this. It's just a matter of attitude to his very pleas and frame. When that happens, it's going to be something to watch out for. It's just time, you know, it's just time spent in the gym. Time spent out away from the state. But we have more show left in us. So, that'll be in the York. That'll be probably in a few YouTube's time.

So we're just holding him in there when we're really currently just under the cup like heavies. But everybody is on point they're looking like spa. So it's just my way of just getting to registration, getting the tanned and assessing that look and then putting together the final meals for a day for the guys. I've got my teeth in there.

Just how would wait nicely he's sitting just below the cap for light heavies, which is carried we obviously want to go in, to see one three weeks ago so every little point we are starting about kilo of toy to them where we were for the regional so everything's fulfilling to play nicely and let's see what happens tomorrow. Same to say – Chenglen being hype and we pay very much thank you so much. So this is probably my first actual decent meal I've had in the last 48 hours. There is now quarter eight during this register during this time meal six will be going down very soon. I don't know if you can see this. And he will be harder in 12 pancakes. I'll probably go to the point, ground to the 30 grams of almond but I'll one banana. I'll give it a squeeze. So roughly 125 grams of carbs, just below 20 grams of fup, a small amount of peri. And we just hate this totem. Today, to 915 grams of carbs and a hundred grams of fups, I'm very don't know, peri. So the plan was just pre-mushed just popping up to the brim, dry them out overnight. In the morning, he will find off. We'll be up about 45 o'clock. We'll take a good look. It won't be some meal in probably around about half five six-ish. And then there will be a general meal probably just like rice cakes, almond but up there, jam. Probably two hours before stage. And then it's just a moment of just rung into the show. No G.I.S. rest, no full-use uncomfortable process of trying to get rid of anything. It's so clear, we'll get the dough from the end hand. And then not bad. See in the morning. You're on me. You're on. Trust me. I'll be fine. You're on me. You're on. Trust me. Hold on to five. What? What? Four. Three. Two. And what? So the show today is called to five.

the but So we've just landed in Kloan, headed to the apartment, we can't get into a cool past team. So first stop hit this gym, it's fucking epic, a well-own gym, there was no music but it's full of hoist stuff which is incredible, brand new kit, crazy crazy good gym. Last session with Jordan, just moved some blood around and then climbed the last three meals and we're good together. and some guys right three soccer gym Victor Hey I'm going to go. Yeah, I'm going to go. I'm going to have a few miles to go. Should I go to the next one? I'm going to go. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I got a bath. Sorry. I'm just going to do it. Yeah, yes it's nice. I'm going to bring that dog. AungAtab. Well, please, I can help a little bit. I'm like- They won in Germany, nearly complete. We got the plane, we headed to the Airbnb, drove the baggage off, went to the gym, Crack in gym, world gym, for the hoist stuff, which was epic. Went to Liddles, smashing peanut butter on the floor, and we got back, five of Jordan Denhovers, Kitchell's Skales rim, so we can wait and hear this. We just figured out, so we had an iPhone on the mission to find some Skales. Fels of Skales, but then to the strat, there's my close shot bit. I did buy for the mantis, I think I'd found a little bit. What made me laugh to Jordan this evening? We have a gun as a breast of us, we've done in the past, with this load. What we're trying to achieve is real crystalline us, and we're feeling that from both shows, has given us enough data to basically put this final look together, which in my opinion is going to be the best look. So, that is obviously a new attempt in fantastic at the moment. I am actually wiped out of the net once I won the AN, and I still have seven check-ins left to do, and then I've hit the sack, ready to come to run. I'm just one of my normal first known interest rates, getting my team outside. I just rose, please, put it back. Let it not even over, it's on you for the time. Just trickle me, and as you know, with the war, I'm just going to get a little further in. I was at a pretty pre-procal our preparations going on. Well, we are giving it all. Come on, it's raining more. The best look is coming. The war holds kind of work. Don't worry, it's just peat max before I go for it. I'm not sure if I can finish it. I'm not sure if I can finish it. Thank you, Jeremy. Good afternoon. I'm Steve O. I'm Jordan. It's a very nice time. First time we're going to take this pizza. I'm going to show you the real amount of pizza. I'm a bit... It's a bit as far as I can see. It's not because I'm so happy. I'm just going to go to the street for dinner. I'm not going to show you the full of what it is. It's going to get nice and weight. Probably that's of the gym. You know, I'm going to set your name. Jordan obviously, too. Well, good luck. It's a good luck. And we have the town hall. It's a good assessment of all the rest of the people. We're going to have a town hall today. We are at 2 meals a week. So everything is going to go well. We got a lot of the time. We're going to do it for the next 24 hours. It's more of a day when it's going to take weeks with meals. Just making sure everything is going to go well. It's just taking a while. Yeah. Yeah. No. No. Yeah. No. No. No. You mean? Oh, the way is going to make it. It's good. Well, you make this. Yeah. You want to say, because Jordan means you have to have a good time. But the Jordan is this, but you project my means. This. You're going to get in the air. You got my ideas for all of the life. Don't make this. Never told me. Don't make this. Don't make this. It's going. It's going. It's going. I'm going. I'm going. Go out. Go out. Go out. Go out. Go out. Never. Never. Please. It's crazy. That's it. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it.

See, you can get. They're not so good. One. See for. Left arm and should snap the plan Kane Suzy High Street. Oh, this is something. Nothing? It's nothing. Oh, you did not forward to you. Oh, yes, very true. So we are back at the apartment. Jordan is ready to say that he's now a child. That was one month for a disaster. Oh, Doug, we're just announcing that. We're sitting back, chill. Still, the net is okay. I'm not mad. I'd be like, how'd you say about the carps? I'm feeling a warm and good to go in. I've been in my firmness. So this is the good luck to be top. I'm just tricky to fluid it. I forgot the rest of the night. With a table of meals, a bandath of love. And then just a little bit over waking up on the money. So pretty much under that. Two kilos down, though I have the approach I'm going to discover is different for the last team, like I said before. It's just a gallery they cut out and assess each. Four inches, says, what we're doing as well. So just to my, I've just put them together. And hopefully this plush is just going to be either one. I'm just like, huh? I'm just like, huh?

So all we can do now is go to bed. Our sales may not have to be enough to stand in, and I'll be doing card works at this. It's just a matter of waking up in the morning. Jordan's going to be on the Monday. I'm going to be happy, and then it's just a game time. So should be, we're starting around half a ten. There's no fitness, let us class the body around in. And it's open body building. So I say we're over half as a level, top as ten new game time. You should be odd. And it's just, we're going to see what happens. Go get feeling about this one.

Good Italian, public Italian, at the end of the town, basically. Just tweaked a few things if we need to, just if there are a few roasts, take it in, roast with a square of ice. And then it's just a bit of waiting to show that. We're here at the venue, Jordan has just been turned. We've had a quick look. Things are looking very, very good. I'm very excited. I'm trying to just keep everything cool. The look is very strange. The look is very strange. I'm trying to keep everything cool. The look is very strange. I'm trying to keep everything cool. The look is very strange. It's very, very good. For me, we weren't even going to do this show. We have to the venue, we're going to call it a day. A few days later, we called some more off with a set. We looked at how Jordan was responding. He was in a good position to say. So we just know straight into it. And it's been a good move. It's been a good move. It's been a good move. We've got probably about two or three hours until stage time. So tomorrow I'm chilling now.

Uh, concert all year round three. My man is just going for a little piss. He's going for a little harder. And the more put the title we did. The three judges. We headed back to the hotel. Look at that. I have been beaten. Put this man to bed. I have a no stop. I'm going to walk on the joy of full on. I don't want to walk. Keep him a muffin. Never a food. Man's happy. He's asking looking back to again though. Three three three judges. We left St. Louis stage. We want to keep that low. It's not about going away in just destroying it with burger or fries. for a ride somewhere. It's about maintaining that bringin' it presentation for the finals and making sure that we're gonna hopefully take that first place to hit the overall I think there's enough pro-killer. So it's been good to put experience and what we've done. We've got the exact same thing. You know, it's very important to give up the individual same thing, to throughout the whole prep. Don't start introducing new run-up things last minute. It's the last thing we want to do is for what the look. You know, your body's already used to process the same type of food. So I'm very important that we do the stuff that we've got the same shop. We're seeing what we've got. We're seeing everything. You know what I mean? So we're gonna keep that in sister's, so I flew, who? Game time. News in. Nick has just taken first place, or a complex classic. Man's a Z. So he is now going on to the overall, which should be about that many minutes time. So another good result for the day. Fingers crossed. We've taken overall there. We get the pro-killer here. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. For rough out some. For ya know folks, they start batting my bones. Wellient prints, by our own burning looks. I don't know if all three minutes left. Everybody wants me home. All raw! With we each stand somewhere, we can wear me blue, even those grey shadows and winning Yes Baby! How old! Kemmaxes! Classic käyttense. Run, Run, Run, recovery successist offJonas violin four people there ... five 7 in I learned done. Okay, so I really love that amazing took his class, class D, one point into the overall Unfortunately, over a birthday, we done our best, he looked absolutely insane, but class D guy was very very good. But please don't be afraid, I'm not sure he's shredded, a lot tissue, but yeah, no broguards Dave, and we don't stop. However, we do have a special guest. Mr Carlos. New, maybe bro. That was a real thrill. It's a thing you might as well, obviously I saw you after the pre-jocing our news, you have said, like, this could be on. And then we come back later. I appreciate you Conmer, and this is a lot of news. I love the British community. It's a good, it's a good body movement. It's a good move. It's what was it? Free weeks ago, four weeks ago. I can't believe it. I think it was three weeks. Re-sport for that. You need to know, you can speak in over there. Yeah, I don't know. I'm sure. But the moment is like, like, it's warm. Yeah, good morning, oh, it is about five. Something morning. Yeah, we just got head to the airport, drop the car off, jump on plane, land this sunset, nail it to maiden head for two roof show. Louis is competing there. He should be on stage probably around about our bus 11. Maybe 11 o'clock. We land at half past nine, so it's going to be very right. I've also got Nick, who won yesterday, and I'm going at the fair expo today. So I'm just going to split the him. I think it's in pictures and videos across the minute. My little job. See how he's looking, and rolling with that one. We'll give Louis his orders in a minute. We're going to give it air for about an hour, so I'm just going to make sure the guys have got their instructions for that period of time. And as soon as I land touch base, it'll go to him. We have just landed in the UK. It is 10 to 10. The two brochure starts in 10 minutes. We are in our 10 minutes away, so we're fucking going. So Louis is in classic, and he passes a few to start at 11. My sat nav just tell me who your maths tell me. His speed won't go in at me. This thing in his past 11 minutes. We will get there. But London traffic can push him on that. So, take a scratch. We're going to make it in time. Yeah. Man, I'm going to make it. I'm going to fucking make it. We'll stop on there. 20 past 11. Oh, absolutely fantastic. Just drive safe, right? I'm not going to put you on stage. I'm going to tell you now. What's the start of the classic, instead of 11 o'clock? Do you know what? I'm not sure. I've just put it here. I think it might be 11, 11, 15. So, I definitely think it would be here, bro. Are they doing guest spot in between body building and club? Yeah. Are they doing body building? Yeah, yeah. That's why they said the classic side I never thought. Bang. Yes. Yes. The traffic starts at 11 o'clock. Yeah, we can. Yeah. All right. See you in a minute. Do you know what I mean? Quick stop. Petrostation. I forgot how much just thing drinks. Fuel. We have 50 miles to go. We're starting miles less than the tank. So, we're still on schedule. The show for classic isn't how I started out. It was 11, because we got guest poses. So, we are on point. We're going to make you a 10 minutes to spare. So, fingers crossed. Yeah. I'm going to start on the end of the line. I'm going to leave. Who wins guys who wins? He's going to use your glasses or not only with the UK, but several I have been in. Let it start. Let it start.

It's a little bit insane. Absolutely insane. You did back the back show. So you competed just a one. And then, a long day today, he looked absolutely insane from the pictures I've been saying in the videos. Just one of those things. I haven't seen any pictures yet. So when I do, I'll give him some feedback. It does. I think he can. Let me just give some feedback from some people who live there as well. Go from there. I'm going to have a chat with him. Probably tonight. Tomorrow. And so. So a game plan. For the way forward, whether we could do another show. Soon. Or we'd take a step back and plan something later on. Louis smashed it today. I'll be able to smash it yesterday. Nick smashed it yesterday. Nick got third today. Smash it. Cracking weekend. Absolutely buzzing. Every is killing it. Peace.

Yes guys, we are here at the strength of fitness lab in Wigan, what fantastic gym? Really good guys, really good lighting, really good fitness. I am broken, I have my shoulder last night, so I have kind of trained with my heart so I am going to be going to back the equilibrium and it is not so many insane. I do this at a manor, however, training, and it is a pretty big success. Even now we have got an hour and a quarter now this session before a shot. It is going to hold that workout with a little bit of back, soft up for a manor. You can be throwing a little bit of back for me, this is well. A lot of good lowly stuff here today, so in this gym we must have a good one. What we are doing is spending the most of your maxi, are quick and quite easily. We have to make it difficult to pull the whole move. Only into muscle rounds, rest force set, and even though that is really maximized the alpha, just get what we need to get done. We are going to do a workout, and we are doing a good workout. We are going to do a good workout, and we are going to do a good workout. We have recently changed the disease, trained with split, and that is always pretty much to a pro-smit. I like the sub-roads of me out the gym for repressment, but how much of this can see these deep in the front, and then we have been in a position because we got multiple shows running in. We can try and go in, raise the weight, and multiple muscle breach in session. We can get in, train them as soon as we get out. We have got a lot of work in the LC today, and we are going to say a rotation training split, basically working on whits and thickness in its back, upper left, arms swing white glutes, and this one we are really, really well. We are currently sitting at a 100-footed kilo, that week is out, and we are very, very good. This last day of the week, we are going to want to make one at 7, so we are going to bring something completely different this summer hours, work on the weaker areas, really cool in the month, but really excited to see all we can see when it comes to sunburn at the same week. So recently our team watched my respect, recently I was doing free level at 2 up at, and you also didn't know I am going to throw that in my belly for a bit, work time to get used to doing that on. Now, if my opponents were about to go a little bit, I would like to wrap my eyes in today's split, every 3 push forward nights, and so each mother root in the equal miles, little whack throughout the week, out of the middle of that piece. Is that any favourite nation? I am going to say a few minutes, my favourite bit of watching like, bodybuilding reviews when I was a kid, was watching them shoot, who's shopping? What you can do is watch a J-Cut and watch Render Super. So now we are going to watch, look at this, pick up this food, the next couple of days. The plan is 10 weeks out, the in over 7,000 calories, 1,000 grams of carbs. This is steak. I'm only going to cook 101 meal prep, rats, rice, turkey, turkey, turkey, sticking around here on the ground, go to the food.

Put it in the place. Yeah, that's it. Put it back. It's a bad one, bro. Why do you crack in so much? You go up and go up and go up. So we're going up, go up on your cat, up and then sink into your glutes and hamstrings. So we're going up and go up and go up and go on the cat, relax and then relax your glutes. Okay. Then go up on the tiptoes. Okay. Then sit into your glutes and hamstrings. Really hard. No, no, no. We're going to see you on the floor. Oh, that's a lot of your hooks. Up and then like almost drive your hamstrings into the floor. And the drops. No, no, you're not doing it. You're not doing it. You're not doing it there. Right? We're going to do this. Go up. Take it right here. And then we sit into the hamstrings. Like an ordinary. Like a walk. Normally it's in the lower floor. I don't confuse you. You want it? That one's up. Not relax. Just plant it here a little more. Squeeze it, move to him. Like then I have to show you how that. Yeah, I always let it up. You don't want to go. You don't want to go. Just go away. Yeah. It's the after I've got a few more vegetables. Like 20 minutes for any minutes after I've got my stomach to go. And then I'll be happy. You'll probably be on the other side. I'm going to go in the vegetables. Do you know how many? Yeah. Oh, don't ever root. I don't know if it's different for you. Make them home mid. Don't be like my fat frio. No, okay.

I'll never know if it's coming twice. That's my sugar, my mouth. I'll give you water. Go ahead and stick on. I'm like the coach. Give me any water. I'm just going to give my bag. It's probably going to take a guess. Yes, and you're one. Maybe with one. Then it's a little bit of a bit of a bit. Yeah, but just be fine. We're all about how you need to have a firebuck to your sugar market. That sounds like a gastrointour. Drunking to be, or in a, I can even give you, so you can make it yourself. You're just going to be working. It's up to yourself. Well, I'm working. One mile away. Okay. And a cloth. Yeah. And you want to get some sleep for me. So, what do you're burying? Okay. I'll tell you what they got. Oh, God. Just see if there's any smash burges around here. Like, see some burges. Yeah. With three lots of fries. Free lots of large fries. Two large breads. So, of course. If you want to risk having a double out of that trap, put it in. Okay. If you want to. Yeah. Well, like, we'll work for a little cheese. That'd be it. We'll see. She's set you off. I'm trying to make sure that that's true. Maybe. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just cheese burick or in a bun. I'm at two parties. Cheese bun. Take all the onions and make some of my thought work.

Coaches take them food on the goat. We're actually getting Roy's rapes easy to beat. When they're running, like it had with chicken. Even making our leg tumble for a few months. Also got some mints in there that are putting the rapes on. No excuse to make sure when we're flying around the world. Oh, come on, boy. Come on. Yo, it is episode six. We're here. We're in the world's largest apple. On a way to Alicante, it's the Amateur O. We have Louis Davis, Abbey Ola, T-C. Both in classic Louis Davis doing O-Classy and Masters. Abbey Ola is doing O-Classy. Louis Davis is number of the cast. Abbey Ola is the small one in. One of five point one. He has his cup is one of four point five. So when he has still the very careful today, just making sure that he's in nice and easy to land into the registration tomorrow morning, he will land early doors tomorrow. Get ready to get a session in the Titan's gym. Head to the apartment. So down, then we're going to have an all-one to fill and then it's shooting else on the day. So take it off. I think I have a little car for this morning. I just have a chicken and veggies as soon as I go. So I've traveled to the Amateur O-Classy. Then I had a car for the Amateur O-Classy. Then I just have to go there. One, two, three, four. I'll be happy. I'll be happy. After the PM, we can get ready to start the project. What does he want to see? Because the wrong thing won't come next. That's never been on stage before, yeah. I'm going to send that. Okay, it's like this morning really. This is an amazing night. Thank you for any time today. Yeah. We start close-warking tonight. Yes. Okay, we'll see that we are in the morning. Again, we're going to go on a trip tomorrow. I was in the front 30 years ago. I'm fully seeing that. I'm so mad. So mad. So mad. Oh, we can. Now, now we can. Now, now we can. Oh, we can. Now, now we can. Cool this is on the champion session. Two out to so far this year. We're moving the amyent. Make it a hat trick. Some it tells me yes. Jump in and go. There's shank in our seat. Oh my god. Okay. Where is our two? Hahahaha hahahaha. Come on. Take one before the moment. Thank you. Yeah, sure. We only have an option. If you're owned by the CHD of EXPERTS, you're equally smart. I'll do a call from Future- Three days time, in three days time, will we make it three out of three? Will I be going home that I'm a trainer of the champion? Some thinking my heart said yes, however the mind knows this with the mind does. Play out of story in your head of eventualities, but we're locked into the process. It's got to go again the best we've locked. So what will be? Learn to walk by faith and not by sight. I'm getting bit and head to toe in Muzzies. So at one moment my gut is humble about first day in Spain. Seeing Louis at Titans, putting for a quick session, pull session, nothing serious. Just moving the blood around, moving the food around, putting in a position where he can start his load. Effectively, okay, we're under the cap. So we've got a good amount of carbs going into night registration. The him is two o'clock tomorrow. Abbey Ola is getting closer to his cap. He's 105.8 this evening, which is good way for him. His caps, 104.5. That's got to be made by tomorrow morning about 10 o'clock. Probably about 11 o'clock by the time he lands and gets to the venue. We're going to head off early. We'll meet him at the venue. Then go to Titans again. But him for a session. See where we are. Plan the food in because we've actually got an extra day load in this tunnel around rather than when in Ireland. We only have a very short period of time. So it's going to be interesting to see what we can do as he can that time period. Then go back to the apartment, catch up the Louis. Go to Titans with him and then go to the registration and then to Titans with him. See how we can move with him. So it should be a good day tomorrow. Saturday the day of chicken eating and Sunday is show day. Tonight, climb work early night. Up in the morning and get going. Your guys, it's Friday morning. We're here at BV Space's registration day. Just waiting on Abbey. Let's see a ride. You've just got off the plane. You went to bed under the cat. So he's just been sitting on the wall through the plane journey. Make it here. It should make way absolutely fine. And I can feed him. I thought it's actually in your sleep. We'll leave he. I'm not sure if we're in full session. Just move some blood around. Just put me in a position where he can then start his load. As he has done, he's a very important man. I'll be out of his bed. He's coming. I can see the man. He's got a hill. He's got a lot of his. We're in a position now where I need to see this man. Yes, yes, yes. I get some food in and make it. Yeah, listen. I haven't eaten in the while. I was a foot. I was a foot like that. I'm full of energy. This is Johnny. This is my boy. Yeah. He's going to show on us around. And see you. So what's going to be a hell? Just stay up there. We're going to get a way in. And then it's going to be a fucking food. I've been looking forward to this. Even oats. Anything right now. I'll make sure I have all the good stuff. So all of this stuff. Yeah. Thank you. Hey, buddy. You're hungry for some. Hey, you're hungry for some. Hey, you're hungry. Hey, you're hungry. you can enter the adjacent of the whole dimension it literally helps to make it moreescad That's fucking the goal. Oh, now I'm off the line. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Yes, me and Mike are tight in the game. It's the last time I see the ball. And I'm here with that. A notes of style. Okay, this session is just purely a fun session. Apple-Moddy fun. All my cigarettes covered. Even now. Okay, just for the boy here great. Just take on the guys. As we continue the process, tomorrow we have full rest day. Okay, so it's the last sleeping in a zoom round of poses. It's like 9 or 7. It's Sunday. They're not going to be able to score a score. It's not going to be a pretty problem. I'm going to try to do it. We've gone down a little bit. So we just have to manipulate everything. So make sure we're at a level for that time frame. It's like you're too old. It's like you're really good. Like? Yeah, we're going to rest. Yeah, we're going to rest. Yeah, we're going to rest. Yeah, we're going to rest. Yeah, we're going to rest. Let the guys go to talk and now. Okay, so much to do. I'm looking for a look better. What was it? I'm not sure if this is a picture of my cherry. Yeah, it's going to be a good one. We're going to go. Got it. Hello. Hello? Who's this? Hello. He's a flat today. My obsession. Okay, so push the boys for a quick workout. Just had a really good look at them. I've got a good bleachers room around a few rounds of clothes. You keep up with it. Just get from me with this. See how they look in. I'll let them bleed in. Set the food for the rest of the day.

Deadlift in Barbell Rowan, heavy fucking weight. For years, okay? I've now actually taken any deadlift in any bent over row in away from Lewis at the moment. We are now being very selective with the exercises that we are choosing to ensure that we create the physique that we want to see on stage, okay? So what we're doing is trying to work on that upper whip, so we'll be just picking movements that are going to work with his physique, okay? Stop looking at favorite guys on Instagram and copy in the movements there, they're in because they've probably got 10, 15 years experience on you. Start with a basic, start with a groundwork filled up foundation. Hey, hey, hey, hey, go, come on, come on, drive. High, high, high high, high, high, high, high. Help! Catch you on the next.

Come on, babe. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Lewis is five weeks out, Amanda's six. Both training with the same intensity. Same strength, all because the team is managed properly. We're able to carry out all of our sessions, 100%. We're not worrying about backing off. Use the lies in Rectown Reserve. We can hit every session still at 100%. And this managing that constantly going into the next few weeks is important. Just to make sure the body is going to be fresh in a position where they can both peak to perfection. Oh, yes. One more exercise with back. It's going to do a little bit of shrugs. We only recently just brought shrugs back into Lewis's plan. Just working a little bit of thickness through the upper back, free the run boys, free the traps. Just to release outline the detail in his physique. So, some of you are working on for the last five, six months. Finish that, come relax, slice them by, and then we're done. You got 15? Yeah. Ow. Ow. I just said no, I don't know how to put them in.

It's not about beautiful. You're going to be lower than the pumps. The pumps will go eventually. It's about going through the motions.

=== FILE: EUROPA PRO 2024 ｜ THE CONDITION COACHES [sR0fTdREAts].txt ===

Yes guys, welcome back to the YouTube we are here at Grittness. Okay it is show we can't is the Europe approach and the MPC European Pro Qualifier. We have a number of athletes from the team from season. I'm here currently with Lewis, really a sport open pro and then we've got that really really like every week pro amateur, for his pro part we've got Matthew Sulek, open heavyweight amateur goes there's pro part. We're going to be catching up with Cala as well at some point. He really is open men's to seek, he's going for his pro part as well. We're very eventful. We came for the guys, Amanda is landing tomorrow. She's coming up with Cardi who's a physique pro, who's competing on Saturday and then we have two of her bikini pro competing on the Sunday. We're here for the guys final contestant. Okay, we just teamed up just to run through some exercises, move the food around, they've all started carburetor, didn't yesterday, so today it's just a start to reuse, that's the development of the pro session we say. I'll take a look at them upstairs and here with this much of open free we've got Crackin, heavy and beer as well, which we're getting some good shots at later. closer up in the water aswell as well. I'm walking only the back藏 pool and I'm going focus on the Copiat� here from the league.ễn Dar's busy following ribs And if I go up with you need to, I can go hard and out. So I'm just so much good, still good. Yeah, now I'm pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty good. I think there's the beach in it. I'm really happy to let me know. Because how many meals now have you got? I have one in two meals. Yeah. So yeah. I can still push good amount of food in now today. And tomorrow we pull out 11 steps. Even an athlete. Yeah, even pushing the water in the back of the little way. Or just see where we're saying, you know, you're like a sponge now. You know, everything's just in the sun again. So if you're depleted yourself and out of the glycogen storage, you can be like, the feel we feel we feel makes it. So it's going to work really well. Get that meal in it. And then like, I'm going to even give you another meal. So it's just like spacing out. So like, if you want, you may not be too, I'll work very good. Or you can go. Thanks. Really. Yeah. Honestly, really good. Really good. But yeah. I'm all the happy where we are. And food is really good. Yeah. And that's what you can do as an athlete. It's a groove. You know, you're better already. And it's just going to over 40 hours. So you can try a little bit. You know, this is where the fuck really happens. We keep pushing. I think like I said, if you have your meal now, and then I'll work out what we're going to do for the rest of the meal. We're going to do the back of the apartment. And then set the meals up in that job. And then you can go to the press. And then I'll come in. Come and get you a work. And get the image made up. You're going to be back. Whatever. Work out. But yeah. Keep doing what you do. This is marketing. Thank you. Yeah Good night. Can you put any more muscle in your road. Can we breathe? Yeah. It's not her job. What's it like now? Is it a little late on a day? Well, the strives and you've got to be a police man. Yeah, yeah. But that was just drier than it was. Yeah, it was. No, but I'm drier. It's drier than it is. It's a big team. Yeah, it's not really. It's checklists. With me, I'll say, see what the bubbles are going to be. Yeah, no, no. Yeah, sweet. Everybody's on. I'm happy. Everybody's fucking happy. Everybody's on. I'm fucking happy. This is very good. I, as a coach. Everyone's on the most stressful and in the weekend. There is zero stress when we all go to the place. Just brings a buzz. We can't cry. We're just sitting for the amateur. We're looking at just thunder for eight hours. And for the pros, probably about 52, 53 hours. I'd be in a position like this when we're not chasing anything. Everything is so easily manipulated at this point. With carb sodium, water, little bit of direct here and there. No, it's the puller that I'm pushing. You can do it this way, that will make a physique. Because everybody's in that prime position now. It's so easy. So, when they're going to show. What we got to do is keep repeating what we did. Let's go back to come Winston. I see a struggle there. I used to be a tiny. It's a strange, everybody. I'm going to grab to create a rise. It's a new cause of funny. And then we'll add some blueberries a little bit of away. Last day of sort of pushing carbs quite heavily. And then tomorrow we could just back a little bit. Let the GI stress subside. And then ready. A Saturday, game day. How'd you let any of your sidechairs in the test? Yeah, you only proved that that's not popular. Oh, it's going to be good. Let's go on your back. Then what's your last show? The last show. The warmest Texas. Was it two weeks ago? No, it was longer than that one there. Who was four? Who was four? Who was four twice a size? So for all the changes. This would take a mat in for you. So we are back at the Airbnb. The boys are coming at Camp Winston. So it's now coming. Extremely happy seeing the guys after their final session. Everybody has some form of lowly in yesterday. Some heavy lenders. Today is pretty much day to one or two guys. We'll push a little bit more of a rest of it tomorrow. Everybody's on. Everybody's happy. I am stress free. Just really, really excited to see what's going to happen on Saturday. I'm sorry. My favorite part is for us. The guys that have been there. The inside of the flush. Three Monica has kindly come here to work on all the guys. Rather than us having to go into the Vigilia. The CS. She's been able to come here. She's been fantastic. She's now working on Matthew. She's not Lewis. She's got Danny and then Bilius. So she's back to the back. It's all going to help because they're going to feel comfortable. But flush in three. They're going to sleep well tonight. Wake up on the money is normal. And then pretty much tomorrow will be just a balance in act for everybody. And then Saturday is game day. The amateur should be on the run about midday. Caled the men's seat boy. He should be on maybe one half oneish. And then Lewis, the pro show of Bilius. Five PM with them think going on fast. And then they should be last. So it could be a pretty late one on Saturday. But it kind of late. Okay. So we'll catch later. Lewis is fucking sure that. I'm pretty sure I'll check in. And the trial gets each night. So they haven't caught a time. habil Efendimiz. So you smell party cold. I want to do somekindles. Cause I think. Superb those now. Yeah. You can see that. Yeah. Woo. Oh. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. That was awesome they to Cam Winston. It is. So, do 1.5 gram? 1.5 for centros. Yeah, thank you. So, he has... Matthews up, move it up, both for looking, freaking awesome. Matthew had six hours sleep, which, as of yesterday, he got four. Before that, it was probably getting about two or three hours, and night. He's not actually really well. He's actually... heavier than what he was for the regional, but he's fuller with more condition, which just... is that the perfect spot to be... again, being where we are now, you've been able to push a little bit more aggressively with fullness, and shows for it as physique, as legs are... in a much more better position now, than they were for the regional, and they were a phenomenal analyst, thinking better now. Moodies, a couple of pounds, a lighter than where we were at this point for the regional. He's... conditioned, he's fuller again. When you're in a position where there's more conditioning coming through, you can push a little bit more and be a little bit more aggressive with the fullness, which then pushes more conditioning through, because... tissue is pushing through to the skin, so it brings our illusion here in more... even better conditions, which is fantastic. It's just set there, but for the first couple of years of the day, just literally just posing every hour after every meal, see how they respond, the just animals needed. Lewis is still sleeping. He will probably wake in the next few days. 45 minutes. Do the same thing. Have a look. Lewis is looking incredibly dry. All the guys had a full lymphatic flush through from Monarch here, today they were pretty creepy, following that Lewis was like... the dry stuff they've ever seen in the night, even what's looking like is show day, condition last night. So today's going to be pretty wild, mubless. This is about our 16th show, 15th, 16th show together. We were doing the mass yesterday, and by like... I can beat Lewis and my eyes because I'm pretty much... I'm probably confident in that as well. It's so exciting to see how he's looking this morning. We've got a good map of how that's going to pan out of the day for him. He's going to be on a 5pm, which is a first of this season. He's not been in on an evening show for a long time. This is back in Europe a couple of years ago. So it's going to be interesting how that pans out, how the look looks. I know it's just going to get better through the day tomorrow. So... Because I have really seen this, he's not messaged me yet. Kind of silly thing, because he's still... He's a late-rise or anyway. So I'll get them through and sort them out. We have Andrew doing the PSA show on Sunday, some way for him to check in. And Amanda is joining us today. She should be up here a little bit, they're all tough to lean. She's got the carli, he's doing the same throw and the two would have to be a bikini pro on Sunday. So... That's me. Yeah, where are we? I'm caught on there. You bet fresh. Everybody's on. Lewis is now alive in Kithyan. Just welcome up even more. What's sticking in him. Minus, the green heat. Both of them really good lighted. He's looking... ...dry like... ...in dron. Honours really good for us. I was leaving loud through this crowd, but we're throwing a sauce-based pretty well with him. Pretty much just a loud coasted in Mount Heese. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you. Thank you. I'll stay here. I'll stay here. I'll stay here. Everything's up. Still alive. Please, place it. It is slightly better than the Texas drone. It comes off in top four, fourth place, ...whacing in Texas. So this update that you're looking at right here was the most recent one. It's two days old. It's up his back. He looks really impressive here. My name comes in another update. Four days ago. But I wanted to show you guys that I felt really, really, really, ...arrily was the level of your nasty, ...lether day that he's displaying in this. You can tell he's in the racing condition. And I think as you watch this video, ...who's free. We'll go back in a really Markers update. Well, I said about really, ...maniacally this could be a very condition-focused competition. I've been how I felt that William doesn't look super peeled in his updates. It's up there, it's like this from guys like Louis Bree. That made me think, William's condition is quite up to stuff here. I'm so much better. I'm so much better. I'm so much better. I'm so much better. Jowls again. Ah! I think he's not a level of perfecting fuck. I'm just not a level of pretty much fucked. It's not gonna end down. I'm trying to break into the wall. So we did the same year as the Sp�. This is plenty. I'm just getting harder, drier. How you're posing through the reef, as well through your armstring and the duck is much better. It's a really, really, really perfect way that you're holding it in and when you're up, you're not releasing your duck, that was in. Making it work really well. So that's what I'm doing. It's a good distance crazy. I thought I was just back to life from where it was this morning. I was just going to go back up again, which was good. There were three for the one I see. So, that's it. No, no. This way you show, because that's right. That way you can't put it on my side, but you're way round to me. What? You can't put it on my side. You're way round to me. What? You can't put it on my side. You can't put it on my side. You can't put it on my side. Here's where you're. Here's where you're. Who's pretty sick of that? I'm like, I'm like, I love my heart. I don't care. Yeah. Good night. This is about, come. To the back. Where is your seat? The counter. And one stage. It's just wacky. The dryer. Harder. Fullness is. You don't wait tomorrow. That didn't look so bad. It's not working. It's working. It's not working. Oh, John. I'm never gonna find those go open spots. Yeah. Yeah. Very happy. I don't know you don't like the way you look. I don't care about that. What's the deal then? You're always gonna... It's basically... In two hours time you could feel an acid. It's just... You're like a batch of ever-wise. So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it. So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it? Yeah, just... Yeah, just... Yeah. It's... When you come onto stage, you've got the line. So you just go off center line slightly. Yeah. And that's gonna show out your hit it. So you're here then you might be interested. Yeah. Because your mid-section looks better in that pose than trying to hit the dory. Yeah, the dory looks cool what I should say. Because it's... Because it's a new pose. I'm a bit like... You know what I mean? You know what I mean? The last thing I want to do is... And think it's a smooth transition around to... Yeah. So that's what you can practice maybe. You know, for future shows, a dory and one. Yeah, a good thing to do. Just a twist on that side chest as well. Like... Like... I've worked with shitloader on my mobile at E&R. Fucking twist. And you're like... More and more. I'm like... I'm trying. But like... It's the mobility. Yeah. Yeah. But think it's even in your court when you're doing this. You can see it. It's bringing that top line. What you're doing now is just getting that little bit more rotation around. Just talking about that. It's a bit... It makes you wear some smile because you're... Yeah, because I do do it. And then I film myself go. Yeah. Just like... Yeah. Just like that. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's... One point. Just keep doing what you do. Next year was normal. I started 40 years with that scum. Yeah. And then you know what happens from then? Me. So everything's just sucking. Yeah. You're waiting for this. Like this is pretty much where you're working when things take a good... Just getting it a lot of not freaky. Yeah. Like, literally, it's like, none of them have been painted bleeds. They go with thin box, solid tissue and leather. That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... It's good. This is good. Detail for your hamstring and glutes. Yeah, glutes are still in out more. So that little crease underneath your glute. Before we are seeing when you're flat. It's now still in out nicely. You're getting dry through that area as well. So it's just like sealing to the skin. It's good. Everything's moving in the right direction. We're getting another big meal in. And then I can see you in person again. What I do is I'll... What time did you eat? Hey, that one. Look. Yeah, it's only been like one hour for you. So getting another meal in. Maybe in like 45 minutes. Yeah, he always takes me. Yeah, I'll get back and message you. But then what I do is I'll give you another meal to take with you. To the first. To the first. Registration. We're getting some fat out of the nose. Here you go. We finish it on. We'll be in the next. Yeah Beautiful I'm gonna catch it You're gonna pop it What's this guy? What's this guy? What's this guy? What's this guy? I'm gonna tell him what I can feel flat. I knew just had a layer of time to smooth everything out. So we're here at the venue, the soft silk boat's out. He's throw the Europa pro. Cool if I. No, less, the less. Really. Matthew. Here. Well, we're on Khaled's mainstay. Matthew's on his time. Matthew's on his time. Louis and Billy are sitting in. You're a good. Everybody's happy. Everybody's happy. Everybody's happy. Just a matter of just getting this out of the way and getting back to the Airbnb. It's just a bit of an end. It just got an edge as I'm praising. Detrain me in his end. It's about not that. Not too long before we go, minutes. So once I stand, everybody's dead. It's good. Said, I'm on a looking at everybody. We go back to, I've pretty much just assessed the last meal. Everybody's the best. We're waiting tomorrow at the money. Let's give it to girls. We'll catch you later. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. Check out his deck. We'll see. Look at this.

We showed the two losel n colour That's fine. Yes. What's going on? Very good for him. Yeah, I think we can keep pushing. Because you're not getting dry, you're not. He is, so I'm not. Mid-section's tight, so out here. Do you feel good when you pose like that? Yeah. He's arm. Yeah, so you're on 20 hours. Yeah, we got another whole day nearly. Yeah, but like I said, you're a rather push. Yeah. Push now. If you got any more meals prepared or is that the boys? No. But you feel the next meal? Yeah. Yeah. Well... Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Good. Good. Yeah. Yeah. We have visited many places that can come in from Europe. Yeah, really good. It's game day. So, is it right? Yep. Yes, yeah. I don't know. No. So I think it looks... It's Saturday morning after... Come with us and there's something called... Yeah. I'm one of the other people in the pro. Everybody is looking for a good person. Just taking a look at the first time this morning. Very, very happy. The other boys' aeropop are like four o'clock, so they'll be up and then seven bucks a bed. Lewis might just stay in bed for a bit. So I can now feed them some more food. It's top and up. We'll be on stage for five o'clock tonight. So it can be a pretty long day, but we're in the best position right. Now, a couple of decent sized meals in. We know that works well, and it literally just keeps them right in a solid position before we hit the stage. So, yeah, they look pretty crazy this morning. Dry. You know, that makes it lovely. It's such a... Lines in the air. Everyone, lines everywhere. Bubbles in line. Bubbles in the middle, so. And... The starting part. And... Yeah. I'm happy. I'm tired. We're doing this. We're doing the back. Back. We're off the bed. On the floor. When you're just trying to put your hand in the chair. There. That's it. Remember that. That's how you go. Have your house. Okay.

So yeah, but now it's like I feel like I've got, so this was supposed to be my last year and I say it every year and it never happens and then I just feel like there's like unfinished business now and that I don't actually need to go right off of season and go back up to 80, do you or me and go back up to that 85 kilo, stay relative to condition and then get more condition and do you have to work as hard to get into condition? Yeah, yeah, so yeah, what should it be? It might not be the last year, but I said it was the last year. As we all know, like, everybody is one of those things I like, the more show you do about you get, everything I'm gonna show you and women's physique is that the condition is better and better I mean, hardly fade unless you're born as tired, obviously our body's not tired now, so she could and she really get tired and I know Kylie does, like, women in 2021 show her the show, show her the full show, our nose and she fucking at 90 by then and it is one of those things because it's like two, like six after a year, yeah, yeah, so possibly the anime for shows that begin in part of the year, yeah, yeah, a few together, European ones, yeah, and for like ideas, to get show, yeah, yeah, it's fine, and I had to, yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll be, I would like to go through her plan to do, all you go to the TV, now she's broke her eyes for two years, off, you need to earn your stripes and roll-y, as always say, you need to come back, show him moments to the same judges and keep fucking going, if you love it, then you'll keep going, and if not, you retire, but also, hate is it, she's now 40 free so she could do, you must as well, yeah, because they got mastered limpia at 25, so why not?

For the long, he UK who is free. We are now at the Red Cross, the White Cross. Today, we are very good there. It's been a very good day. It's been a very eventful busy mixed bag of emotion days. Yeah. That's pretty much it. Just summed it up. Louis is just a little staves, pays and third. And it is 10 o'clock at night. Very long day. I've been up for a long day. I've been up for a long day and check it again. I still do check-ins now. Yeah. I've got a guy on my mind. Just a few people. Just a few people. From everybody, it's all positive. Louis is best. Carly was best. Everybody is at the best today. That's what you can do. Two pro car wins. They are placing open pro show. Top 10. We are in the second and is fast. Top 10 for Vilias. Matt was in the beach. I think we are 12. He is open pro, baby. Moody second. Carly 12. Yeah, yeah. We are not sure where she is. That's what we are. That's what we are talking about. Yeah. We are going to get some food. Make it some snubs without the meal. Make it a little break. Day 2 at the Europa Po. We now got tilde athlete. tilde athlete. Lux. Take free. Day 2. We have tilde. We came here. This is the second show this year. Last year, last week was her pro W. It was a pro W in bikini class. She got a pro car 2 years ago in wellness. She is downed by 40 pound of muscle. 40 pound. It was crazy. You are not feeling this warm. The group is still in full. Basically last week we were going to feed back. How to apply to go into this week. That is what we have done. We got a different tan. A little bit of a different approach. A little bit more fullness this week. I think it is really nice to have another panel of judges. I will see what she is going to do. Tell the how do you feel? Honestly. Really nice. It is very much happening this week. It is getting to show us well. It is not on the show. So we are honest. I feel really uneasy. I would lie last week. I cannot be back in my confidence. A lot. Although the feedback was mainly positive. It has got me feeling really uneasy for the show. I am hoping that we will be back. I am posing in a different way from last week to high scenarios of my physique. That is a week point for the bikini class. However, six days to change your posing is a lot. It is not a lot. It is a lot to see again. And not a lot of time to do it in. So if you are feeling a little bit uneasy for presentation. Why is on stage? Which is as bad as it can get for bikini. But I can only try and roll with it. I am just doing my best. And I hope that the 10% where I have got the posing right. What I have been practicing lately is the 10% that shows up on stage. See ya. We will see. Thank you. Not only that though. She has also had a lot of stress to speak in the industry. I am not just trying to say that I have seen. Can you see his stick? Wait, which one is there? I am going to throw it out. Don't. To Dean had a really bad car crash. It is always this. I am very stressed with them. We have been one week come back to meeting him. But they are still fucking here. So we are just on. And yeah. Please, though, it wasn't my fault. Dean is a very good driver. I have been in the car. I have been my convouch for that. And the guy came onto his side of her. I had a head on collision at 80 miles an hour. So it was a really big crash as well. Yeah, the external stress has been there. But she is still pushed for her to be here. And she is a little soldier. So let's see. Let's get him. It was a little stick. Anyway, that's it for now. Bye. We should have booked big swamps. We have booked all the same. We should have booked the tracks. We raise me and I will pass. We need a snap. We need jewelry. We can see a pump on. It is the largest serving can. Delk. This is new this. With a teeny mic rate, it's happy to be here before. Make sure you have it. We are actually in no habit. I'm a CB. People are going to go wrong. You can try to see too. I've got a couple of people. I want to see you. What did you say? No, I'm completely going to break my question. Well, I'm very good at it. So for a few shows now, I've had the feedback of my tan. Not looking quite right with my hair on stage. We've had a few times from different judges to be fair. But we're actually doing something about it because you've got it really. I've tried to wig once before and it didn't work. So we are currently topping up the tan because we've noticed everyone else is a little bit darker. And the protocol this time has been a lot of base coats. So mixing a warm base coat and an ultra dark base coat. Doing layer upon layer upon layer upon layer over the course of like two, three nights before the show. Dean has been my pro tan man and a man with the steady hand or not so steady hand was pouring the two mixes together. And we're just going to do another layer because I'm a little light. But this keeps the tan really warm. Instead of going that sort of dusky gold color I've appeared on stage for the past couple shows, which my hair kind of looks a bit blonde under the light as you lose the red headness. So I just looked merged. So this should help stop that dirty weird color blend. So wish us luck. Oh, right. Just totally never see on it. Terrible. And I thought one that wasn't sealed in there as well. So I don't know why I'm just saying that it's easier. I'm just going to put it in the back. I'm just going to put it in the back. I'm just going to put a little bit of light on the back. I'm going to turn that thing like a mood so she's going to go back. Maybe I should put my bright mood to be better and I think going on that back layer do it. I'm not pushing them back. And I'm just going to bring this to spin around. I think that's actually a good idea. I think that's actually a good idea. It's super good to be with this system and a good mood. I'm very short. And that's actually a good idea. I'm going to put it in the back. Let's do it now. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Place your chocolate aside. Please make sure we're at an expert level. Maybe there is one more... � bebeli Don't be afraid One thirty nine to one thirty five switch things And that is a Europe. I think we're going to be able to do it. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Music And that is a Europe. Let me a bit. I'm not leaving. She's leaving inside again. Been a very busy weekend. I think Europe is a complete job done. PCA done to him. PCA done. So I had the new one guy in PCA. Andrew, fantastic. He got first and got a short. Just missed out on the overall. Which is, you know, as always. He had fantastic real joy of people down to the British for him. And I'm going to pass the mic over to... Yeah, so we was at a short free, joyous feedbacks. And it's so interesting to see that every single chance has a different view. It's hard to say. Because Tyler basically said, not anything we thought. Nothing about a peak, nothing about foreigners. Nothing about communication. It was like upper outlook loop in these more development. Which I suppose would then match her level loop. Didn't say that she needs to downsize her, so it's because she has told last week. And it's these work on a front post. So get that more hourglass shape. She's going to show it around, but she doesn't like to do, because she has a wider way to try to, you know. Trying to do what's best for your physique sometimes. Then shoot soon of foot because then just don't bring in the shape they want to see. If you haven't got that shape then how would you post, so it's a case of this twisting around. And try and see what they next time do it and see if they don't like it. Then JP said that she turned around to the back and said, whoa, glutes. He said, if her didn't wellness natural next year, rather than wellness bikini, because wellness for natural would be more her size, because the natural bikini, I like tiny that were children he said. That was because like view. Then he spoke to Javier and he said she needs more upper outlook loops to go in line with the quad and to put her feet in more so her quad speed can't see from behind. And then he basically said it's the luck of the door too, because I could tell you this. And then you could tell another show and everyone looks different. And it's who you're standing next to and who the judges are and the day the panel changes. And we all know that I'm pretty, that was cool. So anyway, we didn't, did I already say what happens earlier? Yeah, yeah. Yes, we've worked well placing and then I've had a free glints at PCA today, so that also had. Joe on first, he was the first time as first on stage. If he spoke for the invites to the British out with six or seven, come and what he said. And then we had, we had Naomi and Sarah in the same category, bikini trains, so. Naomi was fourth for the invite to the British and we got a second place for Sarah with an invited British. And that is, everyone done for the weekend. And my brain's fried. Over and out. Yeah, the Martin final, bye bye. Bye bye. Next time, we're going to the next time. We're their name. Yeah, probably the British. Yeah, probably the British. Film one nice, next you, too. Next you, who, for now. Bye.

show this way it landed really nice the one's birthday so we're having a week out here obviously I can pizza today so far those guys like Wednesday Wednesday Wednesday Wednesday Wednesday Wednesday Thursday Thursday heading home and also we're doing a phone up for the little holiday so that's called I don't want to lean up to it we are basically around the same as we were at a county baseline weight as pulled off a little water as hold of the county pastries over the four weeks I'm a little bit higher on the scouts but conditionately it's slightly better you you were able to push a little bit you didn't even use your strongness out with the gym following the Spain which is good like the food's done a good job and rebound in a very short period of time now you can utilize that it was maybe pushing a lot of glycogen through the muscles and it worked and I think that will help with the Z also the service with period of obviously being a deficit for so much longer is naturally your fatal you get faster from me I'm one of those Z's that gets better because I just nearly long the diet and phase to get that harder drive look and that is very individual to so I fix one thing I think to a lot of my clients is where is you can you can peak for a show and be 100% full of that show because your body's in a position where it can only go so far once you've done that show and tick that box and then you're able to move on almost that respite post show allows the body for this field the reset feel a bit redue and it's been hard food it's had rest and then your motivation is high to push forward as well as that drives you and then the body's up and you can eat out an extra one or two percent which then delivers potentially a better look stage it can like must be a mine name because like serious after the cancer again so in key place so those people go I wouldn't pull it back and not lie and I said to myself a few times fuck I'm not going back and I'm going to go back but I'm actually you know that comes up to peak when you can get in better and better than what was at the can see so it is just in the process that you say to your clients all the time and I was to to myself as well trust process but here we are and it's where it's and this hard because now you're at a state's could you've been lean to this long I think of that I actually think my condition is normal now I've been dieting this name number and that's as a give you a good idea as well of how long you can diet for the belt moving the muscle yes you're going to cycle as a little bit tissue now time we're not massively in it to put it's going to be detrimental against your results because obviously I've done the best of them this year despite being dieting this name number and then moving on so I'm not buffing too much about that now we are day two being here we flew over on Wednesday eventually we've martin I nearly didn't make it very very luckily made it so my Esther is collected to my passport everybody knows my passport when it's sort of when I'm watching when the one machine didn't work basically through a couple of customs I've stuck in a couple of airports so I changed my passport but little did I know that you have to change your Esther to go with your passport so no to people change your passport if you change your answer no other than what's up to the airport just about the check-in so I thought you can look at me became really really out of here still be the traffic was horrendous and massive car crash so we've got an hour hour out of four check-in so actually it was really really good because we even hour went into a flight for the Esther before the last check-in time yeah and it got to the last check-in time wasn't that I went through about him hey boom babe I'm going with a girl by myself now I get through to the plane and he's on the plane before me I'm like how the did you get before me so I met came five minutes after he'd baked the lady to be able to do three basically and got a score to probably to the bank which was nice surprise for me because to be fair I was worried but what I do the have ran because he's a man and charge of all the like plans and actions and I have no clue I just fall out of the suit eat the food drink the food drink the food drink the drink seriously do the training and let him plan all the city every holiday we go and anyway it's like a normal holiday or that one good car I had driving to the end to the apartment block it was 24 hours of traveling and total yeah I was holding water from the planes I'll see if it's gonna happen and that's already most people all in the world condition you end no car by j s if it's 11 hour flight like that even a whole water so we know it's a little bit water tension my ankles and feet the veins are gone but by the next day I dropped off back on space line a little bit of manipulation yep and then the food started that was yesterday so keep it survived yesterday he missed all the food action then he's gonna get some crochet we have how much it's gonna get 50 grams 700 grams of carbs just today we're on the same as what we did for at a canty we're kind of repeating it because we know it worked really well and a bit today's a wash off day so two carb mills in then I'll put them back a time is it now we have 11 so basically this is time I am now finishing off my last bit of enjoying some water to it is in and put them back I am one of these people at whole of water so some people can cut this out of it for me I will cut like take what I was out I'm a little bit of each mill obviously but still it's what I've had on stage and still we've pissing like back stage I was like in the line going anything and you hold your phone with the quick pick and the whole phone is yeah so right I know for a while that I'm better than trying to make a little bit out of the end try to put a little bit of water off which was a feedback by the way as well so just touching on that feedback from Tyler himself was a little bit more water off the quads no more tissue and basically from the front up to a really nice X-frame the world turn around I can't open my back up enough to portray that X-ray in the B-faper so I need to go out on that back pose get a water off my quarters two go for that qualification just here and those were two go for that qualification maybe I think oh do you know what I got this I can actually maybe possibly hit a top three in an approach I was never beating myself before so that was cool and that's where we are now trying to manipulate that water off my quotes because that for me is a poor matter area and like how hard I'm like what I do I just hold water in my quotes and you can go too far and then everything's like the voices which is the lovely joy of being able to keep you can control things and knowing your body inside out is somehow basically just replicate what we've done but you know we have a bit of harder yeah a bit harder just so we can have to think and pull through through the clouds and hold the full see what happens basically yeah it is now time for my meal free which is actually my last half meal of the day then it's going to be chicken and nut bar for the foreseeable yes and we'll cut you out registration which is yeah is that weird oh not um not bar and baby not bar and baby but it's not no baby but it's fine is it an onion big or is that gonna be weird or we just put the nut bar with the chicken and rice I mean that was something's the best delicious I don't know try it it's try it on so we're gonna find out if peanut butter and everything bagel which is only legal hmm that's your way we can't wait no it's not but maybe cause onion yeah it's okay Harvie Over here. The steering wheel is gonna automatically operate. . Good afternoon, my name is Ron Sprance from the Vice President of Operations here for most of the time. I'm just interdational. Welcome to the 2020-24. You're on a road to our early approach. We'll give you some of my shows sometimes I have to look at. Welcome to this interview. Good. No John O'Ranke. So this show is actually new in the Petrshada Road to Accusions. One of our judges for the really good one at the time. And sadly she had listed in the coverage in a few years back. And so, you know, we've lost her life. And because of that, and her relationship with the show that we made this show after her. So this show is really an honor to her. And I wish so glad you could all are here. And helping us to, you know, not only be a show here for you guys, but it's lost upon her memory. Okay. Amanda Winston. You know, the cake of all the way through that cake. Welcome. Okay. It's not like I'm looking at my first one. Yeah, that was very you, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Come on, Amanda. Do you have to do this? What do you want? Okay. How are you going? You buy either one of these or both. You get this one for three. That's it. Yeah. So that is registration done. 13 girls in Amanda's class. A couple of Olympians. It's going to be an interesting day. She's just looked after this with it. She has a final coffee. She's not going to go with this. So we're going to get her a huge black coffee. Because I didn't go very good. You just see her just dry and out. We're actually through the day. I've got a few of them saved this weekend. So it would be a pretty crazy one. I just picked those up. Guys, you have just registered in a Holland. I'll be over there and I'll be over there. The classic, yeah, two kilos to make with about six hours to go. So I'll pretty much stay there for all the night. About three hours sleep. Making sure that he was on the couch for a very good registration. Which happened, which is fantastic. All the way to show that I'm going to stress out and go back and forth. So that's the Irving's done. He's resting and eating in his room. I've also got a bomb. He's doing a piece of the show in the UK. He's going again after we do it for all the win. We're a little bit heavier this week. Because we've got the opportunity to know about cap on PCA. So it's fantastic for him just to see what he's seeing. Looks like a bit maxed out. And then we have the Vancouver Pro show. We've got to show him figure in that show. She's looking fantastic. So just managing all these together is as well as doing the show. It's as well as doing the normal things they've set up with clients. It's a bit hack-dick but we love it. Making sure the man just okay and chilled. She's at a point now. I actually think she's fast 24-7. She's feeling for the moment. So just like reassurance. I think as well, it was just a keep in there in a good position. On the bomb excited she's done me so proud. She's in the dark in the sense that she's not that much. She's in the dark. She's in the crazy. But now we enjoy. This is a long time. We'll talk about eight nine months. And this will potentially be a lot of the last show. With the season for sure. Maybe her last show ever. We know that could be one more show. It's the right to my answer. See, that's the end. Hi. So, Tan is done. Can you tell? I don't know. She had a more hawk in the. And that was by it. Was a day of her session done, Tan done. We're going to go back to our apartment. Yep. And make it to three. My friend Megan's coming over from Cali. Oh, she's wearing Cali now. Oh, yeah. What's up? South Kansas here. He knows more than me. So she's come to watch show. So I'm going to go back meet her. That her answer is how. And she'll put even an eight peanut butter on the show. Yeah. No for an out. Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you soon. You're sorry. I'm going to kiss and you're trying to kiss. What's up? We're going to kiss. Oh, I see her wearing it. Go. She's dizzy. She'll be alone. I'm just chicken in that boat. So this week. I was looking at pretty much hundreds of me. Around the class today. Across two meals, the rest of will be for a fast chicken. I've had water. I'll be in one group. I just try to make it very, very, very, very, very, very, very special. And then we've back off a little bit, works really well for our 60-folds. and then essentially it's about the size of the food. Look like Jinsa from the tissue she told me. I did mine, I just cut it in every time. I'm going to move in that cellar, I think this is what I'm going to do. And we're here in the final, the Marius of your stage at 11. No, that will probably wake up about, we'll see we have about five or six or five. I'll probably go back to the next. They'll actually know if something is seen as a guide on it, but we'll be careful and make sure we have the right way. We've got, so tomorrow's going to be a long day, because it will be a long day, because it will be a long day when they're on stage. So it's going to be a bit more of a week and a bit of a week. So of course, we think it's more of a year. Yeah, I'm just not very good at it. It's a bit of a year, but it's a bit of a year. So we'll see. I'll see. I'll see. I'll see. Let me show you. Oh, we done? We done? She had a mind. So, it is Shoday. Oh, yeah. The man doing his gas. Just going around the woods and we've just arrived at Casa de Coupes. The hill and whether the show would be in Haud. The man there is the best you've ever done. Not the she feels it, but I feel like she looks there. It's like anybody, maybe in the head. But she's looking really good at it. I'm here. No. I'm always there. What's hard is it? I think it's weird. So, three hours. I was off time at 80. So we just got here and I literally go to the make up. You can watch that, Bob. And go out the time. Then I think moving the hair off the time. Then I take them to curl off the end of the. And we're going to 11. So, 10. 10. We started 9. We're going to 12. Yeah. Come back up. Do the hair. Yeah. So I was going to be at this and then I went to have a death. That was the plan. And then I'm going to get some more scramble. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. So we did last time. Yes. Yes. We're going to have a car. No. I think I'm going to go out. Do some right. Because if you didn't. Never put. I thought we were doing it out in later. I think I'm going to go out. Is there a car? Yeah. It's time to eat. I know. This is love. I kind of stand. Peanut butter. But literally making the guy with. Oh. Now coming out. We haven't got spoon. I'm using a coffee star. Try and get peanut butter. Oh. It's like that. I'm going to get a kiss of mango. Which is a peat in this. Back. I'm going to be doing my eyes after I think. Because it was a bit late for my time. I've been up like 40. I don't know how I'm sort of late. For about 5.15. I've made my attention. Oh. It's okay. I'm going to see that. So yeah. Thank you so much. I'm going to touch you. Check your photos. She's all getting up and touch you. And six weeks up. I was so emotional. I was so emotional. I was so bad. I was like 11. Yeah. You'll see the glutes on the squirrel. It's my first one. Then woke up. Team condition count. And the water from the one. And another three. I'm going to argue with our feedback today. She's happy to wait until later. She knows the plant. Plan has broken. She needs me to be tonight and go again. Yeah. Either yes they're going to. Sorry to bother you. akt. Yeah. You gonna go? Good to be. Push. All my effects? It's done. I think there's someone fit in line. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, what's better?

We've faced a bad approach. What is it called? Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go on it goes to say or run? Close by rolled out this big line. You mean to say? Go on cocktail? Yeah. No No wayи sey dou legs cold no machine sprite We're going to be back for the 24th. We're going to be back for the 24th. We're going to be back. Keep it safe. Keep it safe. We're going to be back, babe. We're going to be back. Yes, Amanda. What's up, babe? Yeah, man! What's up, babe? What's up, babe? One of the 10s rich. Yeah, man! Come on! Go back, reset! What? What? Yeah, man! Go back, reset! I've been told the genre of the 21st century. All the way from the UK. Amanda, Amanda, Wissin. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. I should have, like, to the ground. One, two, three, speak. Huh? I could ground bread. Yeah, me. Yeah, me. Yeah, man. Yeah, man. I could have turned the ground back. I'm breading me to start a full month. What we get in more meat, yeah. I do move this menu, it's covered in cream. Are we going to get in? I always have a half-pumped apple show, like, or ice. So I thought I could get traditional meat again. But I also wasn't fried, she-she-she-she-she-she-she. I wanted to eat it. Fried from cheese. Yeah, pizza. Yeah, pizza. Are you going to get a cheesecake? Yes. Because of the freshness of the wits. Which one? Actually, I don't know. And the last one I last. I think I have my lunch piece. Yeah. You can see yourself now. You can see yourself. What? Do a book. I don't even have a whole weekend. I don't have a weekend. So, where do you get the cheesecake, Badgey? About cheesecake. I just got the one to go. So I went to the carbonara. Of course. Carbonara. How's that? Cheese and fried cheese. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You're going to take your bite. You're going to have one. Fucking. Cheese, thank battery. Done. We are literally fine food. And a lot of food. Amanda's sat outside. We're chilled. And so, a little bit at this point in the night. I can't wait to come up with a back end of the two very good results. It's a ronso. And I can't see. I'm coming here. We've cleared extra things to do. Well, Miss Louise will receive you going. Come up with back end of two shows. And then you go to another one. You almost sat expectations to a certain degree. Which sometimes you shouldn't really do. A new judging panel. Awesome. There's our feedback. Amanda's in the first call out. And then just shifted around and just outside of the top call out. So maybe like a six-cent of eight. Again, just very dear friendly to what she used the left one stage. Literally posing for about ten to fifteen minutes in one go. It was very great. So I thought, is what it is. It was also result. And again, you know, you can bring your best package with she bought the lake. And then get the last result of the season. So it was probably good. Basically I was eating too much. But this feel like a dance. I thought fine. And the moment it was good and let's make a ban. I can't move. So that's a good moment to do it all night down. But this is the end of the YouTube. Yeah. The dance did last show. The season done not finishing on the high. Unfortunately, not finishing on the better place in this season. But this year I said I wanted to get top five in one watch out. So I'm actually at that in two shows. Okay. So the first show is not so good. Got some feedback. It's just completely different to what I've had before. But always gives a new experience. And that's what I've got to think. It's a body boy in the evening. I don't know what's going to happen. It's a little bit different. Yeah, it's a hair to hair to hair. It's a stage of weeks. It's what it is. It's something else. What ends up? I need to get a light out from a belly mini house. Thank you for the pass out. I need to get my phone on. Two guys on the column. One's just broken up. So seven to four here. No. I think I will be up all night. So I will be the pass out on cheese cream. I got two guys in all of them. One in UK and some more in Vancouver. Just gonna be up busy 24 hours. I think so. But we'll catch you some time soon.

2 days 3 days Meep! Okay, okay. I'm leaving. Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! We are at the supermarket and first things first. I have all fritters to support and so that is all see mainly from mine. Getting on the food in many for this few days and a little bit of the carbub in there. Some nice treats for the carbub. I found Camel chopped it where it's kates. What else was that? Honey. I think we've actually got much. Right. Oats. Sticky rice, oats. Nothing so different. No, it's time. Peanut butter. I've found stuff. We really found some raisins. Raisins. Raisins are my favorite. What in the speed you are? I'm trying to find raisins but it's shattered by delicious species. Here we go. Oh my God. What's that? Cinnamon is black. Oh my God. Sweet and smoky mix. Oh my God. These are delicious. I love those, bro. Right guys, it's Friday. The more filming yesterday, it was pretty much where people were bone-said as landed or sea-cate from low food, standard pump sash. Children pose so today is a bit more exciting to film me. The carbub. Well, I've got 60.1 kilos which is based on the base land and hold that for a while now. We are going to have a look at me here first in this lighting and the gym because the brim is really shitlighting. So I would have looked at me a little pose and practice. Go back and sat in. So to start with anyway before we start eating, we get some good fluids in. I'm going to get about six or seven liters in a day. What I've been doing is all of average in the last couple of days. But some electrolytes. I love this because I hate water. So black down flavor. It was helps get it down. From six o'clock need of course. Meal one is 85 grams of oats, 30 grams of raisins and 30 grams of nutlap. I tried to make my way into a pace. It was nice to see it. But it's worked. So having that one is meal one. The idea is basically to have a higher carb later than the eight, which is two days out. And then back off of what you were away. Just because there were two heavy carbs before the shirt. And expanded my waistline a little bit and holding a bit of water. So I worked better doing that. It had a load now. Back enough of day before. And we'll see how that goes. And I'll be able to sort of trial for next week. So we are mill two. Martin, my lovely husband who's also behind the camera. My cameraman is also a moisture. And we've got 200 grams of cooked weight rise. It was 75 rolls in it. And I'm watching him. It's 75. You set your five grams of chicken and a putter kilogram of pink salt in here. And he just done that well. Been doing work. And I'm watching chains all season. It's last time I was talking to the camera. There's the fact that we're sitting down doing chickens on the Friday. A lot more competitors. I do on the Friday so it's getting fruit of that. And Martin's cooking what I eat. What's going with that meal? Oh, what got it so we're going to go to the train after this. So we're getting two meals in and then going to go train. Obviously not a heavy session just a push from carbohydrates to a run based on the in. Basically do a little bit of a push. Is it pushed today? And it's probably a nice little push session. It always went fucking doubt as well as does. You've been through the bathroom. And my person has been a bit of a good moods. And we are going to team the four seasons. So I put it there and then we're going to say that. Little walk there to help digestion and get to know clearly that it's pretty work out. Some people have muffins. We have proofers. I don't like muffins. Not about life. I know that point but the crew doesn't sit as well. Yeah. We do what works. So in joy babe. What are you doing bro? How many of them look? So we're going to go work out. And this is the pre-work out muffins. But it's 11 muffins. I think it's going to be a back. Or a good eat. What is your decision decisions? That a little scared. So you're going to do whatever you want. Yeah. That's good. But I'm going to give you a second. But what do you do? But what do you do? Okay. What is your decision? Decisions. That looks good. The same as that. What is normal grace? Old fashioned day and that's all the best. Only a bit of my own best. I'll see you at Canada for a minute. See you in the back. Excuse me as well. Coming to a way from England. I think everyone is going to be a hot, so I just packed nothing. And that will help my friends. See you whereas my clothes. All right, make a decision. What do you think? Old fashioned and old crueler. Honey crueler. Honey crueler. I do love no fashion then. I'll say, how do you feel then? Honey crueler. Done. What? Oh my God, so moist. A mouse and a mouth. So good. Pretty well done. I'm hoping the veins come out when I train. Happy. Happy wifey. Almost full of a guilty. Like do I want it yet? Do I want a room thing? Nothing. No, I want it yet. No, that's not good to use. Such a heavy. Ah. OK, so we are here at a pure muscle for the final session and a little push session. We're actually going to film some bits of the day we train in, so let's go. OK, so that is the last train session done. Four times been back again Monday to repeat some calls. Ready for it, I can't in it's week. We are literally going to go back to the apartment. Get some freeze and then literally head off straight to registration. I secured a little pump. Finally. Have? Don't up pump. That was good. That was a good job. Yeah, that's a nice, great. Need some more. And we've got some good photos to. We found some sick lighting in the gym, so that's cool. So, an engine drink, an engine drink. There's on the floor. Whoa, shaker. Another bowl. Pre-bolls. Peel tablets. T-shirts, bikini, stuff to help keep bikinis on. There's one of those little cookies. Not Ky or the KYK, YK, YK. There's literally like pre-protein bars, protein, crisp, protein, cereal, protein bites, and any bites. So, we need to get as a wake and we blow out the heat at all. And for now, we're at the end. Meal fight. I had another meal before this, actually, which was actually rice cakes because of 13, we're easy to trans it. You're only 200 grams of rice with 35 grams of chicken. We're going to get that in. Just when it's registration and then after this, we're going to make a way back and do delicious. Delicious. What fries were these again? Season fries. I don't know how many he got before. I'm guessing most of these for you. I'm about to put away that many fries. Double. And I'm guessing that one is the cow other. I sure is. All right, ratings are 10. Hmm. It's a good burger. How about 10? Hmm. Second bite. Second bite. Situinkles? Okay so it is a day before the show we've come down to our new position room because there's a lot in here so much better. It was good to do like a little comparison as well from yesterday's checking me being completely flat as pancake 2 after having 600 grams of carb just a which did include a broken chin and a cookie half cookie it's gonna boot heavy do you all the reason? We actually are a little bit drier, a little bit tired so I'm a little bit full of little legs just gives like always a worry about my legs for love so if it's a quite balanced today it's gonna pull back and do better than the fat but Martin thinks she put in a bit of carbs and still just a helpfulness to work out a little bit of fat than what he intended and we were of judge each meal by me as well as today and that's it and small posing today not much we were resting what time today at 2 to 20 so we're making a way over to venue there for the tan then back in till for the evening I've also got Alex on today back home at PC Natures she has made improvements since the last show she dropped 1.5 kilos trying to put a little bit more and she's looking on the money today so excited to see how she gets on so we are doing some more filming in Alphabes and this is morning I have had two meals since then I had my oatmeal and then I had a steak and nut butter to praise and fats we are now getting meal free in before we go to tan tan's at 2 to 20 and it is now quarter one I'm currently talking to Alex at the same time Alex Lord's our coach he's back in the UK looking over my client Alex at a PC A for me she's just gone third at PC A first one not for some of Natures and his client has also moved to the second note second call out for the set of stage that he's over the moon too the communication and what are still going and I am now by the career rise this is good but after he cake cream or rice it's actually really really really nice and the career rise is really nice and I'm only getting into that any of us want to go right now time at 220 I've got a lot of them I have washed my hair but right myself with that and I've got some bread brin too as well from some of the needs to help the carbohydrates going down part is patient with a couple of hard days and I'm dropping on the floor standard me and I'm going to go now so I can eat this because I'm really hungry hey cool so there's now 228 you've come down to the pros and cons we claimed non-convenient so it was literally our room to look at me after the last meal today so that is it loading and done we did a big day essay back up to the only 200 grams of carbohydrates I'm full this is even so I know I'm full and that's the case now I'll dry it out over the night basically okay now we're going to bed a bit I'm going to go into bed at half a seat and get another free 30 because we got dry by over for my turn at 5 30 but at 45 minute drive so I'm going to get nice and early for the first time the time is told us to wash this layer off so I'm going to have a wash in the morning and rinse it off actually we've really nice and so it is not stink get first layer done that's 5 30 it's literally straight to her at 6 10 straight into makeup at 10 to 7 and then I think a bit of stage about it getting a long which obviously in UK times can fly by the head of what I'm saying so that's that if we don't have one of these warm film and quickly cool we go as well so we're trying captures and much to come so it does so it's been morning it's 10 past four in the morning we are up very very early for hands at 5 30 quick come down to look at me we're very forgetful what we've got the camera I forgot what I'm making also nothing will be that great of checking but it's been a pretty other light and light so if we want to look at basically to plan meal one and then we're going to head up for time at 5 30 straight into her at 10 past 6 and straight into makeup at 10 to 7 so you're putting up a scene much of that because he can't be with me but we will show you the calm up it looks a lot better than it's what I come out the oven I Love you Did I wait you see i didn't mean every day what I know is but I think it'll come a lot a little bit of their pump. Yeah, they're feeling fluid. Yeah, they're feeling fluid. Yeah. I don't want to be too fasting. I want to give mid-section small. We don't need to literally ride that because it's a bit more mushy, because it's trying to lick it up. I look a little quite with it. I don't think they're... I don't see them in the judgment panel. It's a different one. It's a bit fluid. Okay, so we're back up. So now we're going to put the half-mill one. We have made how much grams of carbs again. How much grams of carbs again on the middle one. Which is from a clearer item course of these. Roughly cakes that have been best, literally. It's like, is a jelly cake. How much of a by-beaven? About number. Photocombs in that bar. And then, the phyhane, very amazing. It's delicious meal. Some of the lecture lights, some pink socks, all they got in, and also some heat max. Obviously they're helped to keep the water going off. And then, using some a little bit of geotage fillet. So, it's going to be too dry. But it's going to be too hard either. It's trying to find out about it as again. And that's it. Not that I believe you're checking the blade to go for the day. It's going to be a long day to do pre-judging fast. Then we will stay for the finals of our free-art walk. And then obviously I'm probably all about maybe a 4-pin of the head on the day to go and half of the day is. And so, imagine that in between is that. So, it's not like, cakes from food. So, you can rice cakes, the basics, the way it's cakes, not bad. That'll drop it. And that's it. I'm going to eat. Let's go. It's like, there's always a big delicious. It's not delicious. Just moving. Just moving. I'm going to the eighth quarter 31. Yes, Amanda. You're supposed to drink a lot. Hold on a minute. Off you go. Put your turn to the right. Yes Samantha. Put your turn to the right. Get face wrong. Get cover. Get cover. Thank you. And the two men are late. Number 26. Thirty points. Number 30. Yes, bye. Come on, Amanda. Come on. Let's go, babe. Yeah, Ashley. Thirty points. Thirty points. Thirty-six. Emily. Oh! Twenty-six. Seat, baby. 때�..? Reset baby.. Sev! Four-hoto. Four-hoto. Boardiers, who are moving, are second-class, these are ready! Come, just sit on the back of our sleeves. All yeah, that was real quick. We got some more� Commons today. Alright, we will continue Seth. You have to turn up So that's a wrap. The morning show is done. Pre-degent dumb. So no I'm gonna smash a dumb note, so I can't really. I will be quite calm because I thought I'd get back out because it looks like I was definitely made talk 10 and talk 10 and talk about the back one and a little routine. The masses was pretty good. I think I've ever first or second judged him by the position of the Nazi and then when I came out to do the open we was in the whole other game and me and the goal and the masses. Be real. Me and the goal and the masses were both there for the novice one place that's like I don't know. I love the fifth or six of them. I'm happy. So happy because I think some of my own is like five or in here and there's twenty more girls and I just honestly thought it would be in a total again we'd be good and been up in mix but yeah being that first what I was main with it. So we had done for the day. I have a long day. We got the goal so one, the masses it would for you if I and my goal this year was the place in the top five and I came to fit in the open class. Super super happy on super close that's the one thing I wanted to know basically get back on a diet and ready but at a canteen they can be. I just want to say like volunteer so far today and so happy that once been here I've let him be put ice for this fun time to peek me and it shows it works so there's like he's now my peak master and that's it so that's it.

So welcome to YouTube number two, peak week number two. We have arrived at the Nala Kanteen. This is the part of the week. Yes, there was a long old trip from Canada to UK UK to Nala Kanteen, so do any film and done. The case of go to Mara Kodana, get a food in for the week, train, sleep, and then wake up today. So we are back to go to Titan's gym to do a poor session. I am currently on a very low carbohydrate support water attention off of the peak and that's a case that we are here at Titan. What is on the intro side, there is none of me. Nala Kanteen, rain and a huge egg every time. Anyway, I have a bucket group of poor sessions. We are going to film a little bit of that, some clothes in, obviously a season of that too, and then we bring that massage feathers down around the head. There is onlyishing items that work through three sizes. So we have just finished back and buys. This is the only time my buy sets get a little treat as a peak week. We are now walking to this up in the store to get some cream rice. Let's go out and collect some of the treats. Unfortunately we had to ditch our cream and buy set the app up. So we are very upset by it too because I really like the pros to keep one. Also I need to find a massage from some of my friends to win my back, blame a martin, he was laughing and I looked over and turned it back. We are going back to some card, we are going to second once we have been to this up in the store because I also need to get a little bit of water way off from the flight. It's not that sauce. They actually sound good. We have got mustard flavour, pizza, pizza and everything flavour. Can we get these faster? One? One. Everything flavour. Do any syrup catchups? Sources. And all the treats. Films. Chocolate sauce, caramel sauce. Oh that one looks nice. They will save the let's say. You are good. Is it your yogurt? So which flavour are we going to get? It looks like there is only one. Chocolate monkey. I am pretty sure they had more mangoes on. They have just got chocolate. That is outflakes. That one is cookies. That one is white chocolate. So we got white chocolate, we got cookies. And we got chocolate monkey. Cookie or a can? I am pretty sure they had more than a corner. Is this cream or what? Yes, it is like roast flour. That is the same thing. This is ground onto more of the flour. Banana cake. And we have biscuit. Strawberry. Banana cake sounds good. Another good egg flavour as well. On my goat apple. Brownie. Brownie, what is the flavour? What one will be in the egg? Cheese cake. Cheese cake. That is oat flour. I am going to answer it. This is something to go. I am going to add some milk. Thank you, bro. So it is Friday. We are two days out from Alacanty Show. Lacy. And Katelyn here is behind the camera. I have now turned up to come watch me. Yesterday was pretty. It was pretty. It was pretty. It was pretty. It was pretty. It was pretty. Root and wine shoes are wearing glasses. Making me some. It was similar but I am still very kiddo. A cake would say. How is that going? Iいた out the poorfows. The cake ends up starting Butter at the dark snow but Analyze. We have done it a week and watched it. We going down the ice and the snow and then there will be more. I am not quite down to my baseline way. We thought this was pulled right down my arm. Someone's been flipping my face either. And I think I'm in a pretty good position moving forward. Yeah. It's just about just getting the right margin today, just making sure that the fullness is there because the feedback last week was literally just a bit of a tire free the glutes at hand, but realistically we can't magic that we've sacrificed in there. No, to be fair anyway, my groups and the hands do look tired this week, even though my baseline is up, so I don't raise my weight and go by weight. I put it still holding a bit of water from the fly, so I can feel like a tiny little film on my abs, but to be fair my abs are like really, really tight anyway, so it's not going to issue holding the film there. I've been more issue holding it here for me. Yeah, I've been a deep tissue myself because my backs bad, I've had an injured that blame not mine completely. I was doing a seated row and there's some stupid laugh of some guy and I thought it's been laughing at me, so I looked at him as I was revitted and bletching jolting my back and I got, oh that's bad, I had to stop training, but I managed to push anything in my back and it's fine, it's literally just sending a skin or a spray, luckily I can pose. So that isn't fishy, so that's good. If I can pose I can still fucking walk the walk. And that's what I would do is just a more film and let it all the film me get eat. Yeah, what would be today I just pose as well, I'm just going to have to push the water through. I sit. Right, so the food is going in, we're pretty much reputating the first meal of the last carber, but the nap to that one's on an online thing, how I look by the day today, Rubbing is not doing exactly the same thing because the body can respond completely differently each time. So it's two slash layers of the outer skin and then. And the ones from Canada, the amazing syrup and bronze sugar and the best. So put them in the real of course. Exactly the same. We've got a very good amount of eggs going in, probably down the raisins going in, 20 grams away, and we have got a fresh, pre-recut, muffin again before we go and do a pump session later at tight ends. And that is meal one, we're going to be putting some salt in here as well, a bit of minced sea and expel, which is a natural dressing for this meal. And then that's it, really just some rounds of pose in each time to push in the food rounds and obviously have a get. So I don't like cooking why it's on a bit of the ears, and a lot of people are like volume and cooking them up. I find when I cook them, actually makes most of them at the way. So just put them in the water and let them sit for like 5-10 minutes. And then the side of my raisins and honey, much much prefer it. Even though it's not high volume, I just find it's a little bit dense and sits better in my stomach. So again, it's another soups thing to do with your use and board order to be safe as well. And the different kinds of ingredients, you cannot try to pat water, you know, it's filtered that one. I've had a bit of a dodgy belly can drink in it, so a lot of risk in here. I don't even know how much calories in this, mate. What's this meal? I've been having my hair done. So we're replicating what we've done in, where are we? Twins are big. Twins are big. But we use Jasmine Rice and we had a amount of car from the Jasmine Rice and we had a Kruella. It's really different than this time. It's America Donna Muffins. We're emulating the fats and carbs, but we have a mixture of basmati rice, and more iscapes which do the... Supplement needs, verbin, how will the carbohydrates? It's chocolate muffins, so. I'm a little bit behind them, though, like half one is the milk tea behind the water, so I'm like a ghostly little bit like a big fatty in a gym, man. I'm posing for that, hey, here. Feel what's my heart? I'm just going to be a ghost. I've got my new function. So that is Afreece, Meeting, Done, Oversteer, and ready to roll for some day. Super, super busy show, literally the whole base. It's full of it. It's 180 Afreece, then. It's crazy, so. I'm not sure if I can get some food in. Get a taxi, get back, and then it's burger time. What game? U22 4 hours out from the Alok house at in Pro show? Friesie and Spain, but it doesn't sound like that. I can't enjoy it, it's not going inside, or nobody besides. I've just been the same Monica for a flush-free massage which is great. I've never had that before some compression boots. Just finishing off the rest of my wardrobe for today and getting my last carb meal in a second and then that'll be me for the rest of the day. Tilt legs up, proteins and fats until the show tomorrow. It's Sunday again. So day number two, my intimate breakfast. It is now currently called the pass at five in the morning. We didn't have about this early morning at 7.15 at the venue. So my arms just have a look at me. Give me 110 grams of carbohydrates going in now. If you pick up the hours before my tannies rose, I have another little look to see where we are at. Because I think the show starts at 9. Two categories before me, then me so probably beyond 10. Just have my very good and a little bit water. A little bit of water. And that's it. I started doing my makeup so if I look weird it's got just more problems. That's it. This week I'm doing my makeup. So I will be showing you that in a second and then I'll be making a touch up because the door is sleeping so early to curl my hair. And that is it. I will be doing some filming at the venue. Oh, it's melted. It's a good one. Then I'm going to play with my wife, my upper hand, my aeratians and my mouth about my muscles.

=== FILE: IFBB PRO ANTOINE LOTH ｜ OPEN PRO DEBUT @EMPRO PRO [ki0h1YL7O4c].txt ===

Yes guys, welcome back to the YouTube, it's been a while, we're here in sunny I think it's an Alicante with Antoine and he is making his open pro debut Antoine as an amateur can be as a bodybuilder, he transitioned into the pro league as a classic physique he's been to the Olympia. The struggle to make the week was getting a lot harder each time around and we had a discussion and we first got together and the plan was to go straight to open capitalise on what we could in regards to the growth time period that we had and then almost utilised the prep effectively to hold on to everything that we built to not sacrifice anything just to make a wake-up which is worked out well because we're currently sitting just around we're hover around about 10 kilos of buffers but it's classic capital which is going to be a good luck. It's been a good prep, it's gone very smooth, it's a lot different to preview. It's a good approach, it's been designed for the fact from a muscle retention and hold on to the electrician that we built. Going into this show it wasn't planned we did have poor school mapped out in a few weeks time but we had a conversation when I was in Spain a couple of weeks ago that maybe we can jump in you know it's it's I think you done this as well previously as well when you've ever been to the A for a Portugal show and ended up doing the M for a show and it's pretty much replicated at this time around you know so with confident the position when we had that conversation was good and it's like good let's make a couple of changes if we see the response that we want to see at that point over the next two three four days and I said to you by the weekend we'll make a decision and that was last weekend and yeah everything was there and then we've set a game plan registered and here we are so really happy and the bodies just wanted really well this week we actually hit a little yesterday after a day of travel at 5,000 on a train woke up like peel but the bleed it right where we want to be you know at that point and yesterday was a bit of a buffer day so we've been here from yesterday and because of the how far and from was depleted there was no point just holding there or just try to chase even more conditions there when you're going into a load of snow around and we'll need decent amount of food just to bring some fullness back to his Zig we've sort of done a bit of a buffer in day we've put in about 650 that we put in yesterday, 650, 650 grams of carbs just to pretty much hold we put in a small amount of fullness back in he's actually drier today than he was yesterday and it almost gives up that stomach a little bit of a warm-up a wake-up cool that you're actually going to be loaded with a shit ton of food since 650 yes it was the buffer day minimal weight gain 0.5 kilo with a drier look put 2.2 point points he's I put 2 of a kilo up and we've meant like minimal fullness but a drier with drier look at the day we got 1200 going in and that may adjust as we go through the day and we get 2 mu's in and train post-waka will have a look if I feel that that's not really touch the sides already it probably it won't I know they won't at that point anyway I feel like the digestion's going well and there's room to potentially push a little bit more today for the day that we can sort of do that because we've still got them Friday Saturday before we land into Sunday that's a big intro yeah excited we will go and train you've had meal 1 we'll have meal 2 and a bit we'll hit the gym a bit of a pool session with these and pose enough for that we'll catch it out yes guys we're here at the famous tightroof fitness gonna put on one through a bit of a pool session nothing crazy here like 88% move some blood around he's started loading we've worked well just over 400 grams of card in two meals so just move that moment moderately the aim of the gain here is not to go crazy super the plet everything we're in a position where we want the body to start filling and be in responsive from the from the moment we've seen the the morning to just have a quick look prior to coming here we can already see a response so it's going to be good move some blood around get a bit of a pump and have a look in the mirror so here we get and again one more keep it in nice and simple busy here today busy we just need to move some blood nothing crazy couple of pool dance couple of rows simple I do one weird out couple of buys just take a set of move the blood and basically just keep in primed ready for the carbs that are going in and tomorrow we'll do the final session which will be a little over up the session the jeel will touch up on all muscle groups just keeping the carbs moving around moving the blood Saturday it's horizontal day yeah no flush feeling fat of flush free from monica hot early in the morning rest of Saturday Saturday's planals a little bit of a back off day so we're going to be ballooning hard today tomorrow Friday he's off a little bit clear joy a few ice-based making sure that he wakes up super feel super full super flat I'm expecting a super flat for the stomach and Okay, I'll go. That's it. Nice. Yep. Yeah, bro. Yep. Yeah, bro. Bad weather. Caught your hair. Well, come on, ape. When I look at you, they're famous. Oh, you never know that. But yeah. up Nice. Back, right. Nice.

Tired. Go ahead and put your go. It's competing tomorrow. It's been a highly early thought today. It's making sure he's paying and the guys are doing the bridge to follow him weekend as well. So, see you for a minute, for a moment. It's cool. Living off the window. Monster, caffeine, drop a bit. Let's get that made for the shit. As soon as the Lewis is done on Sunday we fly back to Vegas from Reno here on the Monday. Tuesday we fly back to UK and I have straight command just to set up camp for the guys are doing two brochures and then head straight to South Africa for the BCA. So it's going to be a long time away from home. Listen, everybody sucks. That's all for good course. Really good. It's time to eat some good down time at the end of season as well. But it's getting tired in the end. It's a good deal. Lewis is now a mute. The saving is a voice to save his throat. So there's no point in the mic anytime. He is actually silent. He's still being a little bit, but he's hundreds, hundreds of times better than Murray where a couple of days go. It's a scar. It's actually pulling out the choke, eventually. When he couldn't even hit one hose without it's been gasping for about 30 minutes. It's a bit worrying, but thankfully, he'll always be catching a humidifier. Throats, spray, and septic spray, every single chest infection medication. In fact, he's going down anything but I'm too far. He's going down anything better. Get in there. And it's working. Okay, now. I want my feet and video lessons. I'm a fan of radio, but I'm a fan of radio, but I'm a fan of radio. I'm a fan of radio, but I'm a fan of radio. I can't believe that things are not seen. It's broken maybe every time I see him on the same as the same. But they can't deceive me. They can't deceive me. I'm quite the same. I'm quite the same as my other things. They can't deceive me. They cannot be. I try to tell them when they couldn't see me. They couldn't hate me. Yeah Yeah, she was a boy, so yeah It is Saturday. It is day before the show. We have just taken a first look at Lewis. Fastest first in the morning in a very very very good position. Okay. He's my father heavy Yes, he's ever been this boy and I'm both far probably the most condition he's been at this point. I think that it's in good very very good Just set up the day today with done three days as pretty much 1500 gram of carbs And we can come in the water day. We can back that off a little bit today. We can probably be a little less aggressive Because bonus is there pretty much it's just about holding it and just probably a little bit at the end of the day Which we'll do with backward fries, start a protocol It's just manipulation of water they will pull back a little bit on that and just for the spectators The boy in the food that goes in the boy with fluid that I think goes in I'll be just making sure the mid-section see the title of the week of tomorrow morning There's still a bit plenty in that and keep it in full. I don't even have a bit of cover I don't even have to play by the little bit and then going to tomorrow very fulfilling It will be a lot of more than two news in the morning that I'll be here. Good good day We are just chilling. Let's go to the next 30 of the leaves So we're going to go to the expo just before I'll have a look around Cut it with a few people, get back, chill, pose and eat burgers so we can't delay that This is all we find in our team Tanning Dunn, Lewis is starting to turn around and I'll like shade of my honking We are going to head back to the apartment, just chill, pose in between meals We've lowered Lewis's last few meals just before he goes in for burgers tonight He's going to be hungry for them Going to head over to the basketball court, full places It's a very close to the room for his routine He's just trying to cover times and he'll stick and he'll go in there I think it's just a matter of just 24 hours from now He should be over, so we shall see what tomorrow brings When give me the�il procedur Young good god works. His burgers is 20 pounds midnighthhhh, look at this his pink So, at this, at the sack, wake up full, absolutely pure. Right for the day, day will probably be just to have one bigish meal first thing and then to cruise into the show. It needs to be on roughly thinking around 12. One of lots of pretty much about 12 hours from now, so, good time to get this in now and pretty much lay off doing it and we'd nice them that empty. As we say, we'd say, we'd say, we'd say, nice and that, so you give, you see it. I only see the markets actually today, so, see it a bit.

Yes guys we are back is the last day here at the Dragons Lab before we head up to Reno the South of New. We've got a couple of hours to get session in and then we take off to the airport. Lewis is feeling a lot better than God. It was getting a little bit cut throughout whether he's going to make it or not. You've been really under the weather. Just trying to find that sort of like spark that is anything that was back up. These days we've got a push session lined up, moved some blood around nothing crazy. We're going to hit some good pose in, rounds, really see where we are because we started the load now. So 1500 grabs the car, just going in, putting them good use. So let's go get session in. We're going to get session in. We're going to get session in. We're going to get session in. We're going to get session in. We're going to get session in. That's a good sign. What we're doing at the moment, just literally 60-70% of Lewis is low. It's moving some blood around a couple of doubts. I'm going to try that and we're going to try and let them just try and keep the fullness in there. When we go and pose, it's a good sign of how full Lewis is. When we can see that, hum, it's a good market to see how much. Well, how well the food is going. How well it's holding on its unique. The impression. Let me out to drive what I came back. What you got to know we don't play that. What you got to know we don't play that. I've been laying low, I had to stay back. Can't check me now, you can't check me. You know I've been that boy was born lefty. Crunch times about how you move on your tire. But the careful pun if you're on a fire, because you don't want it's got to go. Let by Honda decisions you chose. Peaks feel good, but those values get low. Chains for the tires and the rain, hell snow. It's like that everywhere that you go, everywhere that you. A lot of motherfuckers go down, don't come up. Voicing your head, don't shut up. Loing up between the D, you try to call back, but she hung up. Anything that try to get the one up, run out. Solling to pen it, the fence back in it. Real love, the same for the fame, a bad way to shit. I'm trying to move around to get depressed in that home. Life been hidden like some rest is the loan. It's been a rock you week. Brainwork, I use my heart in a while. Gotta get the fence bouncing off the audio files. I got away and know my sentence, like they caught in a trout. Why you ain't no kid caught in denial? Yeah, I remember y'all. Let me out to drive what I came back. Boy, you gotta know it on play that. Boy, you gotta know it on play that. I've been laying low at the same bed. I was at work, they did not die. No magic button on life, ain't no tie-dives. Go, gotta out. The flow so, flow, try to. Three pack of serving them all, all all out. Live behind decisions I chose. Peaks feel good in the values get low. Chains for the tires and the rain, hills, snow. It's like the everywhere that I go, everywhere that I go. Hey. Just let me out. Hey. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Come on. Say, when? Yep. Fuck it out. Oh. That hurt. That's good, ain't no. Nice and light. Squeeze. Peace. That's it. Is there a wrap? We're done. And Vegas. Gonna take a look at Lewis now. Get some food in and eat for it to the airport. You know, he's going to be here. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm sick. That was the first time you've been able to do that, oh yeah. Positive steps today. Just finished training at the had a good pump session. Six exercises, Lewis isn't too gas, which is good. Managed to then come in here and do a full round of poses without stopping. Which is literally the first time you've been able to do this on the US soil this time around. So, luckily, it's Wednesday today. We've got those before I leave Saturday into Sunday just to clear this and make sure everything is absolutely golden. Any good levels of rap, you see a much better in himself. Literally the last couple of days has been real tough. Just sort of trying to just get that mindset because as anyone knows, who's a competitor there, the desire to get on stage is there, but as soon as you are in where or if you're not feeding it, you know what I mean that's sort of then I guess motivation to get on stage drops and you feel shit. And trying to pick that back up is a hard task, but luckily today Lewis is working up in a very good position. It's for the equalised and the mentality going into the next few days he's feeling so much better about himself. So, very positive steps today. Big bonus. Hookup ups in the shaker. One up and see. The last one was ruined. I watched my last one last night and it's like, so, that's it. I'm sure that we said we could have done something. We got to accept it, but I could be stuck in America. It doesn't work here, but I'm getting a car and I know if it drives seven hours to arena. We'll see. All done at 4.55. What's the time now? 3.45. My passport. A little bit fun. It's what happens when you wash your passport. I'll see if it works. There's like a game room. The question. That's a hotel. Got a decent elevator. I can grab me up. You're a person, can't I? I was in a trunk in the balcony. I might get some luts. I'm not sure if you can get some luts. Yeah. We're in. We've got some for lunch. Nice. It's a little bit fun. So we've just woke up. The position that Lewis is in now is probably lack a little bit of fullness. We'll do not push that much food, but the condition that we're seeing at the moment is relative to where he's been at. Texas Tampa. Surely morning. This is crazy. It's very, very promising. Going into the next few days. He's just about to weigh himself. He won't look at it. I'll make sure. I see it just for some correlation to where we are. The starting point from this low, these pretty much two and a half kilos up from where we were at Texas. So that period where we have post show where we went quite aggressive. Suddenly, we were just paid off. So this new tissue there. It's going to bring some crazy new conditions. Well, the state's something that they're there to see in that this morning. I'm blown away. So positive. Positive. Please. So we're going to go and find the gym. There's a couple of gyms that are linked with the lead of festival. So we have a few meals in Lewis fast. Head to the gym. Never like just up a pump session. 67% of the news on the blood around is breathing now. It's so much better as well. Like we're on the sort of plus on the positive side of him returning back to full health. Which is not really bonus. In the medication these days, he managed to pose this morning without having to stop without having to. But catch his breath, which is a real real sort of landmark for us at this point. Go in in because like I said a few days ago, it was a little promising. So it's a good time. It's a good time. It's a very happy. What are you yesterday? Yeah. And finally mine. Yeah. You actually dropped a kilo to nine. Yeah. You went in perfect time to start. You were wondering why you went in nine days. Do you want to know what I'm doing? I don't know who I want to know what I am. One point six up. One point six up. Yeah. From your signal. Yeah. You were in a certain night. You were in a certain night. You were in a certain night. This is a very very good position to be. Even better. Even better position to be. No another food that we put in yesterday is stuck. Normally at this point we're just trying to hold the fullness. The weight is such as well because food just processed for 1500 grams of carbs. And yes, we've gone heavy on that in the past. 1600 on the first day. And we've seen a drop. But the condition today is the same that I expected to see. But I'm going to at least do the same or maybe a little lower but the food is held in this condition is pulled in. It's a broken bread. So it is the first session in Reno. We've located a gym. It's not far from here. So we're going to head there and let me know. It's just eaten again. Okay. With three meals deep. Everything's looking very good. I've just finished all the required food. But the helalics on stage last night was up to the very, very early hours. And the morning comes fantastic in China. It said PCA, a philic affiliated show in China. One of the biggest shows that you'll see at age up. Crazy Christmany. In his class, I think it was 18 dB placed second and then got moved into the overall. Where he then got stiff. I'll have 20 guys in a little bit of way they do it with loads of very strange. But I've got some good prize money. I've looked at absolutely incredible super super chef. He's doing the British PCA from the next week. So keeping my eye up for that, I've got a guy in Portugal competing this weekend. He's doing a regional. He's looking fantastic. So I'm just being there now. He's just updated me before he goes to bed before his final day before his load. We'll get back. I'll start on client plans. And then just watch Lewis expand, I guess. Monitor it. And then tomorrow is day three of the load. So we've done it a little bit differently this time. Because of the way that Lewis is feeling and the response that I know that we can get in the moment. Push in some food a day early. I think there's been much more beneficial to us. It puts us in a solid position going into the show where we're not chasing. I guess the manipulation of water, which can be quite harsh on the physique. And also the way that Lewis is feeling, just chucking a load of facts and carbohydrates in his body. Elevating that sort of energy level is certainly put him in a fantastic position now. So we'll see how things go. So we're here in Reno. We're in, I'm sorry, again, I haven't been able to do this. American iron. We're here in Reno. First session in American iron gym. Massage place. Massage place. Proper mix of pretty much just all the tools that we're going to start track. Some flex. I'm a strength. A little bit of prime. Perfect for what we want. Just moving through the food that we put in. Nurses. 3 days out now. So you just want to get a very careful couple of exercises pro muscle grip. Triple and back. Church, stelts. And one by one try. Nothing crazy. Getting in, get out. It's a nice little pose in room. So we're going to do some rounds in there. Nurses are going to practice with routine. It's been choreographed. But something more special. So excited to see all that come together. Let's come out. We're going to get the shit done. Let's all catch the leader. Rebels so child got a fist ball. I'm a pre-spon of ancestors and I'm blessed. They got knocked him, telling feds up. I can check stuff. Hell and care free. Not the skills. Me, hell and break. Yeah. I got next stuff. Right. No real love the same. Cause see when I look in your eyebrows. You not gated talking, I ready to ride. You do better eat than they cry. My pen is ignited. My soul is enlightened. I like who I can but I buy it. The palettes right on my trip. It's a fountain. I'm not like these regular guys. All that talk is my skyddit. What you like the way I make the tape print. But the ground make the world's play is grim. I'm the river between for the kids. Switz the label. I have to check like a blaze man. Something's barking where it's brain is. The beat is summer with it. Prancing. You're running away. I make the face jump in the passion. It's tasteless. They likely to run in my pool when they see face to face. They quick with the shape shit. I've done an egg with the gravest shit. By the front of the crème to the grave bitch. Big man how they face tense. Look both ways. If you catch fade I'm a nice guy. You're on the inside. Then I'm not somebody to be played with. Keep it on. I'll wake it up. I don't remember how to ground this. I like to see the oven brows. Try to wonder if they drown. I head on the swivel. Yeah. It's only really my surroundings. It keep it out of my guitars. I don't remember how to ground this. I like to see the oven brows. Try to wonder if they drown. I head on the swivel. Yeah. It's only really my surround. It can't stop. Won't stop. Tell that's what the world really glows track. Tell that they can do it. They're the stoves. I type of shit they hide in the tube. I just skip counting the new block. But I'm still around it. It could just not. Better hold it down with a group drop. I kick now for the crowd up a loop pop. They take them around for my moon. Better run them out of town for their hope fly. Queen Xi and Han like new line. They beat the host with a whip. They just not. They beat right up against the face. They beat against the gang. But it's just not. They beat the kick and they say. But they're subpar. If you enjoy through the club and the fly stop for life. I feel amazing. Damn it's keen. I've paid the angle. I send it to your girl but I make a face lift. This is your point. One more session to go. We'll be back here tomorrow. Last. Up a sun. Going up a looking there, it's now in the closing room. He's looking a bit swah. He should be. We might see these guys on. I'm not ready. So let's go in there. See what's under there. Yeah. The red sun rose this morning. Dark skies thrown out this morning. No way to right, no way to right. Hold on. The floor is gaving. Your wall's shining through cages. Your refuse will be your team right. That's the way to tell you. Your power is as special. We don't fit on your canvas. Holly, where are you? Is your job? Things you need. We'll be right there.

The whole event II brought the street to the final commercial, monitors aimed and So we have survived and helped with after a six hour journey. Or a rain and all of their experiences, but we made it, I didn't rush, I took it in flash and my wife. And yeah, this is not about really nice stories, again I've turned on, she went back in a second and I looked at her and she went back and it was time to be in there, I've got four more checkers to do, I did more jobs and checking for the next, but both seas, people check and stuff.

No, once you ever look at you, yeah, I've put my other bit in some of those. Because you just had your time to want to do a rub or make marks, anything loose, like five pounds, long enough, I mean. Yeah, okay, yeah, okay. Do you have your license? Yeah, there is, you don't have a stick to yourself. We're in the jam, yeah, but you know about making marks as you can. I've got my license. I feel like I've got this. Check it out. I'm not on the camera. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, the whole time is just a slide. I don't want to do it like I said before.

Yeah, I don't want to do it like I said before, you need these names, Federation and PCA, like really mean, tight and dry condition. If we put too many carbs in the gym, then we'll lose that in the flesh of the diesel. Yeah, so your side points really tighten on me as well. So we want to keep that in that situation. Okay, so hopefully proteins and fats. Okay. So fats whole fullness. Yeah. Push the carbs in today. They're sitting there and you haven't been even in a little bit like, Yeah. Yeah. It'd be a big pump out of the really push that glyphogen in. Okay. Maybe sat there and I'll weigh it at the pump up. I love it, so we need some zip-force names. Okay.

And it's literally what my mouth is like, I love it. I'll be at it. It's a fattened smile. It's trickler-in because you're on too far. So again, you don't push too much in over the day. Because you're on a hog water. Yeah. So that's why I like to get a move. So on of your frame, the seat, do you think that's a fattening day? I'll sort of complete later. I can help you a bit. She's ever been. Oh. Well, that's a guess, man. Good. Yeah. I'll see you, stupid. Yeah. It's time then. I'm the kind of fellow person. It was somebody towards the end. Whereas this time it's like, I'm not going to be this close type thing. Yeah. You're my car. Yeah. You're the only one. Yeah. It is a mind build at the end because you've been doing so much fat. That's probably so excited. Not too many. Not too many. Lie down and so in cars. Yeah. But they're hell. But they're all in need. You're going to have better future. Morning. Morning. Morning.

So I keep this far. Yeah. Anyhow, apart from losing the attention, but that's fine. I need time for that. So yeah, sometimes, I say they do it perfectly, but it comes out like little patches in say. Yeah. I'm actually a perfect pair of paint. It's quite a set. It is quite a set. It is quite a set. It's starting to get its two fair two. So it's going to be like, 45 minutes to start again.

=== FILE: SHOW DAY ｜ LEGIONS SPORTS FEST ｜ LEWIS BREED [4SiRMGdMDnk].txt ===

Sneaky 4 hours? I'm hungry. How's my car? So, the showly morning, the new is just slept. Like a baby. It's good he's woke it up. Fucking bang on my neck. Literally. Fulness is there. Condition, dryness. Everything. And I know it's just going to get better as we go into the day. I've got probably about four, four and a half hours of the stage. He's a really good spot. I don't need to chase anything. We don't need to chuck a load of food and then fresh thing which is always a positive. I've probably just got one decent sized meal in. Faxing in the morning here. And then head to the venue. He's got his tan and then just chill. And then magic happened. We will see how the show goes. The show goes pre-judging fast and then back for the four and a half hours later on. Day. Same time. Cut the other venue. So we had a good day yesterday in Portugal. Maro. He won his class. And then went into the overall apparently what the school and had a really good show in the university. So it was told. Regional box ticked. Going to bring him to the UK next week for the British final. So we're talking about that one. Alex did fantastic in China as well. Second in his class. I think that was like 18 in the two on two class. Then he got moved into the overall. They do it really, really strange way. 10 competitors from the T1 to 10 competitors from the open. In City overall. Where he plays fifth. Which is fantastic. So the incredible result for him. He's going to be at the PCA British doing the pro show there. So he's bringing his weight back down. And now, check it in this morning. Pretty much just a kilo off where we are for baseline. So it should cruise in to that for next few days. And then we'll be ready to load again. Going into that show. So that being exciting. So you're absolutely happy. Can't wait to hear about the UK. See all those guys. And then the British will be ticked off. A few more shows left to go. So the last one of the years. Like for the same version. And then it's down. But now we focus on this man. So we're about an hour and a half from stage. So I'm going to go downstairs. Where everything's ready to go. Do it. Just put in a bag with some honey in now. Just a... So we're about an hour and a half from stage. Just a slightly quicker distance than it's going to. Everything's ready to go. Do it. Just put in a bag with some honey in now. Just a... I hope. Not fave the length when it comes to stage. A little bit of peak marks. I've given the fullness how to keep the water a bit. Go backstage, little bit chill. I'm going to pose in a couple of rounds just before we go back to the last response of our just proof from the movement. Because a little bit harder than we shot. I've got that since pretty well for it. So then going into that stage. I'm currently being banged when honey with him. I've got that breakfast. Let's get an ocean shot in the perfect spot. Dad excited. So... You're good. You isn't cause any injury. I gotta try and breathe and take an breathing. Thank you very much. I hope Irvis people respond. Go ahead and make some noise, fell asleep. My bottles will smunk and submerge. Oops. Mommy. Don't. They work down all day long.

Many Granpez represent our area. Privetate your mat, get the���bat pedal. for the name. No comparison. Some South American guy saw this not seen this. They've literally like, they didn't even look at him. They didn't even look at him. Free Judging done, that's did. Unfortunately, the same old story. New judges, it's an even taken single look at this. Port amount of stage, max, child, is in the line of the room. You can physically see the judges heads just looking at the complete opposite direction of where Lewis is. They don't even move their heads, they call them off stage. And then when they come to the callouts, they call people when, brought them to the front of the stage, put them back. Every single callout, no comparison, nothing very frustrating. Because Lewis is the best he's done. And he's beaten some of those guys are in the top six. And he looks better than those guys in the top six. This one it is. He's just going to head back and chill. And he's a burger. Lewis is just looking to the Holly. Oh, guys. What's up? Yeah, because they were looking at the night. Yeah, exactly. So it's new. But the way they did it so quickly, they weren't judging. It's not like Texas and Tampa, where they made it more work when all of the lines are different from social. It's shit. It's an absolute shit, you do. No one else, admit it, it's shit, you. God, it's not shipping. You can't wait for two sponsors this season. You, two week's poses. You've made some, you've made new people. You've made new people. You've made some plans. It's not a waste. The very thing is, it's been the best year so far. It's shit that you've gone from third quarter to then whatever this place is. But you know what that's going to be built in. I know that, but it's just fucking frustrating because you're standing next to those guys in the first school. Yeah. And I know I'm beaten something. Yeah, I'm not so exactly what everybody says. And that's what happens when they look for it. But Luke's think of everything that you've taught this year. I think that's it. I think that's it. I think that's it. It's something that she's going to be, I'll make you family fries. It's about, you know the big standard to go boxes, the big spare ones, it's that big. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. What do you think? Any recommendations for our guests? The bull's eye is my favorite. It's a bacon burger with cheese. It's got American and Swiss and then it's got an onion greener. I think that's the main. I think that's it. What's that? What? What's that? What's that? What's that? I'm still not happy. I always thought it's burger steak. So I'm not in steak. So it's panicakes, so. What's the story in this kid's mouth? Yeah. What's with two spoonfuls of steak? Sure. So that is America done for this year about the Lewis and me and the season done, dusted. Today they do his plant. Very disappointed. Not with the way the Lewis looked. He was his best. He's been all season. He's gone for him without going in. We were very, very much happy with the look. It's like a bigger, more conditioned. Hose him was better. The things that he was told to work on his presentation is posing. This was nail. It's hard to take when you everything into it going into a show with the results that we had earlier in the year. A few months ago, to then not even really be judged. That's all new set of ideas new judges. They've never seen Lewis before. They're all parley with everybody else. So shaking hands to talk with the Lewis. They're just acknowledged and moved on. When it comes to stage, the same happened. The judges had literally not moved away from a couple of the guys on the stage. He had a limb of the guys on the stage. He had limbions and didn't even look to the right of the stage. He was like, there was no comparisons. There was no moving around on the stage. It's just called names out. The first call out. There was no back and forth. It's frustrating. Very frustrating because Lewis has already been a couple of those guys this year. He's better now when he beat them before. One of those things, bad day at the office. Bad day at the office, but I'll do it for you for late, because it's a type of way from the family. He puts everything into this and just not to be recognised. His tough, tough, his tough, his tough, but this will hold him back. He'll be back. Big and better. Stronger. More shredded. And have a peace.

=== FILE: TAMPA PRO I 2 DAYS OUT [HlpXRXsdMMc].txt ===

Okay, so we managed to see come off the flight. We've been very, very minimal. Water being held. And yesterday was just my breakfast. I'm running a free full-depletion just to put in a way that the privacy should take everything on today. And we've got, so I've got the first four meals planned out, which will be prior to training and not going to be other meals primarily south. And what I'm expecting to pay, nurse, so I'm looking at 8,363 calories, a 1430 grams of carbs, fast-a-low, although everyone asked me, why is nurses fast, perplexed? For instance, low today, just to help with the device space and then allow the digestion to be optimal. A lot of people when I showed nurses calories and my customers, they were all twice per inch high. It's not because he's having high brain. So also, this is just traced pre-in in the cargo hydrate sources, there's a lot of those, which are high volume of protein. So we do hope pre-indone to about 25 grams direct from protein sources, per meal here they meals, and then the rest is all from trace. Fast, I'm just actually slightly better than the protein, so we're looking at about 120 grams of fast, drown the ingredients, well, just to help with holding that fullness, and paying good grip and that, coming right from the aggressive today, see how that looks. And then we can see it in tomorrow, if we repeat all the harm, back off, and then on Friday, we're looking to drop back, the planet's to drop back a little bit, because I know that I can feed Lewis very comfortably, who's very far away, who's still too large, who's still too large, who's back there, is a huge, huge large. So I've been the fry's at five, five large fry's at big ass fries, so we just need to make sure that his stomachs in a good place, and I've full to take that on board, so we have a plan. We're going to also start being a little bit more wrestling, much better at this as well, just because of the pure volume of carbohydrates, so we're going to be taking it in, so it's just quite in that right balance, over the next few days, and that's going to be fun, so stay tuned. Lewis is over just making this very smooth, which is 150 grams of oats, 40 grams of raisins, 40 grams of jam, and 20 grams of onber, just a 30 grams of wavy scented. It's just so easy for this piece, so this is the navel beef that she owes away, jam, nubber, then rice and chicken, nubber, and bagels, and probably, lean steak, means we've wiped it out, and that is it. This is a very soft- repaired joint that is made by Thomas Collins, suffered from the ghee scandal Scott. Keith sincereened. It's been very good. The wind everybody. It's a great journey. It's one of the day. It's a lot of the lead and the reach and endings. Make sure we get to the mud guys. He's all the one over the. On top of there, we're going to go to the house. We're going to go to the building. See the kind of mud. So being there, our journey tonight is tomorrow. As well as, I'll see. My mind is in a blue ocean. So it's just like, I can't even tell you right. It's been kind of in the wrong day. I probably will call you in as well. And we'll get some stuff in that box. We'll get kind of weight. And see you guys there, right? Wiltsworth Es 그러면 began to have a period of time. 30 wars made. The organizational era had for less than 20 years. I think maybe theYeah or one decade of long exhilaratedness has been nonprofit. I got to say I got no more over. If not the second one, but more. At a time when you might in the beginning just two or three quarters of of less than now, it's the largest time we've earned and 70. If I'll be training about now and then I will look in the gym, assess and see how the last pull me was a punna. So we're just gonna keep pushing the water in as well. Lewis was super flat so we just need a bit of a feed to it saying we've got a little bit fast doing the job as well just holding the fullness because he pleased so quickly. Just a matter of just judging it, me or me or from here, literally I've free a few hours just taking a look and making sure everything's in the money. Lewis just laid him back, literally just sleeping and then pretty much just waking him up to eat and put him out of the bed and go from there. We'll see you in the gym. There you go. All right. See you. Thank you. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. We'll start in the morning. All right. Good. Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? There he is. Yeah. He's right. He's right. He's right. And he's right. He's right. He's right. I'm so nervous. You're a little more wrecked. I'm not gonna die. I'm gonna break my little fall. I make it mean I look pretty too big. I mean I would buy to get a little more in here. I don't think I'm gonna be the one to keep my life. I'm gonna break my life. I'm gonna break my life. I'm gonna break my life. I'm gonna break my life. What? What? I fucking did it. I was crazy. Crazy, crazy guy from the UK. Yeah, just a really silly bus. Really bus. Just seeing everybody here. Everybody in despair. Everybody in good place. Just the push. Music blew around. Just a quick look at the bus after the session. Just as humble as having a look. As well as good to see two guys with a kill. As we're as our sands. But it's a good idea where we're gonna be standing on Saturday. So, the day excited. The notice is the least. We have 225 grams of cereal. I was workout. Just had 125 grams of ground. We were all wait and chicken. 150 grams of milk. Rice. A baby of jam. So, now we'll go in. We'll settle. We will probably have one more meal. And then I'll get into the closing rounds. See how the looks. The better thing, of course, the day. No realistically, we're still when he's like 30% in this load. And so much more of the touch. That's all the push. I just don't wait. Okay, so. Yes guys, it's day three in Tampa. And I am currently making that. That's bold of proving you're good. I'm free. I don't know if I've lost my legs. We have color and it's like in the corner. And yeah, just a minute of it. Let's go over the board. Lewis looks absolutely insane this morning. Okay, so we started the load yesterday. When in 1500 carbs, the weight of the calories. And I had a look last thing before bed. And then we were really full to the seat. Don't even stop. Knowing that moving out of drop off. And it did. But the condition and the drawing I've been with it. It was going to be a level. So we know we are on to something. We're going to put it over to the gym. On the apartment in the apartment block. And just had a really good look. And yeah, it's looking on. So everything started to just push to the skin. Was generally going off, which is good. And that's going to be good. Today is registration day. It's like two and three and four things. So we're going to head to Emma for a bit of a mid day. Get three meals in Lewis. Just keep pushing nothing changes in regards to the size of the meals. At the moment. So we're going to get three solid meals in prior to doing the final process. Not pushing the final pump session. And then we'll head straight to registration. I'll have a plan then move forward where we stick to the same volume of food. Push right through to the end of the day. I'll gauge how Lewis is feeding in regards to his digestion. He's done that. He. The man is a mystery because she was so much food and still managed to hold his mid session. It's crazy. It's phenomenal. So but I know that after two or three days he's started to take his toll. So the plan is to go again quite a day. Back off a little bit tomorrow. The day before showed it. And then. But there are normal of that loading move to the which he's broken. Two large fries because it works nicely trained. So. But is it? I'm going to make this get coffee and meat and start working. Yes guys we are here at my 40 40 final session. Lewis. We'll just move some blood around. We're going to hit every up on my some breathe. Two back. Two chest. Two shoulders. Two arms. We get every single time we grab. Obviously we're finding. Session. Really. It works better. Just move everything around. Getting a lot of beef. Good to get used. I'll allow him to start. Get a little bit of a pump. I'd a good look after where about. Nearly. Nearly halfway point to. To the field. So things are going to come alive. The little one is really good. So. So the side of the field is going to be like. After it's so. That's what it's like. Is it something to do with it? I'm on the reason. Oh no. I'm on the. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. I. Still. I. It. It. I. I. It. I. That. Yeah. That was. I. We. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's not. I can't count, I mean it's not. But free search. Library cobbler, please. It's amazing. They're coming. I just want to do this. I just want to do this. I just want to do this. I want to do this. I want to do this. I want to do this. I want to do this. I want to do this. Press it in for the help. I want to do this. It's not a fast machine. It's not a fast machine. It's not a fast machine. The machine. I want to do this. I want to do this. I want to do this. It's not a fast machine. It's a fast machine. This is too big. This is too big. And two and a half thousand calories deep, approximately. The only thing that is left is the hardest workout of my life. So it's not all fun and game-winning carbon up. It literally eats, sleeps, and then doesn't again. The budget, train, sparking, and pie. The quality is trying to discreetly do it with it. It's all relative. You can eat 6,000 calories, 7,000 calories, so relative to the birth of a stilky of fuzz. Find a grind, drop a million times, counter a last bar of food. Everything doesn't happen. Relaxing while I'm at this square, the body of the person respond, so we create it and everything will happen. That way too, it's not bad. Yeah, except any food situation. Really? It makes my sense. We are done, so Lewis has fought with the proper stuff. We've just been for a few rounds of pose in as well. So the look from this time yesterday, this Monday is night and day different. Much better, try it. Still got a bit of water per last, but the amount of food that Lewis has taken on boards and never bought it. He's going to still be holding, so it's a matter of balance in that. And no end when he's the right tools at the right time, so we'll probably start pulling water a little bit to make the retouching rice. We'll be nearly 4,000 far away probably. So it's going to take an effect on some points. We have the balance out. We're going to back off tomorrow, which will be less of a stress on the body. We can be good, so it's going to be an interesting look tomorrow morning for sure. Yes guys, we're here at the Grand High End. It's a registration day and it's a journey site in the cake. A lot of familiar faces around, very good guys. It's a sighting, just taking it wouldn't absorb any fluid places, happy. But look is on the money from here. We know what we're doing, it's just about controlling it, controlling all the variables. But they're in a good environment and it's pretty good at talking with you today. We've had a lot of fun here. We've had a lot of fun here. We've had a lot of fun here. I'm not sure if you've got the 3V, but it's here. Everyone else is looking for the phone. We're going to have a chat day. Are you feeling a day? We're eating here. Come here. Ah, come on. Come on. Hi, hi. Hi, hi. Yeah. How do you get up? No, no. You all right? You got thoughts? What do you want? What? What's the telly slap? It's a thingy. You just got a lot of things. I'm going to get one. Oh my god. What? Yeah, I'm going to get one. What? My god. See, oh, oh. You did much fun all my shit. Oh, yeah. Oh, my god. Get it? How about that? That's a fun to start. Oh. But you did not humorously. My name is Shematsu Numi Shes. Wow, they're cool. They're cool. I'm a colleague. I'm the star on the show, Ted. Say, do you make it? Hey guys. Say you're a little bit. Hey guys. Looks muscular. Go on. Go on, telly. No. Yeah. Yeah. So, colleague, does my flow move up from the UK to do it? Actually, see Lewis, I'm saying. I know. In 15 years. Poly puts up with all the analyses here because I would because she'd be a model of her whole. Yeah. For this time, this work, that works. It's a little bit. I'm going to be really well. What? Always having something on the out there. And I just late. Did you have any further slip? Yeah. Yeah. You're hungry. Yeah. You're hungry. You're going to subsack. Everyone relates to that. Yeah. Everybody knows. My whole problem up, no. We're going to get seven to eight. It is the final day of loaded tomorrow. Friday, April show. We're going to be out. Crack it all. Probably before the crack it all gets done to that one for eight. Huffle up. You see how Lewis is looking. Literally before he drinks. We've got a reference point now and we can manage literally me at one of those tomorrow. Go ahead and see. Show them. Peace.

=== FILE: TAMPA PRO ｜ DAY 1 [Xq4Tfas_9Xo].txt ===

Yes guys, welcome to episode. I've been awake for 22 hours. We are landed here in Tampa. Louis Breed is five days out from the time of the pro. It's fresh so on American soil. So, I'm very excited about that. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm the only brewery to the food. Louis is Ian. Oaks. Last year we were at the age. We're juiced a month of food today. And that reduced amount of food was eight meals of eight grand of car. Just to help the reduction of any water retain on the flight. We've got basically until Wednesday morning to get anything off. We've got a lot of things. We won't be allowed. So we've got no issue. Tomorrow we will get up. We'll go shopping. We'll go to the Amarford and train. That's enough. I need food. So peace. Welcome back tough and experienced fitness. Let's check out what's going on. We're starting to be optimistic. Weeks like dawn, We will come up 3am, have to do it better. I have 11. Squeezing a couple more hours, I'll see you in our way up all of this. Just a little six. So I don't quickly call it the last of the, sorry, no, how many people have three left, how far you can manage it very well. And that's an over-the-piece of war in. Using a little bit of that amount of time, I should not write it. It's been a seat. It's more of an absolute treat. It's one of the really good spot because a door needs a little bit more time to pull. We'll go in just out of the day's approach to cool. The Louis' normal day is six out of calories, eight hundred something around your car. I was expecting that probably I've been given a bit of a, not just trying to pull any more of that. We don't need to, so we can run out of the days. The standard day, and then tomorrow we'll start an out-of-privileged baseline. There's a superflop, super-superflop, but we don't score. We got a pretty good three days of the rest of the moment, which will work really well. Can't wait. We'll wait for, I hope, to lose that nose. And then we're gonna head like that, but it'll end up, you know, I hope, and then my foot. I'm going to go through the outer side. It's gonna be more America than we've got. Taking it on the lips for my foot. I'm going to take it to the seventh level. Oh, we got a lot of a car to be here. Stay connected. We found a warm-up. I'm blown away. There's a one-to-white people in America big. Everything is super-sized. And now the best weeks been in Ben and Jerry's. I've got three top to these. We're just getting so far for the week, Lewis is car-bugs, starts tomorrow at the road. We have to go quite heavy, so Rob don't pay into to go back and forth. So super market, we'll actually get everything in now. Bagels, rice, oats, honey, raisins, everything. Basically just getting a little lid for the show on Saturday, so we've got to make sure that everything is going to end. Make sure he's going to be on the money with the, like, everything by Justin's on point. So it's all new fees, we need to make sure that it's good. And we're gonna get spots, they'll be able to push out. Oh, what's the have and try in the UK? Okay, okay. Are we doing the race? Sent shoes. No, man, that, this thing. Can we call her from this? Yes, yes. So what's the shoes for? Crunch. Amanda loves pieces. Of course, you see, probably get things just like that, you can see it by everything. Some shoes are not a good check. I'm not right today. I'm going to try and get some food. I'm going to try and get some food. I'm going to try and get some food. I'm going to try and get some food.

=== FILE: TAMPA PRO ｜ SHOW DAY ｜ LEWIS BREED MAKES SOME NOISE!!! [Fz6Xo5iPMi0].txt ===

Yeah we are 10th day. Are you feeling my day? Yeah, what are you doing here? Come here. Ah, I'm on my way. I'm ready. I'm on my way. Holy, I'm the star of the show, Ted. Say, do you make... Hey guys, do you know what I'm doing? Hey guys, what's muscular? So, Holy does my flow move up from the UK to do it to actually see Lewis on the stage. I know, in the 15 years. Holy. It puts up with the open and never see the air because I would. Because you'd be in a moment, I would. Yeah. So, this time, this, what that was. It's a little bit really, really well. What? Always talking to something, what do you mean, and I just make everything. Did you have any fun or silly? Yeah. You had lots of things. Are you hungry? Yeah. You're my subsac. I've never been to like, so I've been eating. Yeah. Everybody knows nice. Marl, fun, what? No. We're going to get some into it. It is the final day of loaded tomorrow. Friday, April, we'll show you going to be out. Crack it all. Probably before the crack it all, get down to that one for a week. I'll look to see how Lewis is looking. Literally before he drinks. He's got a reference point there and do it. And we can manage literally me at one of those tomorrow. Go ahead and see. Show them. So, please. Yeah. Woo! Woo! There we go. There we go. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! We're going to go. We're going to go. We're going to go. Yeah, bro. Go for that. Yeah, not no durates. Not things just kept everything same. What I say, 10 liters of sugar. Okay, kids' day. I'm going to put it all up. I'll put it like two of those six by five. So, it's the way you want to do this. I don't want to reverse-peek it. Yeah. You want to reverse-peek? No, not peek, not peek, don't. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, it's just very cheap and they're falling at you. Yeah. All the way for dough. Small things out of me. Yeah. It's more good. Yeah. So, we're going to put it in the bowl. Okay, but we're going to turn it off. It's like developed sort of time. It's good that time, sir. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to put it in the bowl. It's a little sticky. Yeah. It's very quick. Please, the mixer, something. Because it's rising. I'm not going to mind your full clock. Maybe we tell the powder on your leg. We don't go out of the bowl. But it's like, Tim, I bet last night, it was a feds' wrecked in it. Only a little bit. We've got a fart on building for the bar, you know? I thought, and then the last, I've put some bed sheets on bottom. I don't even need them, it's like that. That we know in there. Yeah. The only night, I mean, like, night, night, late. Oh, yeah. It's not gone, sir. I want to just keep going. It will long be gone. Yeah, me. That's it. Hey guys, it is day four now in the time. Three of the loads, I think, for sure, it is six, just like seven. Not apparently, but thinking about it, even if you get it, probably. We've come to him out for you. Just that, we look at Lewis and some good light. We're glad you see. Because the play wasn't good, so, I had to do something similar. He's been normally seen. It'll be sort of a play, something like that. When you see him, we want to see the America, the practice show. Yeah, they're very good spot. After two days, heavy loading, I'm sitting at a good way. Very, very good condition. You know what I'm just going to go heavy in the first couple of meals, try and work, I think. I mean, tomorrow, I'm going to go by meal. I'm going to pull back a little bit, give some rest on the GI. Try to make some changes for heavy, ask me, which will be a few bites, which works so well, which doesn't seem to mean. And then we'll wait a moment, money, and it's holding tomorrow. It's all good. We have the body, people, we'll take that. In the air, in the air, in the air. The moments away from where the racing game is, hey, we're going to get nuts, cow, fat, and cow. We're going to get it, it's good, it's good, it's good. It's good, it's good, it's good. It's good. I'm down, I'm going to go see you tomorrow. Let's go to the pool, coaching, coach, diet hackie. Egg, free of spread, thank you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Very done, it's not next at the end. Cool, it's good, perfect. Jump in. Go to work. Just look at it. We're going to go, we're going to see six hours. 26 hours. 26 hours. Yeah, so. It's good to be on this, like we could. We could stand on stage now, but I know this could be better. We've got a very small percentage of water left to come off. We're already falling as deep pretty much today, and it's nearly not even a little and a lot of cool. We will probably push 10 liters. All right, can we feel like there's that one you have to wait? Yeah, we can. And then I'll trickle the rest in. Yeah, so that makes sense. Yeah, with the food. Yeah. I'm just going to do it. That's my head, that's what I'm thinking. Because of the fullness of your caroline and your fucking bone dry. And you're just going to dry up. Yeah. Because tomorrow we're not going to be loaded with water. Yeah, but it's just going to suck it and suck it and suck it. If it was fasting in the morning, then I would drink, cause it would too. And then we would just like, yeah, it's a sassum. Yeah. But like they, if you were fasting in the morning, then potentially I would. But with the time of the show, we still not. 26 hours to dry for a minute. Yeah. Yeah. So cows get a lift. If we actually think, I've already done a part of it, of course to me. But mate. Yeah. I'm going to do it tonight. You're going to do a show. Yeah. Do a show. It's going to be a nice month. What are we doing in the tent? Is it a spa demand? Yeah, it's a mouth mower. What? Bigger? That's what I... What? What? He's so... How? I'm going to move to the line. All right. You have to be serious now. I have to... But I'm sneezing. All right. Leave that for a second. What are you doing? Yeah. You're going to be a little bit... Uh, that's much. No, I'm going to be a little bit... Oh. All right. You're going to do the next. Double body. That. Yes. What's that? I'm last breath. Last breath. Wow. So, it is... Two o'clock just gone. And this is a time that we estimate Lewis to be on stage, roughly tomorrow. And, um, you can probably much... Pretty much stand on stage now. Um... The look is mad. Crazy crazy mad. Uh, it's just going to get even better. The decision... It's actually too poor with that. Which I had in my mind this morning. As changed. Um, we will probably just write a book about what we've done yesterday. But time to be presented today. I'm a lackey. We are... Draw, I have a phone. Lewis is going to carry on building Lego. With Ted. Um, well, I'm just going to blow it away. What I look is crazy. Crazy crazy crazy. Ted, we are... Hi, five. Does that do that good? No, this... Do it again. This phone. Let's do it on the... Oh, wow. Can I call you for my phone? Can I call you for my phone? I'm going to have to do the top. We have to finish the Lego one right now. Um, um, it's my own standard drive. Oh, you got the last one. Yeah. Oh, no. One with standard B absolute leader. Is it this one, though? Yeah, it is that one, yeah. You're right. Look at that. Wow. Right. Time to go shave. That is going to get time. Ah, touch. Here we are. No, bro. Not good condition. Yeah, me. It's the... Follow someone called Chick-fil-A, you know? I saw the jack-type. Oh, my gosh. So, I'm taking off this room. I got it. I'm going to win this one. I'm going to play. Come by. Still be me. That boy is growing. Just come back from time. Um, just have a look. I'll fall music. As we planned, we'll back in off a little bit of the day. So expect it a little bit from the street to drop off. Yeah. Which is going to spike up with a heavy immune now. And it's back off of a light immune. And then going really heavy tonight before we go back with the very low price. Um, yeah, it's all going to plant a better one very, very tired. So we've got probably three years left now. And then it's a key time. So yeah, it's good vibe. Every time we're extremely happy, we look at it. It's a good plan. Naturally. It's a good team. So we shall see from here. We'll be telling you like. You like some. You like some, you like some, you like some. Like, yeah. You need to be about. Hey. We're almost pretend. More than a from the last year. Probably about another percentage right. This is something, girl. I see the close. You know, like, just relax there. See what? See that? Hey. You got these, this one, yeah. See that? Well, do you want that to mention? The noise of the Mitch's got you gone now. Like, this is, you know, it is. Turn the clock. We will be having burgers in about an hour. Yeah. Yeah. Man starving. That sounds a grab the car today. Tell me the war. Six thousand calories so far. Um, probably about 3000 calories in with this meal. Two. That would be his very best. Two last fries. And it's my time. Wake up. We will be fuller. We will be drier. Um, and then it's just about managing it. Go in. Into the show. We got bikini. There's about 24 girls a bikini. I think that's 11 girls in. Well, when us starving that. I've had 11. So we're guests to meet in about two o'clock. To be on stage. So, um, I'm just going to try and manage to look up into that point. Two o'clock today was a very good look. So if we can sort of try and mimic the, the food that we used. But to let we more water in the morning. Secure the fullness that we want. By that point, you should be literally. The skinless. So, I said, we'll see. Staying there tomorrow. Good. Here. So I think you did really well. Yeah, yeah. Oh, there's απο. Can I pick that Wisconsin reevalred six, just be on the safe side? The last supper. The first Antrag of this failed dodge B The day is nearly over. It's just about to be soft. It's somewhat of a very impressive load. Something that is truly beyond science. It's crazy. Crazy crazy. It's a very day of load in probably 26,000 calories. We'd probably touch in four and a half, thousand carbs, three plus meters of water. Yes, this is... That's what we... That's what we've got to do. This man process is there. And the math is the ego driver and joy throughout the day. We're probably at our joyous point now, but I've seen him, which is the perfect position to be in. We will be up early. So 25 to midnight. We'll be up above 5 o'clock to assess. This will relax too. Hopefully get a few hours of sleep. We'll see how we'll look as... Holding in the morning we expect a little bit. Potentially of a fullness to drop off. But we'll listen to the planning. Free good near meals, potentially. There's a game plan, which can be adjusted. Not even on stage too. I want to clockish. Yeah, if I want, so... It's all time for that in the win. I think it's frosted. It's a good one too, so after that, we'll put good amount of food in the morning. Because it's just not so super clean. There's just about a number of... ...beating for that moment and the show in the state. I'm going back. See you tomorrow, I'll show you. Look at the air. The team he is for me. The muscles are difficult to get into that. The blades are so pretty. The more conditions they ever do. It's hard to do it. Never. Not. That's what I like. Speak to us. This is a look. Everyone has a little bit. So they've asked us a lot. Forgot to keep the air so I feel like that is going to happen. And to be fair. Quite a lot about the potential. I'm in the barbershop. I'm going to be able to get rest and sleep. Jason Coolson. Yes, on. Good morning guys. It's so late. We are open money. It's very very good. It's one of our happy with a little bit. Flutter. Then we've been out of the list. But there's like five hours. It's a little bit. Just that in person is now. We've just got in the car. Those three are just down. Like from the number in that. They're very nice. They're just like, really good amount of war in the music. I'm not talking to you. See what that goes. Just get well good in time and right today. Hey, if we can hold this condition. Fill them up on a little bit. So we'll go and start. Just take a step first. Every hour. I'll make sure it's on the money. It's good. It's very good. I did not see the link. I'm super dear to write. I'm tired. I've got this. I'm going to show it. So it's all kind of so. Then I'll give this battle a stage. I'll give this battle a stage. I'll give it a stage. I'll give it a stage. I'll give it a stage. I'll give it a stage. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. You like that? No. You like that? Yeah. Yeah, because of customs, I'm not going to throw up. Or feel flat, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know which one? Well, my name is Tioffman. That's what you were going in. Wait, wait. I'm going to come with this. I know. I'm going to wait a minute. Still want to tell him what his weight is. Just play with his head. He could be 150 kilos shredded and it was still a fuck with his head. But yeah, it's already the rock. Never be going. Never be going in. So that's 200. Spive and do grab the carbs. Roughly the small and gone in. Just nearly a minute and a half of water. And it's a tiny good. It's a little bit hard to do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You've got a lot of meat on your plate. So we're here at the ground higher. Okay, so the amateur's a list like the armatures have just finished. So pros and few to start in just under an hour, 50 minutes. Lewis is sleeping. Again, just good. The plan is to have a look at him in 20 minutes time to be 11 o'clock. Estimation were about two and a half hours from stage. So this would probably be the last bit of volume-wise food going in. Okay, the look is perfect at the moment. It's just a matter of keeping it topped up. And really just driving up the last bit of condition, bringing up last bit of water out and he's ready to rock. Okay, let's get it now. Thank you. Thank you. What are you doing here, babe? What are you doing here, babe? What are you doing? Boy the man. What's that he doing? Liz the man. So we are done with pre-judging. The final one, Liz came out and was absolutely on the money that he had been credit for. First row, the four-wheel drive were all directed towards the left hand of the stage. There was a lot of right. He then moved our stage and called the next round. Cool, fast-cold out. They compare a hunt around the rows and together move them off stage. Leave them two guys and pull the Lewis in. And then move Lewis to the center. Well, something went a little bit. And it's looking like they're at a fourth. This is very good, very good. That's our aim. So it's just, this is going in when you do not get prepared. It's just frustrating. We've been able to put everything into this and Lewis is on the money. He didn't get the comparison. The guys like Delorosa, all the other guys, you got cool into four. They were fantastic, but he just didn't sort of pan out with the weather. We are hoping to, you know, maybe always go into the window as good as we can and be Dutch fairly. So we'll see, you know, we'll go back to the point in the minute. Lewis is thinking about our girl in price. Just to pop the top of the map and then we'll go back and enjoy the finals. We'll see you there. This one. Look at this one. What was the song? Did you like the song? Is it kills? Is it the spot in the audience? That's the spot in the audience. That's the spot in the audience. That's the spot in the audience. Yeah. I did see you. I was like, you told me. Yeah. I did see you. I was like, you told me. Yeah. You guys were thinking about that? We have just come off stage. So pre-drogen. I was like, yeah. We thought that he's slightly got overlet. The man he paid off. He fought. He fought. He fought. He put out. Here it is. Top three, maybe. Top three. I'm going to go get the real check. I think we're going to have to put it in. Yeah. That's another one of our finals, right? Pointing out next to John and then my good running for him. Yeah. So he's all going to be one extra.

So she should be in the next year. We'll get out of the Junior. Yeah. And it gives us a good addition to the Ula Haldwax. Good. Happy. She's not really because of my name. It's the most important thing. For the last two days she also has not put those more children. It's not really good because she hasn't actually been sick with them. She has a lot of children's information. I'll just let them know. But then again, good figures. At least as she hasn't been in, she doesn't even grow as a child. I really think we're gonna stop now.

So, come first after her three boys and designers and the drama she calls all day, she got away crying of happiness once. And then we went on to play with me. She was unfortunately the only one in a category, but they put her in with the open to see how she lined up. They didn't actually put her in as a competition, though. There was put one say, so she could see for her future. And she did, she held herself really well and I was seeing she won her junior, but she got the invite to the bridge.

We were very excited for this is the third year in a row that we have sponsored, one of the two brochures and it is a real pleasure of us just to be able to give back to UK bodybuilding. We have a huge passion for it. We love how much the sport is growing and the UK and we want to be able to support that. Yeah, with that excited, it's going to be a busy one. By all accounts, it is the show before the Ben Weeder, there is a few of the next weekend as well, so there are a few guys that are going to be lining that up as effort as pro qualifier and it is that whole host of pro qualifiers coming up that my guys and a number of athletes will be thinking about which is going to be fun. Big start of 2025, I have got four guys in this weekend, two classic, one classic, two men's, a physique and one open bodybuilding and everybody is looking very good and it is exciting to see the other athletes who are competing and I know a few of them and I know they're looking good as well, so it's going to be a good show that's some good names there and so me it's a good taste of what's to come in 2025, 2024 was a very, very good season for us and we hope to replicate it and some this year. Okay, so at the moment I only have Josh here in Essex so I've been able to feel on him last night in a couple of times this morning, three times already this morning, I'm due to pop brown and see him in a bit, he's running around the corner, it's very handy Michael, Matt and Dom are all on the way and I'll be catching up with them. If not before registration, if they don't make it before then then I will see him at registration and just for him to finalise their plans there I'm pretty much checking him with a meal to meal so they've got two, three, four hour drives between them so it's just making sure that I have been smooth before they took off and then they were in done point as they are driving but yeah, I'm just finishing off check-ins here Lewis Amanda, Lewis is actually guest-posed in for us this weekend he is just under well just under 12 coming up to 11 weeks out from the first show of the season for him so we'll get a bit of a taste of how he's looking Amanda's training and Mark Joyce is training with Lewis at the moment I couldn't make it for the gym unfortunately just because I just wanted to try and get everybody's check-ins done I've got four left before registration and I'm pretty much clear for the weekend just making sure what we're guys is good, early start tomorrow and then Sunday is flight to Thibau so we're going to head over the Josh in a minute and then the ride so we'll cut through there traffic is paddling maybe so there's a four way traffic lights on around about right at the exit of our road I'm just breaking down Josh is actually three minutes away I'm going to be sat here for ten minutes so just wait for Josh to come down nice apartment block check on him to spout my parker he is couple hours away just leaving some instructions on some fluid Tom is on his way, Tom's under the cap very nicely last year was a very very good look he done very well in the regionals he'd done the ride in place there in a 30-teap class of class B what starts me over a brook robber this year and we're always sure until it like because of the turnaround we'll feel the next Friday you'll be on stage in the Friday this is a Saturday show and it's a six-day turnaround series you know I said to him from the day one it's not where if that's being a hundred so for the show and this is a smart thing to be there's so many people that you know want to go full hog into the regional and there's a number of crow qualifiers that are going to be coming up you know body needs to be primed for those shows you know yes it's all well and good really new at all here but then if the physique starts to fade going at the brook qualifiers it's not worth it so yeah the plan is to go in at like seven you percent hear this week and then basically do those talk to me basically then run it in for feebo next week f off. Yes of course. But there's a bad Ruudman there. registration here, looked busy, we're at the team type theatre and grades at SX, new venue, stage that's pretty epic, probably theatre, which is called bringing back some older computer, never vibes for myself, but good amount of good athletes coming through the door, which is good to see, good to turn out.

You're a white-white-white guy. All right. But you're actual going for detail, because you're... I'm like, yeah. Me, flower hole. Still be just as clear, yeah. Exactly. Some people are a flat-a-visite, and you're a bigger human, a flat-a-visite. That's right. I mean, you need to pull the detail, because you're not gonna have the white-white-white-green. So it's that balance, so I'm keeping your phone as just a flat-a-visite, and it's working really well. Yeah. No, no, no. So, let's do two more meals. You'll do ribbons to last one. Yeah.

So as you hit a roadblock, the Stomloo block, you can be fighting that for weeks, try to reset the reset and how you feel.

You know, all these guys and girls that have come here today, they've got all the intentions of going for that pro-card. So we've got high quality standard here today. My guys, my guys look really good today. They've all turned up and all four of them. They've actually brought the best package to date. Mikey, Josh, Matt and Dom. Okay. Two mentors, one classic, one super. It's been a busy day for me. I'm very impressed with everybody. It's been a bit of a manic day. You're one of the roundest ones. But start at the season. It just gives that a little bit of a vibe for the rest of the season. Set's the tone and it's like before it. We also had Jenny here as well. Here's one of the passion.

Here, let's go! Hey, when I put up the murder, how's squared that a slave? My wife, me, is the morning last semester, but I'm doing some facial that big rugby, and the key was okay today, and she's on her show, and she's had a win. So first time down, first win, say, amazing. That's it, and we'll see you next six months in the match. Wow, I've tried the anxiety all the way, which I've always been here with. I've bought something. Yeah, I think I'll call a few times. I'll find out when it's you be. So, let me send first up, first check in on the end, and enjoy her state, she said. She's had some life, and she's actually high, so she's been the son of a last time, she's been a son. We've been seen the first two team, we have something you're on the beat, we can reach a big deal of heart. I'm the other one. She had that sort of thing. And you must see her as a last name. I've got a little bit of a little point below, yeah. Contemporary technique, the boring way of that, that thing, and all food wasn't the last time. And you're just come off your side, and you're still, but I still believe in them, and I'm always in the period, and I'm sure we can. This is the thing, isn't that for you? I've got it up to you, because it's been to be on the day, yeah. Let's give you a few days to understand what you've heard on a little bit, blow to you guys. It's all the lead up to you, isn't it? Yeah, and we've been to most of the most of the course, kind of, the lead up to you, so that you're, like, low heavy symptoms, or any of that, some of your, at least, have what happens, I don't believe. And now I'm happy to love you, but more than, I think, let's enjoy your on-estance. So that's Lisa, done, that's the looking really good, so much better position. Last time, I was all eating at school, so I'm happy with that. And the next week, free day to turn that. So, gonna check over, Naomi and Chloe, they're both bikini, and then, and she's probably been more full of it, to be in the peeing quite a lot. And then we are done for the night. So like that is, Lisa, the judges are like that. Guess what, I did last night. I think. This is not a funny thing. I think I did last night, but I was a little bit more full bad. I was just now, I was a little bit more close, isn't it? I'm a little more close. So yeah, I got close right, so give me a couple of hours. I'm going to take a photo to get my full bad. I think I'm still leaving the record tips. What are the more things? I'm actually not a big fan of this. I'm not a big fan of this. I'm not a big fan of this. I'm not a big fan of this. I'm not a big fan of this. So that's why I'm not a big fan of this. I'm a big fan of this. Yeah, yeah. I'm a big fan of this. But you can't go and hang out with me, no one knows this for a year. I'm not a big fan of this. I'm not a big fan of this. But I don't know if I'm a big fan of this. I'm a big fan of this. Why didn't the columns work like that? I've been here at the UK, the FBA show. I've got four ladies here today. On all of the models, it's fantastic because of the parents this year. She's an on-first thing. Someone has to have a third and not seen her visuals, everything will be on. She's just really good. You can pick that up more for this show. Just because it's really net-and-and, for me, she knows that's really what she's doing. She's doing a little bit. She's going to get a little bit. She will get a bit. The main one is, I reach out for that. It's big. I mean, hardly will be going there. It's like a hot-out of a hinn. And the end reading is about four of that, I'll carry it to try and get her. I'll go and do a massage. So that's what you're really going to get trip. Also, if I can marry each other, I can get another collaboration. Not probably to me, if I have an Edwin's, she's at UK BFF today. It's her French wine, too. So she's done the regional, in fact, the regional goes the British style. So they again, the regional with a really peak here, who don't know who we're in there at the week after for the British. So this time, peekin' her, she's checked in. And she's looking really good. Really good. Really good. We're going to play this one, and she's not wanting to go out for free. Maybe so. Because of this trip and in some food for her, I keep going on. I know a lot of others should have given her a couple of presents. I think that's a good one. We're going to play this one, and she's looking really good. We're going to play this one. We're going to play this one. We're going to play this one. We're going to play this one. We're going to play this one. Yeah. The heat when you will fire, let it go get the game. You're feeling like I'm flowing, I'm not feeling the moment I swaka to let it take. They never believed that that would really fly. They go chemistry. I had to set them straight. We were going to play. Will they come, bond, we're gonna pray at five. They're coming. It's 4 a let's go. A close one. Three, two, one, four. Yeah, they're coming. Yeah, I think that's a lot of fun. Yeah, that's cheap. That's just cool. I know the bad guys. I think that's a lot of fun. That's a lot of fun. That's a lot of fun. That's a lot of fun. Yeah, that's a lot of fun. That's just a lot of fun. Okay, two more seconds. Oh, we've got some sauce. Love it. Yeah. That's a lot of fun. That's a lot of fun. I think that's a lot of fun. I think that's what I'm saying. That's a lot of fun. We've got a lot of fun. Yeah. Okay. That's just a lot of fun. I don't know what's the other way to say that. No, I just thought that was a lot of fun. Yeah. That's a lot of fun. That's a lot of fun. And I know they don't have a pretty good clue. I've tried to turn back. It's looking like months and months. Yeah. It's a pretty good idea. I'm probably still feeling like I'm editing it again. Maybe I'm like, I'm really writing my super-methicine knowledge. Yeah, it's a little bit too slow. I'm not sure if it's your first time. Yeah. There we start out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure. I just feel like I'm just making sure that's where you're going to work. Yeah. Yeah. Because once you get that, you're going to start. Yeah. Yeah. I'll let you know that you're going to have a full day of the pre-month. There's a lot of fun. Yeah. I'm going to get on work. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. And then, let's go back. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go! Hello!

I think of me they never have a mind in their beeswax. I don't know the cat, but I'm wearing like three hats. Never been a rat, but I know where the cheese hat. You'll never get a trophy because they all hit with weed. Yeah, you better believe that. When it's all said and done, I still be here standing. Never took a loss and it ain't something that I'm planning. I dig it to say something, my hope is insane. One, every dog has his things, been miles his day. One, this is real riding, I'm still climbing. Why you still trying, I'm still shining, this real blinding. And I'm getting out of two, talking top two. I'm not a two, you love the pressure, bother you. What not, do what I gotta do, let's go home. They ain't coming so soon, me. Flow is on the timing, I'm starting, if I use the porch, reach the hardest out. Stay in loyal, no falling out. And if you step into the court, be ready, we're falling. The coldest of teens, they know we bring on shys. We know between, we go for these dreams, the sightless. How work, don't let's take it from magic. You need to shoot in the gym. This is tight and I'm practicing. Okay, so far we've had, though we're on a junior vacation, although it's second, she's absolutely open-moved. Love is one of the phase when she's waiting for that. So then that was a really good result. We've had links to Anne and Amy on six hours in the class. Yeah. So we have, um, this is what's saying, I'm sad because there's just bad news today. We're absolutely safe, so we've got to be no further. We've got to be no further. She did a basketball event, but she had a really good ass off. And then we had her name again. She's been in half the age for us, I'm a trophy, and again, she knows that she was really good, so I've been happy with that. I'm doing it, I ain't just here, but then... I'm gonna pay not the way I am. And then, she's gonna say, I'm gonna pay. I'm gonna pay. I'm gonna pay. So what's next, we get it, we do a test of it. What's next? We're literally on the water, find the plants. What's ahead and the snack hunt? I've got cat food, food, everyone's sorted, so it's nice to pay when it's myself. Um, she's been walking. Work again. Sir, the fuck are you good today? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go again. Let's go. Let's go. Okay, realize it's been a few hours ladies, so thank you for waiting. Not every body on the stage is smiling, we need to have a little go. This is a good moment, like every go ladies. For the time to the mic. What about the steps, and today? I love it. I guess the arms is going to pull from the fast to figure out why it's going to be quite this. I think she's over there, but it's all under my face. I'm ready to roll, ready to roll my top. Let's go up to the thing. We're getting ready to go home now, we're in a long day, we need to get on the road. We'll all climb and compete, which we're going to stop for a second. I will have to come. So we're going to... I'm going to sort this out. I'm going to go home. Right, wrap up for the day people. We're starting off with Chloe, she was first on in Genie bikini. She did exceedingly well, she's absolutely in with the road. It's our first season and we're going to wait a second in Britain. It's absolutely phenomenal. I was going to go home with Chloe, until next week we had Lisa and Naomi both in Massive bikini. Lisa and Naomi both on Fantastic The World Best Package, both over the moon of how they lived. We got four foot full Naomi and sick police. What we've realized actually in the place in Zah, out of the ladies, the top free her place, was a different kind of her Zika and built to Naomi and Lisa, which is not bad thing. It's a different federation, different criteria and we're going to go with maybe slow federation. Next year, they asked a lot of email masks in their more conditions. So it's something that we're going to trial and that's like I said over the moon with their place in Zah. And then last but not least, at the UK DFBA, was Anne. Again, Anne came with four of Britain and our fantastic lineup as well. All the lineup is this year at the British was fantastic, really good standard. And Anne is over the moon because she's moved up from bikini to figure out athlete and that's so much she really wanted to do. So she's achieved not only and moved up in her category division but also placed in that bush. So over the moon as well. We did have Oxie Carrie and Chloe confusing on the same day. And I didn't have also Nicki competing day before. So a bit of a round of that Nicki did over 45 Masters bikini. Her second time on stage and came away with a win and then came back to the British for Fitt X. And then we had Chloe at, what was it doing? UK DFF. Chloe was over the moon as well. So she normally does home to figure. But this time she did body fitness. So it is a big category. Up against some more muskler physique. And she came away with her. So she's over the moon with that two in a strong lineup. And she ends her season now. After two in the same way shows. We had Carrie who is actually aiming for her pro-cloth as she embasses her win. But she jumped on PCA just to see where she is in regards to divisions again. She actually went into athletic due to the fact that her condition wasn't there for trained. But she's now realized that will be realized actually that she does not fit in athletic. She came sick. Again that will leverage as fantastic as she wasn't in a athletic vision. She stuck up on a sore bum because of my muscle maturity and density she has there. So it is a case for Carrie. She ever does any sort of PCA shows that she needs to be there. We need to get her now before jumping up and not to do athletic again and just think to train. And that's where our heart lies as well. She's actually absolutely loved to train. And she's really happy with what we're doing. And hopefully if you more weeks time we get that her car. You You You You You
