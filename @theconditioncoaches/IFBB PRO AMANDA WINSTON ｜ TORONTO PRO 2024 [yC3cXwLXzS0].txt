2 days 3 days Meep! Okay, okay. I'm leaving. Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! Meep! We are at the supermarket and first things first. I have all fritters to support and so that is all see mainly from mine. Getting on the food in many for this few days and a little bit of the carbub in there. Some nice treats for the carbub. I found Camel chopped it where it's kates. What else was that? Honey. I think we've actually got much. Right. Oats. Sticky rice, oats. Nothing so different. No, it's time. Peanut butter. I've found stuff. We really found some raisins. Raisins. Raisins are my favorite. What in the speed you are? I'm trying to find raisins but it's shattered by delicious species. Here we go. Oh my God. What's that? Cinnamon is black. Oh my God. Sweet and smoky mix. Oh my God. These are delicious. I love those, bro. Right guys, it's Friday. The more filming yesterday, it was pretty much where people were bone-said as landed or sea-cate from low food, standard pump sash. Children pose so today is a bit more exciting to film me. The carbub. Well, I've got 60.1 kilos which is based on the base land and hold that for a while now. We are going to have a look at me here first in this lighting and the gym because the brim is really shitlighting. So I would have looked at me a little pose and practice. Go back and sat in. So to start with anyway before we start eating, we get some good fluids in. I'm going to get about six or seven liters in a day. What I've been doing is all of average in the last couple of days. But some electrolytes. I love this because I hate water. So black down flavor. It was helps get it down. From six o'clock need of course. Meal one is 85 grams of oats, 30 grams of raisins and 30 grams of nutlap. I tried to make my way into a pace. It was nice to see it. But it's worked. So having that one is meal one. The idea is basically to have a higher carb later than the eight, which is two days out. And then back off of what you were away. Just because there were two heavy carbs before the shirt. And expanded my waistline a little bit and holding a bit of water. So I worked better doing that. It had a load now. Back enough of day before. And we'll see how that goes. And I'll be able to sort of trial for next week. So we are mill two. Martin, my lovely husband who's also behind the camera. My cameraman is also a moisture. And we've got 200 grams of cooked weight rise. It was 75 rolls in it. And I'm watching him. It's 75. You set your five grams of chicken and a putter kilogram of pink salt in here. And he just done that well. Been doing work. And I'm watching chains all season. It's last time I was talking to the camera. There's the fact that we're sitting down doing chickens on the Friday. A lot more competitors. I do on the Friday so it's getting fruit of that. And Martin's cooking what I eat. What's going with that meal? Oh, what got it so we're going to go to the train after this. So we're getting two meals in and then going to go train. Obviously not a heavy session just a push from carbohydrates to a run based on the in. Basically do a little bit of a push. Is it pushed today? And it's probably a nice little push session. It always went fucking doubt as well as does. You've been through the bathroom. And my person has been a bit of a good moods. And we are going to team the four seasons. So I put it there and then we're going to say that. Little walk there to help digestion and get to know clearly that it's pretty work out. Some people have muffins. We have proofers. I don't like muffins. Not about life. I know that point but the crew doesn't sit as well. Yeah. We do what works. So in joy babe. What are you doing bro? How many of them look? So we're going to go work out. And this is the pre-work out muffins. But it's 11 muffins. I think it's going to be a back. Or a good eat. What is your decision decisions? That a little scared. So you're going to do whatever you want. Yeah. That's good. But I'm going to give you a second. But what do you do? But what do you do? Okay. What is your decision? Decisions. That looks good. The same as that. What is normal grace? Old fashioned day and that's all the best. Only a bit of my own best. I'll see you at Canada for a minute. See you in the back. Excuse me as well. Coming to a way from England. I think everyone is going to be a hot, so I just packed nothing. And that will help my friends. See you whereas my clothes. All right, make a decision. What do you think? Old fashioned and old crueler. Honey crueler. Honey crueler. I do love no fashion then. I'll say, how do you feel then? Honey crueler. Done. What? Oh my God, so moist. A mouse and a mouth. So good. Pretty well done. I'm hoping the veins come out when I train. Happy. Happy wifey. Almost full of a guilty. Like do I want it yet? Do I want a room thing? Nothing. No, I want it yet. No, that's not good to use. Such a heavy. Ah. OK, so we are here at a pure muscle for the final session and a little push session. We're actually going to film some bits of the day we train in, so let's go. OK, so that is the last train session done. Four times been back again Monday to repeat some calls. Ready for it, I can't in it's week. We are literally going to go back to the apartment. Get some freeze and then literally head off straight to registration. I secured a little pump. Finally. Have? Don't up pump. That was good. That was a good job. Yeah, that's a nice, great. Need some more. And we've got some good photos to. We found some sick lighting in the gym, so that's cool. So, an engine drink, an engine drink. There's on the floor. Whoa, shaker. Another bowl. Pre-bolls. Peel tablets. T-shirts, bikini, stuff to help keep bikinis on. There's one of those little cookies. Not Ky or the KYK, YK, YK. There's literally like pre-protein bars, protein, crisp, protein, cereal, protein bites, and any bites. So, we need to get as a wake and we blow out the heat at all. And for now, we're at the end. Meal fight. I had another meal before this, actually, which was actually rice cakes because of 13, we're easy to trans it. You're only 200 grams of rice with 35 grams of chicken. We're going to get that in. Just when it's registration and then after this, we're going to make a way back and do delicious. Delicious. What fries were these again? Season fries. I don't know how many he got before. I'm guessing most of these for you. I'm about to put away that many fries. Double. And I'm guessing that one is the cow other. I sure is. All right, ratings are 10. Hmm. It's a good burger. How about 10? Hmm. Second bite. Second bite. Situinkles? Okay so it is a day before the show we've come down to our new position room because there's a lot in here so much better. It was good to do like a little comparison as well from yesterday's checking me being completely flat as pancake 2 after having 600 grams of carb just a which did include a broken chin and a cookie half cookie it's gonna boot heavy do you all the reason? We actually are a little bit drier, a little bit tired so I'm a little bit full of little legs just gives like always a worry about my legs for love so if it's a quite balanced today it's gonna pull back and do better than the fat but Martin thinks she put in a bit of carbs and still just a helpfulness to work out a little bit of fat than what he intended and we were of judge each meal by me as well as today and that's it and small posing today not much we were resting what time today at 2 to 20 so we're making a way over to venue there for the tan then back in till for the evening I've also got Alex on today back home at PC Natures she has made improvements since the last show she dropped 1.5 kilos trying to put a little bit more and she's looking on the money today so excited to see how she gets on so we are doing some more filming in Alphabes and this is morning I have had two meals since then I had my oatmeal and then I had a steak and nut butter to praise and fats we are now getting meal free in before we go to tan tan's at 2 to 20 and it is now quarter one I'm currently talking to Alex at the same time Alex Lord's our coach he's back in the UK looking over my client Alex at a PC A for me she's just gone third at PC A first one not for some of Natures and his client has also moved to the second note second call out for the set of stage that he's over the moon too the communication and what are still going and I am now by the career rise this is good but after he cake cream or rice it's actually really really really nice and the career rise is really nice and I'm only getting into that any of us want to go right now time at 220 I've got a lot of them I have washed my hair but right myself with that and I've got some bread brin too as well from some of the needs to help the carbohydrates going down part is patient with a couple of hard days and I'm dropping on the floor standard me and I'm going to go now so I can eat this because I'm really hungry hey cool so there's now 228 you've come down to the pros and cons we claimed non-convenient so it was literally our room to look at me after the last meal today so that is it loading and done we did a big day essay back up to the only 200 grams of carbohydrates I'm full this is even so I know I'm full and that's the case now I'll dry it out over the night basically okay now we're going to bed a bit I'm going to go into bed at half a seat and get another free 30 because we got dry by over for my turn at 5 30 but at 45 minute drive so I'm going to get nice and early for the first time the time is told us to wash this layer off so I'm going to have a wash in the morning and rinse it off actually we've really nice and so it is not stink get first layer done that's 5 30 it's literally straight to her at 6 10 straight into makeup at 10 to 7 and then I think a bit of stage about it getting a long which obviously in UK times can fly by the head of what I'm saying so that's that if we don't have one of these warm film and quickly cool we go as well so we're trying captures and much to come so it does so it's been morning it's 10 past four in the morning we are up very very early for hands at 5 30 quick come down to look at me we're very forgetful what we've got the camera I forgot what I'm making also nothing will be that great of checking but it's been a pretty other light and light so if we want to look at basically to plan meal one and then we're going to head up for time at 5 30 straight into her at 10 past 6 and straight into makeup at 10 to 7 so you're putting up a scene much of that because he can't be with me but we will show you the calm up it looks a lot better than it's what I come out the oven I Love you Did I wait you see i didn't mean every day what I know is but I think it'll come a lot a little bit of their pump. Yeah, they're feeling fluid. Yeah, they're feeling fluid. Yeah. I don't want to be too fasting. I want to give mid-section small. We don't need to literally ride that because it's a bit more mushy, because it's trying to lick it up. I look a little quite with it. I don't think they're... I don't see them in the judgment panel. It's a different one. It's a bit fluid. Okay, so we're back up. So now we're going to put the half-mill one. We have made how much grams of carbs again. How much grams of carbs again on the middle one. Which is from a clearer item course of these. Roughly cakes that have been best, literally. It's like, is a jelly cake. How much of a by-beaven? About number. Photocombs in that bar. And then, the phyhane, very amazing. It's delicious meal. Some of the lecture lights, some pink socks, all they got in, and also some heat max. Obviously they're helped to keep the water going off. And then, using some a little bit of geotage fillet. So, it's going to be too dry. But it's going to be too hard either. It's trying to find out about it as again. And that's it. Not that I believe you're checking the blade to go for the day. It's going to be a long day to do pre-judging fast. Then we will stay for the finals of our free-art walk. And then obviously I'm probably all about maybe a 4-pin of the head on the day to go and half of the day is. And so, imagine that in between is that. So, it's not like, cakes from food. So, you can rice cakes, the basics, the way it's cakes, not bad. That'll drop it. And that's it. I'm going to eat. Let's go. It's like, there's always a big delicious. It's not delicious. Just moving. Just moving. I'm going to the eighth quarter 31. Yes, Amanda. You're supposed to drink a lot. Hold on a minute.

Alright, we will continue Seth. You have to turn up So that's a wrap. The morning show is done. Pre-degent dumb. So no I'm gonna smash a dumb note, so I can't really. I will be quite calm because I thought I'd get back out because it looks like I was definitely made talk 10 and talk 10 and talk about the back one and a little routine. The masses was pretty good. I think I've ever first or second judged him by the position of the Nazi and then when I came out to do the open we was in the whole other game and me and the goal and the masses. Be real. Me and the goal and the masses were both there for the novice one place that's like I don't know. I love the fifth or six of them. I'm happy. So happy because I think some of my own is like five or in here and there's twenty more girls and I just honestly thought it would be in a total again we'd be good and been up in mix but yeah being that first what I was main with it. So we had done for the day. I have a long day. We got the goal so one, the masses it would for you if I and my goal this year was the place in the top five and I came to fit in the open class. Super super happy on super close that's the one thing I wanted to know basically get back on a diet and ready but at a canteen they can be. I just want to say like volunteer so far today and so happy that once been here I've let him be put ice for this fun time to peek me and it shows it works so there's like he's now my peak master and that's it so that's it.
