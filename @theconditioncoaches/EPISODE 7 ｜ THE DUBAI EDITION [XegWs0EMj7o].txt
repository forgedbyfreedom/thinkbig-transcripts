I am thinking about something Unknown Alright, stop with your pussy single arm. No weight, like, cool downs, okay? This back, here, was not built. So we're doing this for 15 years, okay? Deadlift in Barbell Rowan, heavy fucking weight. For years, okay? I've now actually taken any deadlift in any bent over row in away from Lewis at the moment. We are now being very selective with the exercises that we are choosing to ensure that we create the physique that we want to see on stage, okay? So what we're doing is trying to work on that upper whip, so we'll be just picking movements that are going to work with his physique, okay? Stop looking at favorite guys on Instagram and copy in the movements there, they're in because they've probably got 10, 15 years experience on you. Start with a basic, start with a groundwork filled up foundation. Hey, hey, hey, hey, go, come on, come on, drive. High, high, high high, high, high, high, high. Help! Catch you on the next.

Come on, babe. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Lewis is five weeks out, Amanda's six. Both training with the same intensity. Same strength, all because the team is managed properly. We're able to carry out all of our sessions, 100%. We're not worrying about backing off. Use the lies in Rectown Reserve. We can hit every session still at 100%. And this managing that constantly going into the next few weeks is important. Just to make sure the body is going to be fresh in a position where they can both peak to perfection. Oh, yes. One more exercise with back. It's going to do a little bit of shrugs. We only recently just brought shrugs back into Lewis's plan. Just working a little bit of thickness through the upper back, free the run boys, free the traps. Just to release outline the detail in his physique. So, some of you are working on for the last five, six months. Finish that, come relax, slice them by, and then we're done. You got 15? Yeah. Ow. Ow. I just said no, I don't know how to put them in.

Two large fries. Feed him up. He's looking himself in America. He is so flat at the moment. Funny the meeting all week. But the answer to so many guys out there that were worried that they're feeling flat. They're feeling depleted. They're on prep. You're meant to get back free. You need to get flat. It's not about beautiful. You're going to be lower than the pumps. The pumps will go eventually. It's about going through the motions. Not getting caught up in your head thinking I should be fit in the pump. You need to get that mindset that you're doing all of this for a reason. Just go through the process every single day and you'll get to where you want to be. Work. Work done for the day. You just had a handful of clients checking in Saturdays and Sundays normally.
