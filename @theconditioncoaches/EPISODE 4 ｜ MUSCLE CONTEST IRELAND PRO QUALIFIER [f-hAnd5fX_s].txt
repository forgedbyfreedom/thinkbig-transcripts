Just had a quick look at it again. We woke up at four o'clock. See where I think sitting after going about about 11 hitting the final meal. Things were looking really good then. Once you were at four o'clock, got a meal in at that point. Because of that time period that we've had to fill Abby. I've had to be on it to try and make sure that we don't lose that fullness now. So that meal at four of those crucial. Just put another meal in now. Just about workout with the math rules, but it will be pretty much just rice cakes jam. No, but it's probably some fruit loafs like that. I get to go my cards in. Head to the venue. Get tanned. And then it should be on around about 11. Hopefully it will go to the point. Probably getting my family. He's the... He's that first. If they become too tasked in, then we'll switch to my first. I'm, um, yes, guys. What is good? Mine. How are you? How are you looking?

In Sweden, there was twenty four in the long class. So, ten, four, five, half-leaven. I reckon, but John and Levin faced twelve, yeah. And what was the white class?

We'll come back here for five o'clock. We're going to go supermarket back to the house. We're going to run into the finals. Hopefully. Push on that broguide. Back in the UK, I've got Nick doing mental zik in the... I'm taking classic. He's looking for the same. He just getting his tanneder now. I'm going to get a bit of a little process. He should be on stage for the pro-membersyke around about half-bours. So, managing that. And I've got Louie Davis who was about 24 hours. Less than 24 hours out of Nell from YouTube, who was reaching the local Mr. J.T. Which we will try into a 10 Sunday when we land back in the UK. We land about half-9, quarter-10. And then we got a fly to... Maybe a stick in the ceiling. I'm nervous. I've put a stick here. So, I can go with the fuck. I was looking right. What? I'm going to do that for some of my videos. I'm going to lie. I'm talking. I'm talking. I'm talking. I'm going to be on the top. I'm going to be on the top. I'm going to be on the top. Nick, we're on the top. I don't know how it's been. I'm going to be on the top. I can make sure you guys check in. Ow! Fuck! Fuck! Get in there. I look fucking crazy. Happy. You have it. Yes. When you hit that red double, you have to make sure your hamstrings are in the top of the ceiling. Make sure you don't mess with the difference. We are on. We. I can't even act. Close. I'm sure you don't mess with us. I... I... No. This is crazy. You better. You're going to be better? Yeah. I'm going to move forward. Woo! I'm going to shut down. I'm not. I'm going to move forward. Yeah. Okay. I'll probably do just a little bit of rice cakes in jam and nothing crazy. Yeah. Yeah. You're on. You're on. You're on. You're on. You're on. You're on. You're back. Uh, concert all year round three. My man is just going for a little piss. He's going for a little harder. And the more put the title we did. The three judges. We headed back to the hotel. Look at that. I have been beaten. Put this man to bed. I have a no stop. I'm going to walk on the joy of full on. I don't want to walk. Keep him a muffin. Never a food. Man's happy. He's asking looking back to again though. Three three three judges. We left St. Louis stage. We want to keep that low. It's not about going away in just destroying it with burger or fries. for a ride somewhere. It's about maintaining that bringin' it presentation for the finals and making sure that we're gonna hopefully take that first place to hit the overall I think there's enough pro-killer. So it's been good to put experience and what we've done. We've got the exact same thing. You know, it's very important to give up the individual same thing, to throughout the whole prep. Don't start introducing new run-up things last minute. It's the last thing we want to do is for what the look. You know, your body's already used to process the same type of food. So I'm very important that we do the stuff that we've got the same shop. We're seeing what we've got. We're seeing everything. You know what I mean? So we're gonna keep that in sister's, so I flew, who? Game time. News in. Nick has just taken first place, or a complex classic. Man's a Z. So he is now going on to the overall, which should be about that many minutes time. So another good result for the day. Fingers crossed. We've taken overall there. We get the pro-killer here. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. For rough out some. For ya know folks, they start batting my bones. Wellient prints, by our own burning looks. I don't know if all three minutes left. Everybody wants me home. All raw! With we each stand somewhere, we can wear me blue, even those grey shadows and winning Yes Baby! How old! Kemmaxes! Classic käyttense. Run, Run, Run, recovery successist offJonas violin four people there ... five 7 in I learned done. Okay, so I really love that amazing took his class, class D, one point into the overall Unfortunately, over a birthday, we done our best, he looked absolutely insane, but class D guy was very very good. But please don't be afraid, I'm not sure he's shredded, a lot tissue, but yeah, no broguards Dave, and we don't stop. However, we do have a special guest. Mr Carlos. New, maybe bro. That was a real thrill. It's a thing you might as well, obviously I saw you after the pre-jocing our news, you have said, like, this could be on. And then we come back later. I appreciate you Conmer, and this is a lot of news. I love the British community. It's a good, it's a good body movement. It's a good move. It's what was it? Free weeks ago, four weeks ago. I can't believe it. I think it was three weeks. Re-sport for that. You need to know, you can speak in over there. Yeah, I don't know. I'm sure. But the moment is like, like, it's warm. Yeah, good morning, oh, it is about five. Something morning. Yeah, we just got head to the airport, drop the car off, jump on plane, land this sunset, nail it to maiden head for two roof show. Louis is competing there. He should be on stage probably around about our bus 11. Maybe 11 o'clock. We land at half past nine, so it's going to be very right. I've also got Nick, who won yesterday, and I'm going at the fair expo today. So I'm just going to split the him. I think it's in pictures and videos across the minute. My little job. See how he's looking, and rolling with that one. We'll give Louis his orders in a minute. We're going to give it air for about an hour, so I'm just going to make sure the guys have got their instructions for that period of time. And as soon as I land touch base, it'll go to him. We have just landed in the UK. It is 10 to 10. The two brochure starts in 10 minutes. We are in our 10 minutes away, so we're fucking going. So Louis is in classic, and he passes a few to start at 11. My sat nav just tell me who your maths tell me. His speed won't go in at me. This thing in his past 11 minutes. We will get there. But London traffic can push him on that. So, take a scratch. We're going to make it in time. Yeah. Man, I'm going to make it. I'm going to fucking make it. We'll stop on there. 20 past 11. Oh, absolutely fantastic. Just drive safe, right? I'm not going to put you on stage. I'm going to tell you now. What's the start of the classic, instead of 11 o'clock? Do you know what? I'm not sure. I've just put it here. I think it might be 11, 11, 15. So, I definitely think it would be here, bro. Are they doing guest spot in between body building and club? Yeah. Are they doing body building? Yeah, yeah. That's why they said the classic side I never thought. Bang. Yes. Yes. The traffic starts at 11 o'clock. Yeah, we can. Yeah. All right. See you in a minute. Do you know what I mean? Quick stop. Petrostation. I forgot how much just thing drinks. Fuel. We have 50 miles to go. We're starting miles less than the tank. So, we're still on schedule. The show for classic isn't how I started out. It was 11, because we got guest poses. So, we are on point. We're going to make you a 10 minutes to spare. So, fingers crossed. Yeah. I'm going to start on the end of the line. I'm going to leave. Who wins guys who wins? He's going to use your glasses or not only with the UK, but several I have been in. Let it start. Let it start. Let it start. We're all this brilliant idea. It's fine, kid. I'm going to buy some. You said you won't really go. I'm going to buy some. I'm going to buy some. I'm going to buy some. I'm going to buy some. I just want to give you a call. I'm going to give you a change. I'm going to buy some. I'm going to buy some. I'm going to buy some. Can you pay me a bit less of this?

She's the force we got together real winning team. We made it. We've got the job done. We got fast-paced in classic masks today. That's half of it. The best he's ever let. Um, condition with insane. We're going to go on to Spain next week. So we have a plan in place. We're going to go get the point. I'll probably have a chance. We're going to go. I've got Nick literally two or three hours from stage. In Manchester. Doing the sex with. Just sending free as final instructions. Hopefully take full first place as we can. The fingers. You have to put my plan for me. 24 or my favourite. I've got a little bar. Check this. Check it. Anyone that knows do we day be a snows? The man. Yeah, I'm a kick-up fucking man. Thank you, Calum.

Just eating chocolate. Just eating. Just eating from Manchester. Nick just got third in his class. I think. I've got a bit of a expo. Not the result we expect this from back. It's a little bit insane. Absolutely insane. You did back the back show. So you competed just a one. And then, a long day today, he looked absolutely insane from the pictures I've been saying in the videos. Just one of those things. I haven't seen any pictures yet. So when I do, I'll give him some feedback. It does. I think he can. Let me just give some feedback from some people who live there as well. Go from there. I'm going to have a chat with him. Probably tonight. Tomorrow. And so. So a game plan. For the way forward, whether we could do another show. Soon. Or we'd take a step back and plan something later on. Louis smashed it today. I'll be able to smash it yesterday. Nick smashed it yesterday. Nick got third today. Smash it. Cracking weekend. Absolutely buzzing. Every is killing it. Peace.
