Sneaky 4 hours? I'm hungry. How's my car? So, the showly morning, the new is just slept. Like a baby. It's good he's woke it up. Fucking bang on my neck. Literally. Fulness is there. Condition, dryness. Everything. And I know it's just going to get better as we go into the day. I've got probably about four, four and a half hours of the stage. He's a really good spot. I don't need to chase anything. We don't need to chuck a load of food and then fresh thing which is always a positive. I've probably just got one decent sized meal in. Faxing in the morning here. And then head to the venue. He's got his tan and then just chill. And then magic happened. We will see how the show goes. The show goes pre-judging fast and then back for the four and a half hours later on. Day. Same time. Cut the other venue. So we had a good day yesterday in Portugal. Maro. He won his class. And then went into the overall apparently what the school and had a really good show in the university. So it was told. Regional box ticked. Going to bring him to the UK next week for the British final. So we're talking about that one. Alex did fantastic in China as well. Second in his class. I think that was like 18 in the two on two class. Then he got moved into the overall. They do it really, really strange way. 10 competitors from the T1 to 10 competitors from the open. In City overall. Where he plays fifth. Which is fantastic. So the incredible result for him. He's going to be at the PCA British doing the pro show there. So he's bringing his weight back down. And now, check it in this morning. Pretty much just a kilo off where we are for baseline. So it should cruise in to that for next few days. And then we'll be ready to load again. Going into that show. So that being exciting. So you're absolutely happy. Can't wait to hear about the UK. See all those guys. And then the British will be ticked off. A few more shows left to go. So the last one of the years. Like for the same version. And then it's down. But now we focus on this man. So we're about an hour and a half from stage. So I'm going to go downstairs. Where everything's ready to go. Do it. Just put in a bag with some honey in now. Just a... So we're about an hour and a half from stage. Just a slightly quicker distance than it's going to. Everything's ready to go. Do it. Just put in a bag with some honey in now. Just a... I hope. Not fave the length when it comes to stage. A little bit of peak marks. I've given the fullness how to keep the water a bit. Go backstage, little bit chill. I'm going to pose in a couple of rounds just before we go back to the last response of our just proof from the movement. Because a little bit harder than we shot. I've got that since pretty well for it. So then going into that stage. I'm currently being banged when honey with him. I've got that breakfast. Let's get an ocean shot in the perfect spot. Dad excited. So... You're good. You isn't cause any injury. I gotta try and breathe and take an breathing. Thank you very much. I hope Irvis people respond. Go ahead and make some noise, fell asleep. My bottles will smunk and submerge. Oops. Mommy. Don't. They work down all day long. I've got a pretty good story to take us to your right, these in the Charles of Max, because they right there, in order to turn to your right. Order to turn to your right, in baseball, right in there.

Many Granpez represent our area. Privetate your mat, get the���bat pedal. for the name. No comparison. Some South American guy saw this not seen this. They've literally like, they didn't even look at him. They didn't even look at him. Free Judging done, that's did. Unfortunately, the same old story. New judges, it's an even taken single look at this. Port amount of stage, max, child, is in the line of the room. You can physically see the judges heads just looking at the complete opposite direction of where Lewis is. They don't even move their heads, they call them off stage. And then when they come to the callouts, they call people when, brought them to the front of the stage, put them back. Every single callout, no comparison, nothing very frustrating. Because Lewis is the best he's done. And he's beaten some of those guys are in the top six. And he looks better than those guys in the top six. This one it is. He's just going to head back and chill. And he's a burger. Lewis is just looking to the Holly. Oh, guys. What's up? Yeah, because they were looking at the night. Yeah, exactly. So it's new. But the way they did it so quickly, they weren't judging. It's not like Texas and Tampa, where they made it more work when all of the lines are different from social. It's shit. It's an absolute shit, you do. No one else, admit it, it's shit, you. God, it's not shipping. You can't wait for two sponsors this season. You, two week's poses. You've made some, you've made new people. You've made new people. You've made some plans. It's not a waste. The very thing is, it's been the best year so far. It's shit that you've gone from third quarter to then whatever this place is. But you know what that's going to be built in. I know that, but it's just fucking frustrating because you're standing next to those guys in the first school. Yeah. And I know I'm beaten something. Yeah, I'm not so exactly what everybody says. And that's what happens when they look for it. But Luke's think of everything that you've taught this year. I think that's it. I think that's it. I think that's it. It's something that she's going to be, I'll make you family fries. It's about, you know the big standard to go boxes, the big spare ones, it's that big. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. What do you think? Any recommendations for our guests? The bull's eye is my favorite. It's a bacon burger with cheese. It's got American and Swiss and then it's got an onion greener. I think that's the main. I think that's it. What's that? What? What's that? What's that? What's that? I'm still not happy. I always thought it's burger steak. So I'm not in steak. So it's panicakes, so. What's the story in this kid's mouth? Yeah. What's with two spoonfuls of steak? Sure. So that is America done for this year about the Lewis and me and the season done, dusted. Today they do his plant. Very disappointed. Not with the way the Lewis looked. He was his best. He's been all season. He's gone for him without going in. We were very, very much happy with the look. It's like a bigger, more conditioned. Hose him was better. The things that he was told to work on his presentation is posing. This was nail. It's hard to take when you everything into it going into a show with the results that we had earlier in the year. A few months ago, to then not even really be judged. That's all new set of ideas new judges. They've never seen Lewis before. They're all parley with everybody else. So shaking hands to talk with the Lewis. They're just acknowledged and moved on. When it comes to stage, the same happened. The judges had literally not moved away from a couple of the guys on the stage. He had a limb of the guys on the stage. He had limbions and didn't even look to the right of the stage. He was like, there was no comparisons. There was no moving around on the stage. It's just called names out. The first call out. There was no back and forth. It's frustrating. Very frustrating because Lewis has already been a couple of those guys this year. He's better now when he beat them before. One of those things, bad day at the office. Bad day at the office, but I'll do it for you for late, because it's a type of way from the family. He puts everything into this and just not to be recognised. His tough, tough, his tough, his tough, but this will hold him back. He'll be back. Big and better. Stronger. More shredded. And have a peace.
