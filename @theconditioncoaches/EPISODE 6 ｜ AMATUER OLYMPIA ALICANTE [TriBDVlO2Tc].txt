Coaches take them food on the goat. We're actually getting Roy's rapes easy to beat. When they're running, like it had with chicken. Even making our leg tumble for a few months. Also got some mints in there that are putting the rapes on. No excuse to make sure when we're flying around the world. Oh, come on, boy. Come on. Yo, it is episode six. We're here. We're in the world's largest apple. On a way to Alicante, it's the Amateur O. We have Louis Davis, Abbey Ola, T-C. Both in classic Louis Davis doing O-Classy and Masters. Abbey Ola is doing O-Classy. Louis Davis is number of the cast. Abbey Ola is the small one in. One of five point one. He has his cup is one of four point five. So when he has still the very careful today, just making sure that he's in nice and easy to land into the registration tomorrow morning, he will land early doors tomorrow. Get ready to get a session in the Titan's gym. Head to the apartment. So down, then we're going to have an all-one to fill and then it's shooting else on the day. So take it off. I think I have a little car for this morning. I just have a chicken and veggies as soon as I go. So I've traveled to the Amateur O-Classy. Then I had a car for the Amateur O-Classy. Then I just have to go there. One, two, three, four. I'll be happy. I'll be happy. After the PM, we can get ready to start the project. What does he want to see? Because the wrong thing won't come next. That's never been on stage before, yeah. I'm going to send that. Okay, it's like this morning really. This is an amazing night. Thank you for any time today. Yeah. We start close-warking tonight. Yes. Okay, we'll see that we are in the morning. Again, we're going to go on a trip tomorrow. I was in the front 30 years ago. I'm fully seeing that. I'm so mad. So mad. So mad. Oh, we can. Now, now we can. Now, now we can. Oh, we can. Now, now we can. Cool this is on the champion session. Two out to so far this year. We're moving the amyent. Make it a hat trick. Some it tells me yes. Jump in and go. There's shank in our seat. Oh my god. Okay. Where is our two? Hahahaha hahahaha. Come on. Take one before the moment. Thank you. Yeah, sure. We only have an option. If you're owned by the CHD of EXPERTS, you're equally smart. I'll do a call from Future- Three days time, in three days time, will we make it three out of three? Will I be going home that I'm a trainer of the champion? Some thinking my heart said yes, however the mind knows this with the mind does. Play out of story in your head of eventualities, but we're locked into the process. It's got to go again the best we've locked. So what will be? Learn to walk by faith and not by sight. I'm getting bit and head to toe in Muzzies. So at one moment my gut is humble about first day in Spain. Seeing Louis at Titans, putting for a quick session, pull session, nothing serious. Just moving the blood around, moving the food around, putting in a position where he can start his load. Effectively, okay, we're under the cap. So we've got a good amount of carbs going into night registration. The him is two o'clock tomorrow. Abbey Ola is getting closer to his cap. He's 105.8 this evening, which is good way for him. His caps, 104.5. That's got to be made by tomorrow morning about 10 o'clock. Probably about 11 o'clock by the time he lands and gets to the venue. We're going to head off early. We'll meet him at the venue. Then go to Titans again. But him for a session. See where we are. Plan the food in because we've actually got an extra day load in this tunnel around rather than when in Ireland. We only have a very short period of time. So it's going to be interesting to see what we can do as he can that time period. Then go back to the apartment, catch up the Louis. Go to Titans with him and then go to the registration and then to Titans with him. See how we can move with him. So it should be a good day tomorrow. Saturday the day of chicken eating and Sunday is show day. Tonight, climb work early night. Up in the morning and get going. Your guys, it's Friday morning. We're here at BV Space's registration day. Just waiting on Abbey. Let's see a ride. You've just got off the plane. You went to bed under the cat. So he's just been sitting on the wall through the plane journey. Make it here. It should make way absolutely fine. And I can feed him. I thought it's actually in your sleep. We'll leave he. I'm not sure if we're in full session. Just move some blood around. Just put me in a position where he can then start his load. As he has done, he's a very important man. I'll be out of his bed. He's coming. I can see the man. He's got a hill. He's got a lot of his. We're in a position now where I need to see this man. Yes, yes, yes. I get some food in and make it. Yeah, listen. I haven't eaten in the while. I was a foot. I was a foot like that. I'm full of energy. This is Johnny. This is my boy. Yeah. He's going to show on us around. And see you. So what's going to be a hell? Just stay up there. We're going to get a way in. And then it's going to be a fucking food. I've been looking forward to this. Even oats. Anything right now. I'll make sure I have all the good stuff. So all of this stuff. Yeah. Thank you. Hey, buddy. You're hungry for some. Hey, you're hungry for some. Hey, you're hungry.

Apple-Moddy fun. All my cigarettes covered. Even now. Okay, just for the boy here great. Just take on the guys. As we continue the process, tomorrow we have full rest day. Okay, so it's the last sleeping in a zoom round of poses. It's like 9 or 7. It's Sunday. They're not going to be able to score a score. It's not going to be a pretty problem. I'm going to try to do it. We've gone down a little bit. So we just have to manipulate everything. So make sure we're at a level for that time frame. It's like you're too old.
