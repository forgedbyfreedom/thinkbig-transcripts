So first stop hit this gym, it's fucking epic, a well-own gym, there was no music but it's full of hoist stuff which is incredible, brand new kit, crazy crazy good gym. Last session with Jordan, just moved some blood around and then climbed the last three meals and we're good together. and some guys right three soccer gym Victor Hey I'm going to go.

We just figured out, so we had an iPhone on the mission to find some Skales. Fels of Skales, but then to the strat, there's my close shot bit. I did buy for the mantis, I think I'd found a little bit. What made me laugh to Jordan this evening? We have a gun as a breast of us, we've done in the past, with this load. What we're trying to achieve is real crystalline us, and we're feeling that from both shows, has given us enough data to basically put this final look together, which in my opinion is going to be the best look. So, that is obviously a new attempt in fantastic at the moment. I am actually wiped out of the net once I won the AN, and I still have seven check-ins left to do, and then I've hit the sack, ready to come to run. I'm just one of my normal first known interest rates, getting my team outside. I just rose, please, put it back. Let it not even over, it's on you for the time.
