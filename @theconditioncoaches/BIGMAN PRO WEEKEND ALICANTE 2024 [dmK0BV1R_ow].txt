Thank you, Steven. So that is it. Session wrapped up Maro. I'm just joined us all the way from Portugal. Just done rounds with a guy here and that is fantastic. I'm happy to be here. I believe everybody is very, very good spot. It's Thursday. This is something to Sunday. But from what I'm seeing, everybody is at their best this point. Really is the everybody in the position where they don't need a sandwich feed. And they don't need a sandwich dry enough. So it's almost just like cruising into their show. From the very easy, easy to control with meal to meal. Across the next three days and it's just landing it on the day. I'm very excited. I've literally two scums all the way through. It all feels like a big positive sign. What do you guys are happy? They're feeling at their best feed over done. You know, they're looking at the best they've done. And definitely we can ask this. It's a good to hear. But I look like that. There you two, Alacampty Cup, a striding morning. Guys, I've got a meal in. I don't look at them this morning. I'm running a very, very good position. We sort of semi-loaded yesterday just because we know the show is going to be late on Sunday night. It's actually shifted even later. They're going to probably have 910 o'clock at night. I do. But we sort of plan for it anyway. So it's not a problem. We're going to go in. They will have their final session now. Just move some blood around the upper, take a look and then plan the rest of the day. And we're going to go to some meals. We'll have a couple of meals now. So we know where we are. It's just then stoop in the hammock. I need now for the rest of the day. So we'll see you there. Me and Alacampty Cup session in last night. We're having a train. A little bit of dogs. I'm actually going to go back and train at the things that we've said. But we're going to go back and train. We're going to go back and train. And that is it. We've done it. It's done it. It's final session of the 2024 season for Mark and Lewis. Had a good look. Post post workout. I'm so tired. So loads of looking fantastic. Dryer filler. Both very happy with the position we're in with a couple of meals in. And it's all going to plan. We're going to go back. Lewis will be able to set out. Mark's out. You can hear rivals. Mark and Terry have just arrived. So we'll catch up with them. We'll catch you later. Have you done the weekend with them? Alacampty Cup. We're going to be on the right hand. We're going to go back. We're going to go back. We're going to go back. We're going to go back. What are you guys? We are back again at the train. We're going to go back. We're going back back. We're going back. We're going to be on until about half past nine. Possibly teleclock tomorrow night. The game plan is to pretty much shift. Everything. everything, a few hours back, so meals are late and they go to bed late, wake up late, it's tomorrow and it just shifts that timeline which unfolds in half a day with the show will be in later. We've come here just because we've got the same light, Abba Al-Qamaro, Lewis and Mark, all fasted, first of the morning. I can plan out today, the meal, two meals at a time will then come back here, rinse and repeat. Everybody's at different places, everybody's got different protocols, we have a forward, and it's something that we have to manage literally just as a point of just seeing how the body responds. meal, pamele and pimele were warm and a little bit in it and the other good bits. So we're going to have that now and we'll set everybody up for that first meal and then Monica has either come into us or we're going to have massage, myor is not registration, we've then got athletes meet for athletes meet at 4 o'clock, they planned out so we catch a bed all the time. Yes guys we're here at VV spaces. We have some help stumbled across a rest-living. Big man is setting up, and it's probably a bit of a start in the end. So we see how on time that will be. Everyone's on point, everyone's really, really much in an excellent position where we're just literally just taking it meal when we all... Everyone's getting dry and we'll get in there. So we'll be Friday to where we're running the ring. But that was good dry and it's getting very exciting. We are all about 30 hours up from here. It's going to be happier. Yeah, because everybody's out in the reception area. It's probably the most happiest scene a lot of Hollywood in the long-term. There's 26 open guys. There is actually more open guys in the community. I've showed some of the show tomorrow. Everybody's in a good spirit, everybody's in the same of the future, everybody's in a real good vibe. So looking forward to it. It's going to be a good backstage and a kind of way to start. See how I've been going to make those. Okay, he's long-term so we're going to share with you all. He's going to take that into that circle. Okay, looking forward to putting on a very interesting show tomorrow. Thank you, Martin. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. We're going to get out for no-no evening when I'm smart choice. I'm from the UK also. So it's a fun call that's in the little community with me, supporting NWP, but out here because we're about you and us. We're able to organise this. It wouldn't be a show basically. So this is my first show. Definitely improved on each show. So hopefully we'll get good time on stage. We'll be rest of the careers. Thank you. And I'll show to the rest. Thank you, thank you Martin. Lloyds. Good evening. Very excited to be here. This was actually my birthday view of years ago. I haven't improved massively since then. So I want to say thank you to a million everybody. Put on such an amazing event. Madison, all the judges and the IFBB because without them we wouldn't be here today. And I am very excited to showcase what I bring it tomorrow. And that's everybody wants to jump up on stage and do a preview night. Or you can wait for tomorrow. Thank you very much. Thank you. Yes guys, so we're here, we are back stage. A VB space is it is show today. First up, we have obviously, it's the region, it's the pro qualifier. Maro is pretty much ready to rock. He is the best ever. Maro said to him, when we come off stage in Romania, it was the best and he said, he can't get no better. He said, he can't get no better. I think we've troubled it and it does look really, really good. It's a good way to finish the season. We won't actually do this show in after Romania and the excitement. I think he was just buzzing to get back up on stage. And now it's time to finish the season in style. Very happy, Maro is happy. We should see what happens on stage now. We should be a couple hours, but it looks there now. We just hold it and it's good to go. We're on the boys this morning, early doors, when the Titans seem like they're set for their first couple of meals. Whilst I'm here, and then as soon as Maro is finished, I'll be running back home to check on them. And then there will be a late tonight, so they're just going to be sleeping and eating for the minutes. So, all is good. Like we do before, you know, right, just make sure this is good. Top yourself up, three, four rice cakes. Yeah, everything's there. Everything's there. Everything's there. There's nothing left. Like even when you sometimes do that, and you get a little bit here on this one, just everything's like home dry. And because you're posing better with that rear last bread, as well as holding it and nothing is spuckin' perfect. Absolutely perfect. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yes, what do you think? Writing books here in FAA' That's all we do. We don't expect four ice-creams to come. I think about five minutes, 60 minutes. Right? So we're doing a lot of work. So with the event, but I'm going to do some drives to the van to share. Everyone thinks it's going to be a lot less. So, okay, it's not worth going to do some straight-line but I must have to show a good book. It's where a lot of people are wrong. And they keep feeding themselves before they go on stage. So they're working. Right, so they want to get the money to go on a get-a. Honey, everything in. You know, we're in the Parvintz decision. But we're doing a track in the front of the van. We're doing a track in the front of the van. Well, what we do is we have to feel muscle left. So we're going to take the car. Oh, no, that's water. Is that water? Hello, hello, hello, hello!

So, offstage, Maro so close in the overall, the one is class out of nine. I think it's nine in the class in Heavyweight. Really good lineup that we've really expected and some good guys out of Maro dominated the heavy season then went into the overall very close between the Heavyweight, like the Super 4 rounds, 4 full solid rounds and Maro left to Maro that's sentenced to the end. So heart rate went up a little bit and unfortunately they give it to the Super, they do have the opportunity to have a super happy, thank you for everything. We're in turn to the right. Thank you. Maro, thank you very much. Maro, close seven. What if it be nine? Yes, three, three. Can I hear it? One, six, ten. In the air, in the air, all that. Class, face to back. The winner. Class for a gentleman. Face to back. The dollar pose. Relax. Two, seven, six. One, six, five, six, seven, five. Tristan, in the side. Face to back. Okay, gentlemen, double-bice. Class, one, eight, you want six, ten, three, spread out. Four, spread out. Double-bice. Class for a gentleman. Face to back. Six, six, three, spread out. Yes, guys, so this is the official wrap-up from Spain. It was a very late night. We finished. We got out of half-ass one. It was a great show from both Mark and Lewis. Both, incredible package. Maro was there. He actually won the heavy weights and was that close in the overall for the pro card. Show of the year for Lewis, the last show of the year for Mark. Both had incredible seasons and I'm very excited for both in 2025. Plans will be putting place. We'll get them working and we'll be showing up for sure. A few different shows picked out probably for Lewis. Just trying different avenues, different countries. We'll catch you then. This was probably the last show of 2024. But plenty more to come in 2025. Subscribe.
