Yes guys, welcome back to the YouTube we are here at Grittness. Okay it is show we can't is the Europe approach and the MPC European Pro Qualifier. We have a number of athletes from the team from season. I'm here currently with Lewis, really a sport open pro and then we've got that really really like every week pro amateur, for his pro part we've got Matthew Sulek, open heavyweight amateur goes there's pro part. We're going to be catching up with Cala as well at some point. He really is open men's to seek, he's going for his pro part as well. We're very eventful. We came for the guys, Amanda is landing tomorrow. She's coming up with Cardi who's a physique pro, who's competing on Saturday and then we have two of her bikini pro competing on the Sunday. We're here for the guys final contestant. Okay, we just teamed up just to run through some exercises, move the food around, they've all started carburetor, didn't yesterday, so today it's just a start to reuse, that's the development of the pro session we say. I'll take a look at them upstairs and here with this much of open free we've got Crackin, heavy and beer as well, which we're getting some good shots at later. closer up in the water aswell as well. I'm walking only the back藏 pool and I'm going focus on the Copiat� here from the league.ễn Dar's busy following ribs And if I go up with you need to, I can go hard and out. So I'm just so much good, still good. Yeah, now I'm pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty good. I think there's the beach in it. I'm really happy to let me know. Because how many meals now have you got? I have one in two meals. Yeah. So yeah. I can still push good amount of food in now today. And tomorrow we pull out 11 steps. Even an athlete. Yeah, even pushing the water in the back of the little way. Or just see where we're saying, you know, you're like a sponge now. You know, everything's just in the sun again. So if you're depleted yourself and out of the glycogen storage, you can be like, the feel we feel we feel makes it. So it's going to work really well. Get that meal in it. And then like, I'm going to even give you another meal. So it's just like spacing out. So like, if you want, you may not be too, I'll work very good. Or you can go. Thanks. Really. Yeah. Honestly, really good. Really good. But yeah. I'm all the happy where we are. And food is really good. Yeah. And that's what you can do as an athlete. It's a groove. You know, you're better already. And it's just going to over 40 hours. So you can try a little bit. You know, this is where the fuck really happens. We keep pushing. I think like I said, if you have your meal now, and then I'll work out what we're going to do for the rest of the meal. We're going to do the back of the apartment. And then set the meals up in that job. And then you can go to the press. And then I'll come in. Come and get you a work. And get the image made up. You're going to be back. Whatever. Work out. But yeah. Keep doing what you do. This is marketing. Thank you. Yeah Good night. Can you put any more muscle in your road. Can we breathe? Yeah. It's not her job. What's it like now? Is it a little late on a day? Well, the strives and you've got to be a police man. Yeah, yeah. But that was just drier than it was. Yeah, it was. No, but I'm drier. It's drier than it is. It's a big team. Yeah, it's not really. It's checklists. With me, I'll say, see what the bubbles are going to be. Yeah, no, no. Yeah, sweet. Everybody's on. I'm happy. Everybody's fucking happy. Everybody's on. I'm fucking happy. This is very good. I, as a coach. Everyone's on the most stressful and in the weekend. There is zero stress when we all go to the place. Just brings a buzz. We can't cry. We're just sitting for the amateur. We're looking at just thunder for eight hours. And for the pros, probably about 52, 53 hours. I'd be in a position like this when we're not chasing anything. Everything is so easily manipulated at this point. With carb sodium, water, little bit of direct here and there. No, it's the puller that I'm pushing. You can do it this way, that will make a physique. Because everybody's in that prime position now. It's so easy. So, when they're going to show. What we got to do is keep repeating what we did. Let's go back to come Winston. I see a struggle there. I used to be a tiny. It's a strange, everybody. I'm going to grab to create a rise. It's a new cause of funny. And then we'll add some blueberries a little bit of away. Last day of sort of pushing carbs quite heavily. And then tomorrow we could just back a little bit. Let the GI stress subside. And then ready. A Saturday, game day. How'd you let any of your sidechairs in the test? Yeah, you only proved that that's not popular. Oh, it's going to be good. Let's go on your back. Then what's your last show? The last show. The warmest Texas. Was it two weeks ago? No, it was longer than that one there. Who was four? Who was four? Who was four twice a size? So for all the changes. This would take a mat in for you. So we are back at the Airbnb. The boys are coming at Camp Winston. So it's now coming. Extremely happy seeing the guys after their final session. Everybody has some form of lowly in yesterday. Some heavy lenders. Today is pretty much day to one or two guys. We'll push a little bit more of a rest of it tomorrow. Everybody's on. Everybody's happy. I am stress free. Just really, really excited to see what's going to happen on Saturday. I'm sorry. My favorite part is for us. The guys that have been there. The inside of the flush. Three Monica has kindly come here to work on all the guys. Rather than us having to go into the Vigilia. The CS. She's been able to come here. She's been fantastic. She's now working on Matthew. She's not Lewis. She's got Danny and then Bilius. So she's back to the back. It's all going to help because they're going to feel comfortable. But flush in three. They're going to sleep well tonight. Wake up on the money is normal. And then pretty much tomorrow will be just a balance in act for everybody. And then Saturday is game day. The amateur should be on the run about midday. Caled the men's seat boy. He should be on maybe one half oneish. And then Lewis, the pro show of Bilius. Five PM with them think going on fast. And then they should be last. So it could be a pretty late one on Saturday. But it kind of late. Okay. So we'll catch later. Lewis is fucking sure that. I'm pretty sure I'll check in. And the trial gets each night. So they haven't caught a time. habil Efendimiz. So you smell party cold. I want to do somekindles. Cause I think. Superb those now. Yeah. You can see that. Yeah. Woo. Oh. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. That was awesome they to Cam Winston. It is. So, do 1.5 gram? 1.5 for centros. Yeah, thank you. So, he has... Matthews up, move it up, both for looking, freaking awesome. Matthew had six hours sleep, which, as of yesterday, he got four. Before that, it was probably getting about two or three hours, and night. He's not actually really well. He's actually... heavier than what he was for the regional, but he's fuller with more condition, which just... is that the perfect spot to be... again, being where we are now, you've been able to push a little bit more aggressively with fullness, and shows for it as physique, as legs are... in a much more better position now, than they were for the regional, and they were a phenomenal analyst, thinking better now. Moodies, a couple of pounds, a lighter than where we were at this point for the regional. He's... conditioned, he's fuller again. When you're in a position where there's more conditioning coming through, you can push a little bit more and be a little bit more aggressive with the fullness, which then pushes more conditioning through, because... tissue is pushing through to the skin, so it brings our illusion here in more... even better conditions, which is fantastic. It's just set there, but for the first couple of years of the day, just literally just posing every hour after every meal, see how they respond, the just animals needed. Lewis is still sleeping. He will probably wake in the next few days. 45 minutes. Do the same thing. Have a look. Lewis is looking incredibly dry. All the guys had a full lymphatic flush through from Monarch here, today they were pretty creepy, following that Lewis was like... the dry stuff they've ever seen in the night, even what's looking like is show day, condition last night. So today's going to be pretty wild, mubless. This is about our 16th show, 15th, 16th show together. We were doing the mass yesterday, and by like... I can beat Lewis and my eyes because I'm pretty much... I'm probably confident in that as well. It's so exciting to see how he's looking this morning. We've got a good map of how that's going to pan out of the day for him. He's going to be on a 5pm, which is a first of this season. He's not been in on an evening show for a long time. This is back in Europe a couple of years ago. So it's going to be interesting how that pans out, how the look looks. I know it's just going to get better through the day tomorrow. So... Because I have really seen this, he's not messaged me yet. Kind of silly thing, because he's still... He's a late-rise or anyway. So I'll get them through and sort them out. We have Andrew doing the PSA show on Sunday, some way for him to check in. And Amanda is joining us today. She should be up here a little bit, they're all tough to lean. She's got the carli, he's doing the same throw and the two would have to be a bikini pro on Sunday. So... That's me. Yeah, where are we? I'm caught on there. You bet fresh. Everybody's on. Lewis is now alive in Kithyan. Just welcome up even more. What's sticking in him. Minus, the green heat. Both of them really good lighted. He's looking... ...dry like... ...in dron. Honours really good for us. I was leaving loud through this crowd, but we're throwing a sauce-based pretty well with him. Pretty much just a loud coasted in Mount Heese. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you. Thank you. I'll stay here. I'll stay here. I'll stay here. Everything's up. Still alive. Please, place it. It is slightly better than the Texas drone. It comes off in top four, fourth place, ...whacing in Texas. So this update that you're looking at right here was the most recent one. It's two days old. It's up his back. He looks really impressive here. My name comes in another update. Four days ago. But I wanted to show you guys that I felt really, really, really, ...arrily was the level of your nasty, ...lether day that he's displaying in this. You can tell he's in the racing condition. And I think as you watch this video, ...who's free. We'll go back in a really Markers update. Well, I said about really, ...maniacally this could be a very condition-focused competition. I've been how I felt that William doesn't look super peeled in his updates. It's up there, it's like this from guys like Louis Bree. That made me think, William's condition is quite up to stuff here. I'm so much better. I'm so much better. I'm so much better. I'm so much better. Jowls again. Ah! I think he's not a level of perfecting fuck. I'm just not a level of pretty much fucked. It's not gonna end down. I'm trying to break into the wall. So we did the same year as the Sp�. This is plenty. I'm just getting harder, drier. How you're posing through the reef, as well through your armstring and the duck is much better. It's a really, really, really perfect way that you're holding it in and when you're up, you're not releasing your duck, that was in. Making it work really well. So that's what I'm doing. It's a good distance crazy. I thought I was just back to life from where it was this morning. I was just going to go back up again, which was good. There were three for the one I see. So, that's it. No, no. This way you show, because that's right. That way you can't put it on my side, but you're way round to me. What? You can't put it on my side. You're way round to me. What? You can't put it on my side. You can't put it on my side. You can't put it on my side. Here's where you're. Here's where you're. Who's pretty sick of that? I'm like, I'm like, I love my heart. I don't care. Yeah. Good night. This is about, come. To the back. Where is your seat? The counter. And one stage. It's just wacky. The dryer. Harder. Fullness is. You don't wait tomorrow. That didn't look so bad. It's not working. It's working. It's not working. Oh, John. I'm never gonna find those go open spots. Yeah. Yeah. Very happy. I don't know you don't like the way you look. I don't care about that. What's the deal then? You're always gonna... It's basically... In two hours time you could feel an acid. It's just... You're like a batch of ever-wise. So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it. So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it? So you've got to get it? Yeah, just... Yeah, just... Yeah. It's... When you come onto stage, you've got the line. So you just go off center line slightly. Yeah. And that's gonna show out your hit it. So you're here then you might be interested. Yeah. Because your mid-section looks better in that pose than trying to hit the dory. Yeah, the dory looks cool what I should say. Because it's... Because it's a new pose. I'm a bit like... You know what I mean? You know what I mean? The last thing I want to do is... And think it's a smooth transition around to... Yeah. So that's what you can practice maybe. You know, for future shows, a dory and one. Yeah, a good thing to do. Just a twist on that side chest as well. Like... Like... I've worked with shitloader on my mobile at E&R. Fucking twist. And you're like... More and more. I'm like... I'm trying. But like... It's the mobility. Yeah. Yeah. But think it's even in your court when you're doing this. You can see it. It's bringing that top line. What you're doing now is just getting that little bit more rotation around. Just talking about that. It's a bit... It makes you wear some smile because you're... Yeah, because I do do it. And then I film myself go. Yeah. Just like... Yeah. Just like that. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's... One point. Just keep doing what you do. Next year was normal. I started 40 years with that scum. Yeah. And then you know what happens from then? Me. So everything's just sucking. Yeah. You're waiting for this. Like this is pretty much where you're working when things take a good... Just getting it a lot of not freaky. Yeah. Like, literally, it's like, none of them have been painted bleeds. They go with thin box, solid tissue and leather. That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... That means... It's good. This is good. Detail for your hamstring and glutes. Yeah, glutes are still in out more. So that little crease underneath your glute. Before we are seeing when you're flat. It's now still in out nicely. You're getting dry through that area as well. So it's just like sealing to the skin. It's good. Everything's moving in the right direction. We're getting another big meal in. And then I can see you in person again. What I do is I'll... What time did you eat? Hey, that one. Look. Yeah, it's only been like one hour for you. So getting another meal in. Maybe in like 45 minutes. Yeah, he always takes me. Yeah, I'll get back and message you. But then what I do is I'll give you another meal to take with you. To the first. To the first. Registration. We're getting some fat out of the nose. Here you go. We finish it on. We'll be in the next. Yeah Beautiful I'm gonna catch it You're gonna pop it What's this guy? What's this guy? What's this guy? What's this guy? I'm gonna tell him what I can feel flat. I knew just had a layer of time to smooth everything out. So we're here at the venue, the soft silk boat's out. He's throw the Europa pro. Cool if I. No, less, the less. Really. Matthew. Here. Well, we're on Khaled's mainstay. Matthew's on his time. Matthew's on his time. Louis and Billy are sitting in. You're a good. Everybody's happy. Everybody's happy. Everybody's happy. Just a matter of just getting this out of the way and getting back to the Airbnb. It's just a bit of an end. It just got an edge as I'm praising. Detrain me in his end. It's about not that. Not too long before we go, minutes. So once I stand, everybody's dead. It's good. Said, I'm on a looking at everybody. We go back to, I've pretty much just assessed the last meal. Everybody's the best. We're waiting tomorrow at the money. Let's give it to girls. We'll catch you later. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. Check out his deck. We'll see. Look at this. I can't see that. You're a good one. You're good. You're a good man. You're a good man. You're a good man. You're a good man. You're a good man. you There you go. The Tard of Art. Lewis would have a rotation on, but they were doing this side. And I, you know, I grew up, like half. And I'm like Tisha. There is a school where... Absolutely. That's what we're doing. Więc, too. We showed the two losel n colour That's fine. Yes. What's going on? Very good for him. Yeah, I think we can keep pushing. Because you're not getting dry, you're not. He is, so I'm not. Mid-section's tight, so out here. Do you feel good when you pose like that? Yeah. He's arm. Yeah, so you're on 20 hours. Yeah, we got another whole day nearly. Yeah, but like I said, you're a rather push. Yeah. Push now. If you got any more meals prepared or is that the boys? No. But you feel the next meal? Yeah. Yeah. Well... Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Good. Good. Yeah. Yeah. We have visited many places that can come in from Europe. Yeah, really good. It's game day. So, is it right? Yep. Yes, yeah. I don't know. No. So I think it looks... It's Saturday morning after... Come with us and there's something called... Yeah. I'm one of the other people in the pro. Everybody is looking for a good person. Just taking a look at the first time this morning. Very, very happy. The other boys' aeropop are like four o'clock, so they'll be up and then seven bucks a bed. Lewis might just stay in bed for a bit. So I can now feed them some more food. It's top and up. We'll be on stage for five o'clock tonight. So it can be a pretty long day, but we're in the best position right. Now, a couple of decent sized meals in. We know that works well, and it literally just keeps them right in a solid position before we hit the stage. So, yeah, they look pretty crazy this morning. Dry. You know, that makes it lovely. It's such a... Lines in the air. Everyone, lines everywhere. Bubbles in line. Bubbles in the middle, so. And... The starting part. And... Yeah. I'm happy. I'm tired. We're doing this. We're doing the back. Back. We're off the bed. On the floor. When you're just trying to put your hand in the chair. There. That's it. Remember that. That's how you go. Have your house. Okay. Don't know. See that image. You need that block in the studio. That. Perfect. My bed has dry. It's fine. It's fine. That's what you'll stay in your bed. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. So Matthew is one meal in. He weighed the... What was your weight in the morning Matthew? What was your weight in the morning? What was your weight in the morning? Yeah. Not yet exactly the morning. Felling. Pretty big meal. Good night, Fled. And he's still not yet yet. And he's still not yet yet. And striated to fuck us. Yeah. Very happy. Moody. Next. Rotation over. Molly Bowdoin. Murphy Hussleuld A few days ago He sucked my hesitations. This is pretty cool. Good night. But you can also create some walls withagania. This doesn't work even without sun. But Is this a shade? Okay. This? Very beautiful. So everybody, well Matt and Moody have just had their second look after me at one. Both looking very, very good. Just literally planning that a couple of movements. Just sorted, the Vilius, just checked in. Andrew is doing a PTA show on the maro. Just checked in with him. Lewis is fed, watered, and the Vulture for the sleep. Everybody is good. We're going to head to the set of club. I've got two, I've got a shape, I've got a wash. And wake up. Head to the venue and a bit, guys got turned. Nine o'clock, guys. Nine-ish. The girls are pretty good. We can be a little bit flexible. And yeah, pretty much set of club there. It'll be on about 12. Amanda has Carly on today and a tilde on tomorrow. You can pretty much catch up with her a little bit later. And she'll keep you up for today. I think we're going to head.

So yeah, but now it's like I feel like I've got, so this was supposed to be my last year and I say it every year and it never happens and then I just feel like there's like unfinished business now and that I don't actually need to go right off of season and go back up to 80, do you or me and go back up to that 85 kilo, stay relative to condition and then get more condition and do you have to work as hard to get into condition? Yeah, yeah, so yeah, what should it be? It might not be the last year, but I said it was the last year. As we all know, like, everybody is one of those things I like, the more show you do about you get, everything I'm gonna show you and women's physique is that the condition is better and better I mean, hardly fade unless you're born as tired, obviously our body's not tired now, so she could and she really get tired and I know Kylie does, like, women in 2021 show her the show, show her the full show, our nose and she fucking at 90 by then and it is one of those things because it's like two, like six after a year, yeah, yeah, so possibly the anime for shows that begin in part of the year, yeah, yeah, a few together, European ones, yeah, and for like ideas, to get show, yeah, yeah, it's fine, and I had to, yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll be, I would like to go through her plan to do, all you go to the TV, now she's broke her eyes for two years, off, you need to earn your stripes and roll-y, as always say, you need to come back, show him moments to the same judges and keep fucking going, if you love it, then you'll keep going, and if not, you retire, but also, hate is it, she's now 40 free so she could do, you must as well, yeah, because they got mastered limpia at 25, so why not?

We came here. This is the second show this year. Last year, last week was her pro W. It was a pro W in bikini class. She got a pro car 2 years ago in wellness. She is downed by 40 pound of muscle. 40 pound. It was crazy. You are not feeling this warm. The group is still in full. Basically last week we were going to feed back. How to apply to go into this week. That is what we have done. We got a different tan. A little bit of a different approach. A little bit more fullness this week. I think it is really nice to have another panel of judges. I will see what she is going to do. Tell the how do you feel? Honestly. Really nice. It is very much happening this week. It is getting to show us well. It is not on the show. So we are honest. I feel really uneasy. I would lie last week. I cannot be back in my confidence. A lot. Although the feedback was mainly positive. It has got me feeling really uneasy for the show. I am hoping that we will be back. I am posing in a different way from last week to high scenarios of my physique. That is a week point for the bikini class. However, six days to change your posing is a lot. It is not a lot. It is a lot to see again. And not a lot of time to do it in. So if you are feeling a little bit uneasy for presentation. Why is on stage? Which is as bad as it can get for bikini. But I can only try and roll with it. I am just doing my best. And I hope that the 10% where I have got the posing right. What I have been practicing lately is the 10% that shows up on stage. See ya. We will see. Thank you. Not only that though. She has also had a lot of stress to speak in the industry. I am not just trying to say that I have seen. Can you see his stick? Wait, which one is there? I am going to throw it out. Don't. To Dean had a really bad car crash. It is always this. I am very stressed with them. We have been one week come back to meeting him. But they are still fucking here. So we are just on. And yeah. Please, though, it wasn't my fault. Dean is a very good driver. I have been in the car. I have been my convouch for that. And the guy came onto his side of her. I had a head on collision at 80 miles an hour. So it was a really big crash as well. Yeah, the external stress has been there. But she is still pushed for her to be here. And she is a little soldier. So let's see. Let's get him. It was a little stick. Anyway, that's it for now. Bye. We should have booked big swamps. We have booked all the same. We should have booked the tracks. We raise me and I will pass. We need a snap. We need jewelry. We can see a pump on. It is the largest serving can. Delk. This is new this. With a teeny mic rate, it's happy to be here before. Make sure you have it. We are actually in no habit. I'm a CB. People are going to go wrong. You can try to see too. I've got a couple of people. I want to see you. What did you say? No, I'm completely going to break my question. Well, I'm very good at it. So for a few shows now, I've had the feedback of my tan. Not looking quite right with my hair on stage. We've had a few times from different judges to be fair. But we're actually doing something about it because you've got it really. I've tried to wig once before and it didn't work. So we are currently topping up the tan because we've noticed everyone else is a little bit darker. And the protocol this time has been a lot of base coats. So mixing a warm base coat and an ultra dark base coat. Doing layer upon layer upon layer upon layer over the course of like two, three nights before the show. Dean has been my pro tan man and a man with the steady hand or not so steady hand was pouring the two mixes together. And we're just going to do another layer because I'm a little light. But this keeps the tan really warm. Instead of going that sort of dusky gold color I've appeared on stage for the past couple shows, which my hair kind of looks a bit blonde under the light as you lose the red headness. So I just looked merged. So this should help stop that dirty weird color blend. So wish us luck. Oh, right. Just totally never see on it. Terrible. And I thought one that wasn't sealed in there as well. So I don't know why I'm just saying that it's easier. I'm just going to put it in the back. I'm just going to put it in the back. I'm just going to put a little bit of light on the back. I'm going to turn that thing like a mood so she's going to go back. Maybe I should put my bright mood to be better and I think going on that back layer do it. I'm not pushing them back. And I'm just going to bring this to spin around. I think that's actually a good idea. I think that's actually a good idea. It's super good to be with this system and a good mood. I'm very short. And that's actually a good idea. I'm going to put it in the back. Let's do it now. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Place your chocolate aside. Please make sure we're at an expert level. Maybe there is one more... � bebeli Don't be afraid One thirty nine to one thirty five switch things And that is a Europe. I think we're going to be able to do it. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Music And that is a Europe. Let me a bit. I'm not leaving. She's leaving inside again. Been a very busy weekend. I think Europe is a complete job done. PCA done to him. PCA done. So I had the new one guy in PCA. Andrew, fantastic. He got first and got a short. Just missed out on the overall. Which is, you know, as always. He had fantastic real joy of people down to the British for him. And I'm going to pass the mic over to... Yeah, so we was at a short free, joyous feedbacks. And it's so interesting to see that every single chance has a different view. It's hard to say. Because Tyler basically said, not anything we thought. Nothing about a peak, nothing about foreigners. Nothing about communication. It was like upper outlook loop in these more development. Which I suppose would then match her level loop. Didn't say that she needs to downsize her, so it's because she has told last week. And it's these work on a front post. So get that more hourglass shape. She's going to show it around, but she doesn't like to do, because she has a wider way to try to, you know. Trying to do what's best for your physique sometimes. Then shoot soon of foot because then just don't bring in the shape they want to see. If you haven't got that shape then how would you post, so it's a case of this twisting around. And try and see what they next time do it and see if they don't like it. Then JP said that she turned around to the back and said, whoa, glutes. He said, if her didn't wellness natural next year, rather than wellness bikini, because wellness for natural would be more her size, because the natural bikini, I like tiny that were children he said. That was because like view. Then he spoke to Javier and he said she needs more upper outlook loops to go in line with the quad and to put her feet in more so her quad speed can't see from behind. And then he basically said it's the luck of the door too, because I could tell you this. And then you could tell another show and everyone looks different. And it's who you're standing next to and who the judges are and the day the panel changes. And we all know that I'm pretty, that was cool. So anyway, we didn't, did I already say what happens earlier? Yeah, yeah. Yes, we've worked well placing and then I've had a free glints at PCA today, so that also had. Joe on first, he was the first time as first on stage. If he spoke for the invites to the British out with six or seven, come and what he said. And then we had, we had Naomi and Sarah in the same category, bikini trains, so. Naomi was fourth for the invite to the British and we got a second place for Sarah with an invited British. And that is, everyone done for the weekend. And my brain's fried. Over and out. Yeah, the Martin final, bye bye. Bye bye. Next time, we're going to the next time. We're their name. Yeah, probably the British. Yeah, probably the British. Film one nice, next you, too. Next you, who, for now. Bye.
