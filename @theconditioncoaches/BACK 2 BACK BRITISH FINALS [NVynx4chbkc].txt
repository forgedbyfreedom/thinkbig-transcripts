You're just going to have a vaccination. I was probably going to have a vaccination. I've already got about five minutes to the guys on stage. I'm going to be so excited to see some of that happening. So apparently a lot of good players come over. Wow. So we're just going to see what happens. See what happens. They unfold. Everybody's on the money. They've done everything. They can't. Can't see. You're a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, don't. No. Double mindset. Black Spray. Face front, overhand of the envelopes, and your favorite most muscular. Back in German, you can follow up. Please, long give your next competitor one zero wave for side coin. Blacks, quarter turn to the right. Face the back. Double bicep. Relax. Quarter turn to the right. Face front. Back in German, you can exit. All right, Juggie, tell you how many back you reached. That's our 35 and 40-light up. That's our boys' bicep. Juggie, face the back. Double bicep. Face front. Overhand of the envelopes. Your favorite classic for Zipos. Gentlemen, back you very much. That is pre-juggie wrapped up. So, Baron, like heavy. Just hiding a bit of in today and there were some freaks in that lineup. Jesus Christ. A lot of guys with hollow legs. Very very good standing in light heavy. So, Baron, unfortunately, didn't make the top five. Looking at probably six places in that lineup. It was ten in his lineup. Maro, heavy weight. Fantastic lineup again. We're looking at potentially second. Good squeeze first, maybe. It was like close. The column line is in that line. He's looking very, very good, very sharp. So, it's a matter of just seeing what they're just saying at the finals. Shortly, we're probably about an hour away from that. And then, ReStavis, fantastic. Took me master's classic, plus 40, class. We have a game plan moving forward to him. Today was a bit of a warm-up interview. We've worked together for such a short period of time. We now are in in to Romania. Okay, four weeks later, I'm pro-baller by Hugo for it. There's a bit of a card. We're in to see what the result is from Maro. If it doesn't come to you today, let me go again in two weeks. Germany. And Darren is on his way back to the apartment, because he is on stage tomorrow now of the PCA Finals. We've catch up in a bit, post-finals. And we'll go for that. This is how legends are made. Please welcome your next guest. See, Mooru, Mooru, move ahead. Third place fellow, Pittsburgh sent it to one, e-eleven. Brother Slav, cost it enough. That's self-remeral goes to your heavyweight runner-up competitor, one, zero-seven, Mooru, move ahead to the body building overall. Your heavyweight chat, Kielo, bye. Two rows of British finals. I'm sweet. We are done to the day here in Manchester. Smudge on the cart head down to Talford. Good day. It was good finals, Maro ended up with second place in the heavyweight. Fantastic note, Kielo. A little bit sharper again. The finals, however, they obviously didn't judge. There was no good parisans running in. So it was just a good to see how well he proved again from last week's. That came in the quarter-ghosts. Yeah. Please, with everything today, everything's gone to, well, part of it obviously not taking past places, but everybody was happy with their results. Everybody looked fantastic. Now on the TCA bridge, we'll see you. Help it. That's it. Nice. Nice bro. Nice bro. I'm going to play some of them. Fullness tonight, and then back off tomorrow, we'll be trying to keep showday as obvious as possible. I'll be able to do it. Probably get it never me in and then I'll lay back on the fly. Yeah. So we took six meals, plus the burger for us. Yeah. I think maximising the fullness. Now we'll go crazy on this last meal. We'll probably just have to chicken them rice. Or what we got. Yeah, I've got everything in the bag. Yeah, because that was a hundred seconds chicken. But it's a great rice and bingles. How many bagues do we want tomorrow? I mean, you got me the man. Then go up three or four. That'd be fine. We got rice cakes as well. We got two packs of rice cakes a sandwich, just got the one. Yeah, we got bagels. I'll definitely make a quick move. I think we used chicken and rice just for the next meal. I can cook rice for the morning as well. Yeah, if you need any more rice to it. How much rice do you got left today? I've got enough for tonight. Yeah, so tonight we'll be able to now. You're four-jump grams, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, three four-jumpers still have a little less. And it's not from should we do another rice for tomorrow? You can do just because it's going to be a long day. If you want to cook one up, we'll have probably a cream of rice meal in the morning. And then probably a chicken of rice meal. I don't have a cream of rice. I probably just do an easy one. Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't know more rice. I know you make a room cream of it. Do you like it? Yeah. Any longer drawing drawing? For the whole. Real up. You're right. You've got some, I like six, six, thirty. Yeah. You're just looking to experience a pain of butter. Never hungry butter. Yeah, it's a good one. I've got you know the cast, and we talk. Yeah, never. Keep running, you're drawing that nicely. You keep going. You hungry. Yeah, I can start. I'm really in the sense for you. So, yeah. I've been in the flowing meal. That's nice. Hardly. What would you like just make me draw a load from here? Yeah, I've got some bits to do with it. Okay. Hold on a bit. Let's have a look. Yeah. Yeah, and you saw that that you just make sure this is what it's showing. That's it. That's it. That's it. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. It's going to be nice. But at least that'd be longer than it. We've worked for you for your house. Go for him. Yeah. We've just sitting down for a lot of the car for an hour and so just bought a lot of back into the easy answer. We're going to get very close in here. Okay. That's a bit. That's a bit. That's a bit. Um. It's not just. It's going to be two seconds I have thinking. Um. What's next on your plan? Chicken rice. 154 grams chicken. So rice. Yeah. So if I was chicken, I think. So I think. I think like you can push large fries if you need. You're going to have a bit of a little bit of a bit of something. They're really digested and stressed by trying to climb a ball in. Let me think. Yeah. If I take. I'm going to stack the cheese under. And I thought you should have one slice of cheese. Yeah. I'm going to even do something. Yeah. There's going to be enough fat in the. Yeah. Yeah. Honestly, if I just have a burger. Yeah. Bread. Yeah. So yeah. I'm rather not. Yeah. There's going to be enough fat's food. We're a burger itself. Yeah. Sounds good. Sounds good. Yeah. Make sure we go into our guests in our lives. Yeah. I've got some. You know, bought some of me. Yeah. I've got some with me. Yeah. Um. If my eyes are next to it. You're not trying to. I don't know if I can do that. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, you can. You can certainly. Put that in. Um. Just going to bring you more to life. Sure. For us. Yeah. Through the night. And then tomorrow. Just hold in that. I'll see you fast in the morning. Sure. I'll make one meal in. Yeah. I'm just going to sit well. And then just grow. So we have landed now in Tauber. We are at the holiday in. And I am lost. I think we're going to speak. To reception. Possibly. Um. Just being to see Alex Andrew. And George, all of you fantastic. Wait for reception. See you. Find shack. And then see Steve. I think that's it. Who's staying here. Who's there on you. Stay in Manchester. Yeah. Everything's looking really good. Taubering on day. But everybody's happy. Just get somebody's eyes getting very hurt. Right. But every time I get. Um. I'm going to eat today. And then I'll just put it in. Yeah. Um. I'll say. Currently. Just trying to find our way to reception. So. I'll show you a bit. Breathe out out before you get into it. So we're going to. When you're here. Yeah. By the time you finish the end of your post. Yeah. You're going to be all the air out. You don't any. You don't. You don't any air here. Push it out. When you're facing this way. You want to be like. All the way out before you head into that post. Got me. Sense. Nice. That's it. Yeah. Nice. Do you feel like connecting a little bit more. Yeah. You're going to pass it for your back. We all out. Sick. Nice bro. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now you're going to want to show that condition through the midsection. Your strength is pulling that back and making your waist narrower. And your then top line is expanded. Okay. So I think working with that on your physique is going to be an advantage. You can see that you're going to benefit us. Okay. Certainly. You know I'm saying, but you don't work to our strength. But the guys that you're going to be going against. I'm going to do this. Yeah. Front double. Yeah. It's a bottom part. Perfect. And that's what we need to do. I think that's that's your strength. If we can make you this. Because we're not going to get caked in dry. Okay. These guys are assisted. You're not. You're going to be on the money. We play through the strengths that we've got strengths as your level and pop. Yeah. Okay. Your top line. The amount of tissue that you can display. Yeah. And if we can make that look crazy. X-raying. That's I think the the the the run that will approach us with. Because. There's going to be some cute guys. It's a very fun. And I mean. You condition is there. But your look is bubble. But we're going to be. That's going to be our benefit. Because I'm going to have the. I'm going to have the help of you. And that's what you have to do. That's what you're going to do. Cause that's what you're going to do. You're going to do that one. And you can do that. You can almost hide your breathe in. Does that make sense? With that front arm covering the midsection. Okay. You see that on the same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All these little things. We're going to go. And I can't. Obviously on that stage we've got somebody to go up there. little cool control your transitions steady plow within. But it's not too much now but there's a few today that's all with. Yeah, I think that's gone. Yeah, and for us if I can maximize fullness tonight then again tomorrow we still don't need food. Yeah, just an hours volume. Yeah, I mean so, hit your... So in time, yeah, do that on again. Yeah, perfect. Go on and make. I've got to go then. And if you've got to last me or me, is that if you're last me or me? There's no of them here. You're five in any? You're five in your zone? Seven, five. One. Yeah, cool.
