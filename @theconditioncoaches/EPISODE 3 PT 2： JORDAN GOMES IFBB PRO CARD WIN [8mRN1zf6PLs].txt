— Let's go! We're launching Mayday. It's so day we are still ready to rock. We're waiting for a new year to get to the venue, get tired, and then for like a month's age. And the look at Jordan 5, got the small in. It was very much on the money, very, very happy. One meal in 150g of carbs, better fats. It was tiny bit of protein, scoring that fluid. Good Italian, public Italian, at the end of the town, basically. Just tweaked a few things if we need to, just if there are a few roasts, take it in, roast with a square of ice. And then it's just a bit of waiting to show that. We're here at the venue, Jordan has just been turned. We've had a quick look. Things are looking very, very good. I'm very excited. I'm trying to just keep everything cool. The look is very strange. The look is very strange. I'm trying to keep everything cool. The look is very strange. I'm trying to keep everything cool. The look is very strange. It's very, very good. For me, we weren't even going to do this show. We have to the venue, we're going to call it a day. A few days later, we called some more off with a set. We looked at how Jordan was responding. He was in a good position to say. So we just know straight into it. And it's been a good move. It's been a good move. It's been a good move. We've got probably about two or three hours until stage time. So tomorrow I'm chilling now. I'll try to get some cards in a bit of a little bit of sodium. Just see what they're packing us in the day. I am now in a rainbow. Now I'm in a skull of a cat. I'm going to be in a blue sky. I can be in a blue sky. I can be in a blue sky. I can be in a blue sky. There's a crane. Looking up all the same. Let me walk. Let me walk. Let me walk. There's a plane. It's just a small plane. It's just a small plane. It's just a small plane. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky. I can't be in a blue sky.
