Yes guys, we're here at Primate of Jim, the YouTube is back. Season is over. So we're going to make more training videos catching up with Harry today. 16 weeks out from Detroit Pro. So we're going to get an arm session in. Being very careful. I'll slightly a bit of an injury. I've got a little bit of a lost territory. I've got a lot of stuff in the back. I've been here with a couple of weeks. So hopefully that'll be good. We're going to have an in-person check-in. See where we're looking at. I know we're in a good position. We're in a very very good position. So to see if my own eyes, then I'm going to get some content for the ground. What's that? It's down for me. What makes I think it's? Yeah, come on. You again. Again. Again. Again. Again. Nice. Go. Yeah. Yeah, come on. She's out. Come on. Yeah. And again. Go. Yeah. Yeah. I've technically chosen arms today. I've probably thought about the only thing that might be able to keep up with Harry. And we've got us on music level. You've got to watch it pull about six-bates with horse, what wide-brake, so that's exactly it. In just my outfit, I can't do it. So I've had the increase of volume. Bit more reps. Yeah. It's the same as the tempo down. You've got to train smart. Yeah. Yes. First of all, I think there's a certain train to get away of the younger, like in your 20s, you train more like, like, rather, like, sorry, and style, like, probably on failure. Then we get over 30 small, he-hainy, like, stimulate not a lot of, yeah. Yeah. Train, like, evolve with your body. He-he-he, basically, as you get old, trains smart. Yeah. Yeah. I've got my head. Hey! Nice. I've got my head. Nice. I've got my head, this. I've got my head. OK. Nice. OK. I'm feeling good. Yeah. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. Come on. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, no. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Come on. No. Yeah. That's me. Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, it's a great force. Yeah. We need to take the attention on the camera. Oh, my. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, my. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. Come on. Oh. I'm still going to put a bit more of a compound lever. The acoustic press on the front. I think you'll have that habit. So would I just do this? I'm going to do it. It's still giving a concentration on the tricep. I'm not fully locking the elbows out. We're not low. We're not low. No, coming to play by more so written than you've really drive. It's keeping the front tension on the tricep making sure that the track really doesn't come to play either. Very good movement. Very good compound movement. I always good on it. I'm low. Come on. Yeah, screw it up. Drive it. Yeah, come on. We've got a whip. Come on. Go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go. Come on. Go. Go. Come on. Come on. Go. And again. Come on. Come on, man. Get it hot. Do you can move it? Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go. Come on. Come on, man. Let's do this. I am I'm gonna go back. That's good. Well, yeah. Keep moving. We'll try, Seth. Try, Seth. Come on. Let's go. Right, my glasses. One, come on. Two, three, one more. Up. Come on, I'm going back. Come on, I'm going back. You're gonna go back to the office. Yeah. Well, what's the name of this? Snack. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. What's the deal, Frank? You're not talking about that. You're not talking about that. You're not talking about that. Keep moving. I'm just getting flat brakes. I say last week, we're just... We'll just pull last week, I'll do the first thing full. Then that immediately, we're dropping water, maybe feel a bit tighter. Yeah. And the last couple of days, right, we've dropped a little bit more. I feel a little bit slid. I know, don't, obviously, in the poor spectrum, but that hasn't prepared to what I look like. I feel like skinny fact going. I'll say, you know, we're fine. It's nice to learn how to make things. Making things. Making the life. I'm fine with it, guys. You're in fact on the moment when that's made, we're getting to share shows. You know, like, oh, yeah. It's just trying to explain it to us, it's impossible, yeah. Go away from here. SCARTS Get off. Go away! yeah yeah oh Yeah, that's been all to change. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's part of the process. Oh, I'll come up. I mean, we'll reach the boat. Yeah, but then you're always running down our own. Yeah, yeah, I'll try and do as well, make sure. You come down in like four octaves, you'll be following us two weeks and a half. What's your new trend? Zoom, Zoom, Zoom. So, and maybe you spend a half an hour. Probably, probably, that's giving us a lot of work. Yeah, yeah. I meant nobody knows about that. So all the times. I know, so that's what they want to bring them up to. So you can enjoy Christmas. It's still a wrap. But it's just what the history is. Yeah, and they've been with that. Yeah, exactly. It's the day off. We'll go, yeah, I'm fine. So I only take Christmas day off in the Greenwich Bank. Three and bucks today. Anyway, yeah. There's always a good day off. And hopefully that's a nice episode. We've got a really healthy day off. Yeah, I mean, to get through one day, and we'll talk to the new needs of the routine. Right, so yeah. I get a bonus for that. You know, there'll be a good quad. And you're back in the play. Yeah, yeah. I mean, in the needs of jumping to get better now, so I've got them well to just maintain just on the flip. You only done three sets of the leg extension, three sets in the hamstring leg rest. What you want to do, last short, three four months, which is a good, so just when we need to get there, hopefully, I'm going to be able to put back in the hamstring. Maybe I hope you'll barbell, course, my family. No, exactly. A week point. No, you want to. Thank you. You still want to feel that? You still want to support the position. Yeah. I'm going to move the blood around it. I'm blessed to have you in the doubles with the details. So we'll do tell you that we've done it. And you might let your quad-ratching, one of the last things coming from your action, you need to get virtually destroyed, least for I get those quad-cells. That's what people are seeing. When they do come in up to that, they make them look like they're big as us. That's good feedback for me as well. Like, that's what I'm trying to get. But you know, the starting, I'll be looking up for the front. Yeah, just that fucking quarter three next time. Yeah, I'm so excited to look at different ways of my back shots coming almost to a view. And we're still looking at the back. I can have straight hamstrings, to loosen up, if they lower back in. And I still have more to come up from the front, which is the way it can be, it's able to hold around you. So I just need a little bit more time for those quad-cells. You know, coming a little bit more. And that's where I'm with the timeframe that we've got. We've got that time period to bring it in. Almost solidified that condition. And it really good. So when I'm chasing our after, the kick-up, I think that's the fact that. So, especially with the amount of shoes, depending on how many shoes we want to hit. Yeah, keep it going. We want to keep going as long as we can. Yeah, that's another thing as well, like I said, that my physique generally gets better. The more shoes I do, I don't tend to burn out. I get better and better rather than, yeah. You know, doing a show and then getting worse, I'm going to go get tight and start it off. And I'll go. To be fair, mate, I'll find that a lot with the top half needs. Because I always say that you can go 100% and then start for a show. You can be a 100% but then once you've had that little bit of, you've been on say, you've never been to that little bit of respite, you've got that sort of next. So, get a gas to push it to the next show. And you can almost speed out that next year for a cent like. Yeah, so then take your on and on and on. So, don't worry, come hang some of that. Yeah, yeah. So, I always believe in that. You know, it would have get better. It was a wide barrier, it was perfect. It's like, you can only push the body so fast. Yeah, it's actually great. And you're starting up from a different start from the, you're pushing it from a different postshow and then again from the night to check your tyre, you can get down from there. So, you see it back into the time that they do. Some of them need to do what they keep with you, for example, makes it do a couple of more of your favourites. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know that, I know that, I can line up four or five shows. But know that you've put it in and put it in and put it in. It's going to get managed there. So, run it to that. Yeah. And that'll be very much like you. There's a lot of you manage this period. And give you fresh, fresh as you can be. And fresh. Yeah. You can get managed. And you just keep that for three of them in control. And then you're all in your stuff.
