Yeah we are 10th day. Are you feeling my day? Yeah, what are you doing here? Come here. Ah, I'm on my way. I'm ready. I'm on my way. Holy, I'm the star of the show, Ted. Say, do you make... Hey guys, do you know what I'm doing? Hey guys, what's muscular? So, Holy does my flow move up from the UK to do it to actually see Lewis on the stage. I know, in the 15 years. Holy. It puts up with the open and never see the air because I would. Because you'd be in a moment, I would. Yeah. So, this time, this, what that was. It's a little bit really, really well. What? Always talking to something, what do you mean, and I just make everything. Did you have any fun or silly? Yeah. You had lots of things. Are you hungry? Yeah. You're my subsac. I've never been to like, so I've been eating. Yeah. Everybody knows nice. Marl, fun, what? No. We're going to get some into it. It is the final day of loaded tomorrow. Friday, April, we'll show you going to be out. Crack it all. Probably before the crack it all, get down to that one for a week. I'll look to see how Lewis is looking. Literally before he drinks. He's got a reference point there and do it. And we can manage literally me at one of those tomorrow. Go ahead and see. Show them. So, please. Yeah. Woo! Woo! There we go. There we go. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! We're going to go. We're going to go. We're going to go. Yeah, bro. Go for that. Yeah, not no durates. Not things just kept everything same. What I say, 10 liters of sugar. Okay, kids' day. I'm going to put it all up. I'll put it like two of those six by five. So, it's the way you want to do this. I don't want to reverse-peek it. Yeah. You want to reverse-peek? No, not peek, not peek, don't. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, it's just very cheap and they're falling at you. Yeah. All the way for dough. Small things out of me. Yeah. It's more good. Yeah. So, we're going to put it in the bowl. Okay, but we're going to turn it off. It's like developed sort of time. It's good that time, sir. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to put it in the bowl. It's a little sticky. Yeah. It's very quick. Please, the mixer, something. Because it's rising. I'm not going to mind your full clock. Maybe we tell the powder on your leg. We don't go out of the bowl. But it's like, Tim, I bet last night, it was a feds' wrecked in it. Only a little bit. We've got a fart on building for the bar, you know? I thought, and then the last, I've put some bed sheets on bottom. I don't even need them, it's like that. That we know in there. Yeah. The only night, I mean, like, night, night, late. Oh, yeah. It's not gone, sir. I want to just keep going. It will long be gone. Yeah, me. That's it. Hey guys, it is day four now in the time. Three of the loads, I think, for sure, it is six, just like seven. Not apparently, but thinking about it, even if you get it, probably. We've come to him out for you. Just that, we look at Lewis and some good light. We're glad you see. Because the play wasn't good, so, I had to do something similar. He's been normally seen. It'll be sort of a play, something like that. When you see him, we want to see the America, the practice show. Yeah, they're very good spot. After two days, heavy loading, I'm sitting at a good way. Very, very good condition. You know what I'm just going to go heavy in the first couple of meals, try and work, I think. I mean, tomorrow, I'm going to go by meal. I'm going to pull back a little bit, give some rest on the GI. Try to make some changes for heavy, ask me, which will be a few bites, which works so well, which doesn't seem to mean. And then we'll wait a moment, money, and it's holding tomorrow. It's all good. We have the body, people, we'll take that. In the air, in the air, in the air. The moments away from where the racing game is, hey, we're going to get nuts, cow, fat, and cow. We're going to get it, it's good, it's good, it's good. It's good, it's good, it's good. It's good. I'm down, I'm going to go see you tomorrow. Let's go to the pool, coaching, coach, diet hackie. Egg, free of spread, thank you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Very done, it's not next at the end. Cool, it's good, perfect. Jump in. Go to work. Just look at it. We're going to go, we're going to see six hours. 26 hours. 26 hours. Yeah, so. It's good to be on this, like we could. We could stand on stage now, but I know this could be better. We've got a very small percentage of water left to come off. We're already falling as deep pretty much today, and it's nearly not even a little and a lot of cool. We will probably push 10 liters. All right, can we feel like there's that one you have to wait? Yeah, we can. And then I'll trickle the rest in. Yeah, so that makes sense. Yeah, with the food. Yeah. I'm just going to do it. That's my head, that's what I'm thinking. Because of the fullness of your caroline and your fucking bone dry. And you're just going to dry up. Yeah. Because tomorrow we're not going to be loaded with water. Yeah, but it's just going to suck it and suck it and suck it. If it was fasting in the morning, then I would drink, cause it would too. And then we would just like, yeah, it's a sassum. Yeah. But like they, if you were fasting in the morning, then potentially I would. But with the time of the show, we still not. 26 hours to dry for a minute. Yeah. Yeah. So cows get a lift. If we actually think, I've already done a part of it, of course to me. But mate. Yeah. I'm going to do it tonight. You're going to do a show. Yeah. Do a show. It's going to be a nice month. What are we doing in the tent? Is it a spa demand? Yeah, it's a mouth mower. What? Bigger? That's what I... What? What? He's so... How? I'm going to move to the line. All right. You have to be serious now. I have to... But I'm sneezing. All right. Leave that for a second. What are you doing? Yeah. You're going to be a little bit... Uh, that's much. No, I'm going to be a little bit... Oh. All right. You're going to do the next. Double body. That. Yes. What's that? I'm last breath. Last breath. Wow. So, it is... Two o'clock just gone. And this is a time that we estimate Lewis to be on stage, roughly tomorrow. And, um, you can probably much... Pretty much stand on stage now. Um... The look is mad. Crazy crazy mad. Uh, it's just going to get even better. The decision... It's actually too poor with that. Which I had in my mind this morning. As changed. Um, we will probably just write a book about what we've done yesterday. But time to be presented today. I'm a lackey. We are... Draw, I have a phone. Lewis is going to carry on building Lego. With Ted. Um, well, I'm just going to blow it away. What I look is crazy. Crazy crazy crazy. Ted, we are... Hi, five. Does that do that good? No, this... Do it again. This phone. Let's do it on the... Oh, wow. Can I call you for my phone? Can I call you for my phone? I'm going to have to do the top. We have to finish the Lego one right now. Um, um, it's my own standard drive. Oh, you got the last one. Yeah. Oh, no. One with standard B absolute leader. Is it this one, though? Yeah, it is that one, yeah. You're right. Look at that. Wow. Right. Time to go shave. That is going to get time. Ah, touch. Here we are. No, bro. Not good condition. Yeah, me. It's the... Follow someone called Chick-fil-A, you know? I saw the jack-type. Oh, my gosh. So, I'm taking off this room. I got it. I'm going to win this one. I'm going to play. Come by. Still be me. That boy is growing. Just come back from time. Um, just have a look. I'll fall music. As we planned, we'll back in off a little bit of the day. So expect it a little bit from the street to drop off. Yeah. Which is going to spike up with a heavy immune now. And it's back off of a light immune. And then going really heavy tonight before we go back with the very low price. Um, yeah, it's all going to plant a better one very, very tired. So we've got probably three years left now. And then it's a key time. So yeah, it's good vibe. Every time we're extremely happy, we look at it. It's a good plan. Naturally. It's a good team. So we shall see from here. We'll be telling you like. You like some. You like some, you like some, you like some. Like, yeah. You need to be about. Hey. We're almost pretend. More than a from the last year. Probably about another percentage right. This is something, girl. I see the close. You know, like, just relax there. See what? See that? Hey. You got these, this one, yeah. See that? Well, do you want that to mention? The noise of the Mitch's got you gone now. Like, this is, you know, it is. Turn the clock. We will be having burgers in about an hour. Yeah. Yeah. Man starving. That sounds a grab the car today. Tell me the war. Six thousand calories so far. Um, probably about 3000 calories in with this meal. Two. That would be his very best. Two last fries. And it's my time. Wake up. We will be fuller. We will be drier. Um, and then it's just about managing it. Go in. Into the show. We got bikini. There's about 24 girls a bikini. I think that's 11 girls in. Well, when us starving that. I've had 11. So we're guests to meet in about two o'clock. To be on stage. So, um, I'm just going to try and manage to look up into that point. Two o'clock today was a very good look. So if we can sort of try and mimic the, the food that we used. But to let we more water in the morning. Secure the fullness that we want. By that point, you should be literally. The skinless. So, I said, we'll see. Staying there tomorrow. Good. Here. So I think you did really well. Yeah, yeah. Oh, there's απο. Can I pick that Wisconsin reevalred six, just be on the safe side? The last supper. The first Antrag of this failed dodge B The day is nearly over. It's just about to be soft. It's somewhat of a very impressive load. Something that is truly beyond science. It's crazy. Crazy crazy. It's a very day of load in probably 26,000 calories. We'd probably touch in four and a half, thousand carbs, three plus meters of water. Yes, this is... That's what we... That's what we've got to do. This man process is there. And the math is the ego driver and joy throughout the day. We're probably at our joyous point now, but I've seen him, which is the perfect position to be in. We will be up early. So 25 to midnight. We'll be up above 5 o'clock to assess. This will relax too. Hopefully get a few hours of sleep. We'll see how we'll look as... Holding in the morning we expect a little bit. Potentially of a fullness to drop off. But we'll listen to the planning. Free good near meals, potentially. There's a game plan, which can be adjusted. Not even on stage too. I want to clockish. Yeah, if I want, so... It's all time for that in the win. I think it's frosted. It's a good one too, so after that, we'll put good amount of food in the morning. Because it's just not so super clean. There's just about a number of... ...beating for that moment and the show in the state. I'm going back. See you tomorrow, I'll show you. Look at the air. The team he is for me. The muscles are difficult to get into that. The blades are so pretty. The more conditions they ever do. It's hard to do it. Never. Not. That's what I like. Speak to us. This is a look. Everyone has a little bit. So they've asked us a lot. Forgot to keep the air so I feel like that is going to happen. And to be fair. Quite a lot about the potential. I'm in the barbershop. I'm going to be able to get rest and sleep. Jason Coolson. Yes, on. Good morning guys. It's so late. We are open money. It's very very good. It's one of our happy with a little bit. Flutter. Then we've been out of the list. But there's like five hours. It's a little bit. Just that in person is now. We've just got in the car. Those three are just down. Like from the number in that. They're very nice. They're just like, really good amount of war in the music. I'm not talking to you. See what that goes. Just get well good in time and right today. Hey, if we can hold this condition. Fill them up on a little bit. So we'll go and start. Just take a step first. Every hour. I'll make sure it's on the money. It's good. It's very good. I did not see the link. I'm super dear to write. I'm tired. I've got this. I'm going to show it. So it's all kind of so. Then I'll give this battle a stage. I'll give this battle a stage. I'll give it a stage. I'll give it a stage. I'll give it a stage. I'll give it a stage. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. You like that? No. You like that? Yeah. Yeah, because of customs, I'm not going to throw up. Or feel flat, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know which one? Well, my name is Tioffman. That's what you were going in. Wait, wait. I'm going to come with this. I know. I'm going to wait a minute. Still want to tell him what his weight is. Just play with his head. He could be 150 kilos shredded and it was still a fuck with his head. But yeah, it's already the rock. Never be going. Never be going in. So that's 200. Spive and do grab the carbs. Roughly the small and gone in. Just nearly a minute and a half of water. And it's a tiny good. It's a little bit hard to do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You've got a lot of meat on your plate. So we're here at the ground higher. Okay, so the amateur's a list like the armatures have just finished. So pros and few to start in just under an hour, 50 minutes. Lewis is sleeping. Again, just good. The plan is to have a look at him in 20 minutes time to be 11 o'clock. Estimation were about two and a half hours from stage. So this would probably be the last bit of volume-wise food going in. Okay, the look is perfect at the moment. It's just a matter of keeping it topped up. And really just driving up the last bit of condition, bringing up last bit of water out and he's ready to rock. Okay, let's get it now. Thank you. Thank you. What are you doing here, babe? What are you doing here, babe? What are you doing? Boy the man. What's that he doing? Liz the man. So we are done with pre-judging. The final one, Liz came out and was absolutely on the money that he had been credit for. First row, the four-wheel drive were all directed towards the left hand of the stage. There was a lot of right. He then moved our stage and called the next round. Cool, fast-cold out. They compare a hunt around the rows and together move them off stage. Leave them two guys and pull the Lewis in. And then move Lewis to the center. Well, something went a little bit. And it's looking like they're at a fourth. This is very good, very good. That's our aim. So it's just, this is going in when you do not get prepared. It's just frustrating. We've been able to put everything into this and Lewis is on the money. He didn't get the comparison. The guys like Delorosa, all the other guys, you got cool into four. They were fantastic, but he just didn't sort of pan out with the weather. We are hoping to, you know, maybe always go into the window as good as we can and be Dutch fairly. So we'll see, you know, we'll go back to the point in the minute. Lewis is thinking about our girl in price. Just to pop the top of the map and then we'll go back and enjoy the finals. We'll see you there. This one. Look at this one. What was the song? Did you like the song? Is it kills? Is it the spot in the audience? That's the spot in the audience. That's the spot in the audience. That's the spot in the audience. Yeah. I did see you. I was like, you told me. Yeah. I did see you. I was like, you told me. Yeah. You guys were thinking about that? We have just come off stage. So pre-drogen. I was like, yeah. We thought that he's slightly got overlet. The man he paid off. He fought. He fought. He fought. He put out. Here it is. Top three, maybe. Top three. I'm going to go get the real check. I think we're going to have to put it in. Yeah. That's another one of our finals, right? Pointing out next to John and then my good running for him. Yeah. So he's all going to be one extra.
