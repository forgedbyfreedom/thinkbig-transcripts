Tired. Go ahead and put your go. It's competing tomorrow. It's been a highly early thought today. It's making sure he's paying and the guys are doing the bridge to follow him weekend as well. So, see you for a minute, for a moment. It's cool. Living off the window. Monster, caffeine, drop a bit. Let's get that made for the shit. As soon as the Lewis is done on Sunday we fly back to Vegas from Reno here on the Monday. Tuesday we fly back to UK and I have straight command just to set up camp for the guys are doing two brochures and then head straight to South Africa for the BCA. So it's going to be a long time away from home. Listen, everybody sucks. That's all for good course. Really good. It's time to eat some good down time at the end of season as well. But it's getting tired in the end. It's a good deal. Lewis is now a mute. The saving is a voice to save his throat. So there's no point in the mic anytime. He is actually silent. He's still being a little bit, but he's hundreds, hundreds of times better than Murray where a couple of days go. It's a scar. It's actually pulling out the choke, eventually. When he couldn't even hit one hose without it's been gasping for about 30 minutes. It's a bit worrying, but thankfully, he'll always be catching a humidifier. Throats, spray, and septic spray, every single chest infection medication. In fact, he's going down anything but I'm too far. He's going down anything better. Get in there. And it's working. Okay, now. I want my feet and video lessons. I'm a fan of radio, but I'm a fan of radio, but I'm a fan of radio. I'm a fan of radio, but I'm a fan of radio. I can't believe that things are not seen. It's broken maybe every time I see him on the same as the same. But they can't deceive me. They can't deceive me. I'm quite the same. I'm quite the same as my other things. They can't deceive me. They cannot be. I try to tell them when they couldn't see me. They couldn't hate me. Yeah Yeah, she was a boy, so yeah It is Saturday. It is day before the show. We have just taken a first look at Lewis. Fastest first in the morning in a very very very good position. Okay. He's my father heavy Yes, he's ever been this boy and I'm both far probably the most condition he's been at this point. I think that it's in good very very good Just set up the day today with done three days as pretty much 1500 gram of carbs And we can come in the water day. We can back that off a little bit today. We can probably be a little less aggressive Because bonus is there pretty much it's just about holding it and just probably a little bit at the end of the day Which we'll do with backward fries, start a protocol It's just manipulation of water they will pull back a little bit on that and just for the spectators The boy in the food that goes in the boy with fluid that I think goes in I'll be just making sure the mid-section see the title of the week of tomorrow morning There's still a bit plenty in that and keep it in full. I don't even have a bit of cover I don't even have to play by the little bit and then going to tomorrow very fulfilling It will be a lot of more than two news in the morning that I'll be here. Good good day We are just chilling. Let's go to the next 30 of the leaves So we're going to go to the expo just before I'll have a look around Cut it with a few people, get back, chill, pose and eat burgers so we can't delay that This is all we find in our team Tanning Dunn, Lewis is starting to turn around and I'll like shade of my honking We are going to head back to the apartment, just chill, pose in between meals We've lowered Lewis's last few meals just before he goes in for burgers tonight He's going to be hungry for them Going to head over to the basketball court, full places It's a very close to the room for his routine He's just trying to cover times and he'll stick and he'll go in there I think it's just a matter of just 24 hours from now He should be over, so we shall see what tomorrow brings When give me the�il procedur Young good god works. His burgers is 20 pounds midnighthhhh, look at this his pink So, at this, at the sack, wake up full, absolutely pure. Right for the day, day will probably be just to have one bigish meal first thing and then to cruise into the show. It needs to be on roughly thinking around 12. One of lots of pretty much about 12 hours from now, so, good time to get this in now and pretty much lay off doing it and we'd nice them that empty. As we say, we'd say, we'd say, we'd say, nice and that, so you give, you see it. I only see the markets actually today, so, see it a bit.
