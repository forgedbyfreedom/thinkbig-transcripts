Yes guys, welcome back to the YouTube channel. We are here again in Maidenhead another Airbnb. It is the day before Shoday. It is the Ben Rida Pro qualifier myself. I have urban and George doing heavyweight and super heavyweight. Amanda has Charlotte doing figure she is currently at the gym at the moment, bless her she is on prep. I absolutely can't admit it, but really well, just trying to manage being a coach, being an athlete. It's never easy but she's getting it done. So we are off to registration in a minute. I'll pick Amanda up, we'll head there and we'll catch her. So we are here now at the Pro qualifier. I have a Charlotte with the Division 2 weeks again.

Second in her class, but she's not upset because she's put the better package to speak. And even the judges said she's come back so much better. And people are always very positive.
