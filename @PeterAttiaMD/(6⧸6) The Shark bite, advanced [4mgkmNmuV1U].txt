So this is going to be the more advanced version of the shark bite. So using the right leg back and grab the weight. So first, he's going to find his lunge, sink down into a lunge position, find his left glute, and his right hip flexor and quad. And Peter's going to lean forward, come into his standing split position, make sure the pelvis is aligned. Give me three taps here. And he's going to go over into his<|it|>zi. Back as upright, sink straight down. He's going to go right back into his standing split. Again, three taps right here. Making sure that he's really pushing the left hip back. So I think he has left glute and hamstring. Nothing in the tens behind the knee, pull straight forward. And then right back into that perfect lunge position. So as you move into this second repetition, when you lean forward, come into stance, let you believe that I'm going to make sure the right hip is down with the left, the left hip is slightly pushing back. So the pelvis is long. And then upright position is just to see the down into your cursy. I'm going to engage the transverse abdominis here, so I can any lower back extension. Pull straight through. Lunge position, back heel higher with the ball line of the toe, sinking straight down. Good. Awesome. One, two, three. Move toward 밝ies her hips.
