Anybody who's ever prescribed the statin to people knows there's a very small amount And it's even in the package insert that comes back and tell Docs since you started this I'm not right. I'm thinking right I'm not calculating right my brain is in a fog And we use the word brain fog again and extreme minority of people given statins have that we had no clue what caused that Environmently would stop the statin trying another one it usually occurred or if it didn't find but if not then We'd have to figure out other ways to a lower LDL cholesterol which was not easy years ago But anyway my hypothesis now it gases these small number of people get brain fog I wish I had this monochrome levels on them could some people be very sensitive to the effects of a statin We know in the periphery hypersynthesizes of cholesterol respond Incredibly well, this is that and so our should be over synthesizes do hypersynthesizes do not so who knows but That if that being said now here comes the next part of that epidemiologic study where they correlate at low Disemustral with serum desemostral people who had low serum desemostral had a much higher incidence of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease which would lead simply to the hypothesis that Serum desemostral is a usable biomarker to say is somebody at risk for Alzheimer's disease and This goes back to when I met Richard Isaacson with Peter we started throwing these hypotheses around and we've watched that ever since Where would it come into play so if we're and you know until recently you Estatins were our only game in town So if we write a statin especially if used in higher dose if Desemostral was dropping low and we use an arbitrary cutoff point to 20th percentile Would that be maybe you don't want in Hibbit cholesterol synthesis in the brain to that degree? Might we want to attack a pobe with another agent all hypothetical Reason's I'm putting on the table here right now and I think right now we look at that especially in who Who are the people that we know are slightly prone to? Dimension cognitive impairment the e4 carriers people maybe which strong family histories People that have other Identifiable traits that make traits that make us think they're prone to AD we would watch Desemostral incredibly closely in that population So now the last thing I'll tell you if the astrocyte is not making cholesterol because of it's being over suppressed by a statin The neuron would be getting less cholesterol the neuron would convert none of that cholesterol to 24 S. hydroxy cholesterol because it's trying to conserve every cholesterol molecule again So I think if you were somebody who could measure 24 S. hydroxy cholesterol in the serum you would not see it And somebody who had cholesterol synthesis suppression in the brain this all has to be worked out in future clinical trials But there there are looking at this in some clinical trials right now. So one day will be a lot smarter on this Right now if you want you could measure Desemostral and perhaps use that as a cautionary marker Number one if they're not on a drug and it's low Yeah, they haven't done an April E4 genotype you might look at it But if it is somebody who has a propensity Desemostral and you have to use a statin Maybe you want to watch that the good news is and I think it's why our Manitri is if we have to use a statin we start with low dose statins. We have very little use for the hydro statin in the year 2024 because None of the other April B lowering drugs be a ben pedolic acid is that a mime certainly pcs canine inhibitors get into the brain and suppress cholesterol synthesis So we have many ways of lowering April B if we were a little fearful of load as maustral in a patient prone to a day or so So that's As much as we want to get into probably with brain lipids right now Understand April E is a big player up there and there are different types of the April E protein But understand cholesterol homeostasis has a lot to do with what is in the peripheral cells We can look at markers of synthesis The markers of cholesterol absorption that we use big time when evaluating peripheral cholesterol homeostasis Obviously is not at play in the brain the brain is not absorbed in cholesterol from your gut before we leave that time What is our hypothesis around the hydrofobicity Of various statins and do we think that certain statins are more likely to cross the blood brain barrier Are there certain statins that should be ignored in patients with marginal desemostral Great question in the thoughts of changed on this too because early on if you go back probably Maybe even listen to the podcast you and I did in 2018. I believe We were talking about hydrofilic and lipophilic statins in the lipophilic ones Can pass right through the barrier little easier than the hydrophilic one which need receptors to pull them in But subsequent analyses is shown all statins get into the brain ultimately once you have a steady state Staten level in the blood They all will get into your brain and they all have the ability to suppress cholesterol synthesis in the brain Now the last thing I want to say about statins before everybody says oh my god I'm stopping my statin amar I can't get it does most role level Oh, they're available if you look for them, but in general if you analyze all of the statin data the many trials be the observational or Randomized control there is no signal whatsoever that in a population statins Worsen or co-is cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease There's a few studies that even suggest perhaps some lowering Maybe that's through a thoracic cerebral vasculine disease who knows But don't worry that statins in the overwhelming vast majority of people are not hurting the brain But I think we've introduced perhaps a biomarker that you might know with a little more certainty If you have to write a statin in somebody subject to dementia Yeah, we actually covered this at length in one of the previous AMAs and I went through every meta analysis on this topic it's important for people to understand That at least at the time and I don't think this has changed there has been not been any statin trial where the primary outcome was dementia The primary trial is always cardiovascular disease but there have been more than a dozen such trials Where the secondary outcomes are dementia it's worth noting that in every one of those trials regardless of statin used There has either been no change in the risk of dementia or a reduction in the risk of dementia Now it's interesting these studies were almost all done in the setting of trying to determine If lipophilic versus hydrophilic statins were more or less or better and the answer always emerged It didn't seem to matter which of course makes sense if you understand now that they probably all across the blood brain barrier So the question remains will there ever be a study done that tests this question specifically as the primary outcome In other words where the study is powered to ask the question does the use of a statin increase Decrease or have no effect on the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia or will we instead be forced to rely on these Secondary outcomes which are always subject to some Potential misinterpretation again. I take much more comfort in knowing that they are all either neutral or favorable That would certainly be better than the opposite But again that remains a bit of an unknown and you might be right Tom it might be that On average it's having no effect on the brain on Average it's having a beneficial effect through the vascular system But then there might be edge cases that are not being captured in large clinical trials based on Hundreds of thousands of people and it might in fact be those patients in whom a little extra knowledge Goes along way these of e cholesterol synthesis in the brain and the final point I'll make here is What a privilege it is to be practicing medicine in 2024 when we don't have only statins But we have is at amy we have benpedoic acid we have short acting PCS canine inhibitors We now have long acting PCS canine inhibitors We have ASOs around the corner There really is no need for a patient to ever endure a side effect of lipid lowering medication today We can we can lower everybody's lipids without side effects and and so that's that's you know That's and that's only going to become more and more true in the next decade Can argue with anything you said there's brilliant what you said and also this is not a reason not to use statins You individual I we're not evaluating populations we treat people one at a time so In somebody we're worried about dementia We have a biomarker that's probably usable and if God you can't take the statin so what we can't get your able Bego pretty easily with the other things that we know Are not affecting the brain what Peter said wouldn't it be nice to have a randomized blinded trial to answer this question All statins are generic I don't know of any form of companies gonna spend the billion dollars to prove or this proof What statins do to a cognitive Functions of the brain so it's not gonna happen so if it's not we can use an individual patients these Oddball biomarkers that is what I think is part of medicine three point out where we Maybe use a little smarter knowledge to Trying to a better job the last thing I'm gonna paint Peter as heart this enough to we can I Maybe I'd bad mouth I go stands we don't use them When I treating a kill carinary syndrome patients where maybe you want to be out of high dose statin for x amount of time You can get most of the apobe lowering with a statin with the baby dose this has been proven in trial after trial Most of the LDL receptor up regulation occurs with the lowest dose that inhibits cholesterol synthesis You start doubling tripling quadruple you might get another six seven percent not the original 30 percent lowering or so So in today's world why do you ever have to double triple or quadruple the dose of a statin? When we have all these other additive drugs that you take a baby statin my Sort of acronym for a low dose statin and you combine it with a ZMI benpedoic acid or p p says can you nine inhibitor? You've got a A military machine that can destroy a poe b So that should be the thought processes about attacking apobe nowadays we have so many options Which we didn't have in the heyday? I always say one last thing because I'm old enough to remember where did all this hydrophilic lipophilic stuff come from? the first two Competitive statins on the market were symbol statin Which was a Merck's most potent statin more potent in their low-vest statin or nevacore So everybody jump on zilkor or symbol statin but bristomir squid may privacy statin hydrophilic And there was a lot of thought looking at other bio markers that the and even catabolism that the hydrophilic statins were safe for them the others Was there a little more brain fog with mevacore zilkor than there was with protocol and it totally people said that I never saw it Trial it looked at that so but that's where it all came from form a competitiveness hydrophilic versus a little bit of the statin
