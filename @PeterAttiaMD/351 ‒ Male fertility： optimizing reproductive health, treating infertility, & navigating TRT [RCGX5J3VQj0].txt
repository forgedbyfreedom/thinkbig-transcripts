If you ask me, what's the theme for today? It's a sperm matter a lot. Alright, so now let's talk about the guy who comes to see you. He's been on exogenous testosterone for three years. Presumably there are no sperm. I would bet 95% confidence that he would have no sperm in a scene. So what are you telling him now? How are you going to solve this problem? Oh, this is a very important point. So 80% of conceptions naturally are at home. A curl when sex is front loaded as opposed to reacting to ovulation. Tell me about the impact of cold plunging and sauna and hot tubbing on fertility for men. 20 minutes on 140 degrees, three times a week, would probably make you zero. What paternal age do you worry about? National guidelines for sperm donation, 40 is considered older paternal age, 50 for sure. Right? If you look at risks too off spring, tell me what your impression is of the effect of any or all of the above on fertility. You double the stress and a man in testosterone level will fall. And then the sperm production falls for a whole different reason. Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Atia. Hey Paul, thank you so much for coming out to Austin. Peter Atia, the man, the myth alleged I am. It's so excited to be here. So this is in many ways I guess what's going to be part one of a two part series I hope to do on fertility. And given the complexity of it, I think the most logical way to do it would be to break it down into male fertility, female fertility. And there's obviously going to be things we talk about that'll overlap. But I was trying to think about the best way to start this. And the first thing that came to my mind was, can we just explain what's involved in conception? And maybe do it through the lens of the sperm. But like how much of a challenge is this? I mean obviously there's an enormous evolutionary pressure for this to go as easily as possible. But what is actually involved? So what happens for a sperm to fuse with an egg? What are all the things that are standing in its way, so to speak? I mean there are a lot of, so reproduction is an incredibly highly evolved millionaire process. And remarkably, conserved among mammalian species, even among land species and water species of animals. The giant is cervix's, uterus's. And the question is why is it so much work for a sperm to get into the vagina, especially in say water? And then have to go through a cervix and then the immune system and uterus is very active because there's a hole in the woman to the parrot name to the abdomen. So it has to be highly protected. And then you have to go through the uterus so there's an attention 12 inch swim, which is equivalent to about a 20 miles swim for a human. Based on the size of the shark. And how much this is they have to go and they do that in minutes, which is crazy. So it's an interesting challenge that nature has kept in place for a million years and I really respect evolution. And it is why we're here for, you know, eat sleep reproduce. So it's so basically, with ejaculation, the penis is shaped to fit into the cervix. So everyone wonders, it's getting to the right spot. It's also interesting that the semen is collagulated and then it liquefies. And that's because there's a lot of species of lower phyla that they have to leave as soon as they have sex. Otherwise they get killed, like praying mantises and black widow spiders. So you've got to get out of there as a guy. So our ejaculates and humans are sticky. By the way, is there an evolutionary explanation for that? I have no idea. Yeah, why you went to that? I don't know why one queen bee and the bees in the hive die after mating. I have no idea why that's an advantage. But I guess females are prioritized in the evolution. And that makes sense. So there's a the anatomy is perfectly defined. So a lot of men think they're having trouble placing things. But that I usually don't worry about it because the cervix and the penis, it expands. It forms a seal. Then there's a crypt sperm have to go through a crypt channel, which is only a few sperm make. It's a 100 million sperm may start out. Maybe 5 million make it through the first barrier, which is the cervical barrier. The vaginal fluid is acidic. How is it? How is it? 5, 5, and that's seen when there's a page of seven. It's all buffered. So it's soon as that's as a hostile environment. So it has to get out of there quickly. As soon as it liquefies, there's sugars in there and then they go through the cervical path. So 5 million will make it one out of 20. What amount would it? No. Yeah. One out of 20 makes it through the cervix. Then a hundred make it to the phlopian tube and then one will make it to the egg. Literally only a hundred. Right. So we've set large studies in the 50s where he had had women have sex before his Correctemies. And then he swabbed different parts of the reproductive tract. These are young women for different reasons, not in fertility and found these numbers. And that's the basis for our move to technology from 5 million moving sperm is when we start doing inseminations of versus sex, etc. So those are based on the kind of numbers of sperm that reach the uterus and reach the thing. What's really interesting is this some fascinating research. Everyone thought the van guards sperm wins. Yeah. So it's the phelps sperm that's going to be covered. And there's a company in a hot-abost and called Eric's biocentus and I'm consulting with them. Disclosure. But they've discovered that sperm work in failing says. So because the immune system is so vibrant in the uterus, the first round of sperm gets through the sex and typically absorbs the immune systems. And it's a CREATS FCR receptor. And by the way, we've referred to the immune system a couple of times now. What is it? Is it just a bunch of antibodies? Are they B cells? What is it? It's a barrier. They're sites like there's T cells, B cells and antibodies. It's a full immune risk. Absolutely. So it's a specific immune response. It's anything for anything. Wow. I mean, you think about it. And there's also a mucus plug that exists for 28 days a month to prevent anything going through. Because it's a hole into the woman's body and parrot nightisers there, right? So this and this cervical mucus thins and that's the let's sperm through for two days a month. Incredibly detailed, perfectly orchestrated system. So it looks like the first round of sperm get through the cervix, get into the uterus and they get demolished. And they're failing, like a Roman failings. And maybe a second round goes through and they get demolished. And they're secreting the FCR receptor in the immunoglobulin. Because that's what antibodies bind to. So the female antibodies bind to that. And we don't know how many failings is go through. But then it's like a, it's like a, I run up the middle and then eventually, the predisposed sperm for it. And immune systems deactivated and they get there. It's a while that's a hole in the way. And that can be measured now. And there's actually going to be an assay available to look at whether you're doing this. And it's, they're calling it a sperm cycle almost like ovulation, spermulation. But it's an hour and a half cycle when the failing system is working sperm, our deactivating the immune system and then maybe they don't. So there are groups of, there are jaculates, which is a group of sperm, some of which do this well and some of which don't. And that can be a whole reason for infertility. If you're not able to deactivate the system, you're going to, you're not going to be able to get through because the immune system is active. Let's go through those numbers one more time. About a hundred million, a jack-a-later at the cervix, you're five million get through to cervix into the uterus. Yep. 100 to five hundred to five hundred get to the thlooping tube. And one gets to the egg. Wow. Let's go to the question. Why do you need so many sperm? But the classic answer used to give is they don't like to ask for directions. It's meant to like to ask for directions. But this is probably why. Let's also define what makes up the ejaculate because we've talked about the sperm. So how a sperm made because an important consideration for a sperm is it can only have half the genetic information contained within all the other cells in the man's body. So when does that take place? So the testicle makes sperm. It takes about 60 to 70 days. And it's a process called myosis. So in a car assembly line, you want everything to be the model T assembly. You know, mass produced, you want it all be the same in myosis, which is unlike myosis. You want things to be different and to be a little easy peasy. So you get what's called recombination. And so that's the source of evolution. So the chromosomes blend in a different way and separate a different way. And through that process of a couple of those, you get half the number of chromosomes, which is required to join the other half. But it's not always the same half. Correct. Yep. And it's Lucy Goosey. It's not the same. It's what it started. Yeah. A funny story, which I think I've shared on the podcast before, but if not, sure someone will be amused by my stupidity. I had to take the MCAT before doing any of the pre-med stuff because I had studied engineering. And then I decided I wanted to do medicine. But didn't want to spend two years preparing. One year taken the post back and then the MCAT and then doing it. So I was like, I'm going to just wing it and take this MCAT having never taken a biology class since high school. And I didn't even, I think I took one by, I took freshman biology, right? So I am studying my heart out for this little MCAT test. And the physics and the chemistry are fine. But this biology thing is killing me. I bought this cheap study guide. I didn't have the money or I didn't want to splurge for the official study guide. Like there's an official MCAT study guide. But the thing was like 60 bucks. But there were these knock-off books for 10 bucks. I was like, either just as thick. So I buy one of those. And every time I encounter the word myosis and my toses, I assume it's a spelling mistake because I bought the knock-off book. So I'm treating it as the same thing. Every time I see the word myosis, I'm like these guys. They just misspelled it, idiots. It's my toses, my toses. Finally, on the night before the exam, which I still remember, it was August 17th. Was the day I took the test. I realized they were too totally different things. Big things, they might go ahead. That realization might have got me into med school. Because I think I barely, I think I barely got a 10 on the biology section, which was, you know, it's hard to get into a good med school if you get below that. So anyway, to this day, I get such a chuckle out of the confusion of the nomenclature. But again, just to explain for people, my toses is what happens when cells are dividing in our body. Constantly, where they're trying to create a perfect replica of the entire suite of DNA. So really, to my knowledge, the only time we're undergoing myosies is in the creation of an egg response. That's right. Now, remind me, do, do our women born with all of the rags. I feel like that's something I vaguely remember. You're going to have, you'll have a guest, yes, 5 million eggs at birth. Okay. 1 million, no 5 million eggs at conception, 1 million eggs at birth, and you basically ovulate a thousand in your lifetime. Okay. So by the time you're 45, you're out of eggs. You actually ovulate, you ovulate one a month, but you actually produce 10 a month. So you'll lose 10 for everyone. So there's a lot of waste, but there's no their stock in a stage of perpetual space. Really just boom, you know, and they get older and they don't evolve really. And then they mature when they're asked to at that time, but sperm are constantly renewed. So if you look at that, just a mass space problem because the testes are, I mean, if we, if we did, if we did the same thing women did, would we just have to have an enormous set of testes? Is that the reason that we continue to repeat or why do you think out of the box like that? So I'm not sure of, you know, is a whole issue of, you know, what's the source of human evolution? It's really sperm. Yeah. Because they're constantly dividing. They're constantly influenced by the environment. And they're throwing off mutations in epigenetic changes. And what's most interesting for me for this talk is that whatever happens in sperm happens to offspring. That's an interesting point, right? So it's trans generational. Yep. So what does that mean? Does that mean that the father is more likely to pass on environmental stressors than the mother? Probably, yeah. And that's definitely been shown. Hmm. Okay. So let's go back to it. So the sperm is the actual cell. Where does it get the little tail from? And what's the, what is the other part of the cocktail that is, so one of the most, a magnificent transformations of a cell in the body is the making of a sperm. It starts with a sperm and a colonial stem cell, which looks like other cells. That's from an colonial stem cell is actually the first and the bottom of a tube. It's there's 12 stages of tremendous analysis. That cell is remarkable. It's actually the human male embryonic stem cell. So I've a patent on that cell. Hmm. Because if you take that cell and you put it in a niche environment like a embryonic stem cell, it'll become embryonic almost like in its, it can become multi-potent. Disgusting. It's a blurry potent. Yes. Multi-potent. We don't know about puripone, but you can form tumors. It's form bone, you know, ex-isome, mesodermaxidr, xodermen, and adermium. You can do all three layers of the body with that adult, sperm and a colonial stem cell. Is there any other cell in the body that is capable of that? No. I mean, there are stem cells in the bone marrow that might be stem cells in fat. But none of this, none of this. We showed the capability of cell is magnificent. And so I I think it's, you know, it's the source, like women have eggs and embryonic stem cells. That's the male embryonic stem cell in my opinion. It hasn't been taken advantage of yet with cell-based therapy, but it is really incredible what this cell can do. And a man potentially has access to this cell his entire life. Yep, and thongs he's making sperm. So that starts out and it usually reproduces my�otically, and then, in puberty, it'll go down the path of myosis, which is a couple steps more than my toastes involved with myosis, but it's the having and the mixing up of the chromosomes and the newness of the genome introduces mutations and stuff. And most mutations are bad and some are good. And we, you know, you don't really think about that. But we can have a long talk about genetics versus epigenetic. Actually, let's focus on that first second. I hadn't considered that. So when the cell that is becoming a sperm undergoes myosis and it divides, what's the fraction of times when this becomes an anniaploid sperm and explain maybe to people what anniaploid is? And what's the process by which that thing gets discarded? So if you look at healthy human sperm for chromosomal content and what's correct and what's incorrect, probably 2% of them are off. They're still being made. They're just off because it doesn't really, it doesn't really click the system to negate it. We don't know at what level of chromosomal abnormalities the system will say this is not bad. This is absolutely defective, yeah. But I would say if you look at making a sperm, it's very logarithmic. You're probably looking at one out of four that are being made, go through the epididimus, which is the next 10 days, which is a collecting duck after the testicle where it matures, get to be genetically modified and you'll see these zones, different epidimus zones and things like that happening. And there's a lot of post-production modification, not of DNA essentially, but I think there's a filter going on where a lot of the bad anniaploid becomes out because if you look at the chromosomal abnormality rate and testicular sperm before it goes through the rest of the system and compared to a jaculate, it's higher. It's 2 to 3fold higher. So something is getting into filter? Yeah, and just so folks know, when we say anniaploidie, we mean you don't have one copy of each chromosome. You either have none or you have two or anything that's not one is bad. Right. Yeah. And when anniaploidie occurs in the fusion of the sperm and the egg, is it, do we know, I guess we can figure out pretty easily, if it's maternal or paternal in origin? Mm. If you look at the embryo, it's kind of hard to tell. There are some markers of paternal and maternal origin. It depends on where you're going back in my toes to some myosis. So they can sort of ascribe it in the embryo. In the sperm, you're really going to have to look at the sperm. And if you see a translocation, some characteristic change in sperm, and you see it in the embryo, then you know it's paternal. Yep. Okay. But not usually. And, you know, 98% of sperm are typically normal in a guy with infertility. It might be 95%. Here's an example. If you have a patient with Klein-feltre syndrome, yep. A male with an extra ex chromosome in every cell in their body, or a transgenic model with that feature. So this is a man who's x, y instead of x, y. So 47 chromosomes, not 46. Yep. And theoretically, he kind of has a distinctive look, right? 10% of the time. Oh, really? 90% of the time, even men with Klein-feltre is you'd never know. Okay. So that's the board question. That's the board question. That's the M-cat question. Yep. So the, all right. So in these men, if you look at their sperm and you ployty, right? So every cell in their body and in the mice, the transgenic mice, all have an extra ex chromosome. Yep. Only about 10% will have it in the sperm. Meaning they will produce an x or a y sperm. Just like everyone else. The only difference is they have a two-thirds chance of producing an x, and a one-third chance of producing a y. I'm assuming that a 50-50. We know that. That's math. That's math. Yeah. So biology is not math, I remember. Yeah. So the, and I do Klein-feltre space in just a day that I've heard it on, and they're not doing pre-amplotation genetic diagnosis of the embryos that they're going to create from their sperm, because the chance is not that high. So it goes from in mice 0.1% chance in of normal men having x, x, y, sperm, or x, an anti-plate sperm and abnormal sperm. To 1%. And humans it goes from 1% or so to 10%. But 90% are still, that's remarkable. That's amazing. It's remarkable how efficient this is. I interrupted you. You were in the process of explaining how we actually make this sperm, where the tail comes from, and the whole thing. It's all done in the testicle. Yep. It's an amazing machine. Weird question we should maybe get to is, why is it out in the breeze like that? I think it was temperature related. But why? Why? Why does it need to be a little cooler? Yeah. Yeah. We probably have ourselves in the field for years. I would guess, because I like to make things up, that it's so energetically demanding, that it's giving off more heat in the process of creating something that is going to be so efficient to be able to swim 20 miles effectively. And that's very glycoletic. I'm assuming, right? Like the amount of anti-plate that must be generated. That's a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun. That's like, you know, for an electric motor in each wheel. Yeah. So that would be my guess is you just, that's not the date of the test. It's an overheating problem if you try to keep those guys inside. And I think overheating could be translated to talk to the date of stress, which is a cause of a lot of infertility. Anyway, it's, we don't know is the answer. Right. And it's an interesting that, you know, overhearser inside. So men get in hot baths and they're cooked. Women get in hot baths and they're okay. So it's funny. I had a buddy over who shall remain nameless. And he does not have kids, but he would like to have kids. And we, we saw on the other day. And he went up to my freezer beforehand. I didn't really know what he was doing in there. I thought he was getting a drink or something and he came down with ice packs. And there's two companies they do that. Yeah, he so he basically, we were sitting in the sauna and he was in the sauna, but he's got ice packs all over his groin. And I immediately understood why. I'm usually doing that. But yeah. Yeah. We'll come back to whether or not that's an important strategy for men and the sauna who want to have kids. Right. So the complete sperm, the first half is called sperm, eo genus, sperm out of genus is the whole process. Spermio genus is when you go from the round cell stage and you get half the number of chromosomes and then you have to make a tail and then hold motor assembly. And that is the most profound transformation of a cell in the body. It takes about three weeks to go from that stage. And we're learning now. It's a lot of it's vitamin A driven. Three weeks of the six or seven to make a sperm. And then it goes, then it's complete and non-model and it's packaged. It has give us some size comparison. Before the tail is on, what is the size of that cell? Probably similar to a, you know, a lymphus half the size of a lymphocyte. Okay. Or half the size of a red blood cell, a couple of micron. And then the tail makes it, 35 micron tail. Yeah. So really magnificent engineering feat. It's got micro two bills in the middle. And there's these sort of links to the tail. It's like a kite and the engine runs and it tail lags. And it's a remarkable 300 genes control movement of sperm alone. You know, there's mitochondrial DNA in there, all that stuff. It's just wildly compact. 10 times more compact than any other cell in the body. From mitochondrial density standpoint, from any, from a cytopazic standpoint, a nuclear standpoint, it goes from histones to proteimes. So the DNA is condensed a lot more because it's got to go on the road. Right. So it's got to be packaged really well to survive outside the body and be in good shape. Because it's, you know, it's the, it's the transgenerational. So a lot of energy in that. And then during the epidemics, which is a collecting duct, which most people don't know about. Sorry. One other question, where is the ATP or carbohydrate rate or whatever the glucose stored in the sperm? Sword probably in the cytoplasm and in the tail. Okay. It's like a, you know, when you think about a rocket ship with its payload, it uses a solid fuel, obviously, as opposed to a liquid fuel. It's packaged for that one shot. I assume it's the same here. There's no transporters to bring glucose in or anything. It has its solid fuel and one shot go for broke. A try. Yeah, it is a lot like a rocket, isn't it? It is a lot. So that's going to bring the physics in, the physics. So then there's two week period where it stays in the epidemics, which is a, basically a 35 foot tubule with estrogen and there's a lot of post-modification of the sperm. The epidemics is 35 feet if you stretched it out. Ah, flier. And just for folks, 700 feet of tubules in the testus. The epidemics is on the back of the testis of the carbohydrate. It's a carbohydrate organ in the back. Yeah. And this will come to this. I'm sure later, this is prone to infection and that'll probably factor into maybe some of the issues that deal with fertility. Yeah. Okay. So epidemics has been relatively understudied, but it has actually become very important epidemics, ohms. And there's a lot of modifications. We don't really understand. I wrote the chapter for our textbook on reproductive physiology. And it really is a lot of work in the 50s and 60s, but now we're being understand, like DNA fragmentation and the quality of sperm is driven by the epidemics. A lot of the quality of sperm, not the shape and stuff like that. And things that have based on its residence time within the epidemics. And what other environmental influences that occur there, because the epidemics is not as walled off from the body as the testuses. Imminologically, in other words, it's more susceptible to drugs, exposures, heat, et cetera. Testuses very walled off. Very little happens in the testis because the serotonous cells that line the tubules have a blood-brain barrier, blood testus barrier. Same as the brain. It's highly protected. As protective, yes, Harvey Cushing at Yale did that in the night late 19th century. It took brain dead patients and injected them with die, methylene blue, I think. And the blood brain barrier came about when it, nothing went into the brain. And nothing went into the testicle. The two areas of the body that were completely immune from normal transport processes. Well, let testus barrier. So the two things that we know happened in the epidemics after production of sperm are motility improves. So sperm begin to learn progressive motility. So they start moving forward as opposed to not moving or moving at circles, which is important. And the most curious thing is they learn how to smell. And meaning there's basically a chemical signal that they need to be able to track to, which I'm assuming is the egg. So the follicular fluid. So they actually detect follicular fluid. So if you take testicular sperm and inseminated into a uterus with insemination technology, it'll just be killed. If you take an epididimal sperm and you do that from the top of the epididimus, it'll maybe run in circles and it'll be killed by the immune system of the female. It has to go through that whole epididimal cycle. So it's at the end of the epididimus where it's stored. And that's how many weeks? Two, ten to ten to fourteen days. 600 million sperm live in a bucket, a pot of soup called the cod epididimus. And you ejaculate from that pot, which tells you a lot about sperm quality because it can get old. But that's sperm, if you put in it, will know exactly where to go and it'll move forward. Because it's like a shark sensing blood in the water. One part per billion of follicular fluid can be sensed by a sperm. So that's incredible. So it is literally an olfactory sense. It's a smell sense that sperm have for the follicular fluid. So they know exactly where to go. Again, it's, you have to wonder how many years it took to perfect the system, right? You do have to wonder, do we know what the chemo receptor is? Yes, it was published in Nature recently and something that's really interesting. So it's an olfactory type receptor. Do we have anything else that we can, is there any smell, Peter? Yeah, is there anything like what is the most noxious thing that we can smell with our nose and at what concentration can we detect if? No idea. Yeah, because I wonder just for comparison. Give me a minute. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I've always thought about this. If I like to hunt. And so anyone who's ever bow hunted, especially, knows that animals can smell at a level that we can't even fathom, right? They can smell us literally a mile away if the wind is just blowing their direction. So it's always seemed to me like we have really, really insufficient noses, right? We were given lots of superpowers in many ways, but smell wasn't really one of them. I think I would agree with that and it also say that if you, if you block a sensory bank of the five yet others increase remarkably like I'm Braille. I mean, I'm a micro surgeon, I, this doesn't matter as a lot, but I can't do Braille. Or hearing, I think you can crank it up. If you lose a sense and you see that with people who are deaf from you. In terms of your ability to see and I don't think seeing better is really the issue, but hearing and smell, I think it can crank up. So one part per billion, this is kind of remarkable. So you mentioned that at the base of the epididimus is basically the launch pad. How many are stored in that half a billion? Half a billion. So five ejaculations. Yep. Okay. That's a pot. And what's the time to rebuild that? You mean to fill the data? What's your data? Which you fill? I don't know. And the rate of the reason I ask is if, if we're going to come to this, I'm sure, but is there a frequency of ejaculation that is too much that if a guy is say ejaculating every single day is that insufficient to get a complete replenishment where if he's having infertility, you would say you can't move it to every other day or whatever the number is? So that's a great extrapolation of the pot of the pot of soup idea. And so on that note, I would say typically we recommend every two days of abstinence between Essex every other day is too authorized. Right. But not for the semen alphas. That's for conception. Okay. Because depends on what old you are in your biology, but most men need a day or two to refill to recharge completely a day or two. So that's why we do that. That's why recommend that. That's sort of a generalization. Some men are fine every day. Okay. I had a guy once who had to banks burn for hepatitis treatment. And he was like, Mickey Rork. He had a wooden leg and he was about 50. And I said, you're going to need to abstain for a couple of three days to do this semen alphas. So we could stamp I want it to be optimized when he looked at his partner. He goes, and she looked at me and she goes, he grabs, he grabs him and says, he can't do that. He's every day, he can't do that. I'm always going to do. So he was panicking. He had to hold off for a day. I was like, I said, often I have sex. He said twice a day every day. Like, look, so that was great. Then I had one man wonderful orthopedic surgeon at Stanford. And I asked him on my questionnaire. I said, how often do you have sex? And he wrote 0.001356. I was mad. He divided once a year. Well, 0.00 weekly. 0.00155. I was like, you know, avogadro's number right. Like, which man he was so frustrated that he was. It was a beautiful way to say that. It was the point zero zero one three five five. Yeah. So anyway, the. Yeah. So that's so there. For a similar analysis for diagnostics for infertility, when you, when you abstain longer, your sperm count will rise, but your motility will fall because it's older. So there's a, you know, there's a there's a max curve that you're optimizing for, which you would say is three days would be about right when you're not going to gain that much. You're not going to lose that much motility after that. It starts going. So there's sort of biological variability, which we try to minimize when we do the semen analysis. So two to four days of abstinence. That's a different period than what we're recommending for sex, which is every other day. And that's based on knowing the journal paper where you looked at, they looked at, I think 700 couples and they had them keep diaries. It was a Boston based paper. Keep diaries of how they had sex when they got ovulated and when they got pregnant. And then they said, do what you don't really do and then give us the diaries. And then they evaluated them and they found that having sex, say, ovulation is they 15 of the cycle. When they started having sex on 9, 11, 13, there were significant pregnancy rates. And every other day was the optimal interval. But even five days before and three days before there were substantial pregnancy rates before ovulation. But if you waited to ovulation and then had sex, that's about 20% of conception. So when you get the kit, don't react to it, predict in front of it. So front load the sex. Very important point. And why is that? Is that because there's a reservoir effect in this uterus? It's managed sperm survival for a day or two. So an end-on distress. If ovulation is day 15, how could a day 11 sperm survive four days? That's, it's nurtured once it's passed the vagina. But how many of them are surviving? Is it literally the lone wolf or is it the last hundred? Maybe some of this sperm bind to the oviduct and wait. Where is it remind me where the oviduct is? The uterus and then the philloping tubes and that's the oviduct and the oviduct is right below the where it is. They bind to the end of the phillium and just park. There's no egg. They'll just sit there and they'll walk. So again going back to our moon analogy, this is after you've done stage one stage two stage three. You're now out of gravity, right? Like it's actually not an energetic problem anymore. Right? You're not quite death, yeah, that's right. You've escaped the hostile environment. In this case of gravity. So now it's fun place. It's the right pH. It's warm. So do we have a sense? This would be a very interesting experiment of what is the longest duration that a sperm could survive for conception. In other words, to do the experiment, let's just make it as a thought experiment. You had a large number of women that you knew were going to ovulate on day 15. And then you would have them, you know, intercourse on day seven, eight, nine, ten. You create a histoplot or a distribution of what's the frequency of pregnancy across those things and kind of ask like what's the bottom fifth percentile, which is the theoretical possibility. And then the same thing after, right? You want to develop the value curve of the whole thing. But we know that once the egg is ovulated about eight hours and then it's over. Oh, this is a very important point. It really needs to be front. If it's only eight hours of survival, this is after ovulation, but eight hours instead, if it's not, this is a very, very left-tail curve. Correct. I did not know that. I don't want to sperm there ahead of time. So 80 percent of conception is naturally her at home. A curve when sex is front loaded as opposed to reacting to ovulation. And most of the apps that are available nowadays will tell you them. Peter, you're drawing a graph. I am. I have to draw. And it looks like it's algebraic. This is incredible. Okay. Yeah, just this is, it's easier for me to think about these things graphically. And to think that it basically shuts off at about eight hours. So I give some, some more physiology. I, there was a study that showed how long it took to make a sperm. And it was published in science, I think, in the 60s. And they gave men, uh, trudyated water. They gave men, yeah. They gave men radioactive hydrogen. Trudyated water. Yeah. And then they biopsy their testicles, which would never be done nowadays. But I did it all different. I gave dooderated water with a, with a group at Berkeley. And we gave healthy men, uh, durated water for a week. And, and then we checked with the first sort of dumb question, why didn't they just measure the ejaculate? Why did they have to biopsy this, the testicles? Why did they just want to, to swan in the bus from out of Genesis? But we didn't, we had a little bit of a section. It's a torture, the guys. But they weren't, I don't know. What, that's wild. But that was the best data. And we did dooderated water, which is not radioactive. And we could measure that. So we gave them, a dose. And then we watched their ejaculate weekly. Yep. And we looked for when they rated the hydrogen showed up in the, in the DNA. And it was an average of 74 days. So normally say three months to make a sperm. So somewhere we're 42 days. And that's making that's going to the epididymus and getting ejaculated. So that's, you know, so I'm so, we talked about maybe two months in the testis and two weeks or a week or two in the epididymus. And then maybe a couple of weeks to ejaculate. And this was all the average 74 days. So actually, it changed the timeline enormously to a much faster one. That. So 74 days. So when you do anything to a man for till, you wise, you, you're not going to expect to see anything change for at least two and a half months. And when you talk about full replacement of that seam and it's probably, it's probably in the being 90 days. When it's all replaced, the pot is replaced. Yep. So that's a limitation of what we do. Because 42-year-old women want now. And we have three to six months. When I did a study on fixing varicocials, which is an infertility problem in men, it's surgery. And I looked at the mean time to conception. It was about seven months after repair, which is two cycles of sperm production. So let's now define infertility. Again, we've been using this term quite a bit. But I suspect that actually has a formal definition. So one year of inability to conceive after having after after six, using six. Okay. So. Doesn't have to be timed in, of course, just has to be whatever the couple does when they think they're trying to conceive. Okay. When someone shows up in your office, is it usually after they've gone down the rabbit hole of trouble shooting the female partner or are people doing this in parallel? There's a large bias in Western worlds about how infertility is evaluated. And it's a complex, the reasons are complex. But I would say my practice is not typical. So most of my patients have been through a lot before they come to me. And typically, I think Keith Jarvis' data was good in about 23% of men get a formal evaluation for infertility before couples go through IVF in North America. And how does that differ from the rest of the world? Let's say from the biggest sense studying the rest of the world. But there are countries like Germany and Spaniard single ensures and government pays. And it's also recommended by society guidelines. Like American society, reproductive medicine, WHO, etc. That both partners get evaluated simultaneously. But the bias is female gets very evaluated for lots of money. And the men typically may get a C-men analysis, but may not. And it's very complex reasoning there. It's a different beast. You know, they're not part of the problem. They refuse to do it. There's a lot of denial. It does get at your masculinity a little bit to get checked out and things. So it does go deep for men. It can be a little bit of a problem. So I would say that lately with large ensures coming in progeny, may even and things like that. You're seeing a lot more men up front, which is fabulous. And we can have long discussions about the biomarker concept why that's good for a field. And good for men's health. And good for longevity. Okay. So let's talk about your work up. What do you do when a guy comes in and what are the things you want to know about him? So getting a guy in is a great. Usually they're dragged in by their partners. Usually the partners come along to make sure they show up. For me, it's one visit. So we do one visit and I do everything else where they are, where they are. I don't ask them to come in a million times anymore. So it's a very different kind of practice. But I try to get everything done in one visit because when you get them there, it's rare to get them there. And the physical example, so you do a history, a very thorough history, which is usually preceded by a questionnaire. I give 200 questions. And that has all the hot baths, stuff, and all the exposures they have. And they have to do that before they see me because I think it's a really important part of it. If you could pick one an multiple choice question, what matters the most is probably the history. Hmm. History of paternity matters. History of exposures matters. Etc. Physical exam, very important. One to five percent of male infertility can be due to a major medical issue, test this cancer, diabetes, things like that. So physical exam, varicocials is very important. You could be missing a vast difference. One in five hundred men have perfectly normal testicles, but no, they have a natural vasectomy. It's congenital absence of the vast. They're going to be sterile or infertile. Can you explain what that we haven't talked about? How have vasectomy works and why a guy still ejaculates, but is infertile? Explain what the vast difference? How the whole thing works in the plumbing? Right. So we asked, we didn't enter that question. It was the what's the seamen consist of? Yeah. So it's about 10 percent vaso fluid with sperm. It's about 80 percent, some of the vasco fluid, which is an accessory sexically and in the back of the prostate and about 10 percent prostate. So typically during ejaculation, prosthetic fluid, which is clear and sticky, will grease the barrel of the rethra, sort of pre-com. Then during the ejaculation process, the pellet of sperm gets pumped from the vast difference into a chamber called ejacatory duct. And this happens quickly. And then the cellanovesico is like a bladder contract sends it into the prosthetic urethra between the bladder and the the outdive world. There's two valves. One is the bladder neck. It closes and one is the urethra sphincter that we pee through and that opens and it gets forced out with muscular contractions. So that happens in seconds. Yeah. So therefore if the vasove runs is clipped, you're getting essentially 90 percent of the volume. You're just missing the 10 percent of the volume that contains the payload. So in 3,000 men I've done vasectomy zone at 30 years, two men have said, my volume went down and I said, really, one of them banks sperm and he had a similar analysis before and after and he did go down by 15 percent and he noticed it and I said, good for you, what do you want to do now? But it's so can be noticeable, but not usually. And so the colors are saying, the opacity is the same, the whole process of liquefaction to same viscosity, etc. So physical exam, do you need an ultrasound? How are you able to detect if a person is congenitally missing of as diverse? Pure physical exam. What you feel it? Interesting. So my fingers can feel two and a half millimeters and the vast difference is like piano wire. I mean, it is different than anything else in the cord. So I did a study of third of my men with absent vass were were only found out having procedures until I saw them. I usually just do the exam, but it is an expertise thing. Yeah, yeah, it's not like the PCP can figure this out. You have to be doing this all day every day. Yeah, I think you need to be trained on that. But if you're well trained, it should be a purely a physical exam. How what percentage of men are congenitally missing? They're one 500, one 500. What's common genetics, these in America is cystic fibrosis. So the big implication is these kids, these men can't conceive naturally. They have a natural use sperm retrieval techniques and IVF, but they definitely have the chance of passing on cystic fibrosis to a child. Why is that? Because the congenitally very interesting biology, but men with cystic fibrosis, the most common genetics in America, have no vast difference. Okay, so what's the venn diagram of cystic fibrosis and congenital lacking vast difference? The genes for that were discovered. It's a, you know, chromosome 7. There's 17, 1800 mutations of maybe 2000. So they clone the genes and got the variants in late 80s. And then they found that there's another group of men who are perfectly healthy to not have cystic fibrosis, which is a major metabolic disease with a short life expectancy better now. Those men had absent vast difference in the absence of disease. They took the genes set, and looked at them and they were the same. That's not as many. So you have homozygous or heterosygous. So you have a carrier, cystic fibrosis, we'll have an absent vast, but a full-blown CF patient, cystic fibrosis patient, we'll have no vast difference too. So it's a form-frust of cystic fibrosis, but it doesn't have all the chemical and metabolic side effects. So in other words, when you identify a man who does not have CF with a congenitally absent vast, there's a very good probability. He's a carrier of CF. Yes, and you can use you to find it, which we can genetically test easily. Okay. Yeah. And then you have to worry if there's a 4% chance in America anyway that a partner might carry it. There are two carriers. You have a 1 in 4 chance of having a very affected child. Yep. So that's the big concern in my practice. And I'm proud to say in 30 years we have no CF children. Okay. You know, it's all about good engineering and doing it right. So that's the vast difference part. What else on physical exam are you looking for? So cancers, infections, epidemitis, yeah, tell me about epidemitis. Obviously anything that interferes with that section of the journey is going to be critical. And so remind me, is it EBV that we typically are measles, moms, what's the infection, moms, moms. Okay. But that's typically, yeah. So among viruses in the world, there aren't many that get into the testicle like other things. Very little gets into the testicle similar to the brain. But the mumps virus does it about a third of the time when you're a child with mumps, you know, the parodid gland infection. It's a glandular disease. So it really only matters when you're puberty and you get mumps. And then it goes to lots of glands to go to your pancreas and cause diabetes. It can go to the salivary glands and then go to the testicles. It's some kind of, there's an open time open, open, open, you know. So just one more reason why everyone should really get the mmR vaccine when they're a child is like, we, you know, not with sending the tragedy of the DNA of children dying from preventable diseases. But this is, this is another non-lethal but significant complication of the flu. And it will cause viral necrosis and a deema of the testus. And then similar to a brain, it's in a calvarium, right? The brain is in a fixed base. So when it swells, you've got to do something because it can die if it swells too much. Testicles of fixed cavity with the tuna galogenia. And so if it swells too much, it necrosis. And then you get fibrosis. And then you get sterility. And it's, you know, I've got techniques where I can find sperm and lots of these men, really the pockets. But most of it, you're belating the testus. It's going to scar and die from eschemic necrosis. So Zika Ebola, these are, I mean, the CDC called me when these were coming around Zika, you know, Zika's been transented to semen because of the, and it's definitely issues with a child. And when these, when these pandemics were curing Ebola too, I got to call that the air was an Ebola patient who survived when did the Institute survive the hemorrhagic fever. And then a year later, transmitted Ebola to a partner who transmitted to six other men. And it was another outbreak in South Africa. Meaning the patient that survived Ebola, the virus managed to survive in the testies, somewhere. Okay. But it was transmitted sexually a year later when he was well. When he was asymptomatic, he had already developed immunity. Right. So there are, we don't know about tests, but we know that mumps will do that to the testus, but their Zika is also persistent in the semen. But in that case, you have to think they would, wherever the virus hung out, it had to be very, very immune privilege. Yeah. Or at low levels, like low viral loads, where there's no disease. I'm not sure. But these are, of concerning cases. But then it was transmitted at a low viral load and even lower viral load. Right. So it's tricky. Yeah. And there may be bubble with your glands. Maybe it's some of the skull. It's hard to know. But yeah, it's getting away. So, but most viruses don't go there. So the big one would be COVID. Right. What, what did COVID? There was a big deal about the AC receptor being in the lung, being in the testicle. And maybe COVID infection would make you sterile. There was one Zika paper in nature that looked at if you'd infect mice or there's rats with Zika that testicles shrive up and they get infertile. And that caused a huge scare in the field. But we really didn't see it. Maybe see it and see if we don't see it in fertility. And what is it about the Zika virus that does this? We're not sure. Why did it in rats? But it's a blood testus barrier thing. It's an amazing barrier and nothing really gets through, including viruses. But mumps does only a puberty. And Zika does. Zika doesn't have animals, but we didn't see it in humans. But I thought you said that Zika was leading to an insufficiency in cases. Yeah, but that could be seminal. That could be just in the semen itself. Not in the sperm. Like Ebola is probably seminal. It's not testicular. It's not on sperm. It's around sperm or in the fluid. That's the conclusion so far. So COVID, the big worry, was when this Chinese paper came out like, oh my God, it's going to the lung bind to the AC receptor. It's testicle has it too. It's going to make men's sterile forever. And there were cases of infertility with bad infections. And was that just the fever, which jiplocky does it even after a flu, or was that COVID specific? And we didn't know a couple of colleagues did some papers. One which impressed me was at out of cedars was a bunch of men, maybe not reproductive age, and died with fluorid COVID. So they got autopsies. And they looked for virus in different locations in the body. And I think out of 10 men or seven men, one had it in the testicle. So these are men with the words of infection. The highest viral load you can imagine and only one of them had it. So I believe that there is a risk of it. But at it's say in the thousand men, I've seen since COVID, I think there were two cases that I would say were unexplained. Where men were either fertile or had normal seeming quality had a bad COVID infection, maybe hospitalized, and three months later, sterile. So I think there's a low and tell me, first season right there, what is the phenotype of their sterility? Aside from the presentation that says I can't get someone present. So sterility means no sperm in the semen. And typically, if you measure the signals to the testicle. That's literally what it means. I'm sorry. Okay. So literally no sperm in semen. They stopped. Okay. I understood. Yeah. So it's a primary problem. So the third thing we do, history physical semen analysis is a third. Fourth would be hormones. And that's what we check in men too, because production of sperm is driven by the brain. So nothing happens to sperm being made without the brain telling you what to do. Same with eggs and controlling it's all. A homostatic mechanism with negative feedback. Classically, antibiotics to our users. Yeah, which I want to talk about in detail. Can we go back to semen analysis? You're looking for obviously the count and the motility. What else do you look for? So in the semen analysis, there's several features. I consider it sort of a poker hand. There's a volume, how much of the semen volume. There's a count concentration of sperm. That's numbers per mill. And then there's motility, which is percent motion. You do a forward progression. So how good is the quality of motion? And typically, some measure of shape called morphology. There's three liquid issues. Liquid faction, a glute nation, uh, in viscosity. And then you look for other cells that aren't sperm. They're called round cells. And you're going to be puss cells or immature germ cells that are early ejaculated early. And presumably you want to see fewer of those. Right. There's a number of less than a million normal. Okay. So if you ask me, well, how do I look at a semen analysis? That's a little different. I look at that as a poker hand with each card as a meaning. But they have a look. So if you said, what do you mean by that? So if the volume is low, that's one of five things. You're always going to find something. It's at the collection error. I call it first samples and drone. Guys not good at it. Right. You know, it's like, okay, I've got to put it in the cup. And I got to stop doing what I'm doing. Okay. You know, so, so you do a second sample. And then there's low testosterone can cause it. There's an apps and vast difference, which means you have an apps in some of us ago. There's a jack toy, a structure. And by the way, do you ever have that on one side and not the other? Or is that always okay? Yeah, that was very, very low segmental. Yeah. And so there's five real issues. So when I see a low volume semen, as a surgeon and as a doc, I mean, I'm going to find something. So that's really good. Other than that, the semen analysis, I think I've been published as saying it's a blunt instrument for fertility. Unless it's zero, you can't really say much about their fertility because people can see it all levels. And people are there. Are there, you know, obviously you rattled off a whole bunch of parameters that you can access there. But are there certain null states that don't exist where everything is amazing. But this one thing is horrible. Like do you see scenarios where everything is remarkable? Perfect. Motility, but bad morphology or specific morphology. I'm sure you haven't isolated. You do see isolated things. Right. So one of them is called, I call it syndromic sperm shape problem. So you can have a perfectly normal semen analysis, count motility volume progression, and the sperm looked terrible. And so there are rare conditions, one in 5,000, where you might have globos with spermia or two tailed sperm or pinheads sperm. So if you look at shape, 4% should look normal, just terrible. We've all discussed about why 4% of human sperm being normal is normal when 99% of animal species in the wild have normal looking sperm. But it's all a construct. Right. It's all a construct of who someone decided what normal is. But in men who have large abnormal forms like 4% of normal, if they're 1% normal. And you look at the abnormalities. I'm sure I'm still confused on that point. Are you saying that in a, you would consider it perfectly normal if only 4% of the sperm are more phologically perfect and 96% or not. And that means the 96% that are not could be pinhead could be double tail, a more fissive tapering in it. Going back to the original. That's a math petition. That's not a great number. Is it? No. And if you look at marine species, 99, 9, 9 look perfect. If in the wild. Yeah. And presumably that's because they're environment is so much more hostile. Like they're doing this all in the ocean. I don't know, but it's, it's amazing that we're that good with the sperm. But again, it's a construct. It's like putting stars ordering stars in the universe, Cassiopea. Someone named Kruger said, this is what our normal sperm looks like. And but we know that two tailed sperm have double tailed. I mean, it might be the two tail might not be the worst thing in the world. It's just extra rockabusters. But what about the pinhead? What is the pinhead and why? There's no nucleus. It's a tail. So that's a true problem. Yeah. It's like a little tiny head and moving along. So if you, if you, if you rule out, if you, if you give some buddy credit for their two tails, what's, what is your normal go up to from 4%. Oh, it depends. But maybe 20. Okay. So they're still 80%. But they will fail. They will fail. They will fail. They're going to be amorphous, the heads of a little rounder, heads of a little narrower. Those are called stress patterns. Some things like hot baths and varicocials and smoking will do that. We just do that bad. All right. So in the case of 1% normal, you've got to look at the 99% because that's not the story. The stories and the other, the other chunk, right? Yeah. And if they're all looking the same, then it's in drumic and then you have a problem. I see. So the more homogeneous the abnormalities are, the more likely that you have a peculiar ideology. And that's hard to fix. I mean, they'll fail with sex. They'll fail with inseminations. They'll fail with IVF. They'll fail with IVF and XC. And sometimes with global subspermia where they're called lollipopsperm, they just have a big round head with no acrosome. There's all nucleus and there's some of the components. They'll just bounce off an egg. They'll never work. They'll never do work naturally. And to get them to work with IVF, you have to single sperm inject them into the egg and then shock the egg with calcium to a calcium or pz electric to get it to sort of to actually fertilize. Because it also introduces the sperm is important with fertilization. Not only has the bind, but the calcium channels are regulated by and what shuts to doors to polyspermian and egg is calcium activation. This is the reason why even if you launch a hundred sperm at an egg, it's only one that can get in because the first guy that breaches sets off the calcium channel that shuts the, I mean, the star wars space analogies here are just phenomenal, right? Million years. Yeah. Yeah. Million years. No more breaches in the whole. So there's so more biology can matter a lot, but it's very rare. So I'd say twice a year in my practice, I'll see this because everything's failing and everything looks normal and they ask me what's going on and I'll look at it really closely and say you have this issue and there's not much we can do to treat it. Now we're going to try sperm sorting technologies which are on new in the market, microfluidics and things like that and I've been throwing that at them. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. And is that something that we know the genetic underpinning of? We're getting their PLZ's A to deficiencies. One of them recently discovered that that runs the calcium channel which tends to be associated with certain look like locals of sperm. Yeah. So it's like coming around. Think about that for a second from an evolutionary perspective. That that's Paul. That is the single least desirable genetic mutation you could acquire. Yeah, unless you're not making sperm. Yeah, but this is a dead end to the genome. Right. Right. So does that mean it is only an and acquired mutation never inherited? I mean it can't be inherited presumably unless it's home as I guess but even still. That's one of the 50 we throw off in each generation, 50 mutations. Yeah, that's just incredible. I think what I would like to emphasize in this podcast is how fluid evolution actually is and it's sperm driven and it's transgenerational. So if you ask me what's the theme for today? It's a sperm matter a lot. A lot a lot more than we've given them credit for. All right. So let's talk about so basically just rounding out the seamen out houses, physical on the seamen analysis, what if motility is the problem? So I look at in my poker analogy of the hand, if you have anything looks good but the motility is low, I think of short-term toxins. So not severe severity. So things like exposures, so medications, I think about habits, pot, smoking, hot beds, I think about behaviors, lifestyle, I think about so I look for an exposure in that individual. Basically picked up on the history. Varacocille is an exposure, things like that. And if the count down and the motilities down, I think of a large severe exposure. So there's a there's rural flushes and there's fortified and there's two of a so I would think of more of so my goal when I see that seamen analysis, see that patient is to figure out if he's not normal. Why? And by the way, do you get that analysis the day he's in the clinic with you or is that something you follow upon an appointment with? Pretty much have it in my hand when I see them either. They give it to me or I get one, I want that there because that's when I look at them I'd like to have that in front of me to say, what kind of poker hand are you playing? And this is something that's standardized and automated through my go microfluidics. How is the how's the assay actually done? So the guy ejaculates and it takes it to a lab. Oh, I mean how's it used to be done manually? Okay. And now it's done with the hemsatometers and like it's done with machines. Okay. Peter assisted seamen analysis does most of them in IVF groups. So it's really standardized. Oh yeah. Okay. I like the you know I like the bespoke suit. So I like the hand made seamen. So when I have mine repeated I usually have someone do it by hand because there's observations I like which is hey, you know what, one percent more foology but all the others look like this. Those comments are incredibly valuable that you don't really get from a computer system that's seamen analysis. But it's faster and you don't have a lot of human effort involved with a computer. Are they using AI for this yet? Yeah. I mean some people are for sperm selection a little bit. But yeah, there's a lot of stuff to help out. And now it will be really helpful for a morphology to standardize it because one man and Kruger in South Africa correlated bad sperm shape with IVF outcomes and did not find that they were good when the sperm looked bad. That's what the four percent came from. But it's really hard to do that every time and do it well because it's so hard to do. Well, helping AI and she learning can help standardize the look. Because sperm, you know, it's just this hard. Yeah. Given how good AI is at image recognition. This should be like this should be a one foot pot. Yeah. Okay. You mentioned hormones. You were obviously alluding to LH and FSH. What else are you looking at testosterone? Right. So it's a abnormal amounts of sperm. Yep. You need a proper amounts of testosterone and FSH. Think of it as a flowering a plant. You need the water. You need the sunlight. So if testosterone and FSH are key to getting normal amounts of tea, testosterone, you're going to need LH, which drives it. Same in women. You know, these are all named in women and females. So that signaling is really important. So there are cases of genetic infertility like common syndrome or men aren't making any sperm, but they're just not sending the signals down and you can just give them the signals with injections. Sorry. These men are not making FSH and LH. No. So they have virtually no testosterone. Right. Okay. Norse sperm. But you can give them the signals. Yeah. So H, C, G, FSH injections and they will be fertile. Oh, so if you gave those guys, so is the problem in the pituitary not the hypothalamus? No, it's it's the alfactory node in the hypothalamus. So they don't smell either. So could you give them chromid and would they make no? No. Two turns not not working. Yeah. It's the G and R H is the G and R H is not to a turn. Okay. God. So what about estridile? Does it play a role? Yeah. So estridiles often estridiles sort of a mild poison for male infertility. So everyone needs estridile level. Female hormone levels testosterone gets converted to estridile. So that's a byproduct of it along with DHT. And then estridile goes back to the brain and is a feedback. So if it's there, the brain knows how much testosterone it's making. So if there's too much estridile, the brain senses it's of negative feedback, senses hate. There's too much of this. So let's make less testosterone. So it will lower your testosterone depth higher. So when estridiles made it gets metabolized differently than testosterone, it goes to the liver or to fat. And a Roma tases converted to something else or testosterone gets converted to female hormone and romates us. So you can get high levels being obese or having liver dysfunction. So alcohol, you know, how it calls, roces, hepatitis. It'll rev it up and it'll make a lot more estridile level. And there's some medications that do it too. And that will act in lower your testosterone, which will lower sperm production because you're not watering the plant. If you correct for testosterone, so in other words of the guy has normal FSH, LH and testosterone, is there an estridile level by itself that is problematic? Not usually. Okay. So it's really only high estridile in the context of suppressed testosterone. That's when you would act on it. If you see that there's a low count and that testosterone's low. And you could say you need to lose 100 pounds, which is the the key secret for everything, right? But you can also give a Roma tases inhibitors like weight lifters use to keep their levels down. Okay. So those are four big pillars. Anything else besides the history exam, the analysis and the hormones? And then to usually do two semenalces, three weeks apart or more, to get a sense of things because it varies quite a bit. So a lot of a very important point is that the semenalces, any feature of that semenalces vary by 50 to 100%. So never make a decision on one semenalces. It's really hard. Yeah, especially if it's the first one as you said for all the right. So I could do a lot of consulting for the FDA and they do, you know, they do medications and reproductive age men and they're trying to show the semenalces that are going to the FDA and they're saying, can you help us interpret this data for the FDA? I said, garbage in garbage out. I mean, there's so much variability. You really can't say anything. It's really hard to get. So you have to do at least two samples. And it's still very spider. There's interobserver variability, who knows the semenalces. There's biological variability on wetter systems like so that's the big problem with studies. So what percentage of drugs that are going through an FDA approval process are having a semen analysis as part of the evaluation? I don't think many. Why is that? Because usually the indications aren't reproductive age men and women for some of them. If they do, they'll do animal models. They want to human states to do animal models. They'll do beagles, so mice and beagles and if there's no fertility effects, they don't really look at semenalces and those, they'll look at fertility effects in animals. If there's nothing there, then they'll probably not require human studies. If there's any suggestion of a problem in the animal models, which is a million dollars of work. So if you ask me why I patented this amounting on your stem cell, I want an in vitro test for human infertility that we could use instead of animal models. Save the animals, save a million dollars, do an in vitro's manager and this is model and see what if there's an effect at all. It just seems to me that in this day and age with people reproducing at older and older ages, we shouldn't just assume that because we've developed a drug for blood pressure or diabetes that it's not going to be used by people with fertility. I'll give you a silly example. Have GLP1 agonists been tested for fertility? Okay, well, because it's sort of an off-label use of a diabetic medication. But it's no longer off-label. It's an on-label use today. But it looks like it might be out of the limit. But even if it was on label, I mean, I just using that as one example of a drug that was initially approved when we thought, ah, this is going to be for people who are not having kids, but the truth of it is, you're going to have lots of people that are trying to reproduce on many of these drugs. Absolutely, and you know, there are 80,000 chemicals out there that have our not been studied reproductively that are commonly in used in industry. European commissions are a little better off. They've screened them and they've warned about them, but America. Why isn't? I don't know. It's attention to detail. It's one of those things that just doesn't, I don't know. Is it under the purview of the FDA or the EPA? Probably a combination or maybe everyone's thinking it's the other person's job. I'm not sure. But they're untested in there out there. Well, why don't we just talk about some of those things then now? So this is, I'm sure, kind of a contentious topic, but as you know, there are lots of discussion around microplastics. So I don't know how far we want to go down that rabbit hole. I recently did a podcast on this topic. I didn't really touch on fertility because I just didn't see any great evidence. I talked more about things where I thought there was a little bit more evidence. Obviously with the microplastics story, there's quite a bit of smoke, but there's no real fire. My conclusion from the analysis was there is enough smoke that takes steps where they are reasonable and reduce your exposure to these things. So everything from microplastics to PFAS chemicals to EVALA, the thalates and even the PM 2.5. There's no reason to expose yourself unnecessarily this. If you can take relatively straightforward steps, eliminate 60 to 80 percent of your life, do it. Tell me what your impression is of the effect of any or all of the above on fertility. So all those sperm are made constantly and are susceptible to that. We know the testicles are pretty good place to me and insulated from exposures. I also think there's a lot of smoke there and there needs to be in need to be sorted out, but such, but the 80, 60, 80,000 chemicals that are being used that aren't really tested at all. I think the only way to know is to do do stem cell and vitro testing as much as you can before you put it on at the IDI Investigation drug stage, not at the final stages for clinical trials, but early on do it. So you're screening a way in advance of getting into clinical trials and where the money gets big. But I think that men, there are windows of susceptibility and men, unlike maybe with women whose eggs are constantly exposed to toxins, men have windows and one of those windows is birth and early development, the first 12 weeks of life. So there's a good idea early. When all organ systems are developing, including testicles, I mean, Sean is fond of this one with maternal beef conception, estrogenized beef consumption, their sons had lover sperm counts when they were 20 years later or something. So I think that's a window of susceptibility also think, you know, puberty is a window of susceptibility when things turn on. So I think if exposures and those moments are probably going to matter the most to men, I don't know, I don't know about other times. And what is your advice to a guy when you're giving him counsel on everything he can do? We're going to talk about everything. But on this particular domain, if he says, hey, should I stop drinking Starbucks coffees in those plastic cups with the plastic lids and do should I get a reverse osmosis filter in the house like where are you telling him to draw that line? I'm not great at that because the stress level goes up so much and I think the stress counterback balances any amount of microplastics you save. You double the stress and a man in testosterone level fall and then just production falls for a whole different reason. So my my my testosterone level when I left residency, oh, I bet. So how old was I 33? Should I had a pretty good? Yeah, total T, 220 nanograms per deciliter. Did you measure LH? I'm just probably low. Yeah, I'm sure FSH and LH were totally low. I don't remember that. I'm not referring to that secondary free testosterone of light. So think of me to four. Yeah, well the sleep deprivation the stress the so what the stress to stress is the sympathetic nervous system it's fighter flight you're running from a woolly mammoth. It doesn't know what you're running from it doesn't know whether it's sleep or travel or financial or emotional. It's just the body is we are cats and dogs. We have the same binary nervous system either you're on or you're off. And when you're on do you want testosterone? No you want cortisol you're running for your life. And do you want fertility when you're running for your life? And any species? No you're trying to save your life. So cortisol goes on testosterone is nowhere to be found for utilities. No it turn off all that stuff. Then when you outrun the woolly mammoth and you're behind a rock and you grab the berries and you catch a nap, boom testosterone shoots up because it's resting restore and you have to rebuild for the next run. And how quickly do you think that it occurs in humans? How quickly? Yeah, how quickly can that dates easily. We can reverse onxtrust. Yeah, is it? It's not we love acute stress. All species love acute stress. We love that starvation intermittent fasting. It's really healthy. But not low-level chronic stress. Not connected to your computer. Not your emails. Not the workday that never ends. Terrible for us. And the best manifestation is erections because the erections will fall if you're under stress too. Pinos are the mind of its own according to the Vinci. I had a guy come in, you know, he came in. He was like 25 and San Francisco, a startup guy and he comes in and says, I got to see you. I said, why? I said, I lost my erection yesterday. He's 25. He said, first time. He said, yes. I said, all right, come on in. Sweet Coupton. And he's got his act to go. It looks good. And I said, what happened? He said, you know, I just thought my erection, I did never happen to be before. I think something's wrong. I said, okay, tell me about yourself. Just getting his a round of funding. He's traveling half a million miles a year. He sleeps like three or four hours a night if any. And he's constantly running and I said, congratulations. It's been logging to the human race. This is amazing at the first time. I know. It's like, we're talking about it. You're not in purvious stress. Stress has a defects. So clearly, the fertility women who are sort of marathon but how the great study was a moderate exercise, moderate exercise men, a road blog on this called, can you be too fit to be fertile? Moderate exercise went to extreme exercise measured as two hours a day of viotu 80% maximum capacity. So pretty heavy workouts for 12 week periods. So moderate to extreme and then back to moderate sperm counts fell by 40% when it moderate to extreme and constant sperm testosterone fell by 50% and then went back up. So that's a kind of a, and there's also military studies of men under acute stress during, during, you know, hell weeks and training, where they were taking their testosterone and LHs and they were dropping by about 50% with severe stress. And that's okay for a day or two or a week. But when you're doing it chronically, we're not built for that Peter. We're not built for chronic stress. That's a long-termity issue. Yeah. Let's talk about the use of antibiotics steroids. So, or let's talk about it more broadly with sort of the three most commonly used approaches to testosterone replacement. So the way I see it is the three most common approaches are using either clomophine or inclamophine using Hcg or using exogenous testosterone in one of its derivatives. Would you agree that those are kind of a big three? Okay. We'll just briefly highlight for everybody why each is a little bit different. Exogenous testosterone, you're just giving testosterone the body senses it and immediately shuts down the hypothalamal natural production. Yeah. So LH and FSH will go to zero. Testosterone will be as high as you want it to be. There's no limit how high it goes. I've had a couple of people on this podcast who have blown my mind with how much testosterone they've talked about taking not clear how that's possible but nevertheless they're doing it. Okay. Hcg is synthetic lootinizing hormone. LH so you give a person Hcg they will make testosterone. So it's endogenously produced. But they're making so much of it that they'll also suppress LH and FSH. So LH and FSH will come down. Testosterone will go up. And then clomophine or inclamophine block the signal of estrogen at the level of the hypothalamus. So the hypothalamus thick thin. Oh my gosh. We need more testosterone. It ramps up FSH and LH production which has the same effect as making more testosterone. But you'll now see high normal FSH and LH. Yeah. And the two different classes are the LH and clomid versus testosterone. So unlike testosterone, shutting off the natural production that LH, the ACG and the coma phenincloma phenyl stimulate natural production. So you keep your testicular size. You maintain your fertility. Whereas the others you're going to shrivel up your testicles and not maintain your fertility. And you can't generate levels that you can with the exogenous testosterone. But these you'll never get to 3,000. You can't do that. Because it's tightly regulated. So question one, if a guy is taking exogenous testosterone. And let's just say he's been on it now for a few months. Is he able to create sperm? Not 95% chance he's not. Wow. While he's on it. Yeah. Understeady. Can he create it once he's stopped and will definitely address that. But just to be clear, even a couple of months on exogenous testosterone in any form, injection, topical, oral, whatever, you basically have shut off the ability to make sperm because your testies themselves have shut down. Right. No signals. Yep. Okay. No gas to the engine. Now there are some ex-newants. Okay. So there's there are formulations that are topical that are less potent that way, less inhibitory than injectables. So there are variations in the spectrum of exogenous testosterone that will maintain some of your fertility. There are formulations. At least the, I don't want to go so far as to call it the marketing material. But for lack of a better term, the marketing material is suggestive that the more frequently delivered variants. So for example, the intranasal variant, which is delivered three times a day, the oral variant delivered twice a day have a less of a negative impact because they're producing far lower surges than if you did a weekly injection. Is that what you're referring to? Yeah. So they do more physiologic. Yep. They're in the normal range more. What gives you side effects from testosterone, including sterility is the spike too much. Yeah. So in your experience, has that born out. Yeah. So men, you've seen men taking the testo three times a day doing an nasal keeping their sperm counts. Keeping their sperm counts. Okay. That's interesting to note. What about the oral testosterone the twice a day? Love it. So in testos when I can that, I can that and that can no wait. And it was not available in America for 50 years was available in Europe. And a couple of researchers that you say, as been wife team, beautiful. Decided what happened was we were worried when we took oral testo three to the lower, right to the the areas system and go to the liver, cause liver cancer. So it was always verboten. Even though there was no evidence this was happening in Europe for 50 years. Yeah. They wasn't not much. It's a bit of the approved E a approved it. So the so this group came up with a way to get it metabolized through lymphatics. So it can absorb through lymphatic and never hits the liver. And it's really good. I mean, there is a non-respons rate of around 10 percent. So 10 percent men, some like gels too, 15 percent will respond. There's groups that won't respond that well. But it is really good. And you can describe it. Oh yeah. You know, I'd be interested to hear your experience with it. We have prescribed it now to maybe a half a dozen patients. One of the silly challenges we have with it is we actually have no idea if they're therapeutic because trying to get their blood drawn to figure out when to draw their blood to actually see the that for example, if a guy takes the drug at eight o'clock in the morning and then at one o'clock in the afternoon, which is sort of what we're told is a great window to take it so that you get that middose, middose, right? If he does his blood draw at seven o'clock the next morning, he's been 18 hours off drug. He has unmeasurable testosterone. He's going to show up at 200. He's going to look like I did 50 20 years ago. His LSH and FSH are still completely suppressed because that doesn't go away over 18 hours. But you know, I don't know what to, I don't know how to interpret like what is he walking around at during the day, which is what I care about. It's hard to know. I mean, usually you don't want to do it right away too. So you want to give him a couple of weeks to stabilize he niestatically, right? But usually you can get pretty good levels because the half life isn't that short. They say it peaks in five hours. So I don't know what the half life is. I feel like 12 more like 12. You wouldn't dose it at 100% decay, right? You have a dose at 50%. So you show he's probably not responding. We can check it at different times, but it's probably not much of a response. And what are you dosing it at? It comes in 100 and 2. It depends. I usually go to the middose 298 twice a day and then you can double it or go have whatever. I usually start out not the lowest dose. Yeah. And it depends what you're trying to solve too in the problem, right? If you want them, you're not going to get them to 800 or 1,000 very easily. You can get them, you know, 4,500 to 600, 600, 700 pretty well. But no side effects. I haven't seen anything. Maybe a couple dozen men really well tolerated. Interesting. So this is not something you use when you're trying to get a guy from 300 to 1000. You could, but not probably not the first choice. Yeah. And now you're taking 500 twice a day or something crazy like that. Yeah. And twice a day is a big deal for men. It is. Yeah. And what about the test? How are you? Are you used like never, you've never been tolerated. Yeah. What's the experience like? We've never used it. Well, have a flu and try to get you're just hostile level off. You can't do it. You have to spray it in your nostril each nostril three times a day. And it's gooey and it's gel-like. And I just, and within a week we'll call and say, I can't do this. Yeah. We've had more luck getting women to use this. Maybe. Yeah. Okay. So let's go back to the biggest other difficulty. The two types of testosterone replacement or supplements. One is sort of, we'll call it the natural ones. The inverse is the exogenous ones is the side effect profiles different widely. It's very difficult to get polycyteemic or thickening in your blood with the physiologic levels. It just doesn't happen very often. I don't think I've seen it once or twice. But if you take testosterone as honestly, you're at risk for polycyteemia or blood thickening. So testosterone stimulates epipotent. And the kidney, you make more blood. I have to eat love it. But if you went along flight and you're dehydrated, you're going to throw a clot. And people look at it for longevity. It's like it's very careful. Yeah. Because I've seen 70-year-old men want longevity and taking this stuff and then they have a clot and they have a stroke. And now they're 71 and they're not, they're not, they're the whole thing. And deep-frying that that the clot risk is proportional to hemoglobin hematocytes. And what level are you saying? It's time to try. It's time to try. I mean, the studies aren't broad, but drama-same just did another paper on it. And the most significant event occurring with testosterone replacement or supplementation is polycyteemia and events. And so the high level for hemoglobin 17, matricrate 50, you start seeing events happen about 18 and definitely 19. And one of the things we do with patients who are injecting testosteronecipionate is, and we have some patients who love doing this. I think it would drive me nuts if I were trying to do this. They injected every day. So they'll do 10 to 15 milligrams every single day. And it actually produces the same effect, which is they don't have the polycycemia because they don't hit their legs never hit these crazy peaks. You know, 10 years ago, everyone I saw that was prescribing this was prescribing the standard was 200 milligrams every two weeks, which was crazy. Yeah. So what is your typical injection schedule once a week or two twice a week? And I think twice a week, well, you can have the dose right? Yeah. So that is a little safer, but then it becomes the intensity and just a bit of a minute. I can't do it like that or whatever I want to pellet. So do you put pellets in? Okay. I do them all. Yep. And what's your, do you find that the pellet also? I don't know the kinetics of it, but I would imagine you're pretty super physiologic for a month or so, maybe. Yep. So pellets are like the long-term contraceptive for women. Yep. You know, in the arm, they put it in subcutaneously. We put it in the butt. And it's a couple of minute procedure in the office and it gives you, you don't have to worry about anything. There's no compliance issues. We don't have a lot of side effects or consequences from it. It's done with a trocar and a thick needle. And you get, you know, pretty quickly within a couple of days, you'll get a level and then it'll slowly decay pretty much half of it by three a month or so and then the rest by four to six. It's supposed to be a six month physiologic level, but normally it's four. Yep. Four or five. And, you know, men feel great for a while and they can feel it because it's slow, but it is even and you do have this risk of pithything, you know, things like that. But there's a three-month peri-break risk and then usually there's, when you're in the normal range it kind of goes away. So I don't see a lot of consequences with that if it's six months. I really don't. So let's go back to the the clomid HcG route. What is the, what is the extent to which fertility is preserve preserved when a man is on one of those agents? So clomid is, let me give it for fertility all the time. So I'd say, very good. Yep. It might even improve it. HcG depends on the dose. So like you said, high doses suppresses, so you to be normally, for earlier, you want LH and FSH going to the testicle. You want the water and the sunlight. You want the testosterone. If you've got the testosterone, what your FSH is, you don't have a sunlight, you're not going to bloom. So I usually add clomid to HcG if the dose is about 1,500 units, 3 times a week because that's going to start suppressing the FSH and clomid will keep it going and then your fertility is preserved. 1,500, 3 times a week of HcG is a whopping dose. You're saying beneath that, you typically don't have issues with FSH and LH suppression. Well, LH will because it's LH. Yep. But not FSH. Maybe 1,500 units start seeing it. Okay. So that's where you protect the fertility. Yep. And you will just give and what dose of clomid will you give on top of that regimen? Depends. I mean, usually half a pill a day. Half a pill, half a 25, half a 50, 50, 50 milligrams pills. Yeah, it's usually half. You give 25 every day. These are staggering doses. How higher these guys testosterone getting? Did testosterone is driven mainly by the HcG. So I shoot for the normal range of 500 to 1000. I don't. Yeah, that's a man. I ran a ballad guy. Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's interesting. I mean, we don't, we don't like clomophine at all. Um, just because, well, they're all bunch of reasons, but they have to do with kind of lipid stuff. But even when we would use it, we would probably use 53 times a week. So that's about the same. Yeah. 25, 25 a day. Um, but for most guys, that would be sufficient alone, even without HcG. But you're saying, okay, well, it's the HcG that's driving the team. We're just trying to protect it. If you say, what do you give on high-slicious monotherapy? Yeah. What would you give for clomophine? 12 and a half to 25, typically depending on how sensitive do you prefer clomid or enclomophine? Do you? So it's very interesting. Clomophine is really good. And it's an interesting FDA story. So, uh, clomid is not approved for men. And clomophine is neither. Clomid to prove for women and clomophine is not approved for either. Can clomophine's compounded clomid is available for 50 years. So a lot more data. And once this, this is, I remember was a trans-ice of your, so they're different. And the estrogenic effects are slightly different. Um, so I have enormous experience. I've five hundred sixty men on clomid and I have fewer on enclomophine. But, uh, it was developed for older men to preserve the preserve their testosterone levels as they age because the signaling tends to get weaker. The patuitare tends to get lazier. And this is the keep your testosterone levels up more physiologically than taking testosterone. So it went through some very good randomized trials that were published. This was clomophine clomophine. Okay. Clomophine. And they were done by reputable people and field and published. And then it went to the FDA for approval for secondary hypogonatism. So age-related changes, not, not primary, just a key to failure in age-related and your deficiency of aging male or Adam. Right. FDA sat on her for a couple of years and said, nope. Why? Good question. So it's published. They're good trials. It's safe. It's as good as clomid. And um, that didn't approve it. And I think it's hard to know. But I think the reason was that there's such an uproar about testosterone in America right now. And the FDA doesn't like what's happening. What happened is you can, you can, you can advertise your drug to the consumer now. Right. So you know all the, you know, the biological response modifiers for psoriasis, you know, all those drugs go on and take you five seconds on the benefits and the lesions go away and then 25 seconds on side effects. Right. So you can do that. If you do that with testosterone, what you hear is do falling asleep after dinner? Are you not as athletic as you used to be? Are your erections that as good as the used to be? There's 10 questions in the adult question here. And everything guys are going to be like, yeah, everyone who ages as those issues, right? So it's like no brainer if they go on TV, they're going to want this stuff. So the cats out of the bag and that's their stuck. And so now when any testosterone trial comes back, they're going to point out the FDA make sure that we point out the dangers of testosterone replacement. Okay. So this is part of that energy, which is, um, when we don't want another testosterone. So I think there's another reason Paul and it's everything you just said, but H C G and testosterone are schedule four. Which means you cannot prescribe them through like these testosterone clinics that don't even see patients and you know, are literally just not not being doctors, right? They're just sort of giving it to anybody who shows up in pays. It's a coin operated testosterone dispensary. But clomid and I assume by extension and clomophine are not scheduled, right? Which means you can coin operate those. And my guess is that's probably why the FDA is saying what it's saying is we don't, it's already bad enough that the clomid cat is out of the bag, but given that we don't want to put another one of these unscheduled drugs out there in the in the land of sort of shady medicine. And you know, the indications are pretty clear and they're really safe. You know, I, they're really safe drugs and I, I like the my, my effect is someone comes in who's young, who maybe wants kids, hasn't had them. And they have a low testosterone of 220. You measure their LH, which no one does, it's low, secondary have a gonism. So it's not a testicle failing, right? It's a signaling issue. And that's probably stress. So I say get rid of your stress and they say how do I do that? It's like a one, okay? So exercise, acupuncture massage or yoga. I mean, for men, I say physical activities, the best thing for sex. So as an aside during COVID, I had two groups of men. They said, what do I do in my life, some mess, you know, everyone's like some mess. So half of them had drinks at five o'clock, started drinking a lot. And the other half went out for runs. They got a pellet on, which most of the country did. That's a great story that helped them story. And then about six months later, these guys really, it's not working. And they started shifting over to exercise. So I was very proud of these guys. I was really happy with like nice because that's the best way to handle stress is when you have no control over things. Go for a run, go for a walk, get out there. It's so good for you. It's deep, decompressing, hold, get your mind off something, anything, surfing, whatever. So they don't do that. So I said, well, let's do this. I think what's happening is this. I think it's just stress. Maybe try traveling less or whatever. And then I'll give them a clone. And I'll say, let's try this for a couple for three to six months. And let's see how you feel. Sometimes it's sexual health issues. Elections aren't typically that dependent on testosterone. Typically it's other things. And so if that's the issue and I'll say, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Maybe maybe you were higher before. And we don't know that, but let's do something pretty safe and easy. And I'll double your testosterone with triplet. I'll see how you do. And then I'll check and let them at three and six months. How you feeling? I feel great or hey, it's not working. I feel the same. I was like, well, it's not testosterone related. Whatever your this symptom is you're having. You wouldn't have it with it to stop. We know levels of testosterone above what you should not have symptoms. Right. We know libido, we know erections, we know fertility, things like that. And what are the approximate levels for each of those? I don't know. Rections I would say the best study is about 290. Yeah. So most guys that are having difficulty with erections are above 290. There's some other issue. Usually. But you have to prove it to them. And I'm fine with that. Is that what this is safe? And that you know, you're convincing them. And then what about libido? libido I'd say 350 is sort of arranged. It's pretty sensitive and it's harder to call because there's a Beatles driven by so many different things. And fertility. fertility I'd say 300 is a good one. The start with how much FSH and LH. I don't know. Okay. And then obviously the other thresholds would be anabolic capacity like muscle, muscle mass and things of that nature. And mood tends to be a lot more variable in my mind. Absolutely. I think there's nits around testosterone. And those are some of them. But testosterone is a more cantailer and equilibrium story where if you're low, you have symptoms in your low. Those symptoms will get better when you go up. But then there's a point where it flattens out. And there's no increase or improvement in symptoms. Sexual health symptoms are classically ascribe to that. There are there are also it's a linear relationship in testosterone. That would be blood and muscle. Yep. So more is better for making blood, doping and also blood doping and also for muscle. Absolutely linear. Yeah. And with I I'll tell you why I find that interesting Paul. And I only learned that really in talking to body builders who were taking 500 to 2500 milligrams of testosterone a week. Because my initial reaction to that was you've already saturated the endrogen receptor probably five logs. I mean that's five logs. But like at least one or two logs earlier. Why? How would you still get it? And they're but they convince me. No, no, no, there's a real difference between 500 and 1,000 and 2,500 in terms of muscle mass. Which it sounds like you agree with. And I don't understand the physiology of how that's possible. I mean, how many anrogen receptors would you need to you have to upregulate them when in fact you'd be downregulating them. So I'm not sure, but it's not so the effect is indirect. The effect of testosterone muscle masses and direct. It's not that you're going to do it in create mass. You don't just create mass. What it allows you to do is recover from injury. Right. So if you push the system and you need two days to recover, you can go to one day. You can push it again harder. So that's what testosterone does in the primitive world. Right. If you're a caveman. There's even studies that show, by the way, that high enough doses of testosterone will increase muscle protein synthesis absent the stimulus. Absent the lifting stimulus. So it's the potential to recover that isn't proven. I'm not sure that's receptor driven. It might be several pathways going on that are logarithmicly better. But it allows you to push the system and go back and push it again. And that's how you build muscle. All right. So now let's talk about the guy who comes to see you. He's been on exogenous testosterone for three years. So he was given poor advice three years ago. He went to some shady back alley website. And they just, you know, he was 27 years old at the time. He just wanted to, I mean, this is tragically a very common story by the end. Right. So this guy's been on 200 milligrams of testosterone a week for the past three years. He's now 30 years old. He's met the love of his life and low and behold, they can't seem to get pregnant. So he's in your office. During the history, you find out pretty quickly. He's been on 200 milligrams of testosterone for three years. Tell me what his sperm analysis looks like. Do you see there are no, there presumably there are no sperm. I would bet 95% confidence that he would be no, I have no sperm in the same Okay. So 200 milligrams a week. So what are you telling him now? How are you going to solve this problem? So it's funny because a lot of guys come in and they look good. And I want to examine I'll say, are you taking anything? Are you taking because they never put it on their medication. Right. You never write it out on the history. You always have to get it out of it. If they look, if they're super jacked, but then they have tripled testes. Yeah. And there's zero. And then wondering, what, you know, right? So I will look them in the eye. So you're taking testosterone. And I'll look them in the eye until they answer. And if they look down and they don't say anything, I know they're on it. If they look in the eye and say, no, then I know they're not, but they'll always look away because it's this verboten thing. So this is the same, by the way, as I'm sure you experienced as a resident and the ER, the people that come in with foreign rectal bodies and abdominal pain, that's the one thing they emit from their history. Right. It's like, they tell you, you know, this is the last time I ate. This is this. This is this. But then you get the x-ray back. And there's like a candle stick in their colon. And then you say, what is your Hopkins? What about this? Can't, yeah. What about this candle stick? And they're like, oh, I totally forgot to mention that. Yes. Yes. That was lit. What I went in. Yeah. Yeah. So typically, I'll say, so my theory is about this is if he's, why is he taking it? So if he's taking a franabolic sense, you know, he probably has a pretty good idea. And I want, let's send you, it's give you a little research we're doing on the lifespan of anabolic store users. So remind me at the end of the story, it's give you a little brief about what I know about that. But so I, so when you take, so how he takes it matters? So if he's been in constant use injectables, that's the most suppressive of fertility. And if you turn a gland like a testicle off long enough, it's off. So I gave a lecture to the Antiquity on covering men from hypogannas, a men-young men. And I asked them a question at the end because I, my whole procedure comes from steroid users. I, I take notes when the anabolic guys come see me because they're really smart and they know a lot about reactions, biology. That's incredible. Yeah. But it's a science. Some of them are PhDs. I took notes for years and it came up my approach along with what I know, right? So it's very much in concern with cancer with them. So everything I say is sort of built on a large experience and it's called getting off the juice, the blog. And I have people read that blog, do it and say get about 80% of the way and then call me and say, you know, I need help here, now I'm here. Yeah, we'll link to this in the show. No, it's for sure. Getting off the juice and there's a PowerPoint in it. So the recovery is usually possible in young men, but it depends on how much they took, how long they took it and how they took it. If they do it like a cycling effort, that's the best. Right? So if you cycle steroids, you recover the bituotary, you get back to normal and you hit it again. That's actually quite smart. Constant use is not. Constant use for longevity, whatever. It's not a good idea for fertility. So that's going to be much more suppressive injections or worse than orals or any gels. So the next thing is how long, so I asked the end of the society, since I answered all their questions, I said, have a question for you, can you turn a testicle off like an a thyroid or adrenal gland if you suppress it enough? Can you turn it off for good? And they said, yeah, that's a bad question of ours. We can do that. And I said, because we believe it's always reversible in the field of infertility and men. And so that got me a little worried. And so now, it kind of worry about five to 10 years of use. After five or 10 years of use, you may not get it back. Either the ability to make sperm or the ability to make testosterone native. So we typically tell men in our practice, don't, you know, two years would be the absolute ceiling. Maybe are we too conservative? Maybe. Okay. Depends on dose, they get everything right. If they're too, 250 a week. Oh, I mean in our practice, it would be 50 twice a week. Yeah. Okay. I did a study, published a study on the fellow in Houston of a guy who took it for 25 years. And we drove at him with its gonadotropens as Hcg and FSH. And we didn't get anything, but he had testiculate. Now we got a a low number of sperm back. And I just had a guy from Louisiana and I come in 25 years of chronic use. I did a mapping procedure to find sperm in his testicle. And he's going to be having a kid, but he made a couple of sperm after, and that was for the baby. But you pump him full of Hcg and synthetic FSH. And get nothing. And then you have to look in a testicle because production can be low enough to be there, but not coming out. But this is the rescue protocol. It's LHFSH. Basically there's three ways to do it. One is never stop the testosterone suddenly. Interesting. Because men all hit the dogdobsical poop and they'll flop over like they have the flu. They'll feel like shit and they'll get right back on it. They're feel terrible because they have nothing going on. If you take the testosterone away, their persistence turned off. They're not making their own. It takes time to get the system to reactivate. So that's the hardest. So I always taper testosterone over what we're doing. Six weeks typically you have the dose for two, have the dose for two, and then offer two. And then you measure. And that's like getting out of the white water into the green, the green wall a little bit. So that's a little smoother. So taper. And then I offer them two options. One option is taper alone. Tap it with clomid or inclamaphine, which is a little quicker getting the pituitary to turn back on. So that will soften the blow of the feeling of feeling completely fatigued or more aggressively HcG and clomid. That's interesting. I guess there's no. It's about six weeks or there's no. So it's interesting. If you give clomid the pituitary will make FSH and LH, it doesn't shut off. It takes a while. Well, that's a way more cost effective approach than giving synthetic FSH's pricey. Yes, a couple thousand a month. Yeah, in America. Yeah. So is there any reason to do that over the clomid approach or is it just that it's faster? I think you might gain a couple of weeks of time. Okay. So for most people that's not sell a price worth. With that taper over a month or two, I usually check their T levels at around two weeks off of the last testosterone. And that's the lowest they'll be. And if they're in a good range there, that didn't you can use that as a predictor of their response. It would be good if they're in a normal range. Oh, really. Okay. So we want within a couple of months to see them back to 600. 300 would be okay. Okay. To make sperm. Okay. All right. But then to get them to where they want to be, depends on their symptoms and what they're happy with. I'm not sure. I'm not, you all know it'll say you wait longer to see how high you can get them. That's the lowest they'll be, but they'll be off of testosterone. And if they go along that taper and they're not tolering, I try to tell them, don't go back. Just stay there because time will help you. Yeah. And if you're not going to feel maybe that gray, but try to do this because if you don't, you'll feel back then we have start over. But if you just maintain it for a while, you'll feel better. And some of them dip a little bit. But remarkably, most men do really well with that taper. Now, before I want to get on to some other topics here, but just to close the loop on this, do you ever advocate kind of crazy ideas for guys that are using testosterone to use lower doses and then combine it with H C G just as we were talking about the climate plus H C G of growth. Okay. So not in unreasonable approach to combine, clomid with testosterone at low doses to preserve. Test your evaluation. I operated on a man to, to test a clear this primary tree of on a man who's asa spermic for genetic issues. And he was on testosterone for 10 years. And because he needed it, he was in statistical's or failing. And I said, you're not going to make sperm on this. So we put him on H C G, which didn't do anything for him felt terrible. And did that for a year? And he said, I can't do this anymore. I said, okay, or maybe a six months and I said, I need a little more time for you to be off testosterone. But since you've been on H C G for six months, I've been with those to do him on three thousand three thousand three times a week. That's a whole vial a week. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Then I said, okay, let's add in a low dose T gel to testosterone gel. Yeah. To get your testosterone up. And we're going to lower the H C G to 500 three times a week twice a week. And I did this primary tree of yesterday boom, plenty of sperm. How old was it? 35. Interesting. So you can, you can maintain whatever's going on in a testicle with H C G and take any testosterone you want. That was a that's on. And it's in the world. It was in, yeah. It was the here's that here's the catch though. The caveat is it was done in, I think, finished body builders. They were doing a cycle steroids huge amounts that took loados H C G 500 twice a week. And John Aimer has worked out in Washington has worked out all the exact doses. But 250 to 500 twice a week is a good dose for that. It keeps your intertesticular testosterone high. Keep your sperm production going. And they went on both concurrently for 12 weeks. And their sperm counts were normal the whole time. That any dose of T. Now what happened after that is people start saying you can preserve your fertility on testosterone placement, which is possible. The mistake the mistake the story. But it was only 12 weeks. And if you're doing it for three years and you miss your dose of H C G, boom you've done your cook, you're going to go to zero. So on a post testosterone without it. So you have to be 95% compliant. And do you think that there's a difference between H C G and Komet in that effect? Is it a adjunct? The comet doesn't work even near the C G is the one. Yeah, the comet doesn't improve intertesticular testosterone levels like H C D does it's ineffective. It will potentially make you more recoverable. If you do it 80% you'll be zero even though you're, you thought you might have a sperm count. But your recovery will be faster because it's done something. But the only way to maintain your current fertility is you have to be 100% compliant with dual therapy. You can't go on monotherapy with testosterone. Outside of fertility, given the popularity of testosterone replacement therapy today, is there another advantage to just doing dual therapy? Obviously for fertility, we wouldn't be talking about it. But can you think of any other reason why it might be advantageous if a guy can deal with the hassle in the cost? Yes, depends on the indication though. I mean, if everything but fertility, like any other health benefit, I think muscle mass. So with aging, it's a great one. I mean, you know, used to be growth hormone with age-wasting syndrome, things like that. I mean, muscle mass is a key for men, right? As I say, but I'm saying, as opposed to just being on testosterone injectable to do the dual therapy versus just monotherapy. I mean, if you're going to do some kind of therapy, if you've committed to doing therapy, I think I think the only reason would be if you want testicles to be big. I'm just just volume. I just created a new procedure to make testicles larger naturally by putting a fat injection in the hydrosale space in men on testosterone because they don't like their small testicles. So it's the equivalent of the Brazilian but procedure for the testies. Yeah, so it's all natural and there's no prosthetics and that you can't tell and it looks that makes nice and big and it's all testist fat grafting and it's fabulous. But that's not a care to prove. No. No. Yeah. Um, creatively approved. All right. So let's shift gears and talk about other modifiable factors. Let's talk about heat. We've talked about it a little bit for fertility. Yes, for fertility. So tell me about the impact of cold plunging and sauna and hot tubbing on for fertility for men. Okay. So the testicles is outside the body. Yep. It's three degrees cooler than the rest of the body. So 95 versus 98 degrees Fahrenheit. And then there's a reason for that unknown. We had that conversation. Don't really know why. But it may be that it's an immunologic sanctuary and that's the only way to do it in that God or Darwin can figure out. But if you heat up the testicles, it's also close to the skin. So it's a radiator. So when the heat comes down in our turbo blood, it has to cool. So it raises in lowers and there was a journal in the journal of air reproducible results about 20 years ago. A man went to Big Sur and wore nothing and he measured ambient temperature and then he marked on this leg with a marker where his high-scrowed him hung how low it hung and he could tell the ambient temperature by how high or low his scrotum hung. He became a thermometer. So it does go up and down. Is that Peter a tealactic? Journal of air reproducible results. Oh, good. Really cool. But it's show that it's very temperature-centitive. Right? And it goes up and down to regulated closer to the body when you want it warmer, et cetera. You go into a cold shower or a plung where your testicles are way up there. In my abdomen. Yeah. And that's all the creamous dirt muscle and it's all temperature-driven. So it spends all of its time regulating its temperature to state 95. Now, sauna's baths, hot tub shukuzi, steam rooms, change that. Right? The worst one of those is anything underwater, submerging underwater because you're one centimeter away, you're liquid, it's a liquid, you're going to turn that temperature. Maybe not the inner part of your body, but little kids going into hot tub right? They overheat. So testicles will certainly overheat. So you get into a 105 degree hot tub, which is a very typical temperature for a hot tub is 105 to 110. You're saying within a relatively short period of time your testies will assume that temperature. Absolutely. Yeah. You're 70% liquid. And this is right at the surface. So I did a study published in the Brazil and Journal of Eurology. Very, I published 200 studies. This was the hardest one to get in. Everyone said we know that it affects fertility. So I don't, we're not going to publish it. So the American Thailand, the Brazilian Journal of Eurology. Then went to the New York Times as a press release. That's how popular it was. It's probably my most cited paper ever and it's certainly not my best. It's very interesting. I took in fertile men with low sperm counts and stopped the tub. They were in hot basicus. I used to wear jacuzi, jacuzi called mepsit-snop. Don't use that word. So I don't use that word. So hot baser tubs. And I told them out and they went up 300% they're seeming, and now seeming quality went up 300% total amount count. In three months or four months and 600% in six months. So you have to give us some time. And that's that curve, right? The recovery curve. And we didn't look at fertility. We just looked at that recovery. And someone was zero and went up to close to the age range of these men. They're 35. So fertile men. Yeah. And you can see. Yeah. These are men who are not able to conceive. You're making the diagnosis. I think it's your hot tub. Let's get you out of there. And they have a sixfold increase in sperm count. Total models per count. I mean count motility mainly driven by motility. Interesting. So it's motility that the price. The biggest one. But cost of count might have doubled to me. Chilly may have gone up threefold kind of thing. So sixfold increase overall. Then I calculated after that. I calculated a lethal dose of tubbing. So what's the lethal dose? Yeah. What's the other 50? Yeah. So lethal dose to me means you're zero. Yeah. You do it enough. You have no sperm. And it came out to be 20 minutes of a hot bath or a tub 20 minutes on 140 degrees three times a week. Would probably make you zero. Wow. There have to be a lot of guys out there who are spending at least three times 20 minutes sessions in a hot tub that's at least 104 degrees a week. And the highest group, the biggest interesting, the largest group of people in Tubbs at Northern California, we did this study. We're environmental lawyers. I don't know. It's like, sure job. That's stressful. It's okay. This is something that probably isn't California. All right. So then I think there's been studies. That was the, I mean, the only study ever done prior to that was a PhD thesis at Vastro College. Where someone had a guy dip their testicles into a bucket for 20 minutes that really hot and looked at their sperm counts or their fertility and they went, they went, they really. That was the only, and I couldn't even find it wasn't published. I had to go, yeah, to figure out the thesis thing. But that's how little was written about it. And they gave me so much fact for publishing. This was really funny. And the New York Times had an article said, you know, a true condom and a true birth control pills and a true a guy into tub. It's like picture, picture contraceptive. So it's huge. And it's I asked it. I'd say 10% of my populations in it. And the next question is, what about sonas? So sonas is not underwater. It's not some version. But sonas are, you're not, you're in a hot room. You're going to, it's going to affect it. And I would say the effect is one quarter to one third. It's a profound as a hot math or some version. So my friend was absolutely right to have those ice packs on his scrotum. He's thinking he's reading. Yeah. He's listening to Jesus Mark out. The Turk protocol. Yeah. And then I would say steam rooms showers are probably fine. Yeah. Because you, you're in an ambient temperature's normal. And I think steam rooms are probably between sonas and, you know, defense, I'm a shatime you spend. But it's probably not normal, but not a hot bath. Hot bats are terrible. Okay. And then what about the cold? I don't worry about cold. I remember surfer magazine call me and said, um, you know, I'm on the California surfer right now. I'll be surfer. And they said, uh, I the editor of surfer magazine call me says are surfer from fertile. I'll let you say, is that water bad for them? Because California waters. Yeah. And I said, no, I've never met it in fertile surfer. So I don't think it's bad at all. All right. So the cold is okay. Because that you're such a plunge where you're talking seconds. Yeah. You know, your test was going to go up. Yeah. And you're going to be able to maintain the heat. I think if you did it all the time, it would probably be bad. Yeah. Because enzymes work in the testicle at that one temperature. They work opt-in. Okay. Let's talk about exercise. You mentioned one example of exercise that can be problematic, which was, I believe you said in a study where men were ramped up to two hours a day of exercise. I think there was above 80% of VO2 max, which is pretty stranyous. That was enough to put a dent in their fertility. Tell me about writing a bicycle. I'm a biker. I have old vintage bikes that I used to race in Connecticut. And I had them rehabbed and they're all Italian and they're all steel. And they weigh a ton. And the seats are from Britain, Britain. And they've got 10,000 miles on them. And they weigh four pounds. It's much like a Brooks saddle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, all worked out. And it's like that saddle nowadays is about half the weight of a carbon bike. Right. So, but I love it. And I'm thinking of maybe going senior league and doing this gorgeous steel frames. And trying to keep up with those guys. Because it's not about the bike. Really. It's like when you get golf clubs. And I got $150 that a golf club. I'm going to be it's bad a golfer with $1,000 of a club. So it's really about the biker. But there are some differences. And you know, in terms of the momentum in the wheel force and all that. But I love my old steel bikes. So, and they see this and it's like hanging at my office when it comes to work in the morning and I bike in in terms of Cisco. And then I have the seat and I was like, you, that's a bad saddle. And so the issue really is that it got started that biking was bad for reproductive health with a Spanish competitive cycling study. So competitive Spanish cyclists, Tour de France, Calabers, cyclists. We're looked at their sperm counts for examin. But what was the control group of a control group of runners? I don't remember. I don't think itself. So in other words, it could have been the exercise that was the part. It could have been the intensity of the exercise. It's not a good study. Yeah. There. And about so there's sperm counts for a low. There are more follages we're off and they're extreme athletes. So it's so we know that and we know maybe they were on drugs. Maybe they were, you know, it's a big industry. They're super fit. They're certainly exercising two hours of, right? And so they said, look at these guys who are really healthy and look at their sperm counts, but this other day did come out. So I did a blog called Cycling into Childlessness. And I looked at a more comparable study which was British commuting cyclists. So every day people basically knew working Britain on different saddles and, you know, and I looked at their fertility and their fertility was far better than the average bread. So even if they were taking some hit off the bike, it was probably more than compensated for by their healthy lifestyle, which included probably riding the bike. But obviously there's a healthy user bias because anybody who's riding their bike to work is probably consuming less Guinness, fewer fish and chips, smoking less. In other words, riding a bike is a proxy for being healthy. But in spite of that, it didn't offset that health risk, at least unless we found people who were equally healthy who, yeah, I remember what they controlled for, but I think they did a lot of the socioeconomics. And it was just, I mean, it may just be an activity, but the bicycle, so is there a myth? Yes. Now, if you said, are my worried about bicycus? Yes. So I worry about sexual health. I worry about the pudendal nerve. I worry about seed anatomy. So the best seat for a bicycle. So if you're biking a lot, that's good. If you're biking and you're getting pelvic numbness, that's bad. So you need to get a better seat. The best seat was studied by the NACH, the NACH. I forgot. It was Dr. Schrader at the NH. The best seat is, the saddles that are shaped like this are bad for your set phones because they come into the middle and whether the arteries and nerves are to the penis. So it's an erection issue. Those aren't good saddles. The saddles with the two little tongs that held your Iliak crest bones with no nose. Yep. Perfect, right? So it's pressure. Where the pressure is, outside facing leaning in, so we gave those to police in Washington, the bicycling police done in like national cathedral area in the parks and they all gave the seats back a week later. I said, I'm doing this. He said, what's going on? He said, we don't know where the seat is. We go sit down and it lands somewhere. You have to have the nose for bicycus because they use it to guide, where they sit down. They use it to guide, where they sit. So the best saddle is flat or gel and the back cut out in the middle. And some kind of lean in like this. So cut out saddles. And then you should get it, you should get your bones fit. So you get a, you can do this online. You can ask them to send you a pressure pad and you sit on it and then you send it back and they measure the distance. And there's only a couple of different saddles, maybe 12 wits that you could do and you get it done, who are like me, you use a saddle, you use for 30 years and it's perfect, but it weighs 4 pounds. But that's good. It's a leather saddle and it fit to you. Yeah. Yeah. Not that heavy. Likeonic. Okay. Let's talk about alcohol specifically. And let's talk about any other recreational thoughts. Yeah. So fertility wise, I'd say, you know, the government wants men. So I'm going to talk about men to, you know, less than two glasses of alcohol a day is okay. They consider for binging. Now alcohol is a small molecule goes right into the brain, goes right into the testicle. It's definitely a poison, right? It goes everywhere. It's the testicle doesn't limit it. So I worry about it a lot. The effects I see are direct when it's abused. So I would say, I use see morphology, motility and count issues. So that's a direct effect as a direct toxin, because it gets it. It's one of the few things it's into the testicle. Second would be hormonal effect. So alcohol use tends to cause delivery to rev up, tends to cause more estrogenization. So you tend to get low testosterone from that. So it's a hormonal effect in a direct effect. Any evidence that it's having an epigenetic effect? God, I probably. No. I don't know about evidence, but I'm sure it does. Let's talk about common recreational drugs. Let's start with marijuana. That's the worst player for me. So THC, same thing, count motility, morphology. So it and it probably has an effect. We know it has an effect on fragmentation, which is a quality measure of sperm, not only the way it looks descriptive, but quality. And also probably an epigenetic effect. Some of the early studies on the sperm epigenetic showed alterations with nicotine and the pot. What I don't like about pot is depending on you ingest it and however you ingest it, you get a peak. You feel it. It goes away. You feel it's out of your system like nicotine. But it's, but it's two facts for a month or three weeks. And it's a deep pull effect. And it keeps coming back. So you get a low level toxicity, which I don't like at all. So I am not a phenopot. The other thing that really concerns me about pot and reproductive age men is I wrote a couple of blogs on this. A called the weed worries. And there's some compelling evidence from epidemiology and two studies, ten years apart validating each other that chronic pot uses a associate with testous cancer. And we think that that's causal? I don't know. It just worries me. weed worries me. Interesting. Given that it otherwise seems, you know, kind of benign. Personally, can't stand this stuff. But, you know, I know so many people that use it so frequently, that seem to have relatively few effects. I mean, it needs to be phenomenal. It's medical marijuana, right? So medical means safe. But I ask someone, you know, I have a lot of pot growers in the Emerald City up in New Orleans, California. And they have the artisanal stuff that wins awards and stuff and say, which is worse for driving, being stoned or being drunk, undoubtedly being drunk. Yeah. So it looks like reflexes. But, you know, like he said to me, well, we tend to stop the stop lights and wait for them to turn. Yeah. And we're stoned. I'm not saying that they're both that you know, driving stoned is good. But there are probably far fewer people that die at the hands of a stone driver than a drunk driver. Probably. And I think the science, you know, the LA story signs and LA, you know, like I've, like, you know, they have the lit up signs about open season traffic and the movie LA story. They knew say now, it's stoned, you know, drunk or stoned. Watch out. Yeah. We're going to get what do you think is the mechanism of action by which THC is having these negative fertility impacts? Not sure. I don't think it's the mechanism. I don't think it's the root. So I don't think it's talking or, you know, or edibles. But it might just be the chronic exposure. And I don't see there's some evidence that THC acts like LH and binds the receptor and neutralize and blocks it. But blocks it from LH. So you can get low to stostorones, but it's not, it's not been that profound. What about nicotine either synthetically or in the format tobacco? Bad actor at high doses, I think, to either one. Yep. It's nicotine. nicotine per se. It's the issue. And it doesn't last as long as THC. It does have, you know, count motility effects and fertility effects. We think probably both of these are our oxidants. It's the oxidants that do it. It's oxidizing things. You mentioned diabetes earlier as part of your history and physical. What is it about diabetes? Is it the high levels of glucose? Is it the microvascular damage? Is it the inflammation that typically travels in parallel with it? Why is Type II diabetes a risk factor for infertility? I probably all of them. I don't think we know exactly, but I'd say that I diagnose diabetes a lot and a lot of infertile men. I make the what's the physical finding you're seeing in the testies that tells you. Like, you know, how an ophthalmologist will often make the diagnosis because they're looking into the eye. So for me, it's usually their weight and their count motility are low. So I'm looking for a chronic exposure and then they have polyurethry or polydipsia or something to them like that where they're drinking a lot and they're peeing a lot because the sugar is dragging it out and you check their UA and it's full of sugar and you said, you know, you've earned some of them have an A1C that's a little pre-diabetic. But I think a lot of it is nerve-it-neurogenic too. They can develop an ED. They can develop a third of Type II diabetics. I have a load to stosterone. So that's a clue. And that's secondary. So you can plummet it can better right back. But that's probably the common one is the look, the sugars, and then the low T in the low sperm count to kind of a picture. It's a syndrome. And then we kind of talked about sleep and stress. Obviously metabolic health in general. What are some of the other modifiable things that you see the most common is a vericous seal? Okay. Tell people what a vericous seal is. So you could develop vericous veins in your leg. You can be in need treatment. And this is the same thing in the scroteum, but it's not related. And it happens in typically at puberty. You'll develop this. You won't know it. Sometimes I'll let's hit hurts. And it's a reflux of blood in the wrong direction. So the testicle drains to the kidney, which is uphill. And it wants the drain back down. The reason why it drains back down is because as a species, we stood up half a nine years ago. Maybe three quarters a nine years ago. And when you're an animal, your kidney and a testicle drains this way. There's no gravity. But when you stand up, you're now draining uphill. The system was never made for valves. And if you said to me, what's the reason our sperm counts are falling? I would say we stood up as a species. Probably not a good idea for male fertility because that mud that's supposed to be staying up there comes back down to the testicle pulls around it like a hot bath is warmer. And you have to affect it. And usually the first sign is a testicle on that side, which is the left. Usually it's smaller than the right. So the physical examiner testicular discrepancy in size. That's first thing you see. And then you feel above it and you feel a bag of worms. But sorry, there are no valves in that vein. In fact. So what's the head it has to climb? That's got to be the centimeters. So how is it doing that without a valve? I don't know. That's a big, that's a pretty big distance to travel about. It doesn't ignite. I don't know. Interesting. Okay. But there might be a few. But during puberty, but the growth spurred those blow. And the angle of the renal vein and there's a right angle. The right side has a natural valve off the vein of K. So it's kind of has to go around 270 degrees. So you don't reflux on the right left side of lesion and most men. You can be perfectly fertile with it. If you look at statistically 85% of men conceive naturally without varic sales. 80% will conceive naturally about a year. So the curves are very similar clinically maybe insignificant. But there's a difference. And it's statistical. But if you multiply that by millions of people it becomes important. And you'll figure that out easily on a physical exam. The best way is easy if I don't order a whole of sounds. If I can palpate it then it's clinical. And you will, that's an office repair. It's an outpatient surgery. It takes an out. We do my research. Yeah. So it's more involved than a vessectomy. Yes, it is. And because if you're doing it at microsurgery at the level where you don't cut muscle you want them to cover a cover quicker. It's pretty. It's an it's an involved area with lots of veins. But he's not under general. I use I use a triolation. Triolation. Triolation. So yeah. So that's the most common. Wow. And most men are fertile but they can be. So again you look at the semen also says a poker hand and you see countin motility being down. Nothing else going on and you see a varic seal and it's implicated. All right. Have we missed any other of the major? I'd say the major ones are varic seal and then I would look for hormonal issues. So varic cells may be 40 hormonal maybe 10 or 15 genetics. Yep. So they're non-modifiable now. Right. Okay. So you talked about a few of those already. What are some other ones on the genetics? Yep. The most common one is for zero spermist client filter. These extracts comes on the most common one for low sperm count is why chromosome this is interesting area. What is that phenotype look like? Now phenotype mean an in general? Yeah. No phenotype. Normal. Okay. A y-chromism deletion male? Yeah. Because it's only the long arm. Yeah. And it's only a couple of floors on the building. Got it. So there's regions that are missing. I see. Okay. So very interesting. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you made a complete deletion of the y-chromism. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. So it's the long arm. It's deletions regions. Yeah. Yep. Not. Yeah. Right. Well, the genetic area. You're right. So rainy, rainy, a pair of found that in at MIT 20 30 years ago now that the y-chromism is a whole of mirrors. And in myosis, every chromosome has a partner except the y and the x and a man. And so the x, the y plays with itself. It combines with itself instead of finding a partner. It has to do the dance, too. And so it changes a lot. So it's very adaptable. It actually comes from the x through the million through to evolution. So there's a lot of x genes that are on the y and the y doesn't. We thought it was sort of a wasteland. Maybe hairy ears and tooth decay and things like that. But now it's probably more important. So there are regions on the long arm of the y. The short of the mides very important has a gene called s-r-y, which makes you male. The s-r-y is the male of sex determining if you have that gene, your phenotype will be male. If you don't have that gene, you're probably going to be female. It's complicated now, but that's sort of what it is. But the long arm has these genes that control fertility. And some of them took typically we ordered in men with a low sperm count of a little 5 million. So that would be a pretty common cause of a sperm count low than 5 million. And I published a study that if you have a y-chromism deletion, and you have a vericocial, and they both cause low sperm counts. And you fix the vericocial, you're not going to improve. Because the mon, it's non-modifiable in all ways. It's who you are. So, but if you didn't have the bicromism deletion and you fix the vericocial, you'll expect a good response. Two thirds will improve, one third or more will conceive naturally. So you could take guys of low sperm counts and you can fix them or not, but the drivers genetics. And the phenotype in offspring is simply inherited as a y-chromism deletion. Italy, there'd be, I just thought a couple of contexts. It's actually he had a y-chromism deletion. He conceived with help of technology with a low sperm count. Suns have it. They have no sperm. So you can inherit the deletion, but it might increase. So you're going to get what your dad had or it might be worse because mutations tend to get larger and large. Until they tried to conceive, they would never know this. Everything else is normal. So then there's, I would say, there's environmental lifestyle things. So I think obesity's a big one. Yep. And do you think that that's mostly propagated through the undercran system then? Yeah. Yep. And I think, you know, that's probably, that's a big one. Oxygen. Yeah. In terms of the percent of sperm with the lifestyle issues. And then lousy diet is probably something that, and so obesity and diet lifestyle recreational drugs, well, strive to view with them. Toxic exposures at work. So any smelly solvents, I don't, I'm really worried. Some airport fuels, you know, airline stuff, machine shop, oils, anything, anything benzene derivatives used to be pesticides and stuff like that, but they're pretty well controlled. So environmental exposures are, you know, kind of an unknown. I think viruses have a role. Yep. I saw you recently wrote about HPV and I haven't been thinking about that for years because there are men. You used to be half the men who came in when I entered the field 30 years ago. We didn't know what was going on with them. But now it's probably 10 or 20 percent with lifestyle issues and stuff like that. You can pretty much sort it out. It's not that unknown. But there are men who are like, what is going on here? He's a perfectly healthy guy. Practicing in California is incredible because everyone's so healthy. You have to look elsewhere. You have to ask other questions. And you know, when there's obesity, it's always the elephant in the room. But everyone's so healthy in eating. So I get to poke around places where no one else goes. Because I have to explain it and there's nowhere to go. But I did a study, so HPV is in most common. You'd re-arrote about that. Is that what's the link? It's hard to know. There's herpes, very common. The SDDs that we know about like the 11 common beasts, you know, like committee and gonorrhea and syphilis. We know a little more about it. And they're pretty obvious. But some of these like trick-amonus and stuff are pretty subtle. And I had, I was really concerned about this because one guy 20 years ago in the house professor UCSF, he sent me a picture of micro electron photograph of a sperm with a hexagonal herpes virus in it. I don't even know what's Photoshopping. Like this is virus in a sperm. Like, yeah, it looks like this. Where's this? You think that's what's causing it? I don't know. But normally when you see infections as a cause viral or bacterial as a cause of semen and as you'll see pussels. So you'll see what's called piospermia, leukocytespermia, the round cells we talked about. Yeah, semenhouses will show up in higher numbers. They tend to be destructive and it tend to lower motility. So you tend to see a certain look to the semenhouses. But I am normal count normal. Well, tilt is really low. A lot of the sperm are dead because it's been wiped out by these cytokines and all the white cells. And then maybe you'll find the pathogens somewhere, right now. But cultureing myocoplasma, CMV, all these viruses. So Joe Dorisi really bright guy. UCSF went to MacArthur Ward. He took my patient semen and he had a, my suspect when microarrays were popular in the 10, 20, 20, 20, and he had like 2,000 all mammalian viruses on his chip. Everything. And we ran fertile guys and we ran infernal guys and looked at semen, not sperm. And 99% of the infertals are positive for something. And 98% of the normal is a positive or something. So ubiquitous was the word. And so it left us high and dry because you can't really do much with that. So it's out there. But I do agree with your assessment that the pathologic phenotypes, the worst ones, are probably doing something. The question is how do we measure it? What do we look for? And we'll see when I also says I said early on, it's a blunt instrument. It doesn't really, it varies a lot. It's tough to do it. But I love whether we do genotyping on spruce and sperm, probably not. You know, I don't know. And when you look at HPV, it's probably one of those things that might be in the ejaculate after ejaculation. Might be coming from another fluid source. And not in this brim itself. So it's effect would be post ejaculation, which could still have a fertility effect. But it won't be probably as deep. Right? And what if for example, like I has processed the tightest and the prosthetic fluid has plus in it, then that could sabotage the whole thing. And right. I mean, the problem with the male system is it's all through the same tube. Right? And so urine comes to that tube and see when it comes to that tube. So you have to look for infections in the urinary tract and anything like that when you're doing fertility because plus cells kill whatever they see. Yeah. So if your urine infected, you know, so that's a big deal. Now, have you done work with interest at intratusicular PRP and stem cells? Just stem cells been not PRP. Okay. Not a big fan. Okay. As a trained stem cell biologist and someone trying to experiment from skin and working with some of the best stem cells times in the world, I have a lot of respect for them. But it's not that simple. So we've had, you know, people have injected bone marrow into there's there's 560 off so we're off the shore stem cell companies in the world that will take your money and do things like stick PRP in there. They'll stick bone marrow aspirates fat in your testicle. And I'd say my experience has been, it's not been favorable. I, you know, these some of the toughest cases in the world and they come to me after that. And I do my techniques and I don't find anything and the trials aren't really real. They're kind of here. Come here. We're going to do this and then we're going to do a microdeception on your testicle. But they didn't have one beforehand. So the chance of finding it even without that is ex and they're finding ex. So, you know, it's just not well done. And I have my patients investigate all that and I say, you do the work. You tell me who you found. Let me call them. Yeah. So I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll be my, the workers. And then I'll call them and I'll say, hi, I'm just wondering about need do have any papers or what's the science behind it and they usually hang up or, you know, it's really interesting. But self-fired states unfounded. Yeah. I've had it very similar experience with a few of my friends and patients who have wanted me to talk with some of their, their stem cell docs and you're pregnant in space Peter. Yeah. And so I accept the fact that they're not going to have remarkable peer reviewed data. But it is amazing at how few individuals can provide even one cell layer of scientific reasoning. And it's a topic I'd like to explore more deeply on the podcast. It's, you know, my guess is there are some indications for where it makes that. I agree with that. But boy, I'd like to figure it out without people wasting things. I think there's a better way. There's a there there. But it's just not not that easy. Yeah. Um, so what is the, let's just say for every hundred guys that walk in your office who are struggling with infertility, what percentage of them will be able to conceive, assuming they are able to fully comply with the prescriptions, you, you provide the life style or pharmaceutical, for example, hormone modulation, et cetera, without requiring and let's exclude the 40% vericocials because you're going to fix those guys and they're fine. So 100 people who don't have a vericocial, um, who don't have a genetic condition, I'm going to really simplify this. Okay. So these are a hundred guys that presumably have showed up with some eyeatrogenic reason for infertility. How many of those guys are going to be able to conceive without resorting to IVF? I would say that's the goal of my practice and I would say the answer is most. Wow. But the caveat is we've got to tell you about the woman. Because, because I will defer. No, no, no, no, no, no. So the point is I did a paper. This is the only data I can give you. And so I did a paper where I saw men for their infertility values. You got it done. And I, I thought they were fine. They had vericocials and stuff, but there's seem analysis of normal and my investigation of their admits lifestyle. Everything was good. And I said, you're fine. You're cleared. No one's ever said that before. And they went home and they said Turquin Virgato was wrong with us. I said, it's not what I said. I don't do women. You know, I don't, it's, you know, my expertise. I'm saying something positive here. Right? No one's ever said, most people would say, I'm not sure why you're not conceiving. I said, I'm pretty sure you're not the problem. Yeah. Okay. Didn't get interpreted like that. I got me a little angry. So I did a study with USC. And I took these men that I cleared and I called them up a year later. And I said, what happened last year after Turquin. Clear do you had a resident do this? And the answer was 65% of it conceived naturally. Another 15 to 20% conceived with IOI or IVF. These women were 35 or sold year and a half in fertility. They weren't going to wait around. Most perceptions occurred within six months. I didn't do anything for them. I didn't fix the rarec seals. I didn't touch something new medication. I just said, you're fine. So I published it as a lifestyle study. Not that I was right. And the idea was they probably made changes. They probably took a nutritional supplement. They probably timed their sex better. They probably got out of hot tubs. You know, it's stuff and they were taken pills. I have a list of what they did. I had a table in that paper that said that 65% natural pregnancy rate. That is higher than anything I can offer as a treatment than we have published on. Right. So if you fix their varicocile or you rarely get a 65% natural conception rate. So I had a table of all the published conception rates for the technologies that work. And I'm saying this is a better. So it doesn't, if that addresses your question, that's the only data half. What advice do you give a guy who comes in your practice? Maybe you don't see a lot of these guys. But let's say you get a guy who comes in and says, hey, look, I want to bank my sperm. I want to freeze my sperm. Now, presumably you'll get a lot of that if a guy is undergoing therapy for cancer or something like that. Is there anything a guy needs to know? And would you recommend a guy do that if he's 40 doesn't have a partner, but says, look, I want to have kids. And isn't there something to the idea that my sperm are better today than they will be in a decade? So huge issue, paternal age, paternal age and fertility, paternal age. So we can go there. But I don't pay value judgment. I say good idea. I am a disclosure. I'm on a board of legacy. I love their mission driven the way their mission driven. And so I like the fact that going from military and exposed patients in this and that and VA. So, but I'm I'm for that. I think it's the lowest hang fruit in the field, especially obviously for chemo for cancer survivors and things. Like, I don't care what you think might happen with your cancer. I would still bank it. I started a non-profit called banking on the future. 16 year olds to 21 year olds with cancer. We'll do it for you. We'll pay for it five years. Just do you have this as sample? Because it's so much harder afterwards or not. So you would advise any male that hasn't reproduced and who might want to, who's undergoing any chemotherapy for any cancer, just play it safe. Bank for cancer. Yes. Now, who should anyone do it for any reason? Probably not. But again, I don't pass the judgment if they're worried about something, then I'm worried then they should. Well, paternal age, do you worry about? So good question. And you look at like National Guidelines for sperm donation. 40 is considered older paternal age. 50 for sure. If you look at risks to offspring, miscarriages, stillborns, autism, birth defects, things immediately related to conception, prematureity. Those go up with paternal age. Then you look at birth defects. When they're born, those go up with, you know, one to twofold. And then the worry, someone are the single gene defects. And the epigenetics like psychiatric morbidity. So the autism schizophrenia dyslexia by polar disorder potentially Alzheimer's in offspring. And they're not detectable with young. So big issues. So I've written a lot about that published on it. I was actually having my second child at 50 when I was writing this thing which I've been doing this, you know, writing a paper on all these risks called we put in with the island of Chenco from your first epits per. But I think it's a hockey stick curve for risk to offspring. And you think the the inflection is 40 or 50? I think it's more like 60. I think there's a slow linear increase in risk to offspring from 25 to 50 or 60. And then there's an inflection and then there's the blade of the stick. And I think that's log with me. Same curve as women. But they're formal. Yeah, but their shift in 20 years earlier or something. Yeah, so the shorter curve, but the same thing 40, 38 to 40 is kind of a point where things really ramp up with chromosomes. The men's stuff is not chromosomal. So if you take the curves together, they're different spans, same shape. But I think the female curve is on top of the male curve. This is not a the same relevant relative risk, right? So women, you know, you go from 25 to 40 your chance of a miscarriage. Oh, it's chromosomal. It goes up quite significantly after that, very significantly. And the consequence of women's issues with offspring related health is basically miscarriage. Yeah, in many ways, it's almost easier to detect, right? Because very. So it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it can be more dramatic, but it usually now prevented with with pre-imitation jacksets. Yeah, matter different. You can't detect these things. There's single gene mutations. This is the the machinery is constantly working. It's getting old, the quality control of the process goes down and little gene mutations get in there that are all we've been always being spun off in the heat of the engine and they're getting they're not getting vetted. So the machinery's not doing a good job. So they're getting through and they're not going to be they're not going to be lethal. They're going to be deleterious. So that's where you get things and autism's a classic one, the turn of age related. Looks like that's the biggest risk factor for it. And that worries me a lot, right? So I think it's interesting. The facts are that human evolution is entirely driven by sperm. Yeah, because eggs are just saying they're correcting the problem. It's entirely driven by sperm. And half and so 50 mutations a year, generation usually gets spit out for each of their nature paper, probably between generations. And there's always mutations occurring in 14-year-old fathers, but it goes way up with 60-year-old fathers. So the rate of mutations goes way up with age, but average is 50 over a reproductive life. And most of them, half of the mutations that we are throwing off as a species are not ears or hands or feet or height or thing that it's all neural developmental. It's a half neural developmental. Yeah. So when you think about well we're seeing, you know the Martians from the 50s and the movies with big heads. Yeah, that's kind of where we're headed. Autism dyslexia by polar disorder. You know these are neural developmental neurogenitive issues. And why is that? Well that's what's going on. I mean that's where we're being stimulated. That's where we're being asked to evolve. Look at the last 30 years, right? Funny. One of the biggest investors in Salesforce said to me, I said to me, you know, I realized that was dyslexic when I when my son was born. And I said really, he said, yeah, but you know what, it helped me be the man I am to realize that Salesforce is going to fly, given the first 500,000, given the first million they ever took anymore money. And he said, it let me focus. I was so autism is one of these is where you put out you ignore a lot of input and you find the gift and it's amazing. If you go down the rabbit hole of what they're good at, it's like their whole brain trust is there. So is that a disease or is that where we're headed? I mean, I think it exists on a spectrum. I think anyone who's who's probably spent time with kids, you know, using ASD as an example, boy, you know, you know, mild versions of it the way it can be defined because it really has three categories now in the DSM5. I think the mildest version probably comes with more superpowers than limitations or maybe equal amount, but but clearly the more severe it gets it's pretty debilitating, but this this I did have internal recalling it disease though. Yeah, but maybe it's not disease. Maybe it's where we're headed. Maybe it's the future. Maybe the non-sequitors that come out of those brains. I mean, look at who's changing the world right now. These have been spoken about. Yeah. But again, I would argue most of those people would be in category, you know, my class one, no class three. What's the what's the thought success rate, right? So if a guy is 40, he goes ahead, he freezes and banks his sperm, assuming they were good to go in. Right. Are they very high probability of thawing correctly? So when you freeze sperm, it's about a 200-year-old process. Right. Right. Well, the use for about 75. I forgot through the Italian science. This was who froze sperm and snow and then thought it and it was live a couple hundred years later after Leewin who came up with a microscope, the found it was moving and it was possible. So egg falling is very new. Egg freezing and falling is very new. This is very old. So everyone is thinking about sperm now because eggs are being frozen left and right, but this is much older technology and the cell is much harder than an egg. So it does a lot better typically. When you freeze it, it's the freezing process that kills sperm, be from icicles on the inside. Yes. And then while it's frozen, it's usually no issue. No issue. And then there's another problem when you thought rapid their temperature shifts. So that's where the kill rate comes from. And a good sample half of it should survive. Okay. And so in so how much sperm would you tell a guy to bank if he has to do it, if it's the definitive samples for his life. So meaning he's 40 or he's about to undergo chemotherapy or some other exposure where he should just assume he will not have normal sperm again. What are you telling? So I usually say depending on the technology you're going to use, but if you're sperm counts normal, three to three ejaculates is one kid's worth of sperm within some of the combination technology where you would thought and then and then turkey based it. So 10 ejaculates for three shots on goal for three kids. But three kids with low technology, but 10 ejaculates will give you most of China with IVF. Got it. Oh, you say low technology. You mean IUI or something like that? So there's three levels. Sex, no tech. Yeah. High tech is IVF and in the middle is IUI. Yep. That's the stuff that's turkey based. It's relatively straightforward. Yep. Yep. To the cheap. I street kids for that, but plenty of sperm for IVF. So three ejaculates would be more than enough if they're normal for IVF. Yes. So the population you're talking about may be cancer survivors, half of those will not be normal. They're really looking at IVF. Yep. So they don't need that many. Yep. But I think three is a good number, but it's an insurance policy. Yep. Okay. Well Paul, this has been a super interesting tour through the world of male fertility. I can honestly say I knew very little about this coming in. Some of this stuff I understood pretty well, the hormone stuff, but boy, a lot of this stuff I had no idea. So I will be studying my notes from this. We're going to link to a lot of this stuff you've created. You've got a lot of great content out there. So we'll make sure people know where to find podcasts too. Talk to me about that. Well, we started a podcast last year because the blog of 15 years and we're just doing timely topics and it's me and my associate Rob Clyde is a director in Hollywood and we take on Anthony Bourdain. We're going to be the Anthony Bourdainament's health. We're going to just take on the topics to stostroon, et cetera, penis myths, and just talk about stuff that everyone is asking questions about but no one's talking about. And like you dated driven answers. Okay. What's it called? Talk with Turek on all channels. Got it. Okay. We'll make sure folks know that. Um, you have a clinic that you run up and down the coast to California. So obviously we'll make sure folks know how to how to find you there. But presumably I think we've given folks a roadmap for their local urologist as well. If they're getting the work up basically it sounds like if you're being worked up for fertility with your urologist and they're not going through the steps that we've described maybe you should find somebody else. Yes, I think it should be done. That's the first step. There's a lot going on now that the biomarker concept, you know, with relates a lot to your views on medicine 3.0. We now know, the paper came out two days ago looking at longevity based on the semen analysis and then Danish done the regular hospital at Copenhagen. They looked at 70, 4,000 men over 50 years and found that those guys would say normal semen quality live three years longer all causes and then with low sperm counts in the way they were younger. This was a one, you know, a single payer system so they have all the data on it is very much a landmark study. So I'm if you ask me what excites me about the field, I would say as the author of the biomarker concept early in my career, I would say I'm really happy that we're scaring couples to realize that their fertility is a measure of their health. And now we have our foot in the door. If we can get a sperm count, get them in the office, we can actually tell them a little bit about their trajectory and it's becoming more and more every day and we've never had a chance to do preventative medicine with young men. So it's a mental play in a big way because they're partners of bringing you men but who cares? They're in the office. You father, I prostate cancer when he's 50, someone had colon cancer in the vah, you know, so I have now an NP-Molly Jessup who's medical and it's like, okay, you know, what's going on because there's metabolic stuff and you can pick up diabetes and we're we have an opportunity it we've never had ever. It's to get men at younger ages and you know, I was a professor at UCSF for 15 years in doubt share, I left and I went to Yosan University to a traditional Chinese medicine I lecture there now. We had a conference last week and I lectured and I liked it because I thought Western medicine may be your view too is too reactive. They're always trying to get men out of trouble or get patients out of trouble but we're not thinking about getting them from unhealthy to healthy which is the preventative aspect. We're just not very good at it. Your general surgery every example you give is a guy who's a Disney bat, you get a back, whatever but you have a thing next step like kidney stones is great. We're all just we treat them all day it's fun it's endoscopic it's lasers it's shock waves but what are we doing about that stone? I mean how come how come we're not preventing these more it's just not it's not on the radar. I go to the Yosan University in traditional Chinese medicine fabulous place and it's all holistic so I see patients who get referred by acupuncturists and they come in their diets under control there's dresses under control they're doing acupuncture there's sorted out and what do I find varicocials because they don't find those but the phenotype is totally different than the Western referral and I think that's I have a love that because that's 3.0 that's mentioned 3.0 what's they're doing they've been doing it for 4,000 years it's interesting how we don't give a lot of street cred to it but in my view a much of we don't understand about fertility certainly men possibly women is epigenetic and the drivers of epigenetics which are marks on the DNA not DNA mutations 50 gene mutations a generation doesn't explain it there's other stuff going on epigenetics is all lifestyle and diet ran it's all lifestyle and diet driven it's everything in your book well Paul very interesting stuff thank you again for making the trip out here and the thanks for sharing your insights and great yeah all thanks Peter
