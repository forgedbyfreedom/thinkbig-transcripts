So many people suffer brain injuries and if you could wave a magic wand you would just hope for some regeneration of the injured portion of her brain and my guess is in the case of and the actual total volume of cells that are damaged just quite small it could be this you know half the size of your thumb right I mean it's a relatively small, but it just happened to be in the most precious part of real estate in her entire body so Do we know or do you have any point of view on the potential future of stem cell like interventions for the purpose of Regeneration specifically in the CNS? Yeah, I mean this is an area that I think got a lot of focus and attention maybe about 10 or 15 years ago and I would say it largely the results were pretty modest. Yeah, but yeah, it best It's coming back now because of a lot of cell-based therapies or granowates Building miniature models of brains on cell culture is basically I think the first things that we're gonna see and where I am seeing some promise is Very focal delivery in replacing cells that have been lost in small targets of the brain So back to Parkinson's disease where you've got the generation of dopaminergic neurons and the substantiate nigra the goal is can you replace and basically transplant some stem cells into that part of the brain? And remind me why the cells in the substantiate nigra go is it an auto a meat like what do we know what's killing them? I think there's a lot of a lot of It could be multiple fault it's parliogenic There are certain genes. I produce both situation there. They're certain environmental toxins That can cause the disgeneration and then there's like a huge bucket like we still don't know you know what's causing that But if end of the day, there is a disgeneration of those very specialized cells most of the treatments are around dopamine replacement Yeah, medications and how close do you think we are towards? Transplant Well, it's already been done Actually like 20 30 years ago. Oh really I was using a fetal graphs and they just didn't take some of them took in in fact Patients some patients got benefit from it the side effects were also fairly severe They were a variety of different reasons kind of side effects like if you have too much dopamine You can actually get disconeys shows so hyper movement so Parkinson's one of the card symptoms of Parkinson's hypomovement Yeah, yeah, Brady cannesia Specifically where you have slow movements slow to initiate movements as well But if you have cells that are just pumping out dopamine They can also be putting out too much and you get the opposite effect So it's not as simple as just putting them in there. They actually have to be tuned Yeah, in the right way to put out the right levels and so there's a new generation of new therapies that were really interested in traveling UCSF that are much better cell models much better control of dopamine that's involved. We have much better delivery systems to make sure that the different distribution and and I mean could you imagine that could you imagine engineering your way out of Parkinson's disease? We're working on it What about synthetic cells where you completely get to control it, right? So again, you have the substrate problem, but if it's truly a synthetic cell then presumably it can make dopamine as well I mean, that's supposed to an implantable sort of slow leaked dopamine that you come up with some slick weight or refill but What do you think is more likely kind of the more pure engineering approach or the more biological transplant approach where you just try to tune it The near term of course is taking some cell cultures. They are not like purely synthesized That's still I think it's a huge goal outside of just brain like can you generate a cell to know, though? Without some what without some origin does that require immune Modulation so it's a full transplant yeah, so a lot of these patients initially will be on a You know suppression for that, but that's also improved a lot Yeah, right that's just a immune of suppressive as if they had a kidney transplant or a liver heart transplant Yes, wow, yeah, but I think that's primarily right now the level of precaution You know and there is progress being made and try to make these things As least immunogenic is possible and That's where a lot of the engineering actually is focused on is just making Like the least immunogenic to avoid a rejection scenario So I am excited about that and that's some of the biological engineering that I've talked about like biotechnology or the future of technology We really coming back to the biology moving a little bit away from the Electrical engineering What do you think the world looks like in 2040 Which major problems that stand in front of you today do you expect to fall and what will be the implications?
