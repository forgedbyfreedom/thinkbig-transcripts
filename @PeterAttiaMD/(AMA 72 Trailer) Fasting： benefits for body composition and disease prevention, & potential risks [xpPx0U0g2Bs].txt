People say I want to lose weight, but I've never actually heard somebody say what I really want to do is lose a lot of muscle and stay as fat as possible. All of these things can theoretically imply that fasting can further benefit to health, beyond the equivalent amount of caloric restriction. And if someone is going to do fasting, are there ways that they can potentially save some of that lean mass? If I could go back in time and do anything different, Nick, I would go back to that three-year period of time when I was doing all of that insane fasting and I would have done this. Is there any evidence that extended fasting reduces cancer risk in particular? If fasting results in a long-term and sustained reduction in excess body fat or at a capacity, then that would indeed lower the risk of cancer. How does fasting potentially help either prevent or improve symptoms of autoimmune diseases? Intermittent fasting and long-term fasting of up to a week can really reduce systemic inflammation and that could obviously help with any autoimmune disease. Do we have any evidence or knowledge that can fasting can extend lifespan on a whole? Thank you for viewing this sneak peek of an Ask Me Anything episode of the Drive.
