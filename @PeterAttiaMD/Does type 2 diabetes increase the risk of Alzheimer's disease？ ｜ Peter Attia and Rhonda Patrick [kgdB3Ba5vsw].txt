A very subtle point you may that might not be picked up on everybody is you mentioned the glute 1 transporter as opposed to the glute 4 transporter and if my memory serves correctly the brain has glute 1s as opposed to glute 4s and glute 1s are insulin independent is that correct? Yeah, for the most part. I mean, they're they're insulin independent. I mean, that's that's my understanding and why that's interesting is because it seems a bit counterintuitive that a condition that leads to insulin resistance of course type 2 diabetes is the essence of insulin resistance. It seems counterintuitive that that would produce a hypometabolic state in an organ whose gluteose transporters are insulin dependent except when you explain it the way you did which is it's not the insulin resistance of the glute 1 transporter That's the problem the way it is for the glute 4 transporter in the muscle instead It's the actual mechanical disruption if I'm understanding you correctly of that transporter because of the way it's no longer presumably held in place by the barrier itself that allows gluteose to get across is that did I that I understand that correctly? 100% correctly and then this is you know This isn't like dogma like this is like this is definitely known It's definitely where I'm heading it's my opinion, but there is evidence of it and I think I think it's time to explore this evidence a little closer a little deeper because Yeah, type 2 diabetes and it you know you hear that the term type 3 diabetes and I think people think about it in the way of the brain being insulin Resistant and you know maybe there's something to that, but I you know I don't know if that's exactly what's going on. I think the type 2 diabetes is disrupting the blood brain barrier through a variety of mechanisms including you know the advanced location end products and the vascular I mean the vascular church or disruption in type 2 diabetes is well known. I mean they've all sorts of You know problems right Retinopathy that you know the neuropathy like all this. I mean they are they They are disrupting their vascular church Including these tiny tiny little blood vessels that are like smaller in size than are like the diameter of a hair Those things are like Disrupted at the blood brain barrier and when you disrupt them you're their blood flows decrease and the transporters are going down You I mean there's ulcerate to problems and so I think You know fixing the diabetes obviously would be like You know downstream thing to do but like it's kind of a new mechanism right it's kind of a new wave understanding it and You know so It explains the observation so there's an observation that is unmistakable which is type 2 diabetes I don't know the number but I think it approximately doubles your risk of Alzheimer's disease So in other words even if you're sitting there walking around with two copies of the apoe 3 allele Having type 2 diabetes means you might as well have a copy of an e4 allele from a risk perspective and what this is saying is Well It's not entirely clear at the surface why Type 2 diabetes would impact the brain through the lens of Traditional thinking of glute for transporters which are insulin dependent in other words It isn't just an insulin resistance problem but I think these two other things matter right this What you said about the micro vascular Again, what what I think a lot of people don't realize is how destructive type 2 diabetes is to the kidneys Right because those tiny tiny blood vessels right people are familiar with amputations and things that occur in digits Because of that impotence right all of these things where blood vessel is essential in small blood vessels and so there's that Which feeds into the vascular path that you've discussed? But it's this also this disruption of glute core glucose transport directly across that transporter So I think it's actually a very compelling thesis for how type 2 diabetes could be acting via those two prongs To to ultimately result in hypomotabolism I do too yeah and and then of course the cascade of inflammation that happens after that so You know The other thing that's also very interesting is and again this so we're talking about type 2 diabetes and very big Implications there for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease right? I mean There's a lot you can do as you've talked about you know to prevent and even you know treat in it with diet at my stuff right type 2 diabetes
