Okay, sorry to lunch position. If you're just going to bend the right leg down, working on his right glute. Here we have a sub-ruget, starting to make sure that the back is neutral. You don't have any extension in the lower spine. You should be feeling left glute and right quad loading here. So, there's going to come down, reach out for the block, lift the right leg up. So, in this position, make sure the left knee does not go into balladges, or in turn, our rotation should be pointing straight forward. And then the right hip is going to come down a little bit more. Then you're going to cross it and come over into a curtsy. It's going to lean forward, come back up into the standing split position. So, make sure the right hip stays down. Left glute should really be firing. Then right knee's going to pull through. Let's go to the back. Left right back into that perfect lunge position. Back, neutral in the mirror is the side will help you here. Good one more. Lift up left glutes firing. Back's neutral, she sinks down. Perfect. neutral. Sweet back. And then that perfect lunge. Awesome.
