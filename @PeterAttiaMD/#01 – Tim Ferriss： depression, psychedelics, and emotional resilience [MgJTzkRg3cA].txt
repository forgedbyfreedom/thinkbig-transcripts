Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions I've gathered along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of those successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you with a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at PeterAtiaMD.com. Welcome to episode 1 of the Peter Atia Drive. I can think of no better person to begin this podcast with than my very dear friend Tim Ferris. Not only is Tim a really close friend, but he's also almost single-handedly the reason his podcast is coming into existence. In other words, if you hate it, you can blame Tim. Tim has been kind of on my case for about two years to do this. And more than anything else, he's just really helped me think about how I can sort of put something together that allows me to create something that is sort of new and isn't already out there in terms of content, but also is something that I'll find enjoyable to do. And that hopefully will come across as this podcast gets underway. I'm guessing most people listening to this know a lot about Tim, but on the off-chance that there are some who don't, I think it's just worth kind of giving a little bit of background on Tim. He's been described as a, quote, a cross between Jack Welsh and a Buddhist monk by the New York Times. He's one of fast companies, most innovative business people. He's an early-stage tech investor and advisor. That includes a number of companies that most people have heard of such as Uber, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, Alibaba, and least 50 others. He's also the author of five number one New York Times best sellers and Wall Street Journal best sellers. The four hour work week, the four hour body, the four hour chef, tools of Titans, also known as biggest tools that's an inside joke in reference to the podcast and tribe of mentors. The observer and other media outlets have described him as the Oprah of Audio due to the influence of his podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show, which has about 300 million downloads at the time of this recording. It's also been selected as the best of iTunes for three years running. Now, I want to say something about this episode that will become apparent. Obviously, once we get started one, we talk a lot about things that are topics that Tim and I don't really spend a lot of time discussing publicly and certainly personally. And so it's important to understand here that while Tim and I do talk quite openly about psychedelic experiences, we've shared in South America, it shouldn't be taken to mean that that's what we were recommending that anybody go out and do. We're absolutely not doing that. There are physical, there are psychological and there are legal risks among these things. And it's important to remember that in the United States, at the time of this recording, psychedelics, like psilocybin, which we speak about quite a bit, along with masculine and things that we don't get into much detail around such as Ayahuasca, these are currently schedule one, which means that they are illegal. And while we believe, obviously, that designation is completely unwarranted and will likely, you know, eventually no longer be the case when the scientific community has a chance to catch up and understand the great potential of these things. Really the purpose of this podcast is informational only and well. I do generally provide a disclaimer at the end of my podcast that explains that all of this information is informational. I want to be really clear about this particular issue. We talk a lot about these things. We talk about a few other things as well. And I think even for the listener who doesn't find this topic to be particularly interesting, one thing that we talk about at the very end of the podcast that I'd been meaning to ask Tim for a while and certainly I get asked a lot is, what are the things that you still incorporate in your daily routine? Tim has written so eloquently about this stuff and has codified so many ways to find these minimum effective doses and to optimize everything he's doing. But I think people wonder, hey, which are the things that have really stood the test of time. And so I actually found that last part of the podcast to be, especially interesting, even for me, though I knew these things and I can see all the things that Tim does day in and day out, but this sort of have him say, look, if I had to pick five, these would be the five. Tim can be found all over the place, but I think the best place is to see him or on his blog, which is Tim.plog. You can follow him at T-Farist. That's F-E-R-R-I-S-S on Twitter. And you find him at Tim Ferris on Facebook and Instagram. I hope you enjoy this first episode half as much as I enjoyed recording it and there will be lots more of these to follow. So with all of that said, please welcome Tim Ferris. Hey, Tim. Peter. Thank you for having me on Austin this weekend. My pleasure. It's been a good weekend. Good view too. Yeah. What I can't believe is in the relatively short period of time you have lived here. You've become essentially the unofficial mayor of Austin. Well, I like to get involved and to explore all the various nukes and crannies of any city that I live in. And after 17 years in the Bay Area, I felt like I'd left almost no stone unturned. Have many dear friends who are still there, but many of them have traveled outside. And one of the places that was an annual migration was South by Southwest here in Austin. And had wanted to move here right after college gotten to know it year by year with increasingly longer stays in the city before and after the festival itself. And now it's home. Couldn't be happier. Feel like every place we went in the last three days, everybody knew you like the owner of the restaurant would know you. And the coffee shop. And it was, I don't think I drank more coffee and topo chico in a short of period of time. I thought I had the last three days. Yes, coffee, topo chico. And so many things here. Yeah, breakfast tacos is something I haven't yet explored. That's another form of religion here, right next to barbecue and a bunch of other things. But it's a cozy feel. It has a neighborhood feel and I've come to value that type of neighborhood feel and cohesion, which is something I probably wouldn't have paid much attention to 10 years ago. Yeah, I've sort of always assumed I would live forever in California and I kind of say, all your hard work here to get your friends to move out here. It's, I think it's going to pay off. I, I, I, I think I can see Austin in my future. Yeah, I have a lot of friends are moving and I think in many respects, it's defined by the fact that it's difficult to categorize. There is no one mono conversation about tech or entertainment or finance. And some people might view that as a weakness, meaning if you're looking to live in the epicenter of a certain industry and you're in your early 20s and want to cut your teeth and live that hyperkinetic super aggressive lifestyle while you're building your foundation for the future. That's one thing. But in my case, I much more so in placing value on the general friendliness, the cultural diversity, which is not just skin deep, it covers so many different bases here. And I enjoy the fact that you can go from a strict vegan restaurant to a dear processing plant to an electric scooter, start up office to a cowboy boot store, all in the stretch of a few blocks. That's exciting to me. And though I've never really bought the argument that people in New York and Southern California, which are the two places I spend most of my time are, you know, I'm not about the argument that those are snotties, super snottie places and nobody's nice. Because I do think that people are actually pretty decent everywhere and including in the middle of Manhattan. But that said, it's a different level of nice here that is completely foreign to me. Yeah, it is. I remember when I first moved to Austin and I had a number of neighbors drop off cards or come to the door to ring the bell to ask if I want to come over for dinner and I didn't even know how to respond, which really, you're like, one of myself. I'm being more about myself than I was so mistrusting perhaps. But in San Francisco, that does not happen as far as I know. I've never heard of that happening. Certainly in New York, it would be a time to check your security system and consider your avenues of getting out of the house. But here that's just part of the course and it's really been nice to embrace that. And even with in Texas, Austin is known for being very, very friendly. I've met many different people here who've moved from Houston and other parts, which are also fantastic in their own way because of the general level of friendliness. So I'm a fan. I always thought I would be, felt the gravitational pull here when I graduated and did not get the job here that I was so coveted at trilogy. And it turned out being a blessing to skies that I didn't get the job. And I think also for trilogy, because I most likely would have been a terrible employee. But that took me to Newarkell had a great stint there, but that chapter came to a close. And it was just the right time. Well, as I said, it's been amazing to be here. Not my first time here, but each time I kind of like it more and more. I guess with that said, we are kicking off effectively the first episode of a podcast that you, more than any other friend, although several friends have played an enormous role in the so-called cajoling as I referred to it earlier and making this happen. So if this ends up sucking, I'll take all the blame. I'm blaming you. And if this ends up doing okay, I'm thanking you. But either way, I think this has been this will be fun. I think my customary 30% is very reasonable. 30% of what, right? Yeah. Now, obviously this podcast is on some level. And probably on a large level, going to come down to things that I think a lot about and hope to bring to people, you ask me the other day, you know, what am I hoping to accomplish with this? And I don't have a great elevator pitch on it, but one of the things is I find myself so often having conversations with people that I think, God, this person is so much smarter than me and knows so much more than me. And they're letting me be a sponge right now and absorb so much information from them. And so many times I find myself at the end of those discussions thinking, I can't believe nobody else got to hear that. What if I didn't extract everything from that correctly? What if there was more to be gathered? And so it's really that desire to sort of have as many of these conversations as possible and be able to sort of share them in their natural state that I think is a large part of this motivation. And while most people sort of associate me, I suspect, with thinking about longevity, we probably don't spend enough time talking about what longevity means. But the way I talk about it with my patients is it's both enhancing lifespan, but also a health span. And lifespan is the easier of those two to understand because enhancing lifespan just means not dying, which is not to say that that's easy, but it's conceptually easy. I think the health span stuff is harder to understand. And as I have come to learn in the past three or four years, I believe for most people, it actually matters more. Many people think, you know, if you helping me, doesn't add one day to the length of my life, but improves the quality of my life, especially at the end, that would be sufficient. And so in many ways, what I want to talk about today is one piece of health span that I know the least about by far, but also I think is the one that we are least likely to talk about as a society, which is sort of mental health. Now, you've spoken really publicly about your interest in that. I knew a lot of this before you talked about it at TED, but can you tell me a little bit about that? And thrilled you're doing a podcast because I do think that just as a bit of overlay on what you said, there is so much focus on extending lifespan, rightly so, but the equal obsession, equal level of obsession that you bring to performance and health span. I think creates a compelling combination that I don't find in many places. I find the combination of those interests are a common, but the combination of competencies broadly speaking in both of those domains is very uncommon. So I'm excited to listen to other episodes of the podcast. And as it relates to mental health, I should as maybe a introductory preemble say that this is not a topic I've always been comfortable talking about publicly. In fact, I would say for the vast majority of my adolescents and certainly throughout high school and college, I somehow came to the conclusion that I was just not designed to be happy that evolution did not optimize for happiness. And I just did not have the code for happy, and that was okay, that I would be an instrument of competition. I would learn to be good at various things that were valued at colleges and then by the business worlds and so on, and that it was not worth trying to be happy or to not just love myself, but really have a high opinion of myself and in fact, that was self-indulgent. And that I would just focus on being the best competitor possible and hopefully turning that into something that was not only a value to me or that I was rewarded for, but that would help other people and that perhaps I would find some joy in the joy of other people, but that was the extent of it. And suffered from many different bouts of extended depression for as long as I can recall. Really, and that is also something that you can spot very easily looking back at my family history on both sides. And if you look back to grandparents and great-great-grandparents, fair amount of alcohol consumption, certainly fair amount of alcoholism, I thankfully have not sued myself with excessive amounts of alcohol, but you see a lot of patterns that scared me certainly, but the depression was one that I could just not seemingly navigate around. And the TED Talk opened with a particularly close call. The closest call I've ever had, this is not a common experience for me, but in college, where I can very, very close to killing myself and actually got to the planning stages. It wasn't just rumination about what if I wonder what it would be like to take my life. No, it was a decision that had been made and I was already in the planning stages and to give people the short punchline to that, which explains why I'm here today, I had reserved a book, which was going to be the last of many that I had read on this subject, related to suicide. It was already checked out of the Firestone Library, Princeton, where I was at the time taking a year away from. And it was checked out to some other poor student, so I put in a request to be notified when it came back into the library. But I forgot to update my dress at the registrar's office and the dress that I had on file after taking this leave of absence was my home address in New York where my parents lived. And so my mom got this postcard, which was, dear Tim Ferriss, this is to notify you that, and then whatever it was, you know, the final solution that I did it out, whatever it might have been, the how to kill yourself manual, has arrived. Please come to claim your book within the next X number of weeks, or it'll be released to the next person who has it on reservation. Whatever the postcard said, and I got this very heartfelt, understandably nervous call from my mom with her voice cracking, asking about it. And I lied, I said it was, I was very fast on my feet, and I said it was for a friend, Rutgers who wasn't able to get the book for a dissertation, there are thesis, he was working on, so I reserved it for him, know everything's fine. But in that moment, after that call, I realized how these, in retrospect, little waves, small events can be blown, or even large events can be blown so at a proportion or seen as permanent in such a way that regardless of socioeconomic status, regardless of race, regardless of gender, people can be so knocked off course that they end up taking their own lives. And certainly, recently that's been very dramatically demonstrated and tragically demonstrated with the deaths of many people, including Anthony Bourdain, who comes to mind most recently, and that's just on the high profile side. But in my case, personally, I realized how my blinders and pessimism in this downward spiral had led me to really only focus on my pain. I didn't realize how until that phone call, committing suicide would have been like taking 10 times the pain that I felt and imposing it on the people who loved me the most. And that was a huge wake-up call. So that is why I'm here today is the lucky accident that I did not update my address at the registrar's office. And if that had not happened, I mean, I was ready to pull the trigger so to speak, although that wasn't how I was going to go. But it was all specced on. It's terrifying to think of really, really terrifying to think of. And I have some of my best friends in high school who you never would have suspected from the outside looking in, killed themselves, college, same story. I just know so many people who have taken their own lives. And it always came as a shock to people at least to knew them in school, for instance. They seem to have it all together. They seem to have the good relationship or the good job or the good grades or whatever it might be, the good family. And that's led me in the last few years in particular to it. The very least want to focus on discussing mental health, different facets of mental health from an experiential firsthand basis. Simply to tell people, if assuming I don't have any type of ready answer for them, you are not this is exceptionally exceptionally common. But it's the dirty little secret that so many people carry around and are unwilling to discuss. And so at the very least, I want to say, you are not alone. There are millions upon millions of people fighting similar battles. And everyone you meet is fighting some inner battle. You know nothing about. So do not assume that you are alone. And I think in that, hopefully people can find some solace. And then beyond that, I've spent the last few years, really investigating using the contacts and network that I've developed through the books and the podcast and the tech investing to explore avenues and potential treatments or interventions that can certainly help people who are on the brink get back to stability potentially. But also to take people who might view themselves as stable or normal and to mitigate against the potential of losing their footing. And then there are, we can go beyond that certainly. But that is, my interest in this certainly began on a very personal level. How do you I, is it possible? I should say, forget about how? Is it possible for me to manage this? And the type of thinking that triggers the most dangerous downward spirals is what's the point? If I'm, if I'm constantly going to default to this negative thinking and I'm so blessed for A, B, and C reasons, what's the point? And that is a really, really poisonous toxic mental landscape to immerse yourself into it. And get caught in. So is it possible for me to somehow decrease the frequency of those types of episodes? Is it possible somehow to decrease the severity of those episodes? Is it possible to look at my quirky biochemistry, my software in a way that I see some blessings within my day-to-day month-to-month experience, then some way counteract the tendency to view myself so harsh when the inevitable dips come. Long answer to a short question. But that's, that's really been particularly in the last I would say two years, three, mostly starting about five years ago, but in the last two or three, really diverting a lot of my attention that was going to start up investing. A lot of my resources that were going to start up investing to areas that are related to this. And there's so much of that stuff I can't wait to talk about today because you've brought a lot of people along on this ride with you. So obviously I can only speak from my own personal experience, but we have so many mutual friends who have also been heavily influenced by sort of a sense of awareness that you've brought to us with respect to all of these things, but also potential solution spaces that are outside of our realm of thinking. You said something at the outset, which was, you just thought you weren't wired to be happy, which I mean, I can resonate with that completely. I remember as a child, my mom would always say to me, you know, Peter, do you just not want to be happy? And I would look at her, like, I don't know what kind of dumb question that is. Like, it's not an option. Like, you might as well be asking me if I want to be 12 feet tall. Like, I have some say in the matter. It's not about wanting to be happy. It's just about metaphysically not being able to be happy. And then furthermore, my thought, which was even a bit more obscure, or maybe bizarre, was happiness was a bad thing because you would stop being hungry. Makes you complacent. Yes. Right. So right along with self-indulgence, there was that. Yeah, it was like, mom, if I was happy, I wouldn't get up at 430 in the morning and run harder and faster than anybody else. And of course, I didn't have the, I don't think I had the mental framework to probe that idea further, which is what are you proving? Who are you proving it? Two, why do you feel the need to do all of these things? But it wasn't until quite recently that I even began to entertain the idea that being happy is not a bad thing. We're put in another way that it's a good thing. Yeah. The double negative. Right. Right. Just to touch on a few things that you just mentioned, I think are really important. The self-talk, Jim Lair, who's a performance coach who has worked with many, many of the most famous tennis players and other athletes in the world. I had a chance to spend time with him for my last book and then also for some tennis training in Florida. And he's, he spent time with one of my very close friends, Josh Waitskin as well, who's best known for being the basis for searching for Bobby Fisher for those people are familiar. And he talks a lot about the inner voice. The most important coach and voice you ever hear is your inner voice. So I've learned to pay increasing attention to the words I use, particularly when I'm rumenating, referring to myself, talking to myself, making a note to self. That's a long story inside, Joe, guys. Another time. And I found myself using perhaps very unsurprisingly similar language to yourself. If I were happy, I wouldn't be doing the things that are very clearly contributing to my success. Whatever that means. And not only that, but on every possible level, if I were to find joy in too many moments or to not feel deficient or inadequate or low-thewardly, which is honestly how I felt for the majority of my life. No, I don't just not love myself. Like there's a deep sense of why hate to use the word hate, but it's the right word. Like low thing. Like how could you be so stupid? How could you be so lazy? How could you be so filmed the blank? Tuff in the fuck up. And you may not have control over all things, but you know, you can get really, really good at doing is absorbing pain. Like it really good at absorbing pain. It's like, okay, if you were a card and have a high pain tolerance, maybe you can win. Maybe you can be successful and I should put in successful in quotation marks because they're so seldom well-defined by people who use this type of language, including myself for decades. But what I've come to realize, and this is also a, I think a common concern among type A personalities who consider or are told by people they respect, that they should take a stab at meditation for a period of time. There is this highly prevalent, almost universal concern among type A personalities by which I just mean driven like hard charging, head through walls. I can take the pain, fuck it. I'm just going to grip my teeth and white knuckle through anything that comes my way. Which, hey, let's face it. That serves people very well up to a point in certain ways. They worry about losing their edge. This is the exact wording that I hear so often. And the exact wording that I use with my friends when they first recommended a few of them, Rick Ruben and Chase Jarvis, very specifically Rick Ruben, legendary music producer. Although that doesn't, it's not even a drop in the ocean of what Rick does. And who Rick is? But Rick Ruben and then Chase, very, very famous photographer, also the CEO of a company called Creative Live, which is an incredible company in and of itself. Both of them recommended meditation to me, and I resisted for more than a year I want to say because I was afraid of losing my edge. Even though what I came to realize was, if you want to use your edge indiscriminately, like a kitchen knife, which is only a blade, like the handle is also blade it on both sides, you can continue doing what you're doing. If on the other hand, you want to put a nice ergonomic handle on that beautifully honed blade so that you can use it as an instrument for its highest purposes, you can utilize different tools, meditation being one of them when we could talk about all the different types of meditation as well because I think they do have slightly different applications. Is a tool in the toolkit that allows you to build this beautiful kitchen knife instead of holding onto the blade itself, just bleeding over and over again, scabbing, bleeding, scabbing, bleeding, which is I think day to day how many driven people experience life, whether they are financially stable or not, if they are compulsively active, if they are using the distraction of constant motion and absorbing pain and seeking pain to numb themselves that they don't have to be in their own head any longer than possible, which is what I did for a fucking long time, pardon my French, but I'm a decade. If they're able to develop other skills that allow them to and I've certainly less than seeking happiness, I have been looking for ways to both develop in myself and help others to develop a sense of peace even if it's 10 minutes a day. That does nothing negative in my book other than magnify your strengths and allow you to, maybe for the first time, see some of your weaknesses that are very often self-imposed and the blind spots that have been like an invisible hand guiding your life for, in some cases, decades. I really see no downside to that and since I've had two capuccinos and I guess have some extra personality, I'll further extend my long ass answer by saying my books very clearly track my priorities in some respects. You have the four hour work week which looked at different types of currencies, time being the most valuable non-renewable of those and how to address a few runs on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As I've moved along and suffered my own burnout of different types, not necessarily financially related, but certainly for our chef took me out for the count. I bit off more than I could chew in part because I was having some personal difficulties and some relationships and I wanted to numb myself. I went back to that numbing behavior which included taking stimulants, which included over caffeinating, in addition to the pills and so on, using alcohol at night to wind down, engaging in exercise that was far more painful and ridiculously punishing than it had to be for any type of health or performance purpose. I crash and burned and that led to the podcast as a way to take a break from bookwriting which led to the explorations and talking to people like Brinebrain, talking to people like Tarbrain, talking to people like Jack, Cornfield and many many others that then led to say, travel mentors or tools of times, then travel mentors and where I am now. Where I look at this Maslow's hierarchy of needs and realize at least for myself, let's say you cover your food, you cover your shelter, you cover it, that that that that that you get up to these rungs on the ladder where you've checked off success. You are blessed, you are hopefully healthy, your family might be healthy and you can meet all of your basic needs and probably have some disposable income and yet you have trouble living with yourself. That's a fucking tragedy. I mean, it's to have deciphered how to achieve and yet not be able to appreciate is that it's just the tragedy of tragedies. It's this kind of fools errand that could have taken five years, could have taken ten, could have taken twenty and then you see people like that who do not know which way to turn and then perhaps just withdraw into a shell and sit at a table with their family and look at their phone for the entire dinner over and over and over and over and over again because they don't know how to emotionally engage with themselves, let alone other people or you see the more dramatic cases where they're like, all right, I thought these things would make me happy. I was told these things were the necessary ingredients for eventually solving this emotional ruby cube that I'm struggling with my whole life where I assumed that poof one day I would just wake up and have made it. Even if having made it just means you're not struggling with alcoholism and rant like your parents did or something like that. And I've come to realize you don't need to and you should not wait until you think you have all of the other pieces, non-emotional, non-psychological pieces that puzzle together to start working on self-acceptance among other things and untying some of those gordian knots that you have that you might have carried for decades since your childhood and that it is not esoteric, it is not intangible and you start to address some of those things, it makes everything more effortless, it makes everything more rewarding and that I think is a project worth tackling. It's a lot but that's, yeah this depression I think particularly among men who are very very very bad generally and I'm just going to paint with a broad brush because that makes this type of conversational easier but broadly speaking, cross across cultures, it really doesn't matter where you go. Women are generally better at social cohesion and building groups of friends who are mutually supportive and we could look at a through an evolutionary lens but men very often are biologically culturally who knows, fill in the blank, trained and maybe born to just bite their lip and suffer in silence and I do think there are certain places for that look if you're going to be an aviciel commander, waking up every morning and telling your direct reports like about your really hard dream you had, probably not strategically tactically professionally or ethically the right thing to do when you have to go out and then risk your lives doing things that are mission critical to fill in the blank, right? So there is a time for that but to make that you're one coping mechanism for navigating life or like the sort of the mesh that is imposed on everything else that you suffer in silence and that the solution to that is just to get tougher to get better at accepting pain to use cheesy tech parlance doesn't scale, it just doesn't scale. You know when I was on your podcast the first time which I don't know how long ago that was it feels like it's probably been three or four years ago. One of the questions I remember you asked me which of course you asked many of your guesses what book have you gifted more than any other and I remember the book I mentioned at the time it was and remains a great book but I now have to update that answer. What was it just for people who were curious? It was mistakes were made but not by me which is just an amazing book on the psychology of cognitive dissonance but of course that now has been surpassed there is now a new book that is my most gifted book and amazingly I can't believe I didn't bring a copy to Austin to give you because I now I probably I think I just buy Amazon out of this book like I just have stacks of it all over like you have stacks of certain books in your place and this book is called I don't want to talk about it by Terence Real who have since reading the book and becoming obsessed with actually it comes back to you you introduced me to Esther Perrell. Esther recommended the book the book was one of a series of little nudges that ultimately led to me meeting Terry and of course that book has now been the book I have given most but what you said is spot on which is there is just this epidemic of male depression and it's not always overt that's the thing right people have this image of what depression is but you know like a guy who's constantly angry emotionally volatile he can be quite depressed so depression isn't always disthymia and I think that's where people miss this idea of how much pain people both men and women carry around but how men have this more orthogonal way of displaying it that makes it get masked longer and longer and I want to go back to something you said earlier because it really hit home about a year ago when a mutual friend of ours Paul Conti made this point to me which was the way you treat yourself is ultimately how you will treat those you love most and you know when he really pushed me to think about that which is do you want to be the guy who treats his kids the way you treat yourself and I had to be put that way for me to think no I mean if I'm going to be brutally honest I would not want to watch my kids get treated by another human the way I treat myself even though I think it's good for me to treat myself this way so again I think the challenge is by far the hardest part is getting people to accept that maybe what they're doing isn't the right thing or isn't maybe right the wrong word it's not the best thing it's not the optimal thing I love your analogy of taking the best blade in the world and not having a handle on it I mean it's a limited tool yeah and there are so I would say just to maybe put a fine point on it going through life merely tolerating yourself which would have been a dream for me I mean I actively loathed myself and any weakness any mistake any foable any flaw I was I was and and still at times and I'm so incredibly violently critical in my own head that it is not the treatment I would want that I would wish on anyone I care about that is not a state you have to accept it is not programming that you have to accept and there are ways to begin to chip away at that and to rewire it and to reformat in a sense certain behaviors that you've experienced for so long many of them are thought patterns self-talk that you've come to believe they're completely unchangeable and in my experience and more and more the experience of dozens and hundreds of that and thousands of other people I've observed in the last five years it is patent it is patently untrue that you have to accept that and I think what you said is really really important to digest and ponder and that is how you treat yourself is how you're going to treat the people you care most about and I think it was actually glorious dynamo that a quote I don't know if this is accurate but somebody on the internet I'm sure will fact check this who said in effect I'm paraphrasing here but the goal and you have to remember that the golden rule goes both ways so we all know do one to others as you would have them do unto you if you flip that around it is do unto yourself as you do unto others and that is really has very profound and wide-ranging implications when you really sit with it for a minute and it's nice to say though you do not have to accept the inner voice or the patterns that have led you to pursue success with rare glimpses of any type of inner peace that is not something you have to accept so one of the most sort of profound experiences I've had sets of experiences I've had in the past few years our experiences we've shared together around certain plants that honestly I was completely unaware of an ignorant of for most of my life had never really given them any thought and probably much of the stuff that you've talked about written about in the past in particular there were two podcasts that you did one was with Martin and I'm trying to thank the other team Palanco and Dan Angle Dan Angle that was the other one yeah and those were two separate podcasts but they were very close together if I recall there a couple of months they were a few together and then a few of parts you had James Fademan and then Dan Angle and Martin together that's right and then later Michael Palan yeah but that first wave was probably 2015 ish yeah it was a few of course it was a year ago that was the thin end of the wedge and interestingly the thin end of the wedge for me was around something that wasn't a personal issue but more of a societal issue which is I was blown away by the discussion and the clinical results that they were achieving in Mexico using a plant called iBoga and using a iBoga and as well to treat patients who were opioid addicted and that's something that even back when I was sort of you know in my residency and you would see in a city like Baltimore what the effects of heroin addiction are and of course today it's even a much bigger issue and it's spread far beyond just heroin so that just interested me purely from intellectual standpoint which is wait a minute we have a drug or set of drugs that are so categorically addictive to so many for which our only treatments are at best useless and there's this other thing that admittedly comes with plenty of risk and plenty of unknowns but it seems to fundamentally change the way a person's brain is wired which would seem to address the root issue as opposed to the band aid that led of course to me wanting to understand more about those entire classes of compounds and that led to my very first experience with them which I shared with you meaning which you helped me through which to this day remains one of the most profound things I've ever done and if anybody's listening to this who's thinking what are they talking about what are these psychedelic agents aren't those drugs you know all these things one of the most remarkable things I remember after the first time I tried psilocybin was I don't feel like doing that again anytime soon like these are the most anti-addictive compounds on the planet what started your interest into that space the interest began and for those people listening who are wondering if if we'll discuss any other tools I think we should also discuss some other options on the table aside from this although this is very fertile ground for discussion so we can talk about meditations some other tools and books and so on later but the my interest in psychedelics began long ago with a close friend who introduced me to psilocybin contained in what is commonly called magic mushrooms must have been in college midpoint perhaps in college and it became an annual ritual and once a year I would meet up with a few of my closest friends and we would consume mushrooms in retrospect it was very haphazard we were not measuring any doses you just have a big bag of mushrooms and split it up and then hope for the best which is not ideally how you go about things and nonetheless despite the lack of controls and I do not recommend anyone uses compounds under uncontrolled circumstances I experienced what I began to refer to as as a reboot and I would have this anxiety and depression plaguing me I would go very very deep and looking back now I was almost certainly consuming minimum of five grams I'm sure I was consuming quite a high dose of mushrooms which is for those people who might read the writing or listening to some of the presentations of someone named Terrence McKenna five grams is referred to as a heroic dose and that is a dose sufficient to flatten even the most resistant to ego I believe is the wording that was used in any case I felt this decrease or even complete removal of depression anxiety that extended far beyond the supposed duration of effect let's just call it five to eight hours and there would be this after-glo period that certainly lasted most acutely for a day or two after the experience and I was going into this also with none of the best practices that we know of now in terms of preparation intention setting perhaps some of the preparatory steps you can take and then integration there's none of that so this was very bearer bones haphazard experimentation with a few friends nonetheless there were these periods of let's just call it two weeks to two months where I was able to finally see things clearly appreciate all of the incredible chance blessings that I experienced in my life and make decisions about things I've viewed as serious problems or challenges or opportunities whether it was making a decision about academics making a decision about a relationship to either start a relationship or end a longstanding relationship these were things I was able to look at very calmly and make decisions about and ultimately after I want to say four or five years of this had a very very very very scary and dangerous experience which was again with no sitters in other words no sober person supervising this any number of things can go wrong and one is people can wander around and get themselves into dangerous situations in my case I ended up coming out of my trip very late at night walking on the side of a street with cars whizzing by me I mean that could have very easily been the end and that scared me enough that I stopped it's never again two dangerous and I stopped I didn't revisit psychedelics until let's just call it let's think about this 10 to 15 years later when a girlfriend at the time who had some very very very difficult traumatic experiences as a child travel to Peru which has its own set of very real risks that we can talk about if he would like if you were going down explicitly for the purpose of using a psychedelic most commonly in this case IOSca but her experience was strong enough and meaningful enough that she came back and said to me that she wished it for me because it was like 15 years of therapy in two nights now if anyone knows anything about any of the books I've written or the way that I tend to view the world that is a very very effective sales pitch for two 15 years of therapy in two nights interesting and I put that in the back of my mind did not move ahead with it because of my fear which I think was very it was well-founded. I had a what could have been a very very dangerous experience or fatal experience things had to get much worse for me to finally decide to reenter that world which I did first through a guided psilocybin experience. I did not want to go straight to iosca which I to this day believe it was a very very big gun and can be very destabilizing. I didn't want to go I didn't want that to be my reintroduction so I did I had one guided psilocybin experience which also lacked much in terms of any type of prep integration or post so it it was effective in the sense that it it was like a returning home and it was a familiar feeling that I came out of unscathed. I took an absurdly high dose because I didn't know what I had taken before. So for those people who know anything about it I began at seven and a half and they did a booster in nine which for me is it is such an absurd overkill it is too as to almost defy belief at this point which by the way is a counterproductive taking too much is counterproductive it is not more as better by any stretch of the imagination. Being strapped to the icebreaker is not as very rarely what someone needs in any case came out of it realizing that you could approach this any safer fashion with a container physical and otherwise that allowed you to avoid the risk I had that it scared me off. Then went into the iosca experience about six months perhaps six months later took it very seriously had people sign non-disclosure agreements had someone act as my proxy to try to vet people in several different countries and ultimately honed in on someone I spent two nights with and it was one of the most disorienting on spiring experiences of my life without question. The first night I was prepared for all of the sickness and vomiting and terror that I knew it could be part of the experience and it was blissful it was an incredible first night. Second night was without any exaggeration the most painful experience of my life at one point I experienced full body seizures. So grandmall uncontrolled uncontrollable seizures for about I would estimate two and a half hours ended up with rug burns all over my face and hands and feet and was completely lost there was no contact no footing in this reality whatsoever and my subjective felt experience was one of being torn apart a thousand times a second dying a thousand times a second only to remanifest and have that repeat infinitum it was beyond horror and when I came out of the experience or the the main roller coaster was was coasting to an end after let's call it six to eight hours I was I was partially detached from reality for probably thirty six hours and I had very fortunately paid someone in advance to babysit me and act as a shaper on for that extended period in the off chance that happened which into being the case and the entire time as soon as I was cohere enough to even think in English which took a while I thought never again never again will I touch anything like this and it was only six to eight weeks later and I should mention that my intention I did have an intention this time going in to the second night specifically which was to let go of anger towards myself towards other people very a handful of very specific people and I swore I would never touch this stuff again it was just too scary, too potentially dangerous I thought there was a real chance that I could lose my moring from a sanity perspective and never come back and I realized six to eight weeks later after spending a lot of time with someone I've known forever who I've had a very contentious, emotionally volatile relationship with lots of triggers things I thought were beyond repair meaning couldn't spend more than an hour with this person without feeling extreme agitation and anger well up in some fashion and I had I had given up on that changing that long ago I realized let's just call it six weeks after my two nights that 90% of that was gone with this person and completely gone and to this day it has not come back and that has repeated itself or I've seen that in a number of my closest relationships the value of that is hard to overemphasize it's hard to even put it towards and it's so far outside any conceptual schema in medicine or therapy that I've run into it's hard to convey in a way that makes any sense because I've had so many people ask me well how did that happen I do not have a good explanation for that all I do know is since then having explored this both on an experiential level having spent time in several countries working with people who are some of the best at what they do and I do think I'm very very good at vetting that hopefully people believe that after looking at the books and the podcast and so on I'm really good at getting a hold of people who are really really good and I'm very good at vetting and having explored this space also from a scientific standpoint it just gets more interesting it just gets more unbelievable yet at the same time compelling and some of the changes I have seen in people are they they defy explanation by any conventional means and I'll throw out a few examples but before I throw out the examples I want to make it really clear that these compounds are not for everyone there are contraindications things can go wrong and they're not a panacea they do not fix everything by any stretch of the imagination but for certain types of depilitating conditions thought patterns fear they are remarkable really really impressive to the point that it is outside of the care and feeding and love of my family and myself my closest friends it is what I am most focused on furthering from a scientific standpoint certainly so you and another friend who's a mutual friend of ours so it's all this big circle of people we know but shared an equally remarkable story with me about a single experience he had had in this case it was so a siren as opposed to iolaska that also took him to this place of you know incredible emotional pain that led to a change in a belief in this case it was for this individual it was it was a belief system around a person who was no longer alive so some of them had lost I will never probably forget my first experience with siren for the same reason it's interesting I I didn't know that that experience you described came from your very second time with a lausca I was familiar with that story because you'd shared it with me before but hadn't pegged it to such an early time but my first experience with so a side been if not for the fact that I had that experience I wouldn't know what the hell you were talking about right now because it seems so improbable implausible and impossible that something that occurs over a span of six or eight hours that is nothing more than these compounds that come from these plants could so fundamentally alter the way we interact with other people in my case it was very similar it was a very important person in my life for whom I'd not had a great relationship in a very long time because I simply had no empathy now Michael Pollan has written about this so eloquently and I wish I could even half reiterate what he said because I remember him writing about it going that's exactly it which is for the first time in your life or at least for me I'm not seeing the world through my eyes anymore and David Foster Wallace has talked about this so eloquently in his talk which is one of my favorite talks this is water every experience we have is through our own eyes and these plants give you that ability to be out of that and I still remember watching myself as a 13 year old boy in this situation and for the first time ever not seeing that situation from my vantage point instead seeing it from the vantage point of others and that led to the most profound emotional breakdown which again these are very durable changes I mean I'm a couple of years out of this but I truly believe that 40 years from now I will still have this exact set of feelings about this particular individual and this particular experience and you're right there is how do you explain that it's very difficult and these compounds many of the classic psychedelics let's just for the sake of argument will leave LSD out of the running for a number of reasons including just the the political PR baggage that that acronym carries but we're looking at say mescalin which is found in payo de its found in the San Pedro or Wachuma cactus in South America among other places and we're looking at psilocybin found in quite a few different mushrooms these are compounds that have been used for hundreds of years probably millennia by different civilizations and you have amony to moscario which was used in Europe you have psychedelics that have been used all over the world psychedelics referring to and there's there are different ways to try to define this term but mind manifesting is what the word refers to if you look at the etymology but I would say experientially one of the defining characteristics of psychedelics and we probably will talk about we might have the chance to talk about mdma later which is in some way can be used for for many of the same conditions but I wouldn't consider a psychedelic simply because psychedelics provide what is often referred to at high enough dosages ego dissolution or a controlled death experience where you cease to exist as this subject who is viewing your experience of reality but that is so powerful that again we talk about it with these sort of in this sort of banal way but until you experience that that statement is so difficult to comprehend it is imagine imagine if you will and there there are different analogies or metaphors you can use but imagine if your whole life you have been the protagonist at least in your own mind you are the primary actor in the play of your life and you've always been the primary actor in the play of your life and there are other actors of course all these people you've ever met and for the first time you realize that it's a play and you're sitting in the audience and you're the playwright you're the person who has the ability to look at it from every perspective and you can change the lines of the primary actor that person known as Tim and my case that person known as Peter if you want to change their lines you want to change their backstory you want to change the stories they tell themselves you have the ability to do that because you're sitting in the audience as an observer of this person who is known as Peter or Tim and this is similar to the type of experience that people can have through meditation and they might describe it as instead of being outside standing in the storm you're standing inside looking through the window at the storm or you are instead of being inside the washing machine you're zooming out 18 inches so that you're looking into the washing machine in your observing what is happening as opposed to being tumbled by it and in fact the the states achieved through psychedelics and in very experienced meditators although I'm convinced that you can achieve this state pretty quickly through meditation it doesn't have to take 20 years is remarkably similar as best we know or there are some similarities I should say neurophysiologically in the sense that both seem to not necessarily deactivate but decrease activity in something refer to as the default mode network and this default mode network and Peter you may do a better job of explain this Michael Paul does a fantastic job of describing this in his book how to change your mind which I recommend to everyone yeah we'll link to the book we'll also link to your interview with Michael recently which was excellent as well even if people say they're not quite ready to read the book at the very least they should invest the time and listen to the podcast and by the way I would not suggest that anyone jump out and tomorrow go on Craigslist to try to find a shaman to take you through some experience even if you felt like that was an inevitable step you ultimately want to take there are some things that I would recommend first that can buy themselves be exceptionally, exceptionally useful so to come back to it though the ability to for the first time view this ego that refers to itself in my case as Tim who is a combination of many different things the identity that we have had to voice to upon us or conditioned into us but also that we've created for ourselves by the stories we tell ourselves that we've always told ourselves oh my you know my wife always does this my dad always does that I always do this I never do that these stories that we've told ourselves just so long that we've come to accept it is just a fiber in our being to look at it and realize that you can reformat almost every part of that or you can take trauma that you experienced as a child and for the first time ever re-contextualized as an adult without a motion to look at it with a level of emotional calmness so that you can finally close that that that circle is difficult to describe so I don't want to try too hard to put words to something which by definition if we're talking about mystical experiences which is a a corollary to the durability of these effects let me restate that and English that is a little easier to understand when you look at for instance studies that have been done research has been done at whether it's Johns Hopkins and why you are other places and I've gone to know the team at Johns Hopkins quite well and a huge amount of respect and admiration for what they've they've done and continue to do in many of the studies whether they're looking at terminal cancer patients and end of life anxiety or they're looking at lifelong smokers who came into a study specifically to look at how celcius I've been could be used for the cessation of smoking the duration of effect the durability of effect is very closely linked to something that you could refer to as a mystical experience and it turns out as you would hope there are different types of scales and measurements one can use to determine if something is a mystical experience or not and there's some debate about this but there are ways that you can assess whether something qualifies as a mystical experience based on looking at the historical accounts and writings of people who would consider mystics and one of them is in effortability the inability for someone to verbalize their experience that the words somehow do violence to the experience or don't do it justice. Pauling gives a great example of that in his book I believe it was Michael Paulin in his book how to change your mind about it you take somebody from you know whatever a thousand years ago put him in a time machine bring him the time square but I'm hanging out for five hours shoot him back can they describe what they saw not really they could say that it was big loud and bright but other than that they couldn't explain what a car is they couldn't explain what a building is or a skyscraper because the vocabulary hadn't even been developed and that to me is like the greatest example I'll be at somewhat a lib of this idea of being ineffable which is you and I can sit here and talk about it in short-hand but it's very difficult to explain to one of our friends maybe who hasn't experienced this and when you you know again it's these things sound so goofy when you say them like these experiences you see yourself from outside of yourself you know if someone hasn't experienced that I can understand why they would look at you a little funny and say okay intellectually I understand what you mean by that but why would that matter why would that be profound how would that disrupt your ego it's very difficult to convey and I would say that what I've experienced and what I've certainly seen and heard other people experience in their reports to me and in writing in book very books that I've read is the importance of the felt experience and that in some senses it's not that you have a psychedelic experience you have three realizations you bring those realizations back to this ordinary reality you take certain actions based on those realizations and based on that intellectual legwork your life changes it is not something strictly in the domain of words and thinking and just thinking harder and working harder in other words you're not taking the things that got you here if you've achieved anything professional or personally the pro and con list the spreadsheets the logical arguments it's not that you just get a better set of those things that you bring back it's that you are finally able to see and experience and feel something like empathy deeply for the first time for someone you've never felt it for or you feel love for yourself truly for the first time and you think holy shit like that's what's been missing I've never even felt that if someone had asked me what a self love feel like I wouldn't have had an answer for it these are the things that really stick and I think given the plasticity of the mind or plasticity of the brain that allow as one researcher put it to me you to instead of going to the top of the ski slope and then taking the tracks that have been worn and of course the deeper the tracks get the harder it is to kind of hop out of them as you're skiing but to get to the top and to have four fresh feet of powder fall on the entire mountains that you you have the ability to choose an entirely new path and entirely new record to play it's hard to verbalise but one way to think about it for me has as allowed me to come to grips with this because there's a part of me that has sometimes thought like this is too good to be true it's going to go away this new found empathy I have for person acts or this reduction in this horrible negative emotion I've had that's going to go away in six months and and I thought of something which is when you look at the opposite of that which is how often is a person's life changed for the worse based on one event and the answer is all the goddamn time a child could be abused once and that can change their life forever and again we're not going to go into that now because that is its own topic but so many of the horrible habits that we carry into adulthood are really because we never became adults we are basically adaptive children who are taking on a set of behaviors to protect wounded children and sometimes those wounds occurred very acutely and so in many ways these experiences with psychedelics if administered correctly in the correct setting with the correct integration can act as the exact opposite of a wounding event in other words with something that is so acute and so poignant you can just change the direction of this trajectory this vehicle doesn't necessarily mean it's orthogonal and of course there's so much more to it than that many people go through similar types of abuse and they don't all have the same impact and similarly many people can experience a psychedelic and not have the same impact but I think when I started to think of it in that way it started to become much more understandable why this could happen just as something horrible could alter the course of your life and you know I'm going to one of the podcasts I've already recorded that will be coming out later this summer will be with Cory who you and I spent a couple of days with up at Curn it's an excellent security prison yeah and when we did this we spent this this time up there with the five ventures the story of Cory's life is unbelievable and it's just a again at no point in there I think is Cory using any of these things that happened to him when he was young as excuses for the road he went down but it's impossible to argue that those experiences many of them very acute in this moment on this day in this place at this time completely set him on a different path and he could have been otherwise so as you said I I love the idea of this stage analogy because to me that's actually one of the best analogies I've ever heard about how how minefulness meditation works is it's the awareness that there is a stage that's simply what it comes down to and to be able to leave your vantage point as one actor to step back and see that you are an actor on a stage is I think one of the most empowering things and that's why I sort of love this interplay between you know meditation and these psychedelic agents there's an interplay there's an interrelatedness there is a reinforcement a mutual reinforcement also which is why I'd love to mention a few things just to give people a chance to crack their knuckles and stretch for a second in non-psychedelic territory there are a few things that I'd love to suggest people which help you to develop the same types of meta awareness that you can be thrust into through psychedelics that serve a purpose whether or not you ever choose to take one of these compounds. One would be certainly mindfulness meditation and I think by the time this podcast we're recording right now is live Sam Harris is waking up up I think it's just tremendous I think it does it exceptionally exceptionally good job of this and there's certainly guided meditations if you search say mindfulness meditation jack corn field tarab rock both outstanding Sam Harris also has some some guided meditations that he's recorded awareness meditation and Peter you feel free to jump in if I don't do this justice but awareness meditation being different from say other forms of meditation many of which I have used and still use on occasion perhaps one of the more popular of which being say transcendental meditation mantra based it is a concentration practice where you are repeating a mantra to yourself over and over and over and over again as a way to hone concentration and although not everyone's going to love this description to give your psyche and self a break from the incestant monkey mind and you really can reach a transcendent space where you feel like you are a point of consciousness floating if you do the 20 minutes twice a day very consistently that is a concentration practice if you are thinking of a candle flame and that or a a focal point for a period of meditation whenever you found yourself swept up and thought return to a candle flame that would also be a concentration practice if you're doing there are many also within awareness meditation there are different types but if you're doing say something referred to as I think it's sometimes called open monitoring where you're paying attention to anything that comes up as it comes up and there are different ways to approach this but a very often begins with the breath so it is in some sense a concentration practice but you're focusing on the breath you're not chasing it you're simply observing it then you focus on sounds then you focus on any discomfort or weight that you feel in your body then you perhaps later after 10 sessions 10 daily sessions begin to practice with your eyes open which I never really done before sams up which I found tremendously helpful as a bridge into then waking reality these are all practices that help you to spot the gap between sensory input and cognitive response so that you become more response able in so much as you you have a tiny gap within which you can choose your response as opposed to simply reflexively going through life like some type of slug that's been shocked in a scanner box or something and you have more optionality you suddenly realize they're just more options on the menu then oh whenever someone so does this I always get pissed off there are more options on the menu and that by the way having that basic ability having the just the ABCs of that awareness and control will give you a tremendous advantage and allow you to get very often much more value out of any psychedelic experience because you will have had let's just call it 50 sessions on a boogie board before they're like oh cool here's a surf board it's hurricane season have fun good luck like maybe you catch a wave chances are your first experience is going to be getting tumble a lot and you can accelerate the you can steep in the learning curve really dramatically for later getting more out of psychedelics very often if you develop some of this basic awareness beforehand I'm kind of amazed at how difficult it is for me to convince some of my patients at the importance of meditation and I find sometimes by just telling them about my own struggles and my own journey to accept first of all that this was something that was beneficial even when it didn't feel beneficial and too to realize that you have to sort of figure out what's going to work for you but it's worth making that effort I agree with you I think that just even putting the apps aside it's different people have different ways of explaining things and I remember a math professor I had in college and this was early this might have been like I must have been I was either a freshman or a sophomore but he said something that always resonated with me because now you were sort of getting outside of like you know a rudimentary calculus and stuff and mathematics was starting to get very abstract and he said look if you're reading a proof and you don't understand it assume that the person who is presenting it doesn't know how to present it to you find somebody else and so I think that that really holds also for meditation which is there are just going to be some people who guide in a way that you're willing to be guided and so you shouldn't be put off if someone's listening to this thinking oh you know every time I try meditation it doesn't work for me or something like that and so I don't want to sort of name the app side went through but there were many apps that I went through that just didn't resonate for me you know just the way that they talked about this didn't make sense to me but then when you find the ones that do and there are several that do for me including Sam's waking up which you and I've been lucky enough along with a number of other folks to get the beta version of that which got it it's been six months it's been a while yeah I remember Sam giving me a to me in January the way Sam explains it really resonates with me and there are others that do so the same Jeff Warren was also one of the guides on Dan Harris is no relation to Sam Harris 10% happier I just love the way he explains stuff and so you know I would say to anybody who's listening to this who's feeling sort of bearish on meditation try a different app try a different guide try a different book try another way keep going till you find someone who can walk you through how to do this in a way that resonates and the others mentioned to others since they're very easy to test another is headspace the 10 and 10 program I think is a very very well done format for beginning us 10 minutes a day for 10 days and it is quite well done calm for some people who like the background nature sounds for instance I've used that app and many of my friends really find that to be with a female guide to be there preferred mode of meditation and then you can meditate in silence you can consider taking a TM course as I did which actually really served to kickstart a lot of my meditation because it cost money so I had that sunk cost working in my favor and it's effectively four lunch breaks over four days I want to say if I'm remembering correctly and you have to meditate in between those sessions so you have homework and you are going to feel like a dufist and a disappointment and be embarrassed if you don't do those sessions so you have someone holding you accountable I eat the teacher to actually put this into practice for at least a four day period and that in and of itself I pushed off for so long I for so so long and I remember Chase Jarvis I'll give him credit again at one point said 10 you can afford it it worked for me what is the downside if it doesn't work for you you still get to meditate with someone else for four days might that be worth it and I didn't have a good counter argument so eventually I acquiesced and took that step which was which was very it was one of the first times I finally felt what I had the first hand experience of what meditation could deliver which is in some ways equally difficult to describe as the psychedelic experience when you have your first session where you've completely lost any rumination or compulsive thinking about your to do list and it might just be the last five minutes of a 20 minute session and you come out of it and you just feel this serene piece that perhaps you haven't even touched on for 10 years you go oh okay now I get it if this is something that I could actually call upon reliably that is a super power and for that reason I would say for that if you're going to commit to this commit to it like you would a workout program or a diet you don't go to the gym once and come back and wake up with a six pack abs the next morning for me at least if I take a break and there are periods when I live especially by the way if you eat like we've eaten in Austin we have eaten there's so much good food here you have to be very careful about portion control but if you want to get a taste for what meditation can do I would say commit to 10 days and for me at least if for whatever reason I lapse and there's certainly periods when I lapse this happens to me diet happens happens to be of exercise and occasionally it's like you know what I have a meditate for two weeks for whatever number reasons it will take me I would say five to seven days to finally stop grinding gears and shift into a calmer state there there's a certain loading phase almost like creating or something there it takes me five to seven days to click into that different gear at which point I go oh yes this is why it's so important now I remember yeah there's a great book out there called altered states which I read this year that I think does a great job of parsing that concept out which is it altered states or altered traits oh it's altered traits and it makes the point that it's not about the state thank you for that correction we've had a whole bunch of people potentially going to Amazon I can't find this book or maybe they're at that book does exist and it's completely they're on book but that's exactly the point right which is that we don't meditate for the state the state can be pleasurable I ought to be honest I don't find it that pleasurable I don't actually enjoy meditating that much sometimes I do but but as many times as I do it's difficult for me it's work it's sometimes truthfully it feels like I suck like I'm boy it's really amazing the frequency with which thoughts keep entering my mind I forget who I'm again I can't remember if it was Sam Harris or a different guide who made this point which was actually I think it was actually Jeff Warren which was he described it as the bicep curl of the brain is not the cessation of thought it's the recognition of the thought that then allows you to go back to the breath or whatever the focus is and boy that really again that's just an example of like that's not a particularly like profound difficult to understand concept but it's exactly what I needed to hear which is don't be discouraged that you keep having thoughts that's the exercise the exercise is acknowledging it recognizing it going back to the focus which in this case could be the breath or a sound or something like that and so it's not about that state that you may or may not achieve just as some people who like you and I we love exercising so we actually get a pretty good state out of it I actually if exercise provided no benefit I would still do it just because of how I feel when I do it but for many people that's not the case but exercise is still valuable if you spend an hour a day exercising it's really what it's what it's doing through that other 23 hours so that's I guess that would be the next thing I would say to anybody listening to this who's tried meditation who has found it to be unpleasurable or uninteresting or whatever it's like that's okay you're not doing it for what you experience in that 20 minutes I would also add and this just just occurred to me because I think you're you're in some ways looting to this that in my experience having observed hundreds of thousands of listeners and readers attempt or not attempt succeed or not succeed with different forms of meditation it's very important and this applies to many many different things including physical exercises as far as as I'm concerned but the good program that you follow I let's let's lower it even further the consistent program that you follow is better than the perfect program that you quit so if you're having trouble following a meditation program and you've committed to doing it daily which is a very important commitment in the beginning keep lowering the bar if you think 20 minutes is too much do 10 minutes 10 minutes too much do five minutes if concentration meditation is too difficult use a guided meditation and I recall at one point there were there are two things that I recall having been said to me I think tarabrock mentioned the first I could be mis-tributing but I think it was tarabrock of first said this to me her book Radical Acceptance by the way ties into everything that we're talking about beautifully it had a huge impact on me and has had a huge impact on many people it's the type of title that's going to scare off a lot of people because I think it's going to be a bunch of woohandaway of you stuff there's a little bit of woo in there but it is a incredibly good book Radical Acceptance if you have any type of emotional patterns or thought patterns it's seem to control you as opposed to the other way around this is a worthwhile book and her guide in meditation is very good but we were chatting a header on the podcast on my own podcast and I believe was tarabrock said the repetition for doing the bicep curl isn't the 20 minute session where you sit perfectly without having a single extraneous thought occur the repetition is when you get distracted and something comes up and then bringing it back to the breath so you should be happy when that happens because that is the work the work isn't doing it perfectly every time it took me three years to understand that yeah three years of frustration and am I doing this right and you know why can't I stop thinking and and just all of this misunderstanding but boy once you get what the bicep curl is it's freeing and it makes the pass fail bar lower which for many of the people who most need meditation which I think has a brand like me branding problem it should be called you know emotional non-reactivity training or something that sounds very appealing to you know type A driven people emotional non-reactivity conditioning program there you go or just warm bath for the mind might be appealing to other people but meditation as such is it's a word that's becomes it's so overused and unfortunately could use a rebrand but for the time being meditation and a successful meditation session should in the beginning be as easy as possible to fit into your life you need to stack the deck particularly in the beginning and TM transcendental meditation was very good at instilling this in the training for me at least they said if you say the mantra once in a session that is a successful session you have 20 minutes to say a two-cellable mantra once that's a successful session and you might even drop it further and say you know this is the goal this would be miraculous but if I just sit for 20 minutes with my eyes closed that's a successful meditation session and sometimes I've honestly wondered how much of the benefit comes from some of the mental practices versus just sitting still and breathing with my eyes closed. Well that's actually really interesting that that gets to something I want to talk a little bit about which is the study of psychedelics but while we're on that topic it's it's hard to sometimes study these things because of these performance biases right it's hard to disaggregate the effect of just sitting there for 20 minutes and luckily some of those experiments have been which is you know you take a group and instead of saying the control group just doesn't do anything maybe you have the control group sit in silence for 20 minutes and then you can sort of disagree at those things. So Tim you've spoken with me quite a bit about your interest in funding science and that goes back to even before the discussion of psychedelics but very recently you've made a pretty large commitment are you comfortable talking about that publicly. I am I am very very comfortable talking about publicly I have almost entirely redirected not just what I would have invested in startups but a multiple of that into scientific research. I've made the commitment for me which is by far the largest commitment to not just science but even any given startup that I've ever made financially and that's a million dollars a minimum of a million dollars over the next several years several meaning three or four and I expect I'll exceed that one million dollar amount with primarily a focus on psilocybin and mdma but that could extend to other compounds which which I also find to be understood and that have been in some ways shelved for decades for primarily political and not scientifically justifiable reasons. When we started talking about this when you were thinking about it I remember one of the stories that you really liked was a relatively unknown story in the world of philanthropy unless you dig deep in the animals about the woman by the name of Katherine McCormick that story really resonated with you what was it about that story? Well you should you should tell this story because I think it's it's so noteworthy on a number of different levels but what struck me was how if time to write and if thought about intelligently where you're focusing on points of leverage how even a single person with relatively moderate amounts of investment and moderate is relative right but let me rephrase that how how someone or a small group of people if concentrating on points of leverage in furthering in this case scientific studies can really bend the arc of history in a way that most people would find unbelievable because when folks think of say pharma or bringing a new drug to market in the largest scale census it's billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars but that story was appealing to me because on many levels but what I'd love to do is have you tell it and then I will I will point out the the parts if this were a Kindle chapter which parts I would highlight to go back to to remind myself of certain things but why don't you tell the story because it's such a great example of what one person or a small group of committed people can do I'll leave it at that well it can be probably be read about more eloquently than I can restate it but the just of it was Catherine McCormick and I believe the early 60s or late 50s met a gentleman I believe his name was Gregory Pankis if I'm not mistaken and I think that's right I had a dinner party or a copy of it yeah and and basically he explained to her that he was pretty convinced he could chemically synthesize hormones that could be served as a birth control pill or serve as a birth control pill for women and she was no dummy or self she went to it with MIT yeah I believe had been involved with also funding housing for additional female students so they could attend yeah and her hypothesis was if we could create a birth control pill we could completely change the interaction that women can have with education with work with the family balance etc now we take this we listen to the story today and we think well what's the big deal like so what she funded the research for the birth control pill but the reality of it is at the time again I can't remember I must have the dates wrong but certainly it was long enough ago that this was viewed as an absolute no go I mean there was simply you know birth control was such a taboo and what's really interesting is she decided to fund something that was incredibly risky that no farm a company was willing to touch with a ten foot pole because it was viewed as just a way to sink money into a bottomless pit that could never achieve the regulatory approval and using again a relatively small sum of money and I believe in today's dollars it's to the tune of about 25 million dollars she sunk into the work of this guy pinkus and one other gentleman whose name is escaping me over the span of something like about a decade yeah maybe eight years and when you my favorite graph that I ever saw which was kind of the holy shit moment was the graph of the number of women in graduate schools professional school law school business school whatever pre and post the introduction of the birth control pill and it's you don't get to see a lot of hockey sticks you know as one of my friends once put it it's really cool when the data don't need statistics to be analyzed it's not like well there was a statistically significant increase in the rate at which women entered the workforce not like you didn't have to say the words statistically significant it was a step function change and I don't know I just I thought that was such an interesting story and I remember when you and I were talking about this a while ago I I don't know we've been away I told you the story but you you seem to really grip to it there were many reasons for it I think partially being at the time in Silicon Valley and surrounded by venture capital I saw some of the stupidest I don't know how else to put it just stupidest non viable ideas raise tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars let's just stick with film thru optic dollars no I mean thru profit okay startups repeatedly I mean you just saw dozens and hundreds of examples over time of this and it struck me that we find ourselves in a unique time which sposes something it goes without saying every time is a unique time but in the sense that long ago this is worth discussing for a quick second psychedelic specifically LSD were through the controlled I think it's the controlled substance is act scheduled put into the the schedule one class of drug classification which means high potential for addiction no no known medical or no medical application no demonstrate medical application putting them in the same class as heroin and to be clear for the listener who might not appreciate that even cocaine is scheduled to right which means it still has potential for addiction that everybody acknowledges but it does have at least one viable medical application which is it turns out to be a pretty good local anesthetic in the nose which is ironic of course but it therefore does have a medical use and it's used routinely in antisurgery so if these compounds are so useful if they can have some of the effects without guarantee of course it's not batting a thousand every time if you have a hundred people at random or using these some with direction some without you're not going to have a perfect record but if if even some of the time the effects can be achieved the outcomes can be seen that we're discussing how did these compounds including LSD end up in this category and there it's a it's a multi factorial problem and it's hard to say there's one causal agent but there are a few things that happened at the time number one many people don't realize pollen gets into this really fascinating but LSD 25 which was first isolated or synthesized by Albert Hoffman it was developed on the part or on behalf of a farm accompanied it was later used rose correct I want to say the sandals oh you're right you're right it was sandals and then it was later used in a program that if I remember incorrectly was CIA led called MK Ultra where it might be used as a truth serum for interrogations and things of this type or to confuse and sabotage enemies of the state and it got out into the wild and then the adventure began so to speak and LSD was widely distributed and at the time you had parents who had never experienced psychedelics we were going into the Vietnam era and we had a number of characters come on to the scene in a very high profile ways one of them being and he cannot be even though he is often given the blame I don't think it's it's fair to do this you know literally but Tim Lieri came onto the scene he was at Harvard as was Richard Alpert who later became Ram dos and the things exploded at Harvard and they were both I believe fired I don't think they resigned preemptively because psilocybin was given to an undergraduate when it was only supposed to be administered to graduate students and at some point Lieri decided that science was too slow and that the way to effect cultural change was to have tens of millions of people yet a specific number in mind and that that would effectively lead to a tipping point where all these positive effects on society would be inevitable and if you think about the cultural setting you have a lot of young people being told to drop out of school to resist war efforts and all of that made a number of figures including Lieri very high profile targets that could not in some ways be ignored by the administration and so Nixon famously said Timothy Lieri's the most dangerous man in America and you had parents who could not in any way conceive of the experiences that their children were having on these compounds and that along with dozens of other things was a recipe for political crackdown which is exactly what happened what you have now is you have parents who are well in many cases certainly products of the sixties who have had psychedelics experiences you have people who are in positions of power or in regulatory organizations who have in in some cases experience psychedelics you also have studies now being conducted even though it's it's with great difficulty because of all of the approvals and DEA oversight and so on that's required that are going back to the dozens and hundreds of studies that were performed before the the crackdown and rescheduling and applying more rigorous scientific standards and that is combined with a number of as you mentioned earlier epidemic level problems that we're experiencing that are costing I would have to imagine billions of billions of dollars namely opiate addiction depression PTSD right if you add up the costs associated with those three if we want to be a little crass about it and just look at the profit loss it makes a lot of sense based on the data thus far to explore some of these compounds and that's part of the reason why for instance in the case of MDMA and PTSD the FDA has granted MDMA breakthrough therapy designation which means that not only is the process expedited for ultimately phase three trials that the FDA is in a sense a collaborator so instead of saying all right your methodology is approved and I'm going to apologize and advance this is not phase three trials are not my or effects for these so if I make any if I miss speak I apologize and certainly feel free to correct me in comments somewhere but the FDA is effectively a partner who helps them to navigate the entire process instead of saying your methodology is approved see in three years and you're going to get a pass fail which is a precarious position for any compound let alone something that is currently scheduled to be that MDMA is and we don't have to get into right now but there's also something called the special protocol assessment SPA which should hopefully if the stars align in some ways which I think they they very well might give MDMA a very high probability of ultimately being prescribable with and used in supervised settings it would not be a take home drug in other words but PTSD and specifically with respect to let's say returning war veterans or victim of sexual abuse is a it is a highly bipartisan issue or I should better say it's a non-partisan issue it's very hard for someone to say fuck the vets so the risk of of that getting shot down politically I'm not going to say zero because it's never zero but it's there are more attractive targets if you're looking for a reelection or looking for press time there are safer targets to go after to achieve that than this and then within the scientific community looking at psilocybin which there are at least two entities right now that are presenting phase two data to the FDA and I'm optimistic that within the next year at least one of them will proceed into phase three trials psilocybin has shown remarkable efficacy at least based on preliminary data for end of life or I should say event based depression and people with terminal diagnoses terminal cancer diagnoses and that may end up getting extended to major depressive disorder which is to be continued to be determined but I've already helped to raise funding and also apply funding myself to a study that will be looking at treatment resistant depression at Johns Hopkins utilizing psilocybin and that means I believe by the book to pre-chronic depression that is failed at least two interventions or two other treatments. Are there other agents to him? I mean loosely speaking and this is a gross oversimplification and we will probably get into a few of these time permitting certainly as you said MDMA has really shown pretty remarkable efficacy in PTSD. It's it's wild it's one of those similar to the graph you mentioned I've related to McCormick. Yeah it's just not subtle. It's not subtle. You don't need the p-value to see the difference. No no no no it's I think I'm getting this right anyone interested can certainly look up maps that you can find them at maps.org who have spearheaded a lot of this but I believe that psychotherapy alone something like 27% effective at reducing the scale measurement and I'm adding a little bit here but let's just say that there is a rating of 0 to 10 for determining severity of PTSD anything about three is PTSD something along those lines this is a bit of ad lib but I think it's something between 20 and 27% decreased to below a three so they were no longer they would no longer be diagnosed as having PTSD with psychotherapy alone I don't remember the timeframe. When psychotherapy was combined with MDMA was something like 70% I mean it's just not subtle at all. So which again we could spend just two hours just talking about the role the relationship of trauma and psychological damage and how MDMA can help with that the other thing of course which we talked about very briefly earlier was iboga and ibogane in the treatment of opioid addiction which probably has the worst success rate amongst societal epidemics that are being treated by conventional means I mean there really aren't great options for for the individuals with with opioid addiction and then of course celacid but as you said on end of life depression major depressive along with smoking cessation I heard it's even being looked at now for alcoholism. It is and there are few predominant classes people can look at when it comes to psychedelics I believe you have the there are the trip to means and then the phenethyl amines I believe it is but we don't have to get into all that partially because I'll just embarrass myself but coming back to the default node network which I think is worth returning to for a second which listeners might recall is this collection of different parts of the brain that appear to be active when you are doing nothing what is doing nothing mean and this was discovered I believe in part when scientists were doing calibrations within FMR I'm a chance to do nothing we want to get a baseline and this is the part of the brain that's quite exciting what the hell is going on and it appears to be highly activated when people are engaging in any type of self-referential thinking I had as it affect so not only like think about fear but what makes you fear what makes you fearful okay boom then default mode not work seems to light up any type of temporal projection in other words thinking about the past thinking about the future seems to also light this up and pollen does a great job of digging into this in the book and a number of people have written about this in very eloquent terms robin car her at Harris out of the UK is one of them but to do just pose a question that I think is something that's being explored currently if say anxiety is being stuck in the future and being depressed is being stuck in the past what happens if you're able to temporarily suspend or deactivate that system to some extent and to give yourself that witness perspective so you can look at yourself without being yourself and the implication if many of these psychedelic compounds are able to achieve that is an even Tom Insol who I think is the former head of the National Institute on or of mental health and I am age if you look at OCD you look at different types of depression different types of anxiety and so on these are nice these are very cleanly separated out in some type of what is the the term for this desk reference the people use for the DSM DSM in the DSM but they may all be slightly different species of the same thing which is why something like psilocybin appears to be LSD very similar story mescalin probably very similar story at high enough doses can be used for anything that appears to involve obsessive thought patterns or behaviors that includes alcoholism it includes smoking it includes opiate addiction and there are studies that are seeking funding right now I know at Johns Hopkins related to opiate addiction through the lens of psilocybin treatment which I'm very very interested in eating disorders like anorexia these may in fact be very interrelated phenomena and conditions so you mentioned a few that are LSD I think is off the table not for scientific reasons but for political reasons it's just too loaded there's too much baggage and let us not forget that the media plays a very large role in how politics respond to things and in today's day and age I do not have a high level of confidence that LSD since it was once painted as the villain is not it's too seductive I think in a clickbait world to not fall into the same bear trap in a way so psilocybin then you have MDMA which is thought by referred to as some people as an anactogen or empathogen this is not probably not scientifically too granularly accurate but it appears to tone down that's not a scientific term but tone down the amygdala and fear response that we have to say recalling or reliving traumatic events and it allows us to people say with PTSD we've seen their friends heads blown off or had to blow other people's heads off whatever might be people have been raped etc to in some sense clean up a very messy experience that did a lot of damage and to help people to heal themselves in nonverbal ways this is really key it's very it's very it's very hard for many people to talk their way out of something they didn't talk their way into that's so well said I mean you said in one sentence what I tried to say in like 20 sentences a while ago about the experiences that can cause pain can be so jarring that it should be at least acknowledged or considered that equally jarring chemical experiences might be necessary to put that new powder on the slope definitely so you have MDMA MDMA I'll be honest I was I was biased in some ways against MDMA for a long time because A I didn't have much personal experience with anything chemically related MDMA I had a fear associated with it because of research which I think has since been largely debunked in terms of risks for people who are predisposed to depression for instance it was also at one point viewed as an end is still used recreational as a party drug and I've I've really been swayed to the other side I'm very bullish on MDMA as a therapy I think that it is extremely it's an extremely powerful inflexible tool that does not entail the type of perceptual distortion that some of these second Alex do which is not to say I am not bullish on second Alex I am but it requires much more sophisticated training to administer so MDMA I boga and I begin going back to MDMA I do think it is important to point out if anybody is listening to this thinking well of all of these compounds MDMA is pretty easy to get and you know you can get it packaged and other things and it's ecstasy et cetera but this goes back to intent setting and integration I really do not I am not convinced that just taking MDMA going to a party is somehow going to unwind any of these problems I mean this really I would go further than that and I would bet against it yeah if someone gave me a hundred grand and they said all right this person is going to take MDMA go to a party ten times what is the likelihood that it's going to fix ex-long standing problem I'd go a hundred thousand dollars every single dollar against yeah I would short it and I know people in fact who have used MDMA recreationally and then used it in supervised settings and it is as if they are taking a different drug yeah that that just can't be overstated and I'm not just staying at cause I'm a doctor and I'm supposed to say something responsible but I mean that regardless it's and that for me is the urgency around this stuff it's I think about I think about myself frankly but I think about my patients and I think about a lot of my patients that would benefit from these things that I've experienced or even things that I haven't experienced that I've seen people experience and I I've never had such a sense of urgency around this I mean prior to this the most urgency I ever had was waiting for PCSK nine inhibitors to come on the market when I read that first paper in the New England Journal of Medicine about 12 years ago on the discovery of this type of you know these these individuals who had missense mutations in that enzyme that lowered their LDL significantly but boy the the anxiety might be the wrong word but the anticipation I had for that class of drugs which anybody listening to this is probably falling asleep thinking that's here an interesting guy if that's what was keeping you up at night waiting for that drug but but this takes it to another level which is almost nobody I know has not been traumatized on some level and it doesn't always have to be something that is so obvious so you know we've all been traumatized we've all sort of been hurt we're all dealing with these things and yet I feel how quickly can these things go through this regulatory pathway to get into the hands of people who would know how to administer them I certainly wouldn't right even if these things were legal today that's only half the battle it's can you create enough practitioners that know you know how to select the right patients and how to apply the treatment because this is in many ways harder than any other treatments we have today you know people talk today about the importance of combining psychotherapy with any depressants but that's really the tip of the iceberg compared and it's it's also tricky from a commercial standpoint in so much as part of the reason these compounds haven't been picked up like a football and run to the the end zone by big pharma is that many of these studies only involve two or three sessions with psilocybin yeah a naturally occurring molecule in these cases it's synthesized but there's a lot more money to be made in something that you can charge an arm in a leg for that you have to take on a daily basis or and every other day basis indefinitely as opposed to two or three times with some pre-work and post-work with durable effects in many cases that that's financially an unattractive model to many people and I think it's a mistake there are some for profit companies out there I just say startups who are going after this and I'll be very disappointed if they try to make their money on the molecule by blocking other people from doing a researcher manufacturing and good manufacturing in GMP facilities and so on rather I think they should make their money on the services on the therapy so that's that's maybe a separate discussion now why is ibogaine taken the longest track and why is that still the one that seems to have gained the least traction for testing in the United States I've spoken to a number of people philanthropists who are really interested in this open addiction problem and yet they are understandably not interested in funding research outside of the United States and basically their view is until the DA and the FDA allow for a similar pathway we're not interested in funding this and I worry that there's a bit of a stalemate there is this is this thawing I don't think it is yet to thaw there are some researchers in a blanking on names I apologize but there are a number of researchers are doing very good work looking at ibogaine have been studying at ibogaine in the United States part of what makes ibogaine tricky if on one end of the spectrum you have mdma which again I don't consider a classical psychedelic but as a tool that can be applied to some of the same conditions what makes mdma attractive is general low toxicity relative ease of administration short duration if we're looking at I want to say four to six hours let's say maybe a little bit longer four to eight hours i began falls on the opposite of the spectrum now i before we get to put it on the opposite of the spectrum I should say I know people very directly if you had family members who are her when addicts and say prostituting themselves I mean on death store if they weren't going to die from an overdose they might die from getting shot in the street and in a case like that where nothing else has worked including some say alternatives like method on i've seen kids who were ivy and has worked I mean don't the practitioners of this offer that at one year the recidivism is only twenty percent I don't know the exact numbers but that's given what else I've seen with these compounds it wouldn't I don't find that unbelievable yeah if i'm recalling that's only with two weeks of of intervention now these are people that are put into a you know a very heavily supervised detox environment where the the ibogaine itself are administered over a one week period outside of the you know pre and post integration so I think the entire therapy if i recall it's about six weeks there are there are many different formats and I know people who have been involved with running some of these clinics and certainly there are people like goboramate who have looked at opiate addiction very closely but ended up as I understand at least looking at iawasca and others for helping people who are addicted to opiates i'd be gain is very it's it's unlike some of the others such as psilocybin in that it acts on a whole slew of different receptors and let's discuss what puts it on the opposite end so yes it can have these seemingly miraculous effects on opiate addiction and part of the reason for that experientially is i understand it and I've never gone for a full ride i began or iboga psychedelic experience and i have no desire to it is very unpleasant it is very long so it can last as i understand it people feel free to correct me but 24 to 36 hours that is a long time and many people experience a full review of their lives and a controlled death experience whereby they get to see if in the beginning of life almost like a slideshow the decisions they've made how they've heard themselves the other people they've heard how their addiction is affected things and what goboramate they would how he might frame it is instead of asking why the addiction asks why the pain and the addiction is often a response almost inevitably but often response i'll say often to some type of trauma or pain and if you don't address that in some fashion allow people to reintegrate that somehow the likelihood of recidivism is very very high so just from a phenomenological perspective which is fancy i'm saying subject of experiential standpoint many people report that biochemically and there are people who are looking at for instance using a metabolite of i began nor i began which may mitigate some of the risks and this is part of the reason why i began hasn't taken and the risk i think we've stated is implicitly hardy i think yeah cardiac a-rhythmia people have and can die of cardiac events in using i began i don't know the specifics but i believe you can screen for this in a number of different ways to minimize the risk and then certainly you can monitor in ways having other types of more conventional pharmaceuticals on hand in the case there is some indicator of of a pending cardiac event or cardiac event itself that's one of the major risks it is one of the more potentially dangerous psychedelics it almost certainly is because compared at least say lSD or silcib and for which i don't believe there is a known ld50 meaning but you could experience better than i can yeah they all do fifty being the dose at which fifty percent of a population would receive lethal dose exactly biochemically when i was going to say this putting putting all that stuff aside for it for a moment what's so odd about this and i'm not an opiate specialist but i've had family members die from opiate overdoses i don't even know if i told you about this relatively recently and my best friend growing up on long island also died of a offentinal overdose so i have first hand experience with the pain of losing loved ones to this epidemic it appears that many people can come out of these i-bagaine treatments with close to no physical withdrawal symptoms and i don't know how that works i really don't but it does seem to be certainly one of the constituent pieces of this experience that lead to the success rate that many people are which is really interesting because it's true that opiate addiction opiate withdrawal is not physiologically harmful the way alcohol withdrawal is so delirium trements so that these detees that people get when they withdraw from alcohol will be fatal so you actually have to manage these people with benzodiazepines and other medications as you taper someone off you don't have to do that with opiates but the withdrawal is nevertheless psychologically devastating so that's interesting that you could mitigate i've read accounts where people talk very similarly about i-bagaine the way you described or the way i don't know if it was you or if it was Michael pollen on the podcast talking about the smoker i think it was Michael pollen talking about the smoker who says you know my lungs are just too beautiful to be insulted with this stuff and like i realized that and i'm like and it's like as silly as that might sound to someone listening to it that experience if profound enough can have a have a life-changing event that is durable and that's that the key is the durability and similarly i've heard these i've read these accounts of people who you know have been completely addicted to narcotics you know the account i'm thinking of in particular was it was someone using heroin and they came away from this thinking i could never stick that needle in my arm again like i could never do that to myself again because i now saw this connection i have to a plant and or another person and or another organism and again i i know that i realize that when i say that it sounds really silly it takes this or it brings us full circle in the sense also back to the beginning when i said that you shouldn't and you don't have to go through life simply tolerating yourself at best because there are a thousand things that could follow because but in part if you don't have any regard for yourself if you think you're worthless or if you think you're fatally flawed if you think you're a fuck up if you think you can't get anything right or you just don't you don't have some intrinsic love for yourself you don't see any beauty in yourself why wouldn't you be addicted why wouldn't you stick that needle in your arm why wouldn't you smoke pot five times a day and two now why wouldn't not to say there aren't applications the cannabis don't freak out people out there it's an interesting space we don't have time to get into it right now but there are so many ways you can numb or damage yourself which is a in some ways a logical coping mechanism if you have a lower guard for yourself but when you sense an interconnectedness and you suddenly have empathy not just for other people like we've felt through our experiences but empathy for yourself you look back at like the 10-year-old Peter or the 10-year-old ten-year-old ten-year-old ten-year-old and I'm just like Jesus Christ fucking poor kid I mean and I can sit with that feeling and I actually identify with that kid and forgive that kid and assure that kid everything's going to be all right it's right now in words through this microphone probably not going to have the impact that I would hope it to have but for people to feel that as if you are in the same room with that younger version of yourself can be transformative beyond anything that I could convey right now and when you have an experience like that as ludicrous as it might sound the idea of injecting some type of numbing agent into your body just becomes inconceivable in the in the same way that it would be inconceivable as you mentioned earlier how you treat yourself as ultimately how you treat others like what would you it like inject your son with that you're like to numb his experience of life of course not yeah that was just one of the most powerful experiences I ever had when I really finally accepted all of the issues I needed to accept and go into therapy was something they made me do which was carry around a picture of me at a certain age before certain things had happened that were pivotal in sort of shaping both the positive and negative aspects of my personality and the idea was and again it just works out that way it worked out that way for me that my oldest son is at about that age and just for what it's worth looks like me so it became a very easy way to look at him and say well that was me and it turns out that that was the that was the bridge to understanding it's very it's actually if you're a parent what parent can't find empathy for their child and that's like this stepping stone and so to think that these agents can do that because maybe not everybody has that luxury of having a child or having a child that looks like them at the same age when they were traumatized or something like that I mean it's it's it's very powerful and you know it just I guess it's uh there are many problems to which I really honestly have no not even the foggy as clue how to go about solving them from a practical standpoint like like talk about climate change like we could talk about climate change all day long and we could certainly wax philosophically on the lots of regulatory things that could be done to mitigate it but you start to realize very quickly that politically these things become challenging and you have all sorts of different economies around the world and they'd all have to be in lockstep and and you sort of not to be dismissive of these things or say we shouldn't work very hard at solving these but the solution space isn't that clear to me and yet when you see a problem that in my mind is the single most important problem that's plaguing our civilization and I know that's a big statement that's a super big statement and I realize it's also probably naive when you consider that there are many other problems going on but unhappiness is at the root of more pain I would suspect than any ailment that falls in the quote unquote physical body and to think that we have compounds that could play such an important role that are really facing you know challenges and getting approved I just find that really frustrating it's frustrating and it has been frustrating for people like for instance Rick Doblin who heads up maps who've been he's been at it since 1986 1986 which is just to make it happen before hand if you take into account I believe that that's when maps was officially formed if I'm not getting my facts wrong and we're at a very exciting time now where MDMA is being expedited psilocybin is certainly on its way for people who are interested in learning more about this I think maps.org is fantastic place to look in fact one of the areas where maps could you support as I understand it is in taking their approach to legitimizing MDMA use therapeutically in the US to Europe so there will be steps they'll take with the EMA I think it is which is the FDA equivalent in the EU for hopefully facilitating MDMA use in Europe so that that's certainly if you're looking to become involved with exploring and potentially supporting this as I am that is one clear and present need and it's we're also a very exciting point because psilocybin is one example which has a lot of good research to support it there's a lot more being done at places like Hopkins and NYU and many other places now may have and this remains to be studied but it's plausible that it could have profound applications to opioid addiction for instance and this comes back also to the McCormick story with birth control because the I don't I don't recall what the first compound was that was FDA proved but it wasn't approved for birth control I think it was approved for menstrual disorders that's right that was the thin end of the wedge was women whose menstrual cycles were unusually heavy or uncomfortable or the first approval exactly so and that's the most important step is it's much easier to use something off label once it's been approved than to get something approved right so you pick the right indication that's what's also impressed me about these organizations is just the strategic thought they've put into this which is understanding a roadmap that is interested in the least resistance right because to what does it take to reschedule something if you want to take it from the same classes a heroin and put it into a class where it can be prescribed with proper supervision medical supervision you need to well you you you one of the approaches like cocaine and the the nasally anesthetic demonstrate one clear medical application and if that is depression in terminal cancer patients that is a legitimate medical application and then that entire trance can get in motion that's one nice thing about where the DE and the FDA fall out is for the most part there's a sense that look once we've as these agencies done our job in scheduling something we're going to put faith in the practitioner to use his or her judgment as to how much latitude to grant around the application and and I'll also mention one thing just in case we have regulators or lawmakers policy makers people within the FDA or DEA who are listening and that is lead policy book check out policy book and immerse yourself in this fascinating area of research and and I'll give if like a lot of people you just don't have the bandwidth to dedicate a lot of time to this a something that pollen has referred to on a number of different occasions and that is the addictive potential so what is the addictive potential of these compounds if we're looking at say solosciving specifically we could use other examples but if you take a rat put it in a cage and you give it one dispenser little little lever that they can push to dispense food and another dispenser with cocaine that it can use to dispense cocaine it will consume cocaine to the exclusion of food until it dies in many cases if you do that with food and say salesciving and it gets delivered a whopping dose of salesciving it will press that lever once and the rat's like okay that was enough and it goes to the food and that rather than having high addictive potential many of these compounds have anti as we've already discussed anti-addictive potential and my god it's it is terrifying when I look at where I grew up on say long island and you look at the obvious put putting aside the all of the stuff that I don't see or hear about but the obvious among people I grew up with among my friends who have died of overdoses family members who have died of overdoses these are in some cases educated people in some cases not they are using prescription medications these are widely distributed easily prescribed medications that have demonstrated incredible abusive potential and to think that we have these molecules that can be produced at relatively low cost at scale that are not just non-addictive but anti-addictive really provide some hope that we can counteract some of these incredible epidemics I mean I you might have been the person who told me this could have been someone else but was it last year that opiate deaths exceeded automotive accidents yeah for it used to be that automotive accident was the leading cause of death for people up to a certain age and I believe the age is 40 and now opiate overdose has offset that so you know this isn't an isolated issue anymore you know for me I think I think the rate limiting step is actually going to be training the clinicians to administer these things I think that's going to become the bottleneck and that's why I hope that you know and we we have friends who were psychiatrists psychologists who have become very interested in this and that to me is really heartwarming because they're actually going to be among the people who need to lead the charge on this yeah and there are groups thinking about this certainly both maps and other organizations that are involved to civil servant are thinking about this people who have come to the table to provide some funding like myself and for instance the Bronner family of Bronner soap and others certainly their technologists who have come to the table many of many of them have done so anonymously are very well aware that having these compounds legalized for supervised use is step one and that there will be a very very real need for training clinicians and the wheels are already in motion with prototyping some of this there's a there's a group called CIS at California which is prototyping some some training protocols for therapists who are licensed in various ways already so that when these compounds are available through prescription that there are trained clinicians who get in minister so we'll see we'll say I'm very optimistic but this is where I will be applying a lot of my focus and these problems do not they do not discriminate these problems these addictions depression anxiety that people experience in daily basis don't care what call you are don't care what gender you are don't care how much or how little money you have I mean given how publicly I've talked about for instance the content of the TED talk that I that I put out there on the depression I've had people come out of the woodwork from my listenership my readership some of the wealthiest people in the world who suffer from debilitating depression whose kids are addicted to heroin and then on the opposite end of the spectrum people who listen to the podcast who are just scraping by the same set of issues debilitating and you know in the last few years I've developed a real sense of optimism about myself and my life quite frankly number one is a starting point which I think is a starting point like before you try to save the world is a good idea to try to save yourself and I have come away completely convinced that many of these stories I told myself which were crippling were unnecessary and that they can be wiped and you can write new stories new narratives for yourself and we talked about meditation there's a book you introduced me to then I think we should we should certainly mention also this is Saul for happy can you talk about this yeah so Rickerson who is a mutual friend and you actually introduced me to Rick probably about five years ago he gave me a copy of this book and it was one of those things that just sort of sat there for I don't know six months and it was just in the queue but didn't you know I didn't really appreciate why I ought to read it as soon as it was given to me you know something in the midst of a crisis sort of brought it to my to my attention a little more quickly and I just devoured it and so if if the Terrence real book I don't want to talk about it has now jumped into the number one spot of books I've gifted most Saul for happy is probably in the number two spot and those go that yeah I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that right but M.O last name G.A.W.D.A.T. Yeah and that's sort of pushed mistakes were made but not by me into the the now number three spot just ahead probably of Shirley your joking Mr. Feynman it's weird it's interesting it says something about us the books we like to give people doesn't it you thanked Michael Paul and at the end of your interview or maybe it was somewhere in the midst of it but I thought it was at the end of the interview for writing the book that he did because you said it was the book you wanted to read and that you wish you could have written but you're no slouch yourself when it comes to writing books is there is there anything that if you if Michael hadn't have done that and you would have been writing that book in addition to all the stuff we've talked about today is there anything else that you would have included in that book that that wasn't included and that's hard that's a hard he's a tough act of follow a very tough act of follow and I'm so pleased that he wrote the book because I have been very clearly biased in the sense that I am a I've seen the power of these compounds firsthand and I'm not shy about as we've seen in this conversation putting myself clearly on the side of the support I don't think they should be available at every 7-11 some people think it should be every drug should just be available for anyone else to pick them up at any time I I disagree with that position completely but I am nonetheless exceptionally bullish on the scientific research and ultimately the rescheduling and widening of making these compounds available to people through qualified professionals in supervision Michael has such a pedigree and is so widely respected as a and I don't think you'd mind me saying this a skeptical highly skeptical investigative journalist that I'm I couldn't be happier that that he published his book before anything that I might write on the subject if I were to write a book about or including I should say a discussion of psychedelics it would differ in along the lines of Collins and my writing styles meaning Pauline is is so brilliant at taking the history and science and characters in a given field and weaving it into a first-person narrative of his exploration of all of those things much like John McFee I don't want to digress he's also just a hero of mine but they're both so good at that I would never try to outpoll and pollen I'll get my face ripped off I could my book would just be a poor poor poor imitation of of something that he would do masterfully you know as I'm writing a book now sword interrupt it makes it that much more apparent to me when I read good books how much I suck and I'm not saying that in a I that's not a negative self-talk although it sounds like it is just the reality it's like look I mean these people are great for a reason and it's it's exactly what you said it's like the best books are not lecturing you they're bringing you on a journey and when when they can do that in really complicated topics and bring you along and also interweave history non-linearly that's yeah oh it's it's amazing but I would say just to give you a smooch on the forehead that much like the best meditation approach or app or teacher in the world for me may very likely drive you nuts and is not the right person for you that stylistically some writers some books will speak to you or grab your attention in an otherwise overflowing workload and somewhat and that differs person to person so rather than trying to outpoll and pollen or outmix feed McFee for God's sake that would be a losing attempt I've realized that I'm not what I enjoy doing is providing firsthand accounts of my self experimentation followed by prescriptive recommendations that aren't intended to work for everybody but that serve as more of a shoes-yone adventure buffet of options that I have vetted to at least work on myself and a number of close friends who span some different genders different age groups and so on and that's what I did with for our body that's right done with all these different books so if I were to write a book including psychedelics it would likely include experiments with other modalities other vehicles other tools that also produce not my neatly noticeable but profound changes in consciousness which is really the stage upon which everything happens right and in doing so provide you with an opportunity to rewrite the story of your life or to gain perspectives that are otherwise inaccessible and that might include sensory deprivation tanks it might include neurofeedback it might include other types of non-psychedelic pharmaceuticals it might include ketamine for example ketamine we didn't get an answer that would take a while but yeah ketamine is a whole separate ketolophish and I think my book would be more diffuse in that sense thematically connected but with independent modular chapters that includes some likely extreme experiment that I conduct myself and then report back and say I guess what I push the envelope and went way too far so you don't have to let's dial that let's dial that back 80 percent and here's something you can try that I think has an acceptable risk benefit profile that's probably the book that that I would write. Speaking of your books I don't know if I told you this story I think I did but if not it's worth retelling totally unrelated to this but it just made me think of it so like I don't maybe a year ago or so I'm in the airport and I just remember like my flight was delayed and I was sort of like a friend who I don't talk to that often like maybe once a year he called me and he's like dude I just read about you in a book today I think I know where you go and I was like I was like really what do you mean he's like yeah yeah you're in this book it's called biggest tools and I was like what he goes yeah yeah like there's a chapter on you in this book and I mean oh do you mean tools of titans he's like yeah yeah yeah that's it that's it and just kept like he just didn't even and it's it was just and he's Israeli and he has it like an accent so it's like you could tell that like the expression biggest tools didn't mean to him what it meant to me and I just thought that was the funny thing so to this day I feel like proud to be one of the biggest tools well you know that would be maybe the alternate title of the the podcast that you and I have joked about which is you know dumb things that smart people do and that's a separate conversation but there's so many ridiculous habits and obsessions that anyone who could be considered smart has if you have not seen it already just where where should people find egg boxing I will link to it but there's it's it's got its own Facebook page at this point it's hilarious that'll be a teaser I do have one final question that's not on the topic at all of what we've discussed but given that we have now between the two of us in the past two and a half hours drink I want to say 20 topo cheaker my bladder right now is robably at its maximum capacity I think pretty soon I'm going to develop hydrant of frosis so we're going to have to bring this thing to a close one of the questions I get asked all the time is you know people say oh you're such good friends with Tim like does he still do acts does he still do why he wrote about this he talked about this I wonder does he still do it and so I was thinking for the person out there who's sort of wondering like how his Tim evolved when you think of all the things you have written about when you think about all the lessons you have codified for people what are the three four maybe five things that you have written about in some of your books that still consistently shape how you have continued to optimize your trajectory so the three to five things that I would say I return to most reliably are perhaps unsexated some people but one would be some type of hinging exercise movement I noticed that problems crop up when these are emitted for any extended periods time by hinging movement or hipp hinging movement I mean some type of deadlift or kettlebell swing two handed kettlebell swing very very simple to incorporate that into an exercise program I do not believe unless you have some type of competitive agenda that you need to do these more than once a week you can certainly do them twice a week for extra credit but kettlebell swings or deadlifts want a week prevent a whole host of issues and improve a whole host of performance factors so I'll be one number two would be fasting and entering a state of ketosis for at least one week at least once a quarter in conversations with Peter and conversations with Dom the Agustino is a mutual friend very impressive not just published researcher and scientists but also athlete himself the intermittent use of autophagy and entering the state of a fasting and ketosis seems to me to deliver a host of potential benefits with very minimal downside I also like the just the pure asceticism of the practice so we have the hinging movement like a deadlift or kettlebell we have fasting plus ketosis for an extended period at least once a quarter I just actually finished my latest segment about a month ago number three would be some type of meditative practice first thing in the morning I'm also asked constantly one of the questions that I ask sometimes which is what advice would you give your 20 year old self what advice would you give your 30 year old self and it would be meditate 10 to 20 minutes first thing in the morning don't do it after you check your email and do a b and c because you're going to fail 50% of the time you just will knock go back to it wake up right now for instance I have a foldable chair that goes on the floor believe it's called a back jack or a jack back something along those lines use quite often in meditation centers right on the floor in front of my bed that faces out a window looking at a bunch of beautiful trees and I get out of bed through a some water on my face sit down and meditate I would say that's number three absolutely a some type of non-reactivity training for 10 to 20 minutes or put another way non-reactivity rehearsal which is another reason why meditation sessions where you feel entirely scattered and you only return to the breath a few times feel like a waste of time but they are absolutely not a waste of time is that there are going to be periods throughout your day on many days when life is going to just roundhouse kick you in the face over and over again and you are going to be in that scattered state so it is good to rehearse mindfulness in that scattered state which is exactly what you're doing all right so we have the hip-inging movement at least once a week exercise wise Katosis last fasting meditation would be three number four would be the importance of group ritual and this is something that very often falls by the wayside that I forget because I've so often retreated into myself whenever I felt pain or depression or anxiety I don't want to impose that on anyone else and I feel like I should be able to figure it out on my own and just climb back into the cave that is my brain and this very often results in isolation or I'm just by myself even if I'm surrounded by other people by myself sitting in a coffee shop by myself in my own head group dinners at least once or twice a week cooking I found and this was not always the case for people interested you can check out the four hour shift for all the reasons why I find this so incredibly therapeutic but don't have to cook I just happen to find it adds a new another level of decompression but group meals at least once or twice a week would be number four and then if I had to pick a number five I would say I'm not going to use the psychedelics because we've been talking about this entire conversation if you feel like you're having trouble making yourself happy try to make someone else happy and I think that that is the workaround that very often then improves your own state so it's like if you're feeling just awful or depressed or in a funk it's like go get a coffee and pay for the person behind you I mean just exercise some of those random acts of kindness think about someone who has helped you and called them and leave them a voice meal and get them on the phone to thank them for how they've helped you and closely related to that the ties back into the meditative practice is if the meme me practice focusing on your breath focusing on your thoughts focusing on your your your your your meme meme me is maybe exacerbating some of your problems and you feel like you're you're having trouble escaping your own head take a look at meta meditation METTA also known as loving kindness meditation and I have found that to just be powerful beyond belief I didn't think it would do anything I found it kind of cheesy I thought it was kind of cliche I wrote about this a bit borrowing from the teaching of someone named shade man 10 who was an early engineer at Google and created a class called search inside yourself which was hugely oversubscribed by employees at Google I think it had some insane waiting list and this was one of the techniques he recommended so loving kindness type needed loving kindness meditation which jack cornfield has some some fantastic examples of jack cornfield KORN field and loving kind of meditation also known as meta METTA meditation and there've been multiple reports I've certainly experienced myself but by doing meta meditation say at night before going to bed do that for few days and you might have the most at piece week you have experienced in years it's it's really something else it's worth experimenting with so I would say those are my five at least the the five that come to mind right now that I would feel very comfortable defending and backing well Tim that's super helpful because I we managed just somehow figured away to spend so much time together that I when you say those things I'm like yeah I of course like we that's just what you're always doing so but I think it's great for people who are listening to this who who don't you know get the interact with you frequently who who to get that little update on stuff so you've been incredibly generous with you were time but what people probably don't realize is how generous you've been with your time off this podcast including sending me the links to like which pieces of equipment to buy for the recordings and sitting down with me and giving me the not just the one-on-one but the full course on luck do this don't do that waste time and energy on this don't waste time and energy on that so I really want to thank you I can't imagine having anybody else be the number one episode of this podcast and I I do hope that this podcast continues beyond the the initial 12 or 13 but even if it doesn't this will have been incredibly worthwhile and thank you again for your hospitality this weekend in particular I remember I put out something on Instagram another day about what was the over under on how many top of chicos I could drink in a weekend and I think I said it at 15 or 16 we have blown through that so I can't imagine I still don't to this anyone who's listening to this who doesn't know we're talking about we're talking about a sort of bottled water it's in a glass bottle and it's a it's a carbonated water but anybody who's tried it will agree it's not like a paria it's not there's something different little touch of magic sodium to keep you coming back for more among other things anyway Tim I can't thank you enough for for taking the time to be on a little rinky ding podcast at this point but anyway it's been it's been wonderful oh my pleasure man I expect
