Again, hearing you say this, Andre, the listeners are going to be thinking, what? Yes, because we're all so brainwashed into believing that radiation is horrible. I don't think we can have this discussion without giving people some understanding of what radiation is. Essentially, the bottom line is that the low energy stuff that is non-ionizing cannot damage tissue. Falsies about your cell phone giving a brain cancer, and all are just that, their their first off, which patients are typically being radiated. It comes on the two things. You want, you want to be cured, curate is key, but quality of life is equally important if not more important for most people. And so now that cure rates with our modern focused radiation allow to get such a high dose into the prostate, we can say that they're essentially equivalent to surgery. Let's use that as a bridge to talking about using radiation to enhance tissue. You usually see depending on the joint summer between a 60 and 80 percent success rate where the pain isn't if not zero, at least markedly decreased. I don't think patients will have any patients for turf wars. Yes. Right, true. And so if I'm a patient, every doctor needs to be a fiduciary. They need to put my interest, have their interest. It's highly underutilized at this point, and your pain is of shown as the way it clearly works and America just has to catch up. Yeah, this is definitely an area where we are way far behind. Hey, everyone. Welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Atia. Sanjay, welcome back to Austin. Thank you, Peter. Pleasure to be here. I think this is the first time we're together, not driving, right? I think so. Yeah. That is true. So I don't know. Somehow we're going to resist the urge for most of this discussion to not talk about cars. If you don't want to bore your audience. I know. It is called the drive. This is true. So I feel like we have, we will reserve the right to have some automotive discussions at the end. For listeners, Sanjay might be one of the most knowledgeable human beings on cars. He's also a very dangerous friend to have. Because he's always the bad one on the shoulder when you're contemplating a new set of wheels or a new something for your cars. But in his other life, in addition to being the founder of MD Motorheads, right? That's right. Yeah, which is a Facebook group of doctors who are gear heads. We're going to crack 3,000 members. It's exploded. Yeah. That's awesome. So shout out to MD Motorheads. You're also a radiation oncologist, which we also spend some time talking about, right? And I guess we thought it would be a really fun idea to do a podcast for a couple of reasons. One is just the bread and butter of what you do as a radiation oncologist is a bit of a black box to many people. Myself included, if I'm going to be completely truthful. Even training and surgical oncology, I feel like I had much more familiarity with the medical side of oncology than I did with the radiation side of oncology. So for myself, for the audience, I think it'll be wonderful to understand more as it's a field that has evolved a lot, right? I'm guessing last 25 years, yes. You know, a lot of change. It's one of the youngest fields, too. So I think in that respect, it's not steeped in some of the traditions that surgery and medicine are. So yet, it's a new field, highly evolving very rapidly and the technology has changed so much just in really in the last decade or two. It's pretty incredible. And just about a curiosity, when did it become its own discipline, its own set of boards and everything like that? Yeah, so you know, as a kid and growing up in Houston, some of my family friends were radiologists. And I remember it just like it probably an elementary school kid that some of them were talking about radio therapy. And they were these were diagnostic radiologists who at the time were, you know, CT scanning was pretty new in the 80s. And so it was around that time that prior to that in the 70s and then prior to that, it was kind of just a fellowship where people basically would radiologists would have a cobalt 60 machine that they would train on for a few weeks and you'd do a few easy calculations and do some crude treatments. But it really started, it came into its own starting in the 70s and really more into the 80s. And that's when it became its own discipline. The ACR had a separate carve out. And so our residency training is completely independent of diagnostics now. So we just do it's an intern year followed by four years of radiation oncology with a little bit of overlap, but not a lot of diagnostic training at all, just because there's so much to do and, you know, just on the therapeutic side. God, see, I had no idea that it was that new then in terms of medicine. That's obviously like, right. That's very new. The second thing that I want to talk about on the radiation front is this idea of using very low dose radiation to heal injuries. Right. And I actually, I think that while people will be incredibly interested to understand the ins and outs of radiation oncology, again, given the ubiquity of it in treating people, I think a lot of people are going to be very interested in this idea that why aren't we using low dose radiation more to heal some of these nagging orthopedic injuries that people have. And of course, we'll go far down the rabbit hole on that. I don't think we can have this discussion without giving people some understanding of what radiation is. And I would like us to do it in a way that's both rigorous enough that we can really get into some of the science of this, but also get into it gently enough. Right. People that maybe don't remember high school physics well enough, sure, I can come along for the ride and not get lost. But once we get into gray and milly seaverts and all that stuff, I want everyone to be fluent when we start talking about doses. Right. Right. Right. So, radiation itself, the term itself has kind of got a bit of a negative connotation, but basically it's part of the electromagnetic spectrum. So, you know, we have everything on the one in the range of increasing energy of a photons, which are just particles of light. On the one end you have radio waves and micro waves and the other end you've got infrared and I'm excuse me, you've got ultraviolet and then you get into x-rays and radio waves. And in the middle of all that is the visible spectrum. So when you see, I'm sure everyone's seeing the graphs where you've got the rainbow red green blue that we can see, the human eye can only perceive a tiny little narrow spectrum. And then on the low end, the radio waves are wave lengths. These are wave lengths and energies which are the very low end energies you have things like radio waves. And in that situation, both radio waves and micro waves are what they call non-ionizing. And you've talked about this on some of your previous podcast. And you had a really good one with Atari Walla from Pranubo. Wait, he went to really, it was really nice in depth discussion. But essentially the bottom line is that the low energy stuff that is non-ionizing cannot damage tissue. And that goes all the way up to visible light. Then when you start going to the higher energy x-rays, that's when you get both x-rays as well as ultraviolet light and then the high and then the higher particles stuff. But basically the higher you go in the energy and the energetics of the particles, the more likely the exposure to these packets of energy are going to cause damage to your DNA. And why is it that the shorter the wave length? Because that's what's changing as you go from radio waves to micro waves to visible waves to ultraviolet. Why is it that is the wave length gets shorter the energy gets bigger? Yeah, I'm not sure what the reason is that they are inversely proportional to each other. I don't know that I guess I'm probably not enough of a physicist to answer their question precisely. But having said that, that is the characteristic of this. And in doing so that's one of the big reasons why all the fallacies about your cell phone giving you brain cancer and all are just that their their fallacies because even having a cell phone on your on your ear for hours a day, it's it's non-ionizing radiation and standing too close to micro wave oven again non-ionizing radiation. So that cannot damage your cells the way that the other radio wave is too long. That's right. The micro wave is too long. It doesn't have the energy. You can stand on it all you want. It can heat but it can't damage. Correct. It can excite the molecules but it won't actually eject an electron which is what what causes an ion to form which is why it's called ionizing. And that's where we deal with on the I'm on the therapeutic end. So diagnostic radiologists deal with lower energy x-rays than we do the very high energy x is what we use in our linear accelerators to treat cancer. So that's the big difference there is kilo voltage versus mega voltage but all of these are ionizing. Okay. So let's talk about how these are measured. How do we quantify them? Because people on the podcast have heard me talk about this I suspect. We talk a lot about calcium scores and CT angiograms and PET CT and so the I think the the frequent listener will have been somewhat familiar with how we talk about how to dose those things. Right. So radiation dosage there's a couple of different terms that we've talked about. The main one we talk about when we're talking about patient treatment is the unit called the gray and that's an SI unit that essentially is jewels of energy per kilogram of tissue. So that's what they call it absorb to dose. So that's in tissue whereas when you're talking about exposure and the general like in the air and in general exposure it's in the air and that's we usually use the term seaverate for that. And actually both those terms for the most part are equivalent. It's just that the seaverate itself will take into account if you have different types of x-rays, different qualities of x-rays that have different degrees of potential to be ionizing that they have a quality factor you'll multiply it by. But for the most part we use the term gray when we're talking about for example when I treat a prostate patient they're going to get somewhere between 70 and 80 gray but it's fractionated into small daily doses as to be tolerable for the body. And then when we talk about like millisevers like we're going to that's really just measure of exposure not absorbed dose in tissue per say. And what's the relationship between a gray and a milliseaverate is at a one to one. Yes, a gray and a seavered technically. A lot of it's also the gray also if anyone's kind of old school you read you listen to older stuff you hear the term rads a lot of people have heard a rads. So one rad is equal to one centigrey. 100 rads is a gray it's just an SI unit versus the old the older terminology and a seaver is the equivalent only it's in air not in tissue. But a seaver is a gray. Correct. Correct. So when you give 70 gray you're giving 70 severs or 70,000 millisevers over the course of the treatment. That's correct. And just so people can kind of anchor this to things that are familiar living at sea level exposes us to one to two millisevers of ionizing radiation a year. That's exactly what I'm on it. And then of course at the altitude it could be double that. That's really. If you live in Denver it's easily double that or triple that. Correct. Just another thing for comparison a pilot who spends a lot of time traversing the north pole right which is typically how they're going to fly they're not going to go all the way around the center of the earth. Might get another three or four millisevers quite a bit. That's right per trip actually. So that's that can add up. And I was actually talking to a pilot friend about this and they don't really have any sort of a limitation in terms of total exposure that requires them to be out of the to be taken out of the air. A lot of them they're forced to retire at 65 I think is there's the commercial requirement but there's really they don't really monitor the actual exposure to that level to where they it's then I think the reason they don't really use that as a limiting factor for the amount of work is really just that even though they get a higher dose there's been no proven increase in cancer and those types of populations even in you know flight attendants or anything like that the same way that the people in Denver the people here in Texas don't have any higher incidence of cancer. Now the NRC recommends that a person not be exposed to more than 50 I believe 50 millisevers of radiation in a year. Now someone like me that that's easy right unless I'm out there getting a lot of diagnostic radiology or of course undergoing therapeutic radiation treatment but for someone like you who has to set patients up or one of your texts is that a are you guys approaching that level of exposure not at all and so it depends on what type of radiation we do now typically for our external beam machines we're doing it all remotely from behind a shielded wall so the vault in which the machine is placed is custom built just a shield based on the angles that the machine can move through if there's like a direct angle where the machine is hitting a wall that wall has to be built ten times thicker than the walls where the beam can't reach so essentially our dose went treating remotely as close to zero so we keep film badges and we've been it's almost become kind of a joke that when we're not doing breaky therapy which is dealing with actual live radioactive sources our exposure is super low almost negligible really but back when I was in residency doing a lot of GYN implants and things like that where you're you're putting CZM or a radium actually into the body cavities and you're actually up there putting it in up close we had a ring badge on and we would certainly we as a resonance we'd rotate every month but if we didn't it didn't rotate some of the faculty actually got pretty high doses and any idea what the sequelaia that was I know a couple of folks the ones who did a lot of GYN therapy especially in the older days were talking about in the 80s and the 70s where you could actually see dermatitis on their hands from doing that just from the hand exposure one of my faculty members actually had a giant cell tumor of the bone in her finger and again this is after decades and decades of doing it it was you know it was a benign growth but that that was a real thing there's a lot of data out there on especially people who were dealing in x-ray for dentistry and stuff like that back in the day when they didn't have shielding or anything like that that they would get dermatitis the most common thing you'd see is skin irritation in that sort of situation dermatitis and even some kind of chronic flaking and things like that so let's talk about some types of x-rays that people are familiar with and give a sense of radiation dose and I'm also curious as to how much this depends on the size of the individual in other words does a person that is larger receive more radiation for the same test layer at chest x-ray sure and then they certainly do because you have to use more energy to get into a larger person having said that there's two different things because in what we normally deal with when I'm talking about dose to a tumor is the dose actually at that spot versus a whole body dose which is a very different metric and so for someone who I'm treating with say eight weeks of radiation for prostate cancer their prostate may get 80 gray in 2 1.82 gray fractions per day but that's literally only to a small volume roughly the size of the prostate gland itself and when you even get just a few millimeters away from that that dose gets cut in half and then it's exponentially lower because the intensity of the radiation varies with the square of the distance so as you get even a couple of feet away that goes down significantly but typically a patient who is getting 80 gray is a 80 gray was a whole body dose that would obviously be lethal but the whole body dose is more like a few milligray in that sort of situation so we typically don't see like full body sequelor anything from doing even the heavy-duty diagnostic treatment now for the CT scan we almost consider that negligible in our area because again I'm dealing with mega voltage high dose cancer killing radiation and so when they get a CT scan which is going to be just a few millisever it's a milligray that's almost considered rounding air versus what they're getting to the to the tumor let's take something like a chest X ratio so chest X ray again I people should anchor to this idea for what it's worth and we can come back to this and our C says hey limit your annual radiation right 250 millisevers you've got 2% of that just being alive because you've happened to go outside and it be exposed to the sun right so the other you know 98% might come through flying diagnostic let's say you fly a lot that might get you up another 10% right so let's talk about a chest X ray you've got a cough you go to your doctor they do a chest X ray that's how many millisevers for a normal size person normal size person it's a fraction it's probably less than one millisever it actually so it's significantly it's it's something that where you know people who are concerned about things like diagnostic mammograms and all every year you're still talking about maybe one millisever or even a little bit less than that was some of the newer machines and so you're in a zone where it is you know there's a principle we talk about it's called alara a a a a a which is as low as reasonably achievable and that's been the sort of the mantra for our radiation safety people the nuclear regulatory commission and whatnot that you want to keep things as low as possible but having said that when you're talking about numbers of less than 50 millisevers that's kind of an arbitrary number so it's not like getting you know people who've got I should have maybe gotten a chest X ray when I had my cough last time but I just I just don't want to do it that I don't want the exposure but it's so minimal in terms of biological effect that we really don't even really worry about those even if it's getting one of a month or so and a big reason for that is a lot of these numbers especially the 50 millisever number is extrapolated from higher exposure rates and so it's so there's something called a linear no threshold model or ln t and that's been written about extensively and that's what we're all taught in radiobiology and residency one fourth of my radiation training and in residency was actually radiation biology in addition to clinical oncology and radiation physics but so the linear no threshold model is what states that even you know we we know based on all the the data from you know from a nuclear fallout from Chernobyl from three mile island of course from Hiroshima Nagasaki from the bombs that at a certain dose exposure there's a certain risk of developing a cancer or any other endpoint whether it be dermatitis or bone marrow suppression there's all that all these numbers are well sorted but when you try to extrapolate lower so you take maybe say a dose of say one full severt you know the thousand millisever and you start extrapolating that lower and lower to where you're looking at like a hundred or fifty millisever it's the linear model assumes that there's some level of damage even if those lower levels but in reality there's actually a threshold there is the ln t which is linear no threshold is actually been proven to be actually erroneous and so at very low doses it's actually been shown that there's almost no incidence of any sort of biological damage and there's also it's controversial but there's animals that each winter maybe a hornese is affected low low doses like that so let me tell people what that means because that's sure that's obviously going to come back later in our discussion so you know regular listeners of your podcast know all about hornies and you talk about it and in the exercise realm and a cool plunges and so on as and whatnot but the whole idea is doing some degree a small amount of cellular damage when the body repairs that it actually comes back stronger than it was without the exposure in the first place and in animal studies they've actually shown it very low doses we're talking about single digit milliseverage here that they've seen in mouse bones for example increased osteoclast activity or excuse me decreased osteoclast and increased osteoblastic activity so the bones actually heal quicker and some of the soft tissue as well has been has been shown to actually recuperate and in much in the way you see and the hornies is from other causes and that's not something that we're claiming is you know widely accepted but there is a lot of data showing that that is certainly a possibility which goes against this classic LNT model and the LNT model itself the guy that won the Nobel Prize for it in the 1940s did this all on fruit flies and his work was disproven over the years after that and so a lot of this low dose radiation safety stuff we have is certainly a noble goal to keep the dose as low as possible and when we get down into these milliseverage I think that they're probably a little bit overblown in terms of the actual negative effects on the human body. When I think about where for example something like a CT NGO gram used to be right so that that would easily have exposed a person to 25 millisevers to do a CT scan of the heart. You're doing it you know slowing the heart down getting the contrast in there et cetera. Today they're really fast scanners the best of the best scanners are somewhere between one and three millisevers for that same procedure. I certainly favor having patients get it you know getting a scan with that acknowledging though that I don't have amazing data to point two to say that the 25 millisever at one versus just to make the math easy the 2.5 millisever at one. Right. Tenfold difference poses any difference in risk. Exactly. What yeah how how do you think about that? Would you say what would be your confidence in saying that 2.5 is not actually better than 25 from a cancer risk standpoint. So again going back to that alarm principle there's not a whole lot of data at these levels. I certainly would strive to keep it as low as possible which is what that mantra says but I would go with the machine that has the best resolution and if 25 is if the radiologist tells me that that image is significantly better than a 2.5 millisevered exposure and some of the older machines are just less efficient you may get at better image with the with the lower dose. I think that dose is pretty negligible it really would be good. So the risk you're saying I don't really care if it's 25 or 2.5 is well and the good news is these brand new scanners are faster which is why they're giving you less radio exactly. They seem to have the same thing implies that's on the diagnostic side. On the therapeutic side where I am our machines are called linear accelerators and there's a similar progression as you know we as we've been able to focus the beams more and more precisely that actually caught it's a modulation of the beam and you have a lot of photons being showered in the general vicinity of a patient but you're blocking out everything except for a small area to treat and the same way the newer machines do definitely have a lower exposure to the you know Eastern the room in general. So what should people be thinking about in terms of extraneous radiation when should people be saying to their doctors hey do I really need this you know for example when you go to the dentist every year right typically want to do a set of x-rays is that anything people should be worried about not at all not in the least I would certainly not skimp on on dental x-rays mammograms if it's someone that needs cardiac workups and things like that the potential the risk benefit ratio is so heavily in favor of doing these studies that I don't even think twice about them and when and I think part of this comes from you I've been doing this 25 years now I have so many patients who've been through and when the by time they come to me as a cancer patient they've been through so many CT scans and nowadays we do pet scans we follow up with annual pet scans after the function of which are not only the CT but you've got a radioactive isotope that's being injected into them and we just really don't see now there are certain situations where you are giving a like for example an intravenous therapeutic dose of radiation say for thyroid cancer or things like that there's certain new uh their anostics that are out there in those situations you have to be concerned because they can get into the multiple you know again to a seaver range but when you're in these millisiever ranges it's such it's so important to do these studies the benefits of mammograms are so proven dental x-rays I don't really think twice about them okay um by the way just on the pet scan the rate what is so if you do a pet CT for example which again these are not routinely done these are typically done in oncology patients only um but just for my own understanding of returking 50 to 100 millisiever it's if you're doing a whole body pet CT I think you can be in that range yes okay that's exactly right and uh so pet CT's a relatively new but uh up until maybe a decade ago the pet scan was independent of the CT they would do them separately but the data is so much better when you have the anatomical CT data overlay with the pet that whatever that extra dosage is I think it's well worth it in terms of the resolution of what we're able to see and what we're able to gain from that information okay so now let's pivot from the diagnostic to the therapeutic um is it safe to say that the majority or the most prevalent or common type of radiation oncology treatment would be for breast cancer? A breast and prostate how the number one number two depending on what patient population talking about and prostate may even be a little bit higher and this goes back to the 80s when the trend from doing a whole steady in type of a radical mastectomy was falling out of favor and the randomized data was was obtained in the 80s showing that a lumpic to me breast conservation which is lumpic to me followed by radiation as the same uh outcomes in terms of overall survival as a full mastectomy that's when breast really took off in the 80s and around the same time is when prostate radiation started becoming a thing but at the time rat radical prostatectomy was obviously still king but now in the 2020s I think prostate is taken off and it's probably close to matching breast cancer now. Those are number one number two but we also do depending on where you are in the country and what you're affiliation with the hospital is tons of CNS, lung, lymphoma, GI not colon but more rectal and anal distal GI cancers even in the pediatric world we try to avoid radiating children but it's a very big part of that as well so we use it for almost almost all types of cancer now actually I'll solid timbers anyway. Well let's let's talk a little bit about breast cancer given how common it is and I'll tell you something funny despite training at Hopkins I never once did a radical mastectomy and it was already long gone right from clinical practice 25 years ago and again just for listeners to make sure they're in the difference between a radical mastectomy and a mastectomy or what's called a modified radical mastectomy the current version of a mastectomy removes all the breast tissue along with the lymphatic tissue in the exila and though certainly I did more than my fair share of those but the radical mastectomy the Hall steady and prestigier removed also the entire musculature of the pack, pack major, pack mine or the whole thing it basically was a disfiguring operation the dilating, disilluminating with nothing but ribs here and can imagine what it's like to not even have pack muscles you sort of take for granted right what you need to do to move your your humorous and yeah to think that it's only been 40 or 50 years that someone had the courage I think it was probably Fisher right Fisher's big study in the 80s which now we have 40 year data from that and it's interesting how now even the modified radicals are relatively rare we still have some advanced cases that they have to go that route but we see tons and tons of patients now who are so much happier their quality of life is much better by just having a simple lumpic to me, a central node biopsy and if it's all negative especially if they've had their mammograms you get a small t1 or t2 tumor we give radiation to the whole breast following that and the radiation is again fractionating to small daily bits they'll get somewhere in the neighborhood of these days it's actually only about three weeks of treatment maybe about say 40 gray and roughly 15 fractions we used to give even when I was in just just really a couple decades we were giving 50 to 60 gray was quite a bit higher dose but to 40 gray and 15 fractions to the full breast and with the modern technology we can cover the breast tissue without a significant harder lung those so we can even use 10 gencial beams even if it's a left-sided tumor to stay away from the heart which is things that we couldn't do very well in the past and then the overall and disease free survival is pretty much comparable to someone who had a modified radical yeah for folks who want to know more about that Sid Mukherjee and I think it was in the Emperor of all maladies has a chapter on the statistic book and one of your best podcasts love like he's he's a legend so let's talk about that okay so so a woman has a stage one or a stage two breast cancer typically these days I think they're moving mostly to Neo-Adjuven chemo before resection yes in a more advanced case but if it's a typical T1 or even a small T2 that we see they may not need any Neo-Adjuven therapy they just will have their lung if it's like I say one and a half centimeter mass that's that's easily respectable they'll remove that just without any Neo-Adjuven treatment okay and we'll do adjuvent radiation and then potentially depending on the receptor status adjuvent hormone therapy as which is the domain of the medical oncologists but we still work with them so just surgery followed by the three to week three to four weeks of all after surgery can you begin the radiation wound healing given a little bit of time we generally do our CT based simulation in three to mention planning maybe three to three weeks after their surgery and then by the time it takes about a week to do all of our computer programming and then we'll start the treatment within three to four weeks post-op so tell me a little bit about that I was completely unaware of that so I'm a woman I've had a lump back to me satin on note was negative so I've got an incision about this long the listener you know five centimeters six centimeter incision they've probably closed it with beautiful internal sutures I've got some stereo strips they're often a week and I've got a nice little scar a week later when I come and see you how many weeks after that I usually will see patients for consultation a lot of times the breast surgeon will send them prior to anything being done so I'll see them for their initial consultation ahead of time but then we plan on doing what's called a planning procedure or a simulation where we're going to put the patient on the table and essentially do a dry run for their treatment usually a couple of weeks after treatment and that involves essentially positioning the patients typically for a breast patient they'll be prone with their arm behind their head we call the the movie star pose to get the arm out of the way of the exiless essentially okay and so by putting them in this position and then putting them on a wingboard that'll slightly elevate their torso we can and there's a lot of different geometry here that we can use back in the old days they had all kinds of ways of doing plaster casts and things like that but we essentially do now is we will we'll use a we'll call a vaclocc essentially a bean bag with a vacuum port and they see the patient sinks into the bag we suck all the air out of in lock it becomes a rigid cast of their body and that way they fit into the groove that we've made for them will actually will kind of form it mold it around their elbow so they're comfortable many times with patients who've had an exiless section they may have a little bit of scarring a little decreased range of motion to be able to get their elbow back there so we'll work with them the best we can whatever position we get them in we do a CT in that position and that's the position we have to reproduce for the daily treatment and the key there is that when they have their arm out of the way we have to have room so that the machine can move around from different angles the actual radiation machine has a gantry that can move really 360 degrees can treat for many angle you want but we have to be able to model tangential beams we don't want direct anterior feel that's going to radiate the breast but the photons are going to go right into the chest by using an angle we can kind of cut across the surface and actually shape the beam to match the curvature of the chest wall so we cover the entire thickness of the breast tissue or even in many cases in the case of advanced more maybe a T4 patient something like that we may even do this post mastectomy so you're treating the full chest wall and we go a little deeper below into the ribs and to make the first inch of lung tissue below that but by using these tangential beams that really minimizes the treatment the the photons damaging the lung tissue so all of that is planned ahead of time we do a CT scan sorry just to be sure planned pre-resection because you're seeing the tumor itself actually no I what I meant was pre-treatment got it so post-resection you'll see a tumor bed the lumpectomy cavities obviously clearly visible is a fluid pocket on CT so I'll scan the I'll scan the whole chest it takes about a week I have a whole team have a wonderful staff a radiation dosimitrius that helps do the computer planning and then a radiation physicist that actually calibrates the machine prior to actually starting the patient so we do the scan of course the CT scan is two-dimensional slices but we have three-dimensional modeling software so I have a full 3D model of the patient I can look at the slices or how thin it varies usually we don't need this is not a diagnostic scanner I think so usually something like two millimeters three millimeters we don't have to go super high resolution and so that way once it's once it's reconstructed then I can have a nice idea of what angles to bring the beam in because beams in at because every person has a slightly different curvature to the chest wall you're going to have to customize the anatomy different breast sizes we have all kinds of different techniques so I won't go too much into the details but if someone is very large breast did we could even treat them prone to get the have a special pillow to allow the breast to hang down and it's also I'm guessing where the tumor was in the breast so if you have large breast and a superficial tumor yes definitely prone would be amazing because now you're the the tumor bed is so far from the patient right that's true but our technically what we call the clinical target volume the area that we're trying to radiate would actually include the entirety of the breast tissue even even all the way down to the chest wall so there's two different ways there's fault there's full breast radiation which is what most people get but what you're describing actually is partial breast we would just target the lumpectomy cavity and that can also be done we save that for usually for older women who have a very small tumor and when I say older women it's more because of the fact that the remainder of the breast remains untreated so a local recurrence is a little bit more likely in some of it has not had full breast radiation but in a selected subpopulation of small breast cancers in some of the very large breast you can do partial breast where you're only targeting the lumpectomy cavity but for most of our patients we actually do treat the whole breast as stand standard of care plus or minus the exil if that's where the pathology comes in because if they did have a positive lymph node then we have to go after the exil and sometimes a superclavicular and even in for a mammary in a intramarinoid in some cases okay yeah so this is infinitely more involved than I thought which means I'm not the only one that probably was ignorant of what is involved right how long does each session take when they're actually on treatment it's about 15 minutes sometimes even a little bit less than that some of the newer machines can deliver the beam even faster but when I say 15 minutes I'm talking about I have four patients an hour typically so in and out of the room in 15s that includes getting them on the table the key thing for accuracy and reproducibility is positioning so the reason we made that mold and we've not only did we get them in position but I've also got a couple of dots on their skin to use as reference marks to make sure that the patient is in the correct position that whole process probably takes five minutes every day when the patient gets in the room and then maybe another five to 10 minutes for the actual beam to be on and my favorite thing is to come in the room after the patient's first treatment and then the most common question I get is hey doc when do we start and I'm like no maim that was they're like really that was it because the patient feels nothing so the machine will go through its various angles it's pre-programmed the entire process is about 15 minutes a day and they can leave feeling the same as when they got there just like getting any x-ray they jump in their car and go right back to work or to to the gym or the golf course. When did this become so automated with the robotic arm and stuff I mean when was the did you do this in your residency or were you do the one's manually doing that in residency? So I was in residency in the late 90s early 2000s so it was a very interesting time as we were at the cusp like my first year of residency and I was at UTMB in Galveston and we did a lot of it was a combined rotation with MD Anderson so we were at it time this is 1998 we're talking about where we run at the end of the old era we didn't even use CT planning we just had a couple of orthogonal films and we were literally drawing our tumor volumes out with a grease pencil on a physical x-ray and cutting and using that cut out to go trace a styrofoam negative and make a metal or a lid alloy block which you would slide this basically this aperture in the past the path of the beam that's the way it was done for decades and so we were still doing that when I started residency but by the end of residency we had full on CT planning we're now we're doing a full CT scan doing everything virtually and of course it's far more precise and you can model basically you can model multiple different iterations okay do I want to be in coming in from this angle do I want to bring in an orthogonal beam from here do I want to block out a little bit more of the chest wall to get the heart dose down I can see all that stuff now so by the time I finished residency we were basically doing what we do now I'll be with much slower computers and you know just being in the infancy of that it was probably more like 20 to 30 minutes per patient but the last 15 years roughly to answer your question things have been much more automated and instead of having lead blocks that you're sliding into the path of the beam now everything is shaped in the head of the beam by our computer so you hit a button and when I've already programmed the the the treatment planning values the machine knows how to shape the beam to match the aperture of whatever you're trying to do so that's all fully automatic now so the therapist job we have a radiation therapy so it actually positions the patient in the room they get them in position they take a picture x-ray first either a cone beam CT which is a low-dose CT or just a PA in a lateral film and we actually overlay that with our planning imaging to make sure that the original reference from the planning day matches today's image and the beams the the machines will actually superimpose the daily image with the reference image so everything is automatic I can see okay we directly on if everything lines up correctly then we literally have two images that look identical I just see one image which would but slightly off if there's even a few millimeters this way or that way we account for that by moving the table the table is motorized so the patient will be laying there and they'll feel it moved just a few millimeters this way that way until we have perfect concordance between the daily setup and the original and that way that's really really improved our accuracy and the original miss the geographic miss which was a problem in the old days when we didn't have digital imaging and all this stuff is essentially gone now the actual radiation beam is generated by what the ion is generated by what right so that's another thing that has changed now essentially when I say now the last basically 30 years most machines in the US are linear accelerators so these are artificially generated x-rays it's essentially accelerating electrons through a long vacuum tube you know potential electron gun and at the very end of the tube you've got a tungsten target and so the photon the electrons hammer that target and then they shower photons out so you're generating the x-rays that way and this has been done actually I think you're all the modern Stanford had the very first one in the US the medical linear accelerator but prior to that they were using these for atom smasher and you know they have the the gigantic machines they're used for physics but they started in London I think in 53 and then I think in the late 50s Henry Kaplan it's Stanford had the first one but so we're essentially still doing that even today on what 70 years later but the key difference is how we're able to shape those photons once they come out of the machine now and so when the actual photons are coming out they're completely unfiltered it comes out in a cone shape and it diverges as just as any light source wood you know how when you you hold the flashlight to a wall you get a nice precise circle as you pull the flashlight away it diverges so we have filters and we have what's called the multi-leaf columnator that can actually shape the beam as I mentioned earlier that can actually match the anatomy of the patient but now that's all done automatically we program it ahead of time as opposed to the old days we had to use lead blocks that were actually physically blocking the beam but basically the linac has been the standard prior to that we were using a cobalt 60 machine which is essentially it's not even a machine it's basically just exposing a patient to a radio active isotope and then shutting the jaws again so that's how they actually those are still in use in most of the world there's a few left in the US but they've mostly been decommissioned now because the linac have taken over when you say that typical treatment might be 15 gray over the course of the three weeks fractionated over 15 treatments so it's actually about 14 grams or so roughly you know 2.5 2.6 gray per day and you write and times 15 treatments are you getting roughly 40 gray to the breast and then we usually actually do a boost so we'll give what we call a tumor bed boost we give a little extra dose to just the lump itself or their lumpectomy cavity itself and there's a couple of French trials that showed that adding an extra 10 gray over an extra five days or two gray times five just to the lumpectomy cavity itself improves local control over just whole breast. Okay I actually what I was going to ask you was asking I was going to ask if the 40 gray is distributed completely uniformly across the breast the answer is no it is but it is you have that extra boost which is a customization based on the patient's pathology I occasionally have a patient that the breast surgeon will call me and say hey you know sunjay we did our best but we had a persistent positive margin I went back to the re-resection and there's still a positive margin maybe the positive margin is at the chest wall where there's only if they can only go so far in that case I instead of giving a 10 gray boost I might give a 16 gray boost or something to account for instead of just treating microscopic disease potentially macroscopic residual in that sort of situation so every patient's a little different and then the axillary nodes themselves are normally not treated in an early stage patient but depending on the risk factors if it's a very large tumor or if there was a positive central note maybe an incomplete axillary dissection then in many cases we end up treating the full axilla and in in some cases when it's advanced disease we end treating level two and level three so you end up getting the super clav as well if we go back in time to 25 years ago 30 years ago versus today what are the typical side effects that a woman experiences from this trick treatment and by the way was she typically getting 40 gray 25 years ago or was that a little more I think you said and now they've come down a bit it was sort of 50 60 gray back and so a little that this brings up a point I need to kind of emphasize it's not so much the total dose it's the dose per fraction so how quickly are you getting it so the standard of care was actually 50 gray rather than today's 40 ish gray but it was used to be given in two gray per fraction daily dose is rather than the 2.6 2.7 that we're using now so the effective dose when you take into account there's a whole radiobiology lecture that we're not going to bore people with but taking into account the dose per fraction and the total dose the biologically equivalent dose with the BED is roughly the same now at 39.9 gray given in in 15 treatments versus the old 50.4 gray that was given in say 25 to 28 treatments so it was a longer process your career right and we still do that in some cases and this comes back to another question you asked about about the homogeneity of the dose and so our goal of course is to have 100% coverage of the whole breast but the reality is one of the way that photons are going to be interacting from different beam angles and whatnot you're always left with hotspots and cold spots and so the biggest difference between what we're doing now versus the old days wasn't so much the total dose it was the actual homogeneity that you touched on so the heterogeneous heterogeneous old way of doing things with a cobalt machine or with a low energy x-ray unfortunately meant that there were hotspots and cold spots in the breast and that of course could either be manifested as scar tissue if it's a hotspot or heaven forbid a geographic recurrence if there was an area that was underdosed so with the modern computer planning we were much more homogenous so even though you may say I got 50 gray back in 1995 and now I'm getting 40 gray you're now getting 40 gray and two and a half gray fractions which is equivalent to the old 50 plus we don't have a 150% hotspot and a 60% cold spot we have a nice 100% match all the way across and that's all it's like a CAD cam type of thing I'm about as close to an engineer as an MD can be and so we do actually simulate the dose of the dose distribution of the radiation in the tissue and so with a nice tip of modern days we get a nice homogenous dose and therefore that goes to your next question which was what is the patient experience maybe not so much 20 years ago but more like 30 40 years ago with the older cobalt machines they would get a terrible dermatitis like many times it was moist descohamation confluently over the whole course of the whole chest wall axillary descohamation is always bad because of the friction of the arm but with the modern treatment now with the first first one not using cobalt using linear accelerators the energy of the photons is higher which means the skin dose is slightly lower so you're getting maybe 100% on the skin rather than 150% like you once did so we don't see anywhere near the skin reaction that we used to it's more of a you know maybe a grade one or a grade two air theme so mild redness or maybe sometimes a little bit of you know like it's a sunburn but nothing is severe as we used to so these days patients do still get a sunburn we give them a little some free samples of aquifer or they can use an aloe vera plant if they have it just you know your normal type of skin care stuff as opposed to the old days when we were actually treating essentially burn victims with silver self-adysine and heavy duty narcotics and things like that the modern air it is so much better than a lot of the patients especially if it's someone that doesn't have a very large breast there's less energy being put into a smaller size person they don't get anywhere near the skin reaction and that's why if you did have a very large patient we actually still use the old 50 gray in 25 because you're giving less dose per day and you do have a very large breast where you're going to have areas that are going to have hot and cold spots sometimes that's still needed so we have to tailor it to the individuals as I guess my bottom line there. Did anybody ever look at the when you had the very disparate hot and cold spots and follow women for recurrence and yes was there any association between the cold spots and recurrence so there certainly is and so the problem was is that the cold in the old days you didn't have computer modeling so and actually the old school physicists got to give your hats off to those guys and had slide rules and probably abacuses or whatever the heck they had back then you couldn't really you couldn't really tell exactly where the hot and cold spots were my might actually having a computer show you you had to go based on the fact that you use what energy you choose a photon energy and you know what the dose distribution had various depths is and so you would try to minimize that by again having beams coming in from different angles and then by using multiple angles and multiple fields you could paint in the dose as best as you could but yes certainly there were issues where as you get deeper in the tissue the dose would be lower and then yeah this is again before my time but there certainly were were studies showing that there were geographic misses and there was that was obviously not good which would sometimes lead to like a salvage mastectomy or something like that but in the modern era not so much what is the impact of breast implants in this type of treatment either saline implants or the older actually they're not older now they're back in the back in the world yeah of course so it's going to either way what we can tell the photons that the x-rays we use they are not at all affected by that that's essentially tissue equivalent and I'm pardoned by ignorance I completely forget are those implants typically under the pack or between the pack and the breast so we see both you know it's interesting how there's I guess some what's the current standard I'm not sure but the car I think most of them we see are actually under the muscle that's I don't know I've actually seen so we can easily suddenly pack but I've seen them both even I've even even now the plastic surgeons have different criteria for that but regardless of what it is our whole if it's under the pack then of course it's really a little farther away it's not a huge issue but we still the radiation will still affect that area but typically these these implants are pretty pretty tolerant of that the only issue down the road is they may have a capsule or contracture or something from fibrosis the bigger challenge we run into is for our post mastectomy patients who are going to be reconstructed and they have expanders put in and that's where the relationship between the radiation oncologist the surgeon and the plastic surgeon is key you explain to folks what expanders are that works surgically so essentially what's happening is when you have a full mastectomy if a patient wants to have their breast reconstructed later on the the surgeon the breast surgeon will remove the breast but then the plastic surgeon will come in and place some sort of a placeholder to allow the the soft tissue of the connective tissue and the and the skin to stretch to allow for future implant placement and so those tissue expander typically they can actually inject saline into them with a port and gradually stretch them with time and so that's normally what they would do if there was no radiation involved but if it's a patient and again most mastectomy patients really don't need radiation because this gets away from what we mentioned earlier were breast conservation is lump back to me only but there are some patients with a full mastectomy who are going to get reconstructed so they come to me when I do their CT scan they have this expander in place from the breast surgeon so we have to again modulate the beams and we treat the entire chest while we make sure we're covering everything but simultaneously we have to make sure that we don't have those hot spots in the area of the expander where potential you could cause scarring and fibrosis and cause the the expander to have to be removed have the plastic surgeon have to revise it that becomes a whole other it will be in there that we don't like to mess with but we have techniques not to be able to keep the dose off of them and again as you mentioned earlier whether it's silicone or or saline it's roughly the same density but some of these tissue expanders have bits of metal in them they may have other artifacts and so when I'm treating with photons with x-rays depending on what you're hitting the effect is based on the density the atomic number of that tissue so metal behaves very differently from bone behaves differently from air but when you're in the spectrum of saline tissue water it's all basically the same we can model all that very much like I'm getting ahead of myself but very much like when we have a prostate patient with a prosthetic hip a piece of metal right next door we're able to compensate for that with the modern computer treatment planning systems do women experience any systemic symptoms from radiation like nausea vomiting or is that the only time we see radiation patients who have nausea vomiting it's typically a lot of times for other sites they may get concurrent chemo radiation with a chemo could be responsible but for for breasts we don't do concurrent usually sequential the only time I really see radiation induced nausea if I'm treating an esophagus or a pancreas or something that's in the it's treating in the abdomen or somewhere along the GI tract where nausea is more of an issue typically not for breast okay let's talk about prostate which is obviously also the sort of the bread and butter of the field so first off which patients are typically being radiated and so that the answer to that has been evolving there was a time as recently as probably 20 years ago where we only treated patients who were probably medically and operable that the herologist would say hey you know this is a high risk anesthesia patient let's send them to Dr. Mata for radiation and that's a big reason why a lot of the older data was not as good for radiation because of the patient selection criteria but in the modern era as we've gotten more and more precise and our side effects have gone down and our cure rates have gone up now it's pretty much wide open we're pretty much anybody who's eligible for surgery would also be eligible for radiation so there's not that big of a divergence as their once was so I know see you've gotten to know Ted Shafer who's not only going to get a cast but is equally let's just say interested in cars so you me and Ted have a lovely little text thread about cars he and I may have another text so in case our team's meet in the playoffs as well he's a big Ravens fan so I'm from Houston so yeah I'm hoping we get there so let's talk about kind of a patient that comes in to see Ted for a biopsy they've got a Gleason 3 plus 4 and then another patient who's a Gleason 4 plus 4 or 4 plus 5 or something like that right how does that patient navigate their way through the system as to whether or not they need radiation or should then they go surgery and does androgen deprivation therapy necessarily come with radiation or is there a scenario where you undergo radiation but you don't require endrogen deprivation sure so to answer your last question first androgen deprivation for high risk disease is certainly standard of care Gleason 8 or higher for sure the Gleason 7s are always a sort of a gray zone and so a 4 plus 3 with high volume disease typically also do get concurrent and adjuvant androgen suppression along with radiation but one of the things that's really changing now is I know Ted talked a lot about it's with a decipher score where they can look at the chromosomes of the actual cancer cells and have a much more granular view of exactly are they truly high risk or can you die can you maybe say that this one 3 plus 4 is more like a 3 plus 3 so we can set for a lot of the 3 plus 4 is now with the decipher test and there's also an AI test I knew you had a really interesting discussion with your AI expert and that wasn't too long ago called Artera and we're using that that's actually in the NCCN guidelines now so that Artera test can help us differentiate between a unfavorable and a favorable intermediate risk patient and essentially actually I treated my own father not too long ago he was the first person I did this on the Artera test is essentially they just use the actual images of the H&E slides that were already done for the pathologist and it's interpreted by a machine machine learning computer that has been trained on hundreds of thousands of prostate images from the old RTOG studies the 94's all the all the stuff that was done back in the 90's and it cannot come back and say okay very much like decipher it can say that this is a 3 plus 4 but it's a favorable or an unfavorable person and that's in that subgroup and so because of that we can stratify better and actually tailor it to where maybe a 3 plus 4 doesn't need energy and ablation at all and maybe even some 4 plus 3 so they come back low enough on the scale where you could maybe you also have to talk about the side effects and whatnot but the standard of care was always to give concurrent energy and ablation for intermediate risk but now we're able to really take some of those people out of the equation with these new studies and is the main selling point because most patients just want things taken out right I have cancer taken out so is the reason that a person might select radiation therapy especially if it comes with the endogen deprivation therapy because of the sexual function and you're in every like what's the main advantage those are number one and number two yeah lack of incontinence and lack of impotence but of course when you have an origin ablation that sort of clouds things a little bit but typically the number one thing we see is patients who don't want to deal with diapers and for the most part although incontinence is still described to some degree in the literature and my personal experience I don't think I've seen a single patient who came in continent who left with anything less than that there's no pads there's no nothing and then of course also being you know with our as I talked about with breast cancer we can also focus very precisely on the prostate itself so the dose to the pinile bulb the dose to the rectum the dose to the the the bladder are so low now that the side effect profile is essentially zero from a radiation standpoint and they may be having hot flashes from the antigen deprivation and decreased libido and fatigue as you know but on the radiation side because we have all these tricks now very much like with breast a way we can avoid the heart and the lungs in the case of the prostate we can almost completely avoid the bladder and the rectum and even the the pinile bulb now so the quality of life those are the reasons why people tend to choose radiation and I know we've talked about this before you're just not seeing the proctatitis yes almost none in fact now I know I think a Ted and mentioned in his last talk there's a there's a jail spaceer that that is often inserted it's an injection that's done transparently and it separates the the rectum from the from the bladder but in my years of doing this when you're very diligent about how you do this very much like a you know like a surgeon pays attention to the detail so do we I can actually trim the dose off of the posterior prostate and just makes make sure the dose fall off between the posterior prostate and the anterior recto wall is so rapid that the anterior recto wall is always going to get some dose but usually it's not clinically significant and and what we do to to manifest to make sure that that is is a daily thing because we're talking about treating patients from multiple weeks we actually coach the patient to come in with a full bladder and an empty bowel and by being diligent about that an imaging daily to double check that in fact the bowel is emptying the bladder is full that it that allows those two organs to separate from the prostate and even a few millimeters of separation is all we need to take advantage of our modern focused radiation beams and does the patient need to be coached to time their breath or anything as the beam is at that most delicate edge of the rectum great question so not not so much for pelvic patients but we do that for breast cancer especially left-sided breasts so just to go back to that you actually have a deep breath hold which will get the chest wall away from the heart so we do that in the case of thoracic tumors but in the pelvis that the diaphragmatic position doesn't really make any difference it's more about bladder and rectal filling and emptying respectively that's much more important everybody have talked to who's at lacych isurgery always says they're so worried that they're going to do something in a flinch and and and and the patients feel the same way when they're undergoing radiation like what if I just flinch my pelvis or you do something right now that's going to get too close and get that question all the time and from a lacych standpoint I would be worried about that's probably why I'm still wearing these coat bottles unfortunately but in the case of prostate cancer first of all the dose is given over the course of several minutes and then each of those fractions is again for you were talking about one fraction out of multiple weeks so even if someone absolutely had a coughing fit or something like that first of all we're watching them we can stop the being you can stop it at any given moment but slight variations day to day the biggest variations are going to be based on bladder and rectal filling we take that into account when we're doing the treatment planning so there should really be no adverse outcome because what I actually do is I'll map out where the volume of the prostate is and we will actually purposely expand that volume and treat the full dose of radiation even a few millimeters outside of the prostate to make sure that there is any internal organ motion or anything like that that we take that into account but typically if someone's coughing or something that would just we can just hit the pause button and get them reset and ultimately it's not an issue. What about patients that are inoperable? First of all what leads to a patient being inoperable and how do they show up? So you know typically the urologists have already screened the patient because that everyone's first first exposure is going to be to what the urologist tells them and luckily in this day and age I'm lucky we have people much like Ted who are very open and who are very open to not just doing surgery but who actually look at the other options and present everything to the patient but typically a patient who maybe was medically anoperable will certainly come to me but even somebody who maybe is on the borderline who wants to watch the both sides of the token a general urologist will send them to a surgical specialist and to me and we'll go through all the pros and cons of everything and really what it comes down to to not to not to you know and belabor the point it comes out of two things you want you want to be cured curate is key but quality of life is equally important if not more important for most people and so now that cure rates with our modern focused radiation allowed to get such a high dose into the prostate we can say that they're essentially equivalent to surgery so we don't have that deficit like we did 20 years ago when our fields weren't as precise it was sort of the shotgun approach versus our you know sniper approach now because the cure rates are better and it really comes down to the quality of life changes and that's where there's a spectrum of things now is this an apples to apples comparison because the patient who undergoes the robotic prostate to me today does not go on hydrogen deprivation therapy right they get to walk around in fact you've probably heard Ted on the podcast he says we'll give those patients TRT if they're hypogonatol right um why does the patient after radiation therapy still need to be endraging deprived if in theory the radiation is as effective as the surgery and that's that that comes to a key point where you have less surgical side effects you don't have it's it's trading one thing for another you don't have the incontinence you don't have the at least the short term risk of impotence like there is from surgery you don't have the you know the pinile shortening or whatever other sort of things that they have to deal with but you have to deal with hot flashes and the decrease libido and whatnot but again most of the patients who are intermediate or high intermediate risk are going to if they if they end up not having a negative margin or seminal vascular invasion after prostatech me they're still going to come to me for radiation anyway and they're still going to need to be on antigen ablation so there's a significant number now these days we'd certainly treat a lot less gleece and six and we used to we observe most of them yep but there's a lot of gleece and six folks that even in this day and age will choose to have radiation just because it's maybe a little bit more aggressive form of watchful waiting and in that case there is no antigen ablation and they just you know they just they live through the process of gleece and three plus three watchful waiting versus XRT no ablation now unfortunately there's no actual trial there's this observational studies that's that's kind of what we're dealing with oh gosh but obviously you can't figure out what the biases are but what do those observational studies show they show you know essentially because people don't die from gleece and sixties as we all know they really do because quality of life they do so with the radiation there is just less of a chance of it for instance to with three plus four and and when they come to me to be seen I'll I get a like it's it's interesting the different patient populations I also get people this is not mainstream but I get a lot of transplant candidates who need a renal transplant and they cannot get their transplant unless they're they're cancer free even if it's like even if it's one core of a gleece and six they're ineligible for their transplant so those guys I will certainly treat but I've been following them now for 20 plus years that we've been doing it they quality of life they do so well and this way they don't have to worry about antigen ablation when they do become a gleece and seven yeah so it's really interesting there would be a very interesting and elegant study taking let's call it medium to high risk three plus threes so people based on family history or some other phenomenon genetic or otherwise you randomize them to watchful waiting versus radiate them without antigen deprivation and you're really looking I mean you have to do this is a very long term study so the question is outcome number one could be conversion to three plus seven requiring surgery or antigen deprivation therapy and then of course outcome two the very long term outcome would be overall survive that's right and that's the key that's why these haven't been done he would need decades to do a trial yeah so yeah definitely but it's certainly what certainly would be interesting to see what it would show but the real world observational study show that all the gleece and six guys like I would say until maybe maybe a decade ago we did a lot of gleece and six patients they mostly were sent for radiation and they just because of the why were they sent well you know I guess the combination of different things people have different levels of tolerance for watchful waiting in the pre MRI days everyone had to have an annual biopsy and that alone is more anxiety invoking than really the radiation is not to mention we'd see fair number folks zero sepsis and you know complications from that so now in the MRI era we don't really see that any more but that was done very routinely and because the patients had so little proctitis and and cystitis especially in a gleece and six where not only am I not worried about pelvic lymph nodes I'm not even really worried about the seminal vesicles so my field is very small which really minimizes the side effects because the bladder a full bladder when it's when it's actually full it'll move superiorly and anteriorly where the doses is close to zero so most of these patients they just kind of laugh and say I'm coming from my daily my daily treatment and I'm you know right back to my normal life again so what in the absence of antigen deprivation radiation has become very simple for prostate patients now and again what fraction of gleece and sevens can do radiation without requiring antigen deprivation therapy that answer would have been zero probably five years ago you know it's recently but now with our terror and decipher it's probably I'd say a quarter of them don't need it if it's a three four with a load decipher lower terrorist score and again this is still in a evolving area where I don't think anyone has the exact answer but that's what most people are doing nowadays and even some four plus three is that have load decipherers are potentially candidates to avoid that and the biggest thing the biggest change in this has now been our ability to do PSMA PET scans to follow up because otherwise I think that the extra antigen therapy antigen deprivation was more of a sort of a band aid for not being able to see what's going on afterwards now if someone has a recurrence and we do a PSMA PET I got a guy that had treatment 20 years ago with radiation now he's rising PSA otherwise he'd just be stuck with ADT for years now I see we see a positive parloric lymph node on a PSMA PET I can just treat that area and you're doing that and very successfully there's no long-term data yet but it seems to be working really well similarly to how we would use a FDG pet to target a long-term in the past what about these patients that show up with two spine mats how effective is radiation there given that that's a favorite spot for prostate to you're talking about like an initial presentation with all the go metastatic disease okay we could talk about that or we could talk about post treatment three years later so post treatment three years later palliative radiation does work very very well it would be probably five treatments you can even do what they call SBRT which is stereotyactic body radiation may be in a single fraction and it definitely is very good it's we kind of joke about it just kind of spot well that spot and then of course it's not going to prevent something else from popping up elsewhere but that's extremely well tolerated and usually it'll stop the progression at that site so there are people who had high risk disease and to get back to what I mentioned earlier if they had a couple of spots like that at the time of initial diagnosis now it's been shown that you can treat the oligomedastatic disease if it's in the bone only at the same time as the primary lesion and the outcomes are actually not significantly worse if it's just limited disease and what is a more favorable presentation oligomedastatic to bone or oligomedastatic to parahortic bone for sure yeah you can have actually I had a guy walking to my office with a PSA of 1900 he looked just as good as you were me and I actually took him on a TV show I did many years ago is kind of an interesting story 1938 65 year old guy Mr. Macho had never been to a doctor in his life widow who decided that he was dating a younger woman now and she's like if you want to be with me you gotta go get checked out colonoscopy clear blood work all clear oh by the way your PSA's 1900 which means the lab made a mistake if you're I mean that's what I said so you would think except for his bone scan look like a Christmas tree this was in the pre-pet era but I mean he had disease and every bone is body with zero symptoms so this is an obvious and outlier situation but in that such situation you need lifelong androgen deprivation and chemotherapy you know usually at back then it was mostly tax all-based therapy we didn't have all the second generation androgen ablation drugs that we do now like in the ludumide but at that time when when we saw that you know he went and got chemo and got engine ablation when he came back to see me again fully functional guy perfect shape his PSA was down to 1.5 with just the systemic therapy and at that time the tumor board we presented him the decision was made to go ahead and treat his prostate as though he was a you know a denobo presentation because all the bone disease had had a result and he did great so he treated his prostate and how long did he live he still alive this has been I got an email from just about a year ago so I think he at least has about a year ago he was 12 years out still doing great with the zero side effects aside for me how he did have to be he's on androgen ablation for life so he's certainly going to have issues from that but overall still very functional how is this possible what what is what's the biology of that tumor that allows him to still be alive I don't think it's even necessarily just prostate I've even seen it in in breast cancer patients in that small subset where it's bone only disease with no visceral metastasis some folks can live for a very long time with bone only disease and I'm not sure what the answer to that is he's not an any debilitating fractures you would expect that at this point but no not not even one this guy's in his late 70s now he's in his yeah late 70s and has not fractured a thing and is still active the guy plays golf and hope he still has the young girlfriend I'm not sure about that but but other than that other than the hormonal aspects of it yeah it's amazing how I've seen many many people with four digit PSA's that we get him down at least any D for some window of time even if it's not that long four digit PSA yeah I think the highest I've seen is 7500 and that was not that was a person that ended up passing away but the the guy he was 1900 he I think a lot of it is a function of just like any other type of tumor he had all the other risk factors that were lined up he was young healthy no other comorbidities active you know you name it yeah well it's interesting I Ted has told me about some of the most terrifying cases are the exact opposite these guys that show up will be a low PSA with a very low PSA of 1.9 those are worse and for sure rampant metastatic design right right and that's the thing to get some of these really poorly differentiated cancer that no longer resemble their prostate presented or sells and they just they're very hard to monitor and a lot of them even don't even show up on a PSMA pet scan anything else you want to talk about on the oncology side of this as far as what what should people know as they're engaging with a radiation oncologist what questions should they be asking what you know it sounds like it's no different than surgery where there's clearly a difference between good surgeons and not so great surgeons there is presumably are people that take the kind of care you take and agonize over the details how can somebody find out if their radiation oncologist is kind of practicing in your philosophy you know it's it's difficult in terms of actual metrics very much like even for the surgeons like you know Ted has excellent outcomes but it's not like it's a published series you just have to commonly that the best surgeons often are treating the hardest cases so it's a handicap right handicap right so you know it really comes down to finding someone who's got got the experience and in my case because we do so much prostate I think I've done something close to in the modern era 7000 cases probably 10000 when you include the pre image guided radiation days someone who specializes in the area that the cancer is located so someone like me I may be extremely experience in breast and prostate but maybe for a pediatric maligncy you're not going to come to me you're going to go somewhere or a CNS or something that's unusual you have to find the right tool for the job but you have to just interview your doctor I think there's anything specific to radiation that's really asking about talking with patients right I think being very open with them saying yeah exactly and so ideally maybe you come to someone who knows something like I get a lot of patients who aren't familiar with the field they'll have a patient they'll have a family member that's a nurse or a dentist or a veterinarian or whatever it is some of it has some medical background they can say okay let me ask the more specific questions and these days with with the internet you can do all kinds of research in terms of like when I'm when I'm talking about matching my my volume of the dose distribution to exactly conform to the tumor volume that's something that's very easy to talk about but I mean for an educated patient they can ask to see the actual computer simulation so what am I engineering patients for the engineer is probably having easier time they do my love for my engineering patients are really the only ones who do this and I'll be I usually pull out all the graphs I show them dose volume histograms with area under the curve for each organ and you can see okay the prostate dose I air into the curve is huge the dose of the blood and the rectum is super low you can actually quantify that but for a lay patient it's it's hard you know it's not that easy to do that you really got to go with I think a lot of you have to go with your gut too in terms of this guy's had a lot of experience and the initial consultation is where it all comes down I'll spend an hour with a patient and go through every little nuance of what couldn't happen and my main I think my main MO is to sort of overprepare them and have them be pleasantly surprised maybe when the side effects aren't as bad rather than the other way around and you just it's hard to find the right person but there's a lot of good doctors out there so let's spend a minute just on the the brain and because I guess I guess that's sort of a unique case I know it's not where you are but but I'm sure you still do a lot of it you do okay not as much as prostate and breast but yeah okay both primary and metastatic yeah so again because the brain is such a sink for meds you know hey it's a source of a lot of primaries but it's also where a lot of cancer spreads it's often a place where you can't operate either because the the tumor the met were the primary is too close to say the brain stem or something too vital so it's a radiation is a pretty common tool there so talk about the history of radiation in the brain and in the spectrum of everything from whole brain radiation to gamini and stereotactic and sorts of things in between sure thing so really the main differentiating factor for brain patients is whether it's primary or metastatic disease and although primary brain tumors are relatively common they are dwarfed by metastatic disease so the vast majority of what most radiation oncologists see when you're treating CNS is going to be usually lung especially small cell base brain metastatic disease and so in those situations the the trend used to be where everyone we get whole brain radiation but now with the advent of stereotactic radio surgery which is more focused precise radiation the newer data shows that you can actually just treat the area of metastatic disease as as a as a delineated R&MRI scan and not necessarily radiate the whole brain like we used to but for decades everyone got whole brain radiation and for the most part they did all right but the problem was you're looking at a patient population that maybe doesn't have that much of a life expectancy now that systemic therapy immunotherapy everything has gotten better especially in the case of lung patients they're living longer we we have evolved where we've been finding people that were previously radiated the brain we're having cognitive issues years down the road not for the short term they would tolerate it well but maybe they'd start to have more forgetfulness and inability to remember numbers and names and whatnot and so the modern this was from whole brain radiation and give me some doses so we're talking about 30 gray to the whole brain given in 10 fractions of three gray weeks that was a typical sort of a three gray times 10 was a sort of a standard thing and again this is a staggering amount of radians and that's what and when we consider that again it's to the brain so it's a different story just to be clear do you need to use way more radiation because that's what you're delivering to the brain so the this is this an example of where the seaver it's in the gray are very different because this skull is you have to get through the skull so no so the the only difference between seaver it's in gray and any patient is going to be whether we're talking about dose in tissue or coming out of the machine basically the dose in air versus dose in the patient the biggest thing with the brain tumors yes the bone certainly is going to attenuate more dose but what I'm talking about it's actually 30 gray into the brain itself the actual brain tissue and so the but does not mean you need much more than 30 gray coming out of the machine a little bit more the bone doesn't do that it's not like there were in a football helmet or something yeah the first on's can still pretty much go through everything it's not that's not middle so it'll still go through but the dose is a little higher and it gets to be like for example in a lung patient it's more of an issue when you have multiple different areas you got bone soft tissue and air in that situation you have to modulate the dose more but in the case of a whole brain it's been found of course that the hippocampal dose is very much related to their cognitive deficits down the road so now that we have iMRT which is a term I hadn't mentioned before but that's basically intensity modulated radiation therapy which is also the magic behind allowing us to treat a prostate without burning the blood on the rectum and the newest form of iMRT is called image guided radiation therapy so here you'll hear iGRT basically those two terms go together but by using iMRT it's kind of like an HD TV versus a 1960s black and white blurry set where we can treat with multiple small pixels and high definition so to speak so now when we do a whole brain if I have to do a whole brain from multiple metastases by using iMRT I can literally carve the dose out I can map out the hippocampus and carve the dose out of there so you see these two cold spots on the hippocampal and not and really have a very low dose or while still treating the remainder of the brain perankema or there are other parts of the brain that you carve out and protect that's the main one of course we are going to not necessarily completely carve out because when when you have multiple metastases really the whole intercranial spaces of risk you have to cover everything so believe it or not 30 gray sounds hidey which it is but for a glioblastoma we is 60 gray but granted that's not to the whole brain that'll be to the either fits it on resectable patient it'll be the primary mass and then we will give maybe 46 gray to the to the peri to a moral edema but then the rest of the brain is getting much less hopefully zero in many cases do we know what the survival difference is for an unreceptable glioblastoma within without radiation it's it's certainly worse but typically the one there's again multiple confounding factors there because someone who's unreceptable probably has other other negative issues as well if they they have you know a poor overall performance status they have neurologic deficits whatever the reason the surgeon can operate that makes it worse but yes even then in that situation you get probably you're again you're measuring survival in weeks to months but it's probably double with radiation then without but a lot of our GBMs though are resected hopefully fully resected in terms of a radi-elisradio graphic of post-op MRI not showing any enhancement if you have someone that's got a fully resected primary who's a younger patient with not a lot of neurological deficit they can live a couple of years actually why is this cancer unservivable yeah you know that's that's the that's the key question I know you and I are both rush fans Neil Peart was lost to the GBM as well and you know it's it's so many people that's taken away but I think it just has to do with the the invasiveness of the fingers of the tissue in terms of even when you think you've gotten the whole thing there's microscopic fingers that are always on the periphery and you can't just radiate it indiscriminate like you can't other parts of the body because you've got the brain there so you get there's there's always a a fine line you're walking between causing you know say for example the process of the brain versus letting the tumor recur and so that's really the number one issue we do have a new tool now and as far as radiation oncologists in terms of treating CNS2 which is called proton therapy that you've probably heard about there's several centers in the country now M.B. Anderson where I'm in Houston has a huge one but with protons you potentially can have the dose go into the brain to a certain depth and not exit out the other way like an x-ray what x-rays are like light goes right through you you may have a decreasing dose what's kind of like a bullet you got an exit wound going up with proton therapy this is one of the areas where proton shine because you can actually modulate what's called the brag peak of the physics of the protons to where it'll go with certain depth and not go out the other way so down the road hopefully we'll start to see improves survival it so far it really hasn't shown to be a huge improvement but there's less integral dose to the rest of the brain and especially important pediatric patients where you've got you know children with growing skull bones if you can avoid radiating the growing bone to cause a you know a deformity later on that's huge so proton therapy is one tool we have but I wish I had an answer for GBMs you know that'd be that's going to be a game changer whenever that does happen yeah I I find GBMs to be just such a frightening type of cancer and I do wonder if it's going to require some sort of injectable immunotherapy or something like that I just yeah it's you have to basically figure out a way to treat the brain systemically and that's right and but you you have to mechanically overcome the blood brain barrier and come up with some sort of systemic treatment right um okay so today how many patients are undergoing whole brain radiation? Whole brain radiation is probably to give you a number it's I don't know what the absolute number is but it's probably 10% of what it was 20 30 years ago the original studies out of Kentucky that patch will have done in neurosurgery everyone used to get whole brain radiation following either following a resection limit has this or even if it was unreceptable and there was some good data back then supporting that but nowadays rather than whole brain you're usually going to do a focus treatment just to a smaller area and this is kind of a you know a universal trend to less radiation dose to a smaller volume same thing in lymphoma you want to treat just the enlarged lymph node and not the entire lymphatic access so it's the same idea where you're trying to minimize side effects so whole brain we still use it as in specific cases like for example small cell lung cancer part of their Regiment is going to be once the primary has been treated if they have a complete response in the thorax prophylactic cranial radiation only really small cell PCI 20 gray five fractions been done forever shows an advantage they have lower lower lower how much is reduction in CNS it's a lot I think it's probably 70 80 percent reduction in interest in CNS failures because they all fail their otherwise that's small cell they just all do that and at 20 gray they really don't have too many side effects but again of course the caveat is always small cell you know extensive stage small cell lung patient isn't going to have a long term survival but at least they won't fail on the brain it's a quality of life issue and I'm sorry this is done with every small cell patient no matter how early it's caught if they have a complete response to primary treatment yes basically I remember maybe there's some nuances but for the most part yeah okay so what's a gammonife so gammonife is is instead of using a linear accelerator it's actually using cobalt 60 like I described earlier but you have multiple small sources that can actually be used very high resolution cobalt essentially so you're doing the same thing but instead of using a linear accelerator based treatment it's it's using cobalt so is that used anymore or is it still our centers that use it it still works very well for what it is but the focus is very narrow there's a lot of children's hospitals and all that I think we're still using it but the linear accelerator which I is a abbreviated linac the linac based stereotyactic radio surgery for the most part has sort of taken over from that because it can do all the same things and also have more flexibility to do more than just CNS same juice hospital has a fantastic PDC and S program and they still have well it's been a while now but they did have a gammonife last time so we've talked a lot about radiation we've touched a little bit on the idea of radio phobia but but maybe let's let's use that as a bridge to talking about using radiation to enhance tissue as opposed to eradicate a subset of tissue sure what does it does it stem from you know nuclear accidents is that largely where radio phobia comes from I've done a deep dive into this this year which goes along with all these benign cases that I'm treating now they're essentially arthritis tendonize which we'll talk about and what's really interesting is that this radio phobia is largely a U.S. based phenomena because the first cases first of our x-rays were discovered in 1895 by RENkin in 1898 there was the first case described of actually radiating both arthritis type things are anglicing spondilitis or other arthritis and also tumors even back then we had no idea how to work but the case is pre-1900 they were already being used for that and then in the subsequent now 120 plus years we have this divergence where germany and the UK are using and all of Europe really are using radiation routinely for arthritis in tendonitis but in the U.S it seems to be a basic there was a lot a lot of a nuclear phobia the cold war like you mentioned but another thing that's been talked about there's a guy named Jason Becht that has a really good podcast on the subject he's out of Vermont standard oil the Rockefeller's and I'll actually had a massive lobby group that were actually actively promoting oil over nuclear power plants and the the amount of spread went from just the energy interesting to the just the general zeitgeist of our entire country and so at that time the radio phobia just caught on and it was of course bolstered by World War II and seeing what happened in Hiroshima Nagasaki and then on top of that you had the you probably heard about the radium dial workers there was a movie in its section to call the radium girls these are essentially women in the 1920s that were using radio luminescent phosphorous paint to paint the watch the watch dials yeah being a watch guy you probably appreciate that but they litter that was the only source of elimination they had so in order to keep the brushes very fine they were literally dipping it in the radium paint and then after each brush they were licking the brush to keep the the tip real fine and so they were ingesting bits of of radium and so there were a number of cases where they ended up getting the the radium is metabolized like calcium so it was actually incorporating into the mandible and they were getting osteo-radio and a process of the jaw and things like that so all of these different phenomena kind of added together became a became a big deal because prior to that people were using the radiation for all kinds of crazy things it was in sun tan lotions and waters and there was something called the gorydeen that they were using for e-d that you could not topical saves that had radiation and there was literally no end to it and then when all this sequela started to come out that hey maybe this isn't such a good idea that's when things took off but now that we look back the reality of it is is that a lot of that was really overblown even so much so that those radium dial painters which we hear about this from day one in our residency training there was only a small percentage I think 50 out of 1500 roughly that actually had toxic sequela so most of them didn't is there a way to quantify how much exposure they had to write that thing you know they'd named licked different ways but there there had been some basic ideas it was again we're talking about it was probably at that era probably a couple of milliseverts to that particular area but it was daily for decades and so part of the reason why they if you actually look at the numbers it was probably a super high exposure when you spread that out of such a long period of time that's sort of the general trend like I mentioned earlier it's not just the dose it's the dose over time it's you know the denominator matters a lot and so that's why most of them actually did very well they even used to use radium internal and the internal nasal applications in the 19 I guess 1920s to 1940s essentially a radiation equivalent of a ton select mad noidectomy and it was done in something like a half million to two million children in the US and even in the armed forces it was done routinely back then and there's been very few adverse sequela that were reported I don't even know what the dose was but it was high so there's a lot of cases where the exposure based on our 50 milliseverts we talked about would just make people follow their chair but the actual reality of it is is that many times the actual end results aren't as bad as we had expected again hearing you say this on jade the listeners are going to be thinking what yes because we're all so brainwashed into believing that radiation is horrible right right I can tell you so many stories I got patients who have had to treat I had actually had a guy who was involved in nuclear testing at the lowest alamos in the 1940s he's passed away now but I saw him in his 80s so this was in the early 2000s this was 60 years after that they had very little monitoring back then but he was close enough to feel the heat from a thermonuclear bomb and by the time I saw him he had had thyroid cancer as you would expect he'd had a one or two lymphomas I think I ended up treating his prostate so he'd had at least four or five different malignancies but the guy was as functional as most 80 year olds are the guy was still walking and talking and doing just fine and it's actually seems that the when you look at the population studies that were done outside the blast at Hiroshima Nagasaki when you've got the initial concentration everyone dies from the thermonuclear energy but as you get several miles out not only are the cancer rates actually roughly the same as the background you actually see again evidence of her mesis where you have some patients in whom or maybe not her mesis but some sort of radio protection where you actually have lower rates of leukemia and thyroid cancer when you get a few miles farther out than you did in the general population so it's all very much dose dependent time dependent but I think the human body we were evolved really to handle this to a larger degree than we realized because again mammalian DNA we came from you know the background of all the animal kingdom where there was tons of exposure from natural cosmic rays and whatnot and then you know our our predecessors had to be able to survive our DNA had to be somewhat resilient in order to get to this point and I think it's more resilient than a lot of people give a credit for so this first came up maybe a year or two ago when when I was lamenting must have been two years ago I guess because I was kind of lamenting my Achilles tendon which wasn't I wouldn't say it was injured I just had a little bit of tendonitis it was just bugging me a little bit you and me both brother and I'm exactly what you mean and and so it was through that discussion that we got into what we're talking about now which seemed crazy you know I just decided I didn't feel like driving to Houston all the time to undergo therapy and my Achilles is fine now I just been sort of standard therapy but right I've sent a few patients to you who have had similar injuries both you know high hamstring tendonopathy's Achilles tendonopathy's so so talk a little bit about this idea sure how prevalent is this type of treatment in Europe who you know how prevalent is it here right so prior to probably 1970 maybe 1980 it was very prevalent even in the U.S. it was very widely done so this is kind of everyone that talked about it now it sounds like I'm doing something experimental and radical but if you go over to Germany again going back to Ankelosing Spondylitis papers in 1988 they've done they do something like I hair between 20 and 50,000 patients a year in Germany and there's tons of it's mostly observational studies it's very very few randomized trials but low dose radiation for tendonitis osteoarthritis plantar fasciitis all the itadies you can think of birthitis a low dose of radiation has a similar anti inflammatory effect to what you would get from a colonel to find the dose so now we're talking about very low dose meaning 50 centigrey or 50 rads given six times over two weeks so three gray 0.5 times six it's three gray to the affected joint and using a very low energy machine so this is especially in the case of someone who's got a hand you're talking about electron beam right so let me just make sure I got that straight you were giving 40 gray total to a breast a breast and now for the achilles you're giving how much six got three gray six fractions of half a gray each okay got it so all six fractions combined is about the dose of one fraction for a typical cancer got it that'll kind of give you the idea and giving it in a superficial fashion where especially if it's a hand you only have a couple of send it maybe a couple centimeters of thickness so we use what's called electron beam therapy the same linear accelerator when the electrons go and hit the tungsten target and make photons if you remove the tungsten target you just get direct electrons and electron energy can be modulated to where you can treat a superficial skin cancer you can treat a knuckle I can treat a temple squamous cell and not going to the brain so these superficial things and in the old days before they had linear accelerates I told you this goes back to the turn of the previous century they had ortho voltage machines and these basically created kilo voltage x rays not the mega voltage x rays we use now and all they could do was superficial stuff back then and that's where it works very well the dosage has changed tremendously but these days with the modern the biggest data comes out of Germany half a gray three times a week Monday once they fried it for two weeks just to the affected joint and it has an anti inflammatory effect very similar to either either a cortisol shot or an insect or how many weeks is the course two weeks that's a month and a week this Friday six treatments and the protocol is what we typically follow the German protocol is to wait 12 weeks and you usually see depending on the joint summer between a 60 and 80 percent success rate where the pain is if not zero at least markedly decreased and then after 12 weeks the German protocol allows for a retreatment and at that point you get up to 90 plus percent success in terms of reducing pain and this is for joint arthritis arthritis 10 to 90s bursitis plant our fascia this is a really big one now that we're doing a bunch of I've done probably clicked a 70 cases across the board which is a positive markup because anybody who's had it you know I had it once back in med school so about 25 years ago did you get it treated it was it just a not just all went to PT and rolled on golf balls and did the usual thing but it you know it took months to get better it's such a big deal so you're saying so of the patients that are coming to see you with plantar fasciaitis how many of these patients how long have they been hurting first of all many times for years and in fact my biggest cohort recently which is still relatively new haven't done thousands of patients like I can speak from decades of experience with cancer we're talking about you know dozens to hundreds a couple of surgeons that were having trouble standing and operating they literally couldn't you know couldn't perform their normal duties six treatments to the to the fascia and they're walking like nothing ever happened how long after the last treatment did it take for them to experience in the case of plantar fasciaitis was almost immediate like within within a week I have other cases especially when we do like knee arthritis if there's a lot more pathology going on in a knee I treated my own Achilles which I can tell you about took two months or so so it was almost almost almost wanting if you was going to work and not I was my own first patient before I offered anybody I treated my own treat. True doctor physician healed myself right and so I literally jumped on the table because of colleague of mine had posted about it that he did his he's a radiation I call just in Florida he tried it out and so I was like you know I have the machine I know this should work in theory we just never taught about it in residency and I look at all the German data there's tons of it's like why do we not do more of this and it's sure enough like I I'm actually my own personal case controls study because I did steroids and PRP and my left Achilles and then later on this past year did the right side with only radiation and no steroids and now I'm walking without a limp and you obviously did the other side mm-hmm no I actually didn't I didn't repeat because the PRP actually finally did because I had two cortisol shots and PRP in the left and then a year later radiated the right and so both of them are holding up pretty well so far got it the other area that is a huge interest for me at least is the very very high hamstring tendonopathy so that that is chill tuberosity pain very very common for runners she seems to be anecdotally much more common in women than men that's on pelvic and I've only treated women for some reason that and they've all had tremendous results yeah again so you're it's still the same protocol it's the three over six treatments over two weeks exactly for any type of an arthritis uh you're essentially lacing all the macrophages and all and you're saliminated that side of kind storm that would have normally resulted it's very similar to what cortisol does but the difference is it seems to be based on the study we've seen this much longer lasting than a cortisol shot not to mention the fact that you're not necessarily violating the capsule and causing other you know again the case of an Achilles tendon you run the risk of rupturing it with multiple injections so totally non-invasive you just get up on the table most of my patients go right back to whatever they were doing and many of them are actually quite athletic and they don't take any breaks during treatment they just do what they do they're still working out is there any literature looking at this for spine injuries uh not by injuries let me be clear what I mean right so when you think of all the times that people are getting spinal epidurals for irritation of spinal nerves herniated discs things of that nature is there any reason to believe this could have any efficacy there if indeed there's some efficacy which there clearly is due to spinal injections or epidural injections there there is some data for spinal osteoarthritis specifically it's less robust than all the extremities uh I've actually done a few cases and it's actually worked quite well we've even got you know essentially Medicare actually does reimbursed for these things the issue with the spine is it's such a multifactorial area where if you've got a nerve root compression or a disc issue I can't fix that part of it but there is limited data that I've seen out of Europe that did show some degree of relief but it's not the 80 to 90 percent that we quote for the extremities. It's interesting and do you think that's because of patient selection like if you if you knew you were dealing with a facet arthropathy that should in theory respond well it should and it does I've done a few of those SI joints seem to respond quite well and that's in the literature that's included so hips SI joint, lumbar spine those sorts of things they are described they're just not as routinely treated there's not as the level of experience that we do have what your ability to center the beam is remark you're using the same high fidelity equipment you're using the rat on so you can hit a p inside if you want to. You could but that's exactly what you don't want to do because you're basically trying to eliminate all the macrophages in the region so you're actually better off treating larger features. It's the exact opposite of what we do with cancer therapy and because the dose is so low you're not really gaining anything by being too cute with the small fields you actually want to treat the region it's like almost like an abscopal effect for the whole area. So when if you're treating somebody that comes to you and they've got an achilles tendonopathy usually there's a point of maximum tenderness but it usually hurts up and down the whole like lillies how do you position the beam and are you literally hitting from mid-caf down to heel from the insertion in the gap even treat up to the in my case part of the gap the inferior gastroch was painful too. Okay so I treat that entire region the field is probably about that long all the way down to the calcaneal insertion and even onto the a little bit of the plantar surface of the heel because again when you're talking about these super low doses of radiation there's like if it was a sarcomo that area I'd be treating a tiny lill area but over here we won't we want to treat the whole region and in the most of the most radiation oncologists we talk to their experience treating an extremity it's usually for a sarcomo so that's a whole different ballgame where you're giving 60 grade to someone who's had a sarcomo and they're in their leg or something and you have to worry about things like a deema you know essentially if you you can have lymphedema of the distal extremity if you radiate the whole the holes circumference of a leg or something like that but with these low doses it doesn't affect any of that so you do treat large fields so it'll be from the entire and it's from the insertion of the Achilles all the way down if it's a plantar fascia the entire plantar surface of the foot another thing that we see a lot which is not arthritis is the putrons contracture and also the foot equivalent which is leader hose disease I had to look that one out that was like a trivia question but it's essentially palmar plantar fibrosis and so radiation works well there as well very well document and that requires a higher dose though you're talking about three gray perfect fraction five fraction and then you do it again after a few weeks so 1515 1515 almost a cancer yeah almost um palliative cancer not not a high dose but again that's for fibrosis keyloids it works very well get teenagers with the big old golf balls hanging off their ear after getting their ear pierced and things like that and so again you're treating the fibroblast in that case you use four gray times three treatments of 12 gray relatively large dose per fraction you can totally protect the brain totally 100% yeah and just tell I've seen obviously patients with debilitating kiloids what does it look like after the treatment so the treatment has to be adjuvant after a surgical resection if you just radiate an intact kiloid it's not going anywhere okay because you don't have the DNA mechanisms of you know a week cancer so that can be wiped out so kind of like doing a good on pregnancy but obviously if the surgeon just did the resection the kiloids coming right that fibroblast go crazy and they roar right back so in order to do it right a lot of people do and they have multiple recurrent to rate treatment I've killed as even after treatment you have to do the first treatment the same day of surgery so you just not letting those fibroblast get a chance to have any sort of a foothold so I literally arrange it with the dermatologist to do the resection send them straight to me so we get the first dose in that day and ultimately the cosmetic outcome is as good as if they didn't have radiation that you'll see the scar wherever it is we get sometimes kids that have had acne scars all over their chest that have these bumps everywhere and they're all reseected flat and you're radiating them they just stay flat you don't see any sort of dermatitis from radiation I think what's amazing to me is I I just think there's so many people that don't know this right I think there's too many people that are walking around sort of suffering right from something that's cosmetically upsetting like a huge kilo aid especially on a visible part of their body right obviously the people everybody listening can relate to some nagging injury 10 SLB golfers elbow a killies 10 to an opathy hamstring 10 to an opathy these things nag for years at times yeah I think they the data was showing some like one in seven people in the country are afflicted and the the socio economic costs are massive and there's also you know going to your whole quality of life and longevity bias I mean we're talking about something that can really affect someone's ability to exercise at all and it can lead to exacerbation of other medical problems so it's a huge problem you know I'm very encouraged to hear you say a second ago that medicare is covering some of these things and private insurance too yes for the most part now a lot of times because it's relatively new I'll have to get on there and do appear to peer with the company but I've had no rejections at all even for the spinal ones which are little bit there's less robust data but I've gotten everybody covered so I think the question is do we need more radiation oncologists right because how are you making room in your practice to treat these patients when your cancer patients are probably ringing you off the hook as well and that's a big reason why it hasn't caught on I think there's a component of just you know when you've got eight hours or 12 hours a day that the linear accelerator can run we're busy with that but one of the things is that because not unless it's a deep hip or something for most of the superficial for all the other joints you can use one of those old style ortho voltage machines that I mentioned earlier like what they use in Europe they still sell those here there's a company called extra all that still makes them and they're perfectly acceptable for all the joint stuff except for the very deep ones like maybe an SI or hip joint but you could have a you know a small center set up and those types of machines don't even require the shielding because the energy of the photons is very very low so yeah this is something that could be it's highly underutilized at this point in the and the Europeans have shown us the way it clearly works and America just has to catch up yeah this is definitely an area where we are way far behind but it's truly exciting I mean I love treating cancer patients it's really personally very rewarding to tell someone that they're any de- there's no evidence of cancer and they're body anymore they're PSA's low or where their mammograms look good it's it's that's what's kept me going this long but the amount of immediate relief we're seeing from from all these inflammatory conditions right away it's like it's a night and day patients come in one day they can't grip a dornab or lift a gallon of milk out of their fridge and after six treatments they can't and they're just they think you hung the moon it's an amazing thing yeah I really I'm hopeful that people listening to this so if there's a million people listening to us have this discussion and you know one in seven of them let's just say one in ten of them at some point in the next couple of years they're going to experience the type of injury that would benefit from this how can they go about finding you they can't all come to Houston to see you I'm trying to get you to move to Austin but regardless of where you end up yes they can't all come and see you so where oh that's you already said the answer I'm just going to move to Austin we're just going to do this full time and drive cars in the on the weekends no but seriously it's there's a uphill battle because as I've been going out and trying to get the medical community in Houston aware but you have a lot of pushback because number one you've got orthopedic surgeons podiatrist hand surgeons who are looking at this like number one what are you doing what are you talking are you they look at me like I'm crazy and number two is like even if this actually works the concern is with someone's got maybe a knee arthritis has been nagging them and maybe they're going to need a total knee at some point their concern is wait a minute is is this taking surgery off the table they have all the which it's not by the way it's such a low dose there's been plenty of cases of surgery after the radiation it's not an issue or you're taking away from like when you had your plantar fashion as I'm sure the podiatrist build something from when they do those extra corporeal shock treatments and steroids and whatever it's it's a different paradigm that would potentially be taking away that these a lot of paid a lot of doctors are very negative about it most of them that this one are very negative but I think that tight is going to turn just like anything else it's just going to take a lot of education a lot of time a lot of well I think the end of the day look I don't think patience will have any patience for turf wars yes right so if I'm a patient every doctor needs to be a fiduciary they need to put my interest have their interest and what's interesting is that I think you can have your cake and eat it too and the reason I say that is many times this is an adjuvant for other things so if you've got a podiatrist that's doing all these PRP's and other things I'm actually looking at starting a protocol I just treated a nurse in Houston who's who's a NP who does stem cells off label but she does them routinely has a quite a big practice we're going to look at maybe you can do radiation with adjuvant stem cell treatment there's I think a lot of reasons because it's such a low dose this may be the sort of combined modality thing down the road that we haven't really approach where there may be options to do other things still but again the fact that medicare to improve something is a huge bar right so how are you getting medicare to improve this are they are basically acknowledging that well hey if everywhere else if Europe's been doing this for a hundred years and it's working like what's that sort of looks like when you you know I've got the c61 which is the icd code for prostate cancer which is in most of my patients we got the australarthritis codes now they just go right through typically without any sort of problem some of the private insurance is you have to get an appear to appear call but when I all I literally will do is quote them a couple of the German studies unfortunately we got a little bit of a setback because historic is only two randomized clinical trisers both heavily underpowered poorly run studies just not well done so that's been a little bit of a setback but and the randomized data may never come just because of the nature of this sort of thing but having said that that's not the obstacle anymore we got as if it's really just public awareness and like you said once you get it just like a guy that doesn't want a radical prostitute to me and wants radiation therapy for his prostate he's got to be his own advocate and the data is out there the information is out there I've actually held there's a couple of big Facebook groups and one is only the putrons patients and they literally will post up that got this big nodule what do I do my surgeon wants to cut on me and so there's actually a whole whole network now so there's a lot more of that education going on they've got big PDF files of doctors all over the US that will do deputions radiation so deputions is a little bit more commonly accepted but as I'm slowly talking these folks they're going to sort of you know migrating to their arthritis space as well so I think it'll come and the patient the general public has nothing but great positive outcomes from this I mean and do we we have a sense of the durability of this so for example I have a little bit of osteoarthritis at my AC joint right right it's it barely bothers me but everyone's in a while if I'm doing something really violent overhead you know reaching for something or I play a ton of football with my son it'll bug me for like three weeks I'll take a little bit of ad bill it's fine right if I did a treatment there would it be done or am I doing this treatment annually how it works and that's there's a lot of variability that depending on what the actual anatomy that's causing it if there's you know if it's literally just a straight up osteoarthritis case with no physical structural issue I've seen cases I've now again I've only been doing this about a year so I don't have the 25 years of experience I do with cancer but I've talked to there's there's a couple of doctors who do this routinely they've been doing it for 20 years in LA one of them treated his own neck shoulder and spine he's 15 I think he's at 15 years out anecdotal obviously but never had to retreat himself typically the German studies allow for to treat me to retreatments because the dose is so low radiobiologically I don't see any reason why you couldn't do it I don't know about annually but you know maybe every few years something like that but there seems to be a fair bit of data that a lot of patients who don't have other struck like a like a knee that's bone on bone it might only last a month or a man I even work but for the other ones like the hands and all it seems like it's certainly longer lasting than any sort of cortisol shot but I think months are very reasonable and probably years for most people now what about non osteoarthritis like a room a room a room a tight arthritis is like that is there any reason to believe that this could help with sort of the debilitating injuries that those patients so I've done three cases of room a tight arthritis and one guy that had a gaudy arthritis as well because again it's a systemic disease I'm not going to pretend to be able to cure that with a local treatment but to a single knuckle that's driving them nuts it's still in an inflammatory process and yes it works great for that so I've done that so if a patient has room a tight arthritis where they're really experiencing a lot of deformation in the hands yes you you think you can help that that patient with with the local part of it yes it won't reduce the deformation necessarily a lot of that is you know long standing and if they've got we're treated early enough in the course of disease I think it that there's no strong data to support them but I don't see why it wouldn't work personally and it definitely from a purely palliative standpoint just to reduce pain it does work you just have to you've to manage their expectations what are some other examples of where this could be used in your at least in your experience so far in terms of reducing reliance on and said or opioids or other things like that uh tennis elbows become a big one doing several of those and how much do you how far down the arm do you aerate it I would I'd base it on where the patient might out if they palpate if they're getting pained down into the break your radials and if it's if it's sort of radiating further down I'll treat a larger field because again there's no reason not to bigger fields are better no need to be again it's just six great just three great three great so and again that's three great locally and it's in it's two an area where there's no vital organs nearby the total body dose is negligible it's like it's like getting a cat scan initially for the rest of the body so I would treat definitely the joint capsule a little bit of the distal humorous and the and the proximal radius and whatever else but if it's hurting larger I'll just treat a larger field and in that case we use a posed lateral beam so the patient will just lay there the beam will come in from one side and rotate around from the other side and we treat them well because that way we get the same type of homogenous dose we do with our cancer patients but if it was if it was more disillivism or it's like we've actually done several piano players that have dequire veins tend to survive this in their wrist and because when you're stretching to play those notes all my music I'm a musician as well all my my musician friends are coming to me and the the wrist pain is going away and that actually again very quickly my biggest patient cohort so far are our former patients because they don't have radiophobia they're like I've been through 80 grade my prostate this is a joke and I'm bringing my wife with me and half the times the wives sit there for their daily treatment anyway they start chatting in the lobby so we do the wives hand the same time we do in the husband's prostate and for the most part the hands the wrist the elbows it's very rapid in the case of the tendonitis like my killies it was a couple of months but that's not outside of the window of what we've been conditioned to expect from all the German studies so it can be not as immediate of a ever-releaf as a steroid shot but it does seem to be more durable yeah we failed to mention at the outset that you're also a remarkable musician about that how much do you still play the drums I try to play with I got a couple of actually a couple of doctor buddies we get together in jam every every week or two and one of them is actually a guy who's actually got his own YouTube channel and Spotify and he was actually professional musician before becoming a cardiologist so we may actually start touring again but back in the day we had a full full doctor band a full 70s rock cover band called ultrasound so there's a good old days we used to play you know journey in rush and and led Zeppelin all day long so yeah was commenting recently on a podcast how much I regret not seeing rush during their last tour yeah yeah again because of a GBM tied back into what we're doing here needle needle was it was a it was a genius so greatest drummer of all time are you going with bottom neither because after coming I went to what to college here at UT and that opened my world open my entire eyes up to the world of jazz and so the jazz drummers can all drum circles around those guys in terms of pure technical ability but yeah feel rhythm not necessarily being able to to wow people the way the jazz guys can but yeah probably kneel in bottom are both right up there on the rocks you put them at the top of the rock list I would put kneel first I'm just partial to rush and a lot of that has to do with their music not necessarily and then kneel was obviously an innovator but as a 16 year old I'm sitting there trying to imitate every single note on his drum solo so if everything like that so kneel number one but bottom and the and there's playing and then the new generation rock guys are incredible the guys that grew up with kneel as an inspiration now you've got you know 12 year olds who can do this stuff and they're sleep and then all these math metal bands you got you know dream theater and you've got things like animals as leaders some of these guys are doing things I pride myself as a drumroll me able to analyze the music really well it's getting to the point where it's almost more math than music like it's so intricate the modulation of the time signatures and things like that it's it's actually getting beyond or even I'm having trouble understanding it now but these guys you appreciate it from an auditory perspective or is it is it does it get too technical where it's hard to appreciate and distinguish that's a fine line because when you think about it math music is just math with emotion added in and it gets to a point where some of it is not appreciable anyway at least not to me some of these guys love it but that's where the jazz side comes in where it's all about feel but even the jazz guys will be extremely you know talented in terms of their ability to to feel the beat and have it be pleasurable to the ear but they're doing such intricate things and you can balance those two things out that's that's heaven as far as I'm concerned when you can when you can have the emotional side and also have be technically challenging and not just playing a straightforward you know the straightforward stuff is great to you but it gets a little bit tedious sometimes so we met actually driving amg drift academy I think yeah yeah which by the way not to crap all over it but it was like I ended up doing it because of the last second I got a phone call from my driving convention he was like hey I'm doing this amg driving school and they got an extra spot in the advanced drift school you want to come right but I'd already been to you know the drift academy with my friend Josh Robinson yeah sure I'll go yeah and I was like what is this the last time I ever do one of these school josh this school is 100 times better compare like in close if you want to come and you want to learn how to drift you go to the Texas drift academy I want to go to Minnesota with a manila ice class are you going I'm just I'm just run I don't know if I'll be able to make it or not I'm trying to yeah so anyway we met and but it was totally random right like it was just well I knew who you were because I'm gonna remember I've been a follower for years I was like got speed or tea over there so we got paired up in the same group and that's kind of where it started was totally random I was actually just it was a last minute thing it was actually a level two so I was like you hadn't done the level one right right so I was like man how did this guy get any without even doing the level one but and so having done that I agree especially those cars with the automatic transmissions in the turbo lag not the greatest for drifting you've been kind of a carnero your whole life and and what is it about cars that that has you as excited as you are you know I think whenever anybody asked me that I kind of think about it in terms of every three or four year old boys enamored by cars but normal people just grow out of it and some of us never do I and my dad certainly like cars he taught me how to change my oil and whatnot but he wasn't a fanatic like I am so it just kind of started there and then it got to point where like you know my parents will tell you the story about how I was like that was that four year old who could tell you at a car driving by if it was an old mobile that had Cadillac hub caps on it like how the hell does this kid know this thing but I don't know where just kind of clicked and over the years it was always just a nice nice release and I guess being a mechanical he oriented type person I think if I didn't do medicine I would have done engineering which is why I said what did you study in college I was actually biology I did a BA with arts I did a lot of jazz studies at U.T. so I music guy engineering just seemed fascinating to me but I you know I was always interested in medicine from day one but I think that it's really the mechanical side of things like knowing the every every car's five gear ratios and what their torque converter lock up is and what their horsepower and torque is it's just you know and what posters of cars did you have on your wall the same as everybody actually know because everyone had a kuntosh right I never had a kuntosh I mean they're cool I would have like a calo a corvette Miami-Vice testarossa of 928 which I'm almost done with my old 928 getting it back on the road you know more the domestic stuff and the stuff is more attainable fox body mustangs the five leader mustangs of that era really cool C4 corvettes back in that era when they were state of the art I mean I loved watching night rioters so I thought Pontiac firebirds were super cool you know it's funny I just bought my youngest his first Lamborghini poster he's mostly got sports posters on his walls which is great but I was like you gotta have like a Lamborghini poster so let's go pick one out so we scroll you know edc for hours right and because I wanted to figure out what his taste was right that he want to go retro that he want like a kuntosh but in the end I think we went with the I can't even remember now actually we just ordered it I think we went with an oracan oracan I have a lot of guy yeah I mean ultimately was it was gonna be an eventador oracan but got the color right and get the angle right have you driven a kuntosh yet I've never driven a kuntosh have you it's I have it's one of those don't meet your heroes kind of things you know it's it's cool but it's kind of a POS too you know it's it's it's there was just the bar has moved a long way since then but you might even if you don't expect I mean you clearly don't expect it to perform like a modern car but but even if you judge it for what it was in the 80s would it is it's still not enjoyable it's enjoyable because of the 80s camping is in retro spec but even compared to its contemporaries you look at an 80s 928 Porsche or even a testarossa those cars are beautifully driving you know long distance cruiser super comfortable compliance suspensions you got good ergonomics and the kuntosh is so awesome because it has none of that it's awesome we bad yeah yeah I've driven a testarossa yeah have you ever driven it I've at 40 I have not yeah I have I'd love to have ridden and one but I haven't driven when it's it's it's a race car so it's you know you're basically just sitting on the ground with a carbon tub or on you so if you good have three road cars but you can't sell them so you can't you know you're not making the decision based on economics right okay what what if a three you want three road cars not daily drivers or we tell me just three cars that's all you can have in your right no no no these are your these are three grail cars okay I would probably say man there's too many to choose from but probably you have to go with it's gonna sound like a cliche but McLaren F1 I mean how do you not pick that if I could only have one that's the one I want it's got a bunch of the picture of you sitting in that yeah I was jealous I was happy number one but then there's at least 10 that I could pick from be happy but I would probably say and one of them is one that I have a lot of experience was with the 4 GT I just think just one and then Jen one one of the all time greats and I would probably pick stuff that's manual and somewhat analogs I'd probably just say career GT Porsche career GT with an NAV10 and they're they're an obtaining now but they were reasonable of just a few years ago and they're just again you just don't get there's plenty of faster cars career GT today is going for about one seven one eight ten years ago was half that yep and what's an F 40 going for today it's got to be three I think at least yeah I mean six seven years ago it was half that it totally was do you think this is a bubble or do you think these things are not coming down and value there never make any more of those limited supply the man is never going to wait for those at least I think when you look at other collector cars like some of the pre-war stuff it's going down because the the target market is all fortunately dying off they're just those people aren't around they could appreciate that but and that may happen at some point I suppose we're going to be a point where nobody cares about this we'll probably be long gone but the McLaren F one is it's unattainable oh that's I mean and there's so few of them yeah that's in a completely different league than the other cars but even like something that for GT they made four thousand of them it's not that rare well to two of them are gone a lot of them are gone thanks to yeah lack of traction control but still I don't think they'll ever go down just because that era I think then the gen two the current Ford GT which is a twin turbo automatic car will ultimately be a clipsed in value by the old one even though right now there's still more yeah they're almost double or triple but I think it's going to so where where would you put the nine five nine on this list we talked about that little bit it's right up there the only downside to nine five nine is that it was so ahead of its time that essentially is what a modern Porsche is now so yeah it's super cool we've got the 80s camping is the looks but it's basically like driving a nine nine three turbo for the most part it doesn't have that NAV8 or V10 sound it's a it's a turbocharged flat six like everything was after at that time there was nothing like it did that four real steering as well I you know what I think they did yeah like it was so modern so modern it's sequential turbos and even water cooled heads even those were all air cooled portions back then they managed to water cool the heads and now canypid does a really cool version of resto modern version but those never came to the US you think you know about that right it was the bill gates ruled as you hear about that he who I did know about the same more so I don't know all the details I should have read up but essentially he was able to get the gray market to passage for these cars for some loophole I don't know the details of it now and only after that were they able to import them into the US and so of course now that they're older you can get anything under a 25 year old I like the odd ball stuff like that that's just unavailable but the nine five nine I would still put click below the courage to just because of that naturally aspirated F1 drive V10 that's just sings in the nine five nine's motor is not as than how that level of character I'll tell you what's interesting about the courage to be which by the way would be on my list of three as well most people listening to us now if they're not carners wouldn't spot a courage to if it ran over their toes yeah that that's like a bigger boxer right it's just like so they're like what is that a portion but it's like probably like that doesn't even look like it doesn't right stand out at all whereas if you saw McLean F1 yeah you don't need to know anything about a car to know you saw something special for sure for sure um but it's and and I think the same as to with a GT the GT is yeah absolute head turner right no matter what and the interesting thing there is it's really based on a 60's design it was a tribute but the Camillo parto who was the the designer for fort who basically reinterpreted for the 21st century kept that original character but made it arrow friendly and didn't you know was able to use all these hard points from the old car but make it modern and basically upside the car it's like 110% size of the original that you could actually fit two people and because the original GT40s were tiny and they apparently generated tremendous front and lift in limon so the bottom and the modern when I've actually run at the Texas mile and the on an air strip over 200 miles now it's it's dead straight it's I mean it's they did everything right without resorting to the modern cars with all the big wings and all the big downforce it's just well balanced it is it's just they just did everything right on the car um okay now of the modern cars okay anything that you really really fancy kind of 2000 okay let's go let's define that first wave of hypercars in the 2015 so when the La Ferrarie the P1 and the 918 came out right 2014 2050 10 years ago they call it the holy Trinity for some reason yeah yeah I mean yeah that was staggering right first yeah so from that era forward right what do you fancy the most the most you know those cars again at that time I like the more than I do now just because again the hybrid technology is leaving those kind of they're a little outdated now I think out of those three I was personally maybe I'm sounded like a Porsche fanboy but the 918 was just stunning that part was just a design for get about the performance and it had an again NAV8 high-reving bespoke to that car you're not in any other platform and the electric component was just sort of a that was the G-Wiz thing of the moment which of course made it ungodly fast but that NAV8 and the way they exhaust it's out of the back well that's why by the way if you I've I've got a friend who has all in silver 959 career GT 918 that's the Trinity right like that's a Trinity that's like having you know F40 F50 and so La Ferrarie same sort of thing I mean all of those cars were amazing but since then it's gotten and that was probably the the the interesting thing about that era decade ago was that was probably the inflection point after which performance doesn't matter anymore you're okay saturated performance yours you can buy a your traction limited at this point right and not only that you can buy a used EV you can buy a Tesla plaid that'll do 16 2 seconds flat that'll for 50 grand that'll smoke everything so it's all about the total of the total of the total of the total of the total of the total of the total of the total of the time you took your Tesla plaid to Coda how how long did it take you to smoke the brakes on that so I when it was stock one stop in one make sure people understand this because they don't know so that means you came out of pit lane right so you're going up to turn one I didn't outlap so I didn't outlap so but the first coming down first hard break is going in turn one going to turn one of my buddy was in an SF 90 which is a 1000 horsepower Ferrari hybrid which is basically the fastest Ferrari you could ever buy and I was I found I was kind of catching up with him in turn in 20 and coming down the front straight I caught an SF 90 in my daily driver but I nearly rear-ended him because the car was able to stop just barely for turn one but the brake fluid boiled at that point the car was not designed to do that unfortunately and what's interesting is it's not you would say okay it's an electric car's heavy blah blah blah other electric cars don't do that the loose did the tie can they actually have really good brakes but at the time I didn't realize this because they had been advertised as being track ready or at least able to run a like the time of how it ran so good the nerve wriggling but the factory brake fluid is dot three I know after the fact which is low boiling point is boiled it the car is designed for efficiency low driving I didn't even use dot three in my simulator right I was running dot four in the same probably boilers similarly yeah so a 5,000 pound machine stopping from 100 and I probably did 160 on the front straight at that time yeah what's about I don't think it was limited actually that time I have a track that the amount of BTUs that you're trying to shed off of those brakes it was just forget about it so thankfully it had to be great so fine if you put better fluid in or they're better they're less terrible so if you want to track a plot you're going to need new brakes so I don't did I tell you what I did I ended up having a full will would set up put on the car so all new rotors custom duckting Mike do sold to sold designs actually he bought a platform himself he's built he's like I've built the Z06 I'm driving now but he ducked into the front brakes basically custom custom brake ducks that car is sealed the whole front is sealed up it's not meant for that it's meant to just be looking for anything any error on them nothing nothing at all so he actually made custom ducking and after that the car was unbelievable because you could actually late break and and so really what lap time can you do in a in a trip to Plaid now a trip Plaid will only do one of them here's the problem you can only get one solid lap before starts pulling power due to heat to the battery okay my best was a 224 and so that's at a 55,000 pound car that's no way taken I just stopped car didn't do any mods to other than just the brakes but you do one lap and and the so just to re-answer your previous question I don't know how much time we have but I'll just keep it brief that one stop turn one brakes gone thank god I have regent so I just literally nursed but I was already I couldn't turn off so I go through the s's and I'm just you know 30 miles an hour whatever I got down through the regen is enough to keep the car from completely just going off the track so 30 40 50 so coming through 9 10 coming into 11 again I'm not on the throttle at all I'm just maybe going 40 miles an hour but the regen has slowed come coming down the hill towards 11 the regen is kept me from gaining any more speed but my my my right foot is on the floor like it's the fluid is boiled so I had to go wide in 11 into the gravel completely around and then you know that that's when I found out about all that and the McLaren Senate both taught me where all those orange squares are spray painted on the arm coat where you can have the emergency off so I literally went through the gravel came with an inches of the arm coat 11 and then just hobbled in but then after that the next time out we put dot four a butt put castra will break fluid in it and change the pads then it was good for maybe a lap so then ultimately that still wasn't good enough so we did the big break now I see guys out there with testlers they're clearly not pushing as hard as you or they're mostly model three's the model three is 800 pounds lighter it's not as fast but it's a way better track car so I've done I've got dozens of laps in model three's they do fine because they're not making a thousand horsepower and they don't weigh 5,000 pounds they still will boil their breaks but if you just do pads and fluid that's actually a very desirable especially if it's a little bit damp outside not much can keep up with you in a model three and auto crosses they went national championships which is coil oversense in a 4000 pound sedan that's where EVs have gotten but just answer the previous question we did the breaks on the model S and then once that was done the only thing that that eliminate the brakes as this as the weak link but the battery the cooling is still not there so you got guys spending tons of money I actually was looking at doing a really heavily modified arrow testlamodel three like Randy Pope's drives it only do a lap at Cota because of again that's such a high high speed and high braking but it will literally just you can you can hot pit and go right back out and you can keep hot pitting but you'll never get a flat time but it'll do just fine if you do that but the next gen cars like Porsche Taycan the even the loose it's sapphire now those cars can they're just as heavy just as if you take in the Taycan turbo S out I did when it first came out in 2020 and what a lot lap out that was that the time was on stock tires and everything probably two thirty-ish yeah red red runs. Much I mean it had 750 I think I probably sent you that video at John Hennessy's track I had the Taycan the loose it and the plaid all lined up on the drag strip I'm in a 750 horsepower Porsche that can run tens in the quarter mile and the plaid and the loose it walked away from me like I was on foot. You just didn't have the traction control? No it didn't have the power 750 horsepower versus 1100. How much is the loose it up? The loose it has 11 this was the old loose it now the new sapphire loose has more has 1200 but this was 1100 and it's still in a 10-th or two behind the 1000 horsepower. Because they all have great traction. They all have and they're all will drive the traction is in the same size. It's literally just powered away at that point and you're just so I didn't realize that so the Taycan turbo S was only 750. When you stand on a turbo S if there's a plaid next to you he will leave you like you're not moving and that's like the outies a super fast car in the real world but that's why horse power doesn't matter anymore but that was more horse power limit the Taycan would happily do and actually I had a turbo before the turbo S which had steel brakes turbo S had ceramics and even the turbo would do it and on all season tires the very first Taycan that came out this was in the early days when Porsche was VW was having to respond to diesel gate you remember diesel gate and the whole deal. They had to build these electric cars and they had to go to states that were car basically the California Research Board admissions compliant because of all the diesel penalties they had so the first cars didn't come to Texas they only went to New York so I got a non-turbo S irregular Taycan when all season tires out of New York and on steel brakes Porsche Porsche it just I mean it was squealing in the corners of the all season tire but it lap 20 minutes no problem brakes were solid there's just something about the German engineering there but having said that the loose it is now equally good if not better despite being a brand new non-legacy company who is again not they're not trying to build a track car but the loose it sapphire is faster than a plaid now it runs eights in the quarter mile but it can actually track and even my old loose it which I would expect into the car on eights in the quarter mile these yeah it can crack and and sub nine now so it's several car lengths ahead of a plaid which is beyond bonkers I mean it's this you have to warn passengers these are these cars now you can't just accelerate and we have to say hang on just put your head against the headrest before I can cuss you by the way we failed you you very very briefly mentioned it but my favorite car post that the Holy Trinity of 2014 and Vivid is of course the McLaren Senate yeah yeah where does how does the Senate stack up for you and what was your fastest lap time in the Senate so my best again the biggest limitation of the tires of the non-GT or the Senate GTR can probably I've seen guys run like I think two flats in those things a couple I know a coach of mine had run a 208 just on just barely even trying but then street Senate on the trophy or just it understands it's really just not meant for that but it'll still and it got tons of downforce tons of braking but it just doesn't have the grip so I think the best that it was a 2015 and again when you driving car that value that's insane for a street car release you still you're insane but but at the same time I'm sure a pro could do better I was still thinking you know that arm code gets really close to a that car of this value they could be very good and return 12 I wasn't breaking actually 150 even on trophy bars really and then I find you know McLaren doesn't want you to put slicks on it and so I violated all the rules and I ended up putting a set of probably tires off the for our challenge cars on it when I first put it again slicks need camber you can't get much camber out of a street Senate which to me was the most disappointing thing where is the GTR you got four degrees but anyway even without camber when I first stopped on that back straight completely stock Senate would just slicks on it at the 150 mark I almost parked it in the corner it's was incredible even with the trophy R to stop at 150 in a car that in the tire that drove me to Houston in back the band with of today's tires that's a whole another topic it's incredible what even on all season Michelin has congenerated one G one G is nothing anymore all my old car and drivers I have a library of thousands of magazines point eight point nine was a huge deal 30 years ago now you got many vans to do that and even all season shot sports cars that are heavy we can do that on a on a regular tire the chemistry of these tires these days is unbelievable yeah and the promos that were two point three yeah yeah right I mean that's just and that's not even on a paralli that's like I'm a cheap guy so I run yeah well I run hard AMG GT3 I was running handcooks which would at least last me like two weekends and even then like that car was running two 11's on handcooks with just me driving it so the pros are running faster than that yeah I think I think Senate GTR not a streetcar of course just the the problem with the Senate street cars it's too track for the street and it's too street for the track it's just like a 720 S which is mechanically identical without all the downforce is a beautiful GT car drive across country you can store stuff in it super comfortable and on on Hoosiers not on select but on Hoosiers and and I change that to steel brakes that's a 2016 to 17 car it's not it's not that much slower faster than like the your old GT4 yes yeah the McLaren GT4 that's yeah that one I I'm sure I think Randy Pops could probably run close to that but when we drive for the drive drive it a driver three seconds probably and that's all in the streets because the GT4 car has half the not half the power but it has and actually my GT4 I actually cheated I tuned it okay so because those the the 570 S GT4 was already detuned from the street car but you can you can tune the street cars as well so when I was I pushed an extra 150 wheel just by tuning it because stock turbo's can handle that and so that would go 175 on the back straight whereas a regular GT4 can do 20 miles now or less than that but even then the 720 S and the actually 720 S and Senate are identical on the back straight the Senate can stop later though the Senate you can stop on the top 100 yeah probably 100 but in the in the 720 with the aftermarket steel brakes pads and a who's you're not even a real not in the which is still a DOT tire you can still break it a little bit after 200 it's not bad at all for a car that you can go shopping at the outlet malls and because it's got a massive fronken and the ride compliance that's the biggest thing about McLaren so the Senate is more tied down but they all have that active suspension that doesn't use sway bars or springs it's all hydraulic it's all fully active there's hydraulic lines that diagonally connect the front right to the left rear wheel so the pressure in those lines kind of combat body roll so you can have it be a plush highway ride or you can have it be a a stiff track car the bandwidth is almost unobtainable in any other any other car do you do you think in the in the in the sort of maybe in the public I mean do you think McLaren is somehow underperforming relative to what they should be doing given both their quality as an automotive brand and as a as a racing brand underperforming in terms of sales that what you're talking about primarily they are yeah they truly are and a big problem is I think is the perceived I'm actually and it's not just perceived the actual lack of reliability I love the cars but they're always there's it's all the jokes about British British electronics they all come to bear even the Senate would go into limp mode between nine and ten if you floored we even we had it wasn't just mine we had Senate Fest going on with 20 I think about 20 on track at one time almost every so some guys were just kind of tooling around so they were fine but if you were hauling ass between nine and ten when you get a little bit of suspension droop yep going to limp mode if you're if you're accelerating through that I would live even a GTR no no okay I'm sure the GTR is fine I haven't tracked one of those unfortunately but the and over a GTR is that a mode issue no like if you were in track mode that was in track mode I think it happened to me even one time I forgot to put it in track I think it still did it it it's a G4's related to suspension droop issue they just freaked out the computer and they had it they had McLean guys on site who were actually working on patches and they could patch it they did and I think it made it less frequent but I think it still happened after the patch I have to ask them a clarion guys about that I think it's safe to say nobody's listening to us anymore now anyway but case anybody still is yeah this has been an awesome discussion I really appreciate the the offer to come out this is a true privileged Peter what you have done in this community is unparalleled in terms of like I think I told you when I first mentioned it's like dude how do I get CME for this stuff your lectures are better than almost all not lectures but your podcasts are better than almost all the CMEs because you get the right quality people on here much better than me by far and you get people and then the way you phrase the questions and the way you kind of parse everything it's so understandable for a wide band with I got you know my non-medical friends and family all the way to the colleagues everybody gets something out of them and that's that's hard to do well hopefully today we delivered a lot of insight both to people who are obviously interested in radiation therapy for cancer which unfortunately is going to be a lot of people yeah and then of course this other application around the treatment of inflammatory conditions which again inflammation lies at the root of so many other things right and just in case anybody cares about a little drumming in cars that's right got us something to we got to we I think we have a whole indication for a whole separate series here that truly is the drive it's really just the drive we can do that all right well thank you Peter
