We're spending $1 trillion on K-12 education, but our ROI is quite low. Why are we doing so poorly? The standards just keep going down. If you're a B student, you are from three years behind to seven years behind. Where did this virus infect us? The best analogies we always use the parents totally understand is sports. Everybody in sports is like if you're not doing well, go back and do the basics. You think it's the current material, but it's your pre-rex. It's your foundation. It's your foundation. It's so easy to fix. When you use these learning science-based AI tutors and the apps that we have, kids can learn 10 times faster. You would still say that 95% of all eighth graders in the United States could be what today is considered top 10% performance. The most important part of education is a motivated student. Two-hour learning is motivational for every kid on the planet. Our competition is Fortnite and TikTok. And we need to use things like Gen AI to create such compelling content for kids. They've created a narrative that says I can't do math. Once it becomes a mastery-based system, it's a decision not an inherent capability. And there's this mental view of, oh, I guess I am a smart kid. It's like the kindling that leads to the fire. What's the simplest unlock to fix education in America? It would be this. Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. Joe, thank you so much for making time to come over today. It's nice once in a while to have a guest who is local and doesn't have to travel so far. Now it's great, I super appreciate it. You know, look, people are probably wondering, like, you know, how does this sort of tie into health and medicine? And this is a topic that's a little bit about outside of that. But really, it's not because it's where we're ultimately going to go is education. And you can't have a great system of health and medicine if you're not educating. Kids today, right, the people that, you know, are learning today are going to be the ones taking care of us. So I think everybody should have a vested interest in this in this process. Of course, also many people listening have kids across various spectrums of learning. But I think before I get into that, your story is just so interesting. And I know you don't really like telling your story. Because I know this because I know you so well. And all you want to do is talk about the work. But I'm going to force you to tell your story a little bit. So where did you grow up? So I moved around, I was born in Minnesota and I moved around every couple years. And I'm mostly up and down these coasts. My dad worked for general electric and wherever they had a factory. Whatever town we'd we'd move there. Yeah, I mean, he did very well in high school and you wound up at Stanford. So what would you, what would you major in? I majored in Econ. I did not graduate. I dropped out. But I would have been in Econ major. I mostly picked it because it was easy in the in the Stanford curriculum. So what year were you when you dropped out? So I would have been class in 1990. I would have been and I dropped out between junior and senior year. I was I'm sure my junior year professors were like he's not really engaged. And probably miss as too many classes. And you know for me and just a little bit on the background was, you know when I was in high school, I wrote a paper on AI. And you know one of the parts of the paper was about expert systems in old school AI. Now what we know today and there was a part like one paragraph called Neural Nats which is sort of today's AI. It was like this is decades away. And so I then went to Stanford and literally I was in a class with Professor Vigabong who's considered one of the fathers of expert systems in old school AI. And he's just talking about how this is you know you can build these incredible systems. And they'd be worth you know millions of dollars, you know if you could figure it out. And so you know if some classmates and I we dropped out, you know and started trilogy. And the story around that was just it was the first AI company we didn't call it AI back then because it had a bad rap in the 90s to sell a billion dollars way of products. And so that's how we got our start and eventually leads to you know today's story. Yeah so so again you it's I always find that amazing when people are dropping out like with one year to go right it's sort of like why didn't you finish it but you must have a strong conviction if you're saying I'm gonna forego my Stanford degree to go and start this company that can't it can't wait a year to do this right. Sure well there's and so back to this story because I I had you know my dad there's a famous Forbes headline that's like you're more on because my dad was very clear what a more I was being by dropping out and you know it's the the issue as I felt there was a time to market issue is a race right and I was just like I I'm sitting in Spanish class I don't care right and my market's gonna run away without me and there's a huge opportunity to go build this company and it's just it's that tension where you thought now with 2020 hindsight it took us over three years to build the product and we thought we could do it much quicker and so there was an time to market issue and with with hindsight I could have stayed but back to that pressure I just felt it I didn't want to miss it I had to go do it and so that's what actually led to the job. Did you guys come and set up shopping Austin right away? Yeah well not right away so we dropped out and did the whole you know we couldn't raise funding still can value back in the late eight eighties was not given money to dropouts like us and but we literally lived in a garage you know we had classmates who had like have a house and we're like can we rent your garage to live at it but then in 92 we moved down to Austin actually John Lynch who is one of the co-founders was like look you know if we're gonna be poor Austin back then Austin was cheap it's like it's a lot cheaper than Palo Alto so let's go move down there and so that's actually what led us down here. Austin. When did this idea of finding your next you know as I guess is it is it David Brooks who wrote that book the second mountain right so if you're if your first mountain was was trilogy this incredible business which really we're not gonna say much more about other than the fact that it basically created an an unlimited essentially word chest of capital that you were then able to go and deploy to your second mountain which is this passion around education yes you always had an interest in AI but when did these two become the next to front to you come together. So back to education so 10 years ago 11 years ago now McKinsey Price started Alpha in Austin and you know it's just still radical idea back that you know and one of the things I've learned is principal of Alpha is that parents want their kids education to be however they were educated and I was the same way I went to Catholic school my kids are in Catholic school you know and McKinsey's like look look at this great new school I got it's gonna be awesome you know and I was like McKinsey I'm it's weird like when she started it's literally in some guys garage I'm like you know her co-founder and like I'm not going to the weird school sorry and it took her two years to actually convince me to move my daughters over and you know they sampled it one time and literally loved it you know and they came back and said it was they did it after their Catholic school got out before they went to summer camp and they came back and they're like that we don't want to go to summer camp we want to still go to Alpha and I didn't like school enough to want to you were gonna miss summer for school that's how it crazy me so anyway I was like okay that's actually really good time I should move over and that was 10 years ago then how I but my discussion with McKinsey always was like this is awesome but it's not scalable and yeah just what did Alpha look like 11 years ago when you first appeared behind the curtain the other co-founder Brian right and he had this philosophy he had these rules like when so when I sent moved my kid over to Alpha I said Brian what are the two things I don't believe about education that I need to understand he's like first kids must love school they must love school and I'm like sort of spinach sometimes dude like no I he's like you're wrong and you'll figure it out and I was like okay and then his second is your kids can do so much more than you expect and I'm like I'm I sort of have really high expectations he's like they're gonna blow you away and what they can do and your expectations are too low and so you know he was you know setting it up it really it was 20 kids right they weren't in the garage after two years but you know it is alternative they would use a set of apps right to do academics but you know they'd have you know the teachers right would help academically if needed and then they would have all these life skills they checked charts and life skills so it was some academics and then workshops and life skills and that was you know 10 to 20 kids that are in there are what grade slash age range yeah they're gonna be from there probably second grade to fifth grade was probably the range sixth grade somewhere around there and you know and they're clustered it's sort of like the one room school house right and you know you go in and it is crazy like he's like oh they're doing spelling these and like they're walking on their hands you know they're doing handstands across the room and he's like yeah watch how they do it and literally they would you know have to buy try they try to walk across the room and handstands but recite all the words on their spelling v is doing it right and could they make it all across and the kids would just have it in a ton of fun right and I was always like are they really learning and sort of all the academics are high but you know testing showed they were and what was the state of technology what what you referred to some apps but what was the state of educational apps 11 years ago yeah there were um there were things like dreambox and uh Khan Academy was out okay so they were static I mean static in the sense that um they weren't adaptive I guess as maybe one of them or there the the the the prom with old ones and they actually even a bunch of them today is you know now we know with learning science you know all these much better ways to do it there's standards of mastery were too low their their implementation of learning science was too little you know if if you look at them but they were good enough that you could you know get your way through but back to some of the problems like when my oldest you know first took her seventh grade test um you know standardized test she failed at all you know and so sorry this is after being in the alpha program this was she had been in the alpha program and with with those apps got it and so the apps were you know janky and not all there um this is before I got involved except as a parent and you know she failed her seventh grade you know test and standardized test state standardized testing like oh wow so something there's a mismatch and there's mismatch they just you know you can use apps you know and people say how does alpha get all these results because there's a lot of people try to use these apps and you're like these apps have gaps and holes and you know figuring out how to change that was a lot of what how I got involved and you know what I've been doing the last three years so you're for a into this is obviously then in this logical way through the experience of your own kids I want to just take a step way back and talk more about education in general so I I don't think anybody listening to us now is unfamiliar with the idea although this is it's not particularly popular at the moment we have enough other things that are going on in the world that have people up and arms but it's it's sort of sickleck when people sort of look at the data and realize that the United States is not doing well in primary and secondary education um or I don't know if those are the right terms but whatever it is up to K to 12 I don't know if secondary is considered college but we start to do pretty well in college right relative to the world but but getting to college we're not doing well and it's it's it's this is further I think the the point is it's further made when you look at the dollars in to results out so I think we're spending what one billion dollars are pretty one trillion dollars on K through 12 education which is about one seventh of what the world spends and of course we don't have one seventh of the population so there's a huge mismatch there but our ROI is quite low so it's actually kind of parallels the healthcare spending thing right where we on a per capita basis we spend more in healthcare than anybody else and yet we're actually not producing the best life expectancy so let's do well on that for a moment why does the United States spend so much money on K through 12 education and maybe more importantly why are we not getting the results at least if we believe we're measuring the results correctly if the results are to be determined by these tests that all the OECD nations take yeah why are we doing so poorly that's a really complex answer but there's there's a set of which it is it is true right our academic performance continues to go down across it as an example there's this test uh NWA map test it's a nationwide test you know when I was a kid I took an Iowa test this is equivalent one you know millions of kids take it and they just updated their 2025 norm table you know the last one they did it's it's 2020 you know every five years they update the benchmark and America knows less now so your average eighth grader in 2025 knows less than the average eighth grader in 2020 which is no less than the average in 2015 yep so you can't you just blame COVID on that no like this it's going to be a new trend it's a continuing trend it's continuing going down there is one actually anomaly which is uh in both the 2021 from 15 to 20 and 20 to 25 there's one one group who actually goes up and that's your 99th percentile so the top one percent academically in America in K through 12 continues to increase right those are your Ivy League bound kids continue to go up um now but everybody else is is going down things are getting easier in tests you know the the AP tests in high school that you take you know they re-normed them in the last couple years and they normal begins college kids because it's like okay if you take an AP test that's like a college class right and so they say well what would a college kids know and they're like oh college kids no less so now our AP test is easier right and so it used to be at alpha if you were going to be the honors track you had to get a four or five on an AP now we're like oh you just need a five because the fours are too easy right just the the standards just keep going down and you know I'll give some more data just you know I just gave the academic talk we had hundreds of families at alpha across the country of campus now everywhere and you know start last couple weeks and so they all come in they take a placement test you know and I got up in front of all the parrots and I was like here's the message and it's going to worry you but you should take away that your you know 40 thousand dollar private school they've been lying to you which is if your student has an AP and you've been getting straight days on your transcript that student in our tests right is anywhere from one year ahead that's great two three years behind this is an AP student who's three years behind and when we talk about three years behind if they're seventh grader that means they're missing a significant number of questions on the fourth grade test if you're a B student you are from three years behind two seven years behind so you've been paying your title let's give an example of what this means I have a great sense of this because you know you and I have been through this together but I want the I want the listener to understand tangibly what that means let's put that in terms of something mathematical okay so let's talk about what that implies for a B student in seventh grade mathematics what concept could they be possibly missing yeah yeah well I they don't know their multiplication tables or division tables so one of the things that's happened in sort of K through 12 education is they've decided that memorization is bad and that memorizing you don't need to memorize multiplication tables any more you're just going to use a calculator you know that's not what learning science says that is not you if you're going to do higher level math you need fact fluency and if you think of cognitive load theory right you have a certain number of working memory slots and the level of complexity of the math problem you can solve is going to be based on how many slots you have and right how you're using them and you know one of the few places in in in brain chemistry is if you have memorized something to fluency it doesn't use a slot it doesn't use it and so you can do higher level math but if you have to use your slots to say seven times eight is 56 you're now trying to do higher level math and you're using it up on the wrong things so if you want to do higher level math memorize your math tables right and your division tables it's a fluency and that's like the most simple obvious thing we could do in this country is just change that right just go back to what we used to do and you're like scores keep going down and you know if you even get in and even this and this is like the most extreme example is you know we had a student who had a 740 math SAT so again just for listeners who might not be familiar with that the score is 800 so 740 would be a very good score it's very good score centile is that I'd have top 10 percent okay yeah 90 percent yeah 770 is like the top 1 percent okay maybe in top 5 percent I'd have to and so great score yeah she cannot get above it and when we we we do game well we call game film right you review why you miss the test why you miss the questions on the test right one thing as an example that's common in sports right game film people don't do this in academics for some reason so they she would just go through it she's like I know what that is you you decide was it a careless error yep did you not know the material yeah she's like after the test she could get them all done right given time and what happened was is she was overloaded and made careless mistakes when you're right working memory slots are overloaded it reflects actually in careless mistakes so if your students making careless mistakes you're like grit and discipline you're like hmm you probably don't have a fact fluency some are earlier that if you just go fix that also those carosam stakes go away so she literally went back to third grade learned her multiplication and division tables right and back to convincing parents that's really hard convincing students and parents that your 740 baths due to the third grade material she then got a 790 map after she memorized it because she stopped making the careless errors she knew all the material before she was overloading or working memory right and the learning science is like that's that's our issue and in our system we can identify that and fix it and seemingly crazy you know that you can go back and and memorize your tables and get up there and I remember another story Jo that we kind of bonded over a couple of years ago which was the student that was really struggling in uh in entry level chemistry yeah and I mean I can I I think anybody who's been through chemistry can empathize with that the first time you're doing you're going through physical chemistry and you're trying to balance the chemical equations and this this kid is dying and they think the problem is I'll never it's chemistry they problem is chemistry and you came in and said no actually the problem is fractions you didn't master fractions in third grade or fourth grade or whatever fractions are introduced and your failing chemistry because you did you for this exact reason we're going to go back and fill the gap in in fractions and this will become easy for you and of course that's what happened and math science knowledge is hierarchical right and this is back to mastery which is we've why we do poorly we've given up mastery in this country why um we're a time-based system right at the end of third grade you're moving to fourth grade and at the end of fourth grade you move to fifth grade and we don't hold kids back we don't we just we've said we're just going to move kids through no matter what um because it's time because there's all these other social issues right and you know oh my god I can't have my kid hold back the pressure on the school to relax the standards you know 80% of kids at Harvard get an A now you know it's just grade inflation you know grades look like this yeah look at these test floors look like that yeah right and it's just we've just got and for whatever reasons we've done it but in a time-based system you know and here's part just even grading you know there's this concept that you know okay you got a 70 you know you can pass and 80s a B right that's great okay my kids would be student 80 the problem is you know if you only have 80% you know knowledge you're creating all these holes and it all compounds were eventually and it starts to when you had algebra or chemistry right that you're you think it's the current material but it's your pre-rex your foundation it's your foundation and you know we talk a lot about parents because a lot of this is you know we all grew up in this time-based system and just the old system and so this new way is very different but the best analogies we always use the parents totally understand is sports right just like game film we're like have you your test figure out what's wrong master is the same one you know which is if you're the point card and you lose the ball 20% of the time going down the court the coaches and like let's the work on the advanced stuff like kids let's learn how to drip all right we don't need to worry about dunking yet correct no dunking like let's focus on right get up to 99% get to mastery that you know how to do the basics everybody in sports is like if you're not doing well go back and do the basics well academics is the same way and if you apply that same logic right but in a time-based system with a teacher in front of a classroom right you can't get every kid to mastery right and that's when we get into like the new solutions and why we get these crazy you know kids can learn tendons faster it's because we're able to get out of a non-mastery non-time-based system or a non-mastery time-based system that has a teacher in front of a classroom right teachers are great teacher in front of a classroom's bad you know that that dynamic and so but into your point hierarchical you know chemistry is just algebra with advanced word problems right physics is literally calculus with advanced word problems you know algebra is basically advanced fraction manipulation you can give kids a fraction test and predict their algebra score right and then fractions are how's your division of multiplication tables do you memorize them to fluency and so it just keeps going down the whole track you know all the way down and so part of what you have to do to fix the system right is figure out age grade oh wait I'm an eighth grader in algebra and knowledge grade wait I don't know my fractions are different and so you know what a teacher in the front of a classroom though it's not their fault right I'm a teacher I'm an eighth grade teacher what do you teach eighth grade material yeah and I have kids who don't who don't who don't know some third fourth fifth sixth seventh material what do I do right and this is why you know and so many people hire tutors you know after school at private schools right there's you know it's crazy we have all these people go to private schools and higher after school tutors because the school doesn't teach them and you know the tutors just like okay I'm gonna go give you the earlier grade level material that's it when we talk about kids all these hundreds of kids coming in who are you know three years behind seven years behind the second part of what I tell the parents is that's freaking you out because nobody wants their kid this far behind but it's so easy to fix the remediation of this stuff is no time at all that when you use these you know learning science based AI tutors and the apps that we have kids can learn ten times faster ten times faster so when you actually look at material there's 180 school days right hour a day plus homework so a couple hundred hours most of grade that one subject right per grade level takes our alpha kids between 20 and 30 hours to finish an entire grade level two mastery so you can take fourth grade math and be like you got 26 hours kid you do an hour day homework your 26 days away right 22 hours is 7th grade and 6th grade 22 each right for math and Joe would this work if and again as just as a thought experiment if each student had one teacher the private tutor if you could put a private tutor in front of a student for 22 hours over the course of you know whatever two months or one hour day for 26 days are you confident that that individual and of course we'll talk about why that's not practical but that that that individual if skilled enough could navigate and weave that child through if you give me a few more hours then what I just gave you because the AI can do a little bit better then then then most tutors but yes fundamentally the paper that was written when I was in high school about education like so learning science and we didn't you know learning science has been around for 40 years they've been writing papers there's 10,000 papers published by all the schools of education you know Stanford and you know all over the place that is we know kids can learn two five or ten times faster right we've known it in you know blues two sick blooms two sigmas as a seminal paper and he just said if everybody got a personalized tutor was his first point and second they did it to mastery they worked to master so mastery based not ten year based correct just you have to know the material before you advance yep and there's an individual tutor to coach you you will get two sigma better performance which is right your leftmost part of your curve your worst students are going to be what today is considered the top 10 percent and I have two sigma performance you said to me once four five years ago something and I'm curious if you still stand by it which is at least through the end of eighth grade there is not a single student in the United States that cannot achieve complete mastery in mathematics to score above the 90 youth or 99th percent dial in the national test yes so I think I said that to you three years ago and I would hesitate just for arguments sake take out the bottom five percent just to stop all the all right so 95 you would still say that 95 percent of all eighth graders in the United States could be what today is considered top 10 percent performance yeah they can get to mass in mathematics in mathematics yeah so just let that settle in for a moment right like that just that seems to fly in the face of everything I want to go back and close the loop on something before we continue this discussion which is I still don't have a sense of what's changing right because we've always had a time-based system not a mastery-based system so what has gone on in the last 25 years because that's not the change right what is why are why are white or scores the fundamental answer standards are lowering and part of it is parents right here's so I'll give you you know three years ago when I became principal you know I would sit down with parents and I'm like we have this cool engine it's going to teach your kid twice as much in the two hour block twice as much now they have to use the apps right and engage with it and you know your your students not using it right so they're not learning to X the parents are like yeah stop don't pressure my kid to learn to X don't pressure you know I'd be in a parent meeting it would literally be you know mom dad and Johnny and I'm like look when you know when this is a question he doesn't watch the video right or he's scrolling and just guessing if he just watched the video he'd learn twice as much and the parents is say we're not interested in that now so why are the hundreds hundreds hundreds well the rest of the things parents want life skills community a school is a bundle of which academics is one piece and for the most part in America except for less fewer than 10% like less than 10% market share less than 10% of the parents right fewer than 10% parents really care about academics that 90% of parents are like oh well and so that was an eye opener to me and hundreds of parents I mean later I literally we switched our pitch which was two hour learning the same engine because you flip the you're like it's two hour learning and look we're trying to get Johnny out of here in two hours so we can do these cool workshops and do what he loves right and that flip parents are like then all so they're like Johnny which wrong with you why don't you want to get out of here do the cool stuff and so it's it's back to you know the most important part of education is a motivated student and you know for us two X learning is not a motivating idea except for you know sort of the top kids but two hour learning is motivational for every kid on the planet right and that's if you had to say are my biggest unlock was that realization and you know the product became codename time back give the kids their time back because that is the most precious right that for 12 years we waste kids time we know that kids sitting in a lecture base classroom right retain maybe five percent that is bad it's that bad it's that bad and so like being ten times better you're like I need to remember 50 percent right it's just I there's still you know it's it's that bad we know it's that bad right it's not personalized to them it's not to a master's all these bad things and so we're wasting their 12 years and you wonder why kids don't like academics and they're in a disengage and all these things is we're wasting their time and so for this it's like great just they're gonna learn two in two hours now they're still learning two X right that's just not the part we pitch and so they're learning two X in two hours and then you free up the rest of the day and so we get all our kids right our scores at our Alpha School we're all top one percent right academically our our classes are top one percent of the country there's no school academically who's as good as Alpha you know in the country and the reason is is using this model right and we were just implementing all these concepts that were in these learning science papers for 40 years is there is there a challenge to the intensity that's required in those two hours so I give you an analogy so I get asked all the time hey Peter look I've read that you know I could just do one set to failure once a week for each body part and get most of the benefits of you know grinding it out for you know 10 to 20 sets per body part and I say luckily that's a little bit of an exaggeration but there's some truth to this right like if you could truly do one to two sets to absolute failure per exercise yeah you're gonna get great results and they're like well Peter why don't you do that and I and I say look to be honest with you it's really freaking hard to bring that level of intensity to every single set of every single workout every time you do it and there are a bunch of other reasons that I actually kind of like being in the gym or whatever but but the point is it's true you can get great results in much less time but for many people the intensity is not something they're willing to rise to right and and so I guess the similar question is if for two hours a day a kid can learn what a traditional kid is learning in six to seven hours a day and actually do it better um is there something that they have to be able to bring from an attention span perspective that is very difficult or not something that is you know yeah yeah and so the answer is it's not difficult but they have to want to do it so motivation so if you know if you talk to an educator there's two things you need you need a motivated student and you need to put them in lessons of the correct difficulty not too easy not too hard right that's back to an ed tech and why you know taking this little bit why doesn't ed tech work right back to these apps and yeah you know test scores keep going down but everybody keeps buying ed tech and the answer is ed tech does that second piece that 10% piece of put them in the right you know lessons very well our AI tutors do it even better it can figure out very easily what a kid knows and doesn't know and say age grade eighth grade knowledge grade fourth given fourth grade lessons right and so that parts great now the second part is to the point of my parent meeting how do I get them to engage with the app right because I'm spinning in the chair I'm not paying attention I'm talking to my friend it's called TikTok right I'm doing anything except focusing on it and so what is their motivation is 90 of the solution and for us that's why time back is so valuable which is the kid has to engage with the apps for those two hours or they don't get the rest of the day they don't get their time back right they'll just sit there wasting their time I mean we literally in our app have a waste meter and it just coaches the kid right the AI like what we can get in the AI's and stuff and chat bots are terrible like chat GBT rolled out to America students they 90% of kids use it is a cheap bot it's all cheating that we don't have a chat interface and ours but one of the things our AI does is it watches the kid's screen and coaches them up and is like look you're scrolling the article and guessing not gonna learn that way right you're skipping this right and it's gonna coach them of how to learn better and if you have a motivation for the students to actually learn better and be effective they're very happy to do that right we have a sports academy that we just we'd still been 10 out of around Texas and these are middle schools right D1 bound athletes you know kind of and they come in and they do the two hours in the apps right and then once they hit it you know and they go green where they've done the lessons right they get to do sports all afternoon and so you can take kids who are like I hate school I skip school you know absenteeism is huge and when they get to do that all of a sudden they're like I'm totally motivated right we it's only been a couple weeks that we've been open but you get notes from all the parents who are like my kid always was sick never wanted to go everything now he's waking me up and it's like let's not be late right and it's because they have the motivation to actually learn and so now now so that's the most important you can do that for everybody right and motivation really really does matter and it alphas designed around how do we motivate kids and the biggest motivators time back we also use a lot of other ones but that's that's the biggest thing that makes our system work and when then when you talk just is there also extra juice of the intensity right we measure do kids get through our apps 90 or 95 percent first time right right we're not making the lesson hard enough we're we want to make sure the lessons not too hard where you don't have to have too much intensity yep right now we also have what is the sweet spot is it 90 percent we 90 and 95 it's not where first time right yeah okay actually a little bit there's a thing called the zone approximation development which is what an individual student should be and you want to keep a student in 80 to 85 percent correct questions which is different than first time right I'm getting through the whole lesson you want to be in the zone approximation development which is you know if you're at 99 percent it's too easy you're not learning right if you're getting 99 percent of the questions right you're just regurgitating what you already know if you're missing and half the time or two thirds you know you're only at 50 or 60 right you get disengagement right it's too frustrating or go home out right we literally video game developers the world experts on this on engagement of how do you engage and you know they'll tell you you know always winning always learning you know and that concept in 80 to 85 percent is where that is so we're measuring you know the way to maximize learning is an unending stream of content right both educational questions right and learning content that is at 80 to 85 percent accuracy you know and and this gets into stuff that we're building is you know if you sit in a Stanford lecture you're going to retain one to five facts ideas and concepts per hour our current learning engines depending on what the subject we're at 20 to 40 you know we have stuff that we're working on where when in Gen A I is the driver of this we'll get to a hundred facts ideas and concepts in that or right think of an endlessly scroll tick-tock list except engaging and good content so the the poison that that is and so the learning science part is we know how to get knowledge into kids head 10 times better than the current educational system but it takes a whole rebuild and back to kids when they love school they're going to engage in the app because the whole day is great so let's go back and talk a little bit about education science right you've alluded to it a couple of times tell me what is what 90 percent of people would agree with right there's nothing that I was going to say tell me something that is unambiguously true about education science but but let's let's soften that a little bit and say tell me something that 90 percent of people who study education study the science of learning would agree with 90 percent would agree that individualized tutoring and a mastery based standard is the best way to teach kids right it's dramatically more effective than a time-based system that the concepts in learning science zone approximate development spaced repetition right you would get the testing effect right that actually asking kids active learning is better than passive learning right that retention of sitting passively in a classroom is the worst way to teach a kid they're going to all of those things would also really well-normed you know cognitive load theory is a new area of learning science that's you know sort of developed in the start of the 90s and this is the how many working memory slots do you have and then how many reps does it take to move from working memory slot you know short term memory based working memory slot to long term they're all going to by the way so interesting to me that this is that there's any disputor on that when you see the effects in sports like the sports illustrates that I think more than anything else um you look at the difference between like a Tom Brady versus an exceptional quarterback who's a very good quarterback and it's the it's the it's the processing speed right it's not I mean it's not how fast or how far he can throw the ball it's his processing speed that sets him apart it's it's the cognitive bandwidth of what he's doing and it's this this is I mean it's actually the same in formula one right if you look at what separates the very best in the world from very good it's it's cognitive bandwidth it's the guy who actually doesn't have to think at all about driving and can still drive at the limit while he can use all of his cognitive reserve for strategic decision making and an overtake so yeah and so like that fluency stuff just there's no there's nobody in learning science who's like it's better if they don't memorize their multiplication tables even though our school system you know has a band of that and that's that's you know private private it's not like oh these private schools are you know the private schools are bailing on it too it's not just why was that decision made back pressure you know there's parental pressure again my kid is not happy like one one of the so I there's three things I still this is another one of the sort of coddling of the yeah this is just and there's three thing to come to an alpha school now I have a conversation with parents I'm sort of fry it you know what he'd give you those two things but I've had a third a third one to it which is you know first your kid must love school right really love school and we measure literally measure would you rather go to school or go on vacation like super high standard right we should have kids love school for 12 years right and they're gonna be there your childhood why why do we not have that standard the second is your kid can learn in two hours right twice as much as sitting in class for six right your your kid can crush academics in just two hours day crush it that's the second thing you have to believe to come to alpha and the third and this is where the controversy parts but it's true you know is the key to your kids happiness is high standards right and that's the one that a lot of people do not believe that they think the key to my kids happiness is low standards and the problem with low standards I can't where did this virus come from where did where did this virus in fact well part of it is if you actually you know the parents want to protect their kids right it comes from parents from a good place which is I don't want to see my kids struggle and fail on their road to success they don't want to see that like I talk about you know the cycle as a as a principle I can tell you kids struggle fail sometimes cry on their road to success if they're supported by a caring loving adult right that loop if you ask any child development expert in the planet right you can type that all in chat to be to is the key to kids development the key to their self confidence the key to their resilience right the key to their growth that they go through a the cycle of struggle fail right on the way to success journey it's a here it's it's it's woven into every and back to your point out sports everybody why do you 50% America's like you know where my kid learns life skills and when you talk about life skills teamwork leadership grid hard work it's an actual school sports because that's what the coach does my kids going to go through that struggle and I went through it when I was playing sports and my kids going to go through that and that's where you learn it and they have this view of that's the only place you learn we do that's such an an excuse and the reason it doesn't happen in schools is because in a time-based system everybody thinks good grades equals high IQ and so it's fundamentally that IQ is what determines grades and so I don't want to pressure my kid because you know as if he's really this right it's not fair right and so I don't want to put that pressure on you know one of the magic on locks we have right back to everybody can get to you know that not higher performance right is a mastery based system you know if you take the best kids you know you like who are the kids who do get in the Ivy League right they're basically the high IQ kids who also have high conscientious and it's big five conscientiousness right they're grinders right they just they just cranked through it naturally um and those are the kids who do well and so if we're rebuilding education to fix it we have to take those two constraints away right and so a mastery based system takes away IQ which is every kid you know just the conceptual leaps that are required to get through K through eight actually by the design of common core just aren't that big that does not mean everybody can go be a nuclear physicist at Stanford and design all these things right I'm not gonna that's that's there is areas where you do need more cognitive everybody in math there's a point they reach yep just I can't do the processing but I'm poor K through eight it's designed that everybody everyone will do it everybody can do it so if you went and yet just reflect on that for a moment Joe think of all the kids that are in six seventh and eighth grade who are good students in other domains they're doing well in English they're doing well in history they're conscientious they work hard but they they've created a narrative that says I can't do math and let's I'll we'll dive into that and we'll get into the the second thing of how we on we also use our motivation model to undo the conscientious limitation you you have to use more extrinsic motivators to let people who aren't high conscientiousness still perform like somebody who does so those are sort of magic on locks on those two things that we think can fix education but you're math thing I got I got to give these examples so you know it's an epidemic of kids who come into middle school you know predominantly girls I have two daughters right who come in and they're like I'm not a math science girl and there's just like societies like accepting that and okay let's go read all the learning science papers about how middle school girls can't do math science okay there are not there's not that doesn't exist right there's no such thing but it's this total meme that they they believe and so part of what our job in middle or when they transfer in high school is to fix that right that there's this concept of oh I'm an art girl I'm an English girl or whatever it is and it doesn't grow boy there's just there's no difference and so like our we have some seniors this year you know the first one she's her big project that she does at Alphay Alphay to these big Alphayx projects she is doing the first all teen produced created musical for Broadway right she sourced all the song and song writers off TikTok she can fill a thousand person venue you know she's trying to raise it up so she can do it so she'd be you know I'm an arts theater girl right 790 math as a team we have another girl right see these are seniors she's you know trying out to be misteen USA right 790 math SAT right third girl who is doing uh this is my daughter right she has a you know uh i call her TikTok girl you know she's got millions likes on TikTok and tons of followers she's building a uh app to teach teen boys how to ask girls out on dates because teen boys are terrible dad um right top one percent at 18 math right that there's this concept that these people can't learn it you're like they all can right there's just no now what do you have to do when they come into middle school they do they don't know the milk patient tables right they don't know the pre-rex they are gonna struggle an algebra right and so you're like okay let's go back let's fill them up and all of a sudden once you fill the holes all of a sudden they can do it and then once you know algebra right you're like oh I can do chemistry right and I can move from you know it's because you can through a science there's no math actually it's all just memorizing facts you know igneous rocks and you know the planets and stuff um once you get to high school that's where you know a biology still more memorization less math but then chemistry and physics are all math based calculus and algebra and so you have to get these kids the pre-rex but then all of a sudden they're like oh chemistry is pretty fun right oh now they're in a calculus and I can crush cowpeasy all our kids in high school right if you want to be on the honest track it's five on cowpeasy right and totally doable right for everybody and so this whole thing you know our freshman coming in by the end of the freshman year they're 14 10 on the SAT right which you know 13 50's top 10 percent right these are freshman these are freshman like in most school's don't I mean that's better than most juniors seniors most don't publish their freshman results right and and we can get freshman there you know and you and and once it becomes a mastery based system how high you go becomes a decision back to your effort it's a decision not an inherent capability and so when you break that link like elf kids are just like in a mastery based system they're like oh it's just more work it's not I'm not smart enough right and that is the unlock that we have to have and why we have to move to a mastery based system because you just need kids to be like oh so if you want to be in the non honor if you're in normal alpha high right 13 50 is the minimum SAT right you gotta get to a top 10 percent if you want to be in the honest track it's 15 50 and we're just like 15 50 and that's top one percent yeah oh yeah and but it's it's just a decision do you want to do the work to get to 15 50 right from 13 50 right and so so it's just that look I'm willing to put in this many more hours this year yeah no so back to my my youngest daughter who's just took the SAT you know it's she's top one percent but she's not perfect 800 and she's like she literally was in she's asking the AI she's like how much time will it take for me to get up to the top to a perfect 800 and you know at that level it doesn't really matter for getting into college but she's like just out of curiosity she's like oh no she's like you know dad you know all those stemboys you know they think I'm this dumb ticked a girl and you know if I get an 800 I get to mow down on the rest of their life and I think it's totally worth it and so she's literally but it's just a decision she's trying to side it'll come back it'll probably be 20 hours probably I don't know some some manageable number of hours and she'll just be making a decision am I going to put the reps in right the practice in to get there right so that I can have this ego boost face that you get as you really love it or no okay you know I'm going to do something else with my time but that's where you know in these mastery based models you know versus you know in a teacher in front of a classroom model where you're a time based system you're like I don't know how to get there right there's no path up and you know when we when you log in to our system it literally tells you you know in two hours a day you know you're three years behind so you first come in you're like your three years behind it's you're like oh my god that seems insurmountable you're 20 to 30 hours per grade level so you could be 60 hours behind if you're three years behind 60 hours that's it you're 60 hours away and you're like so if I do an hour homework so then some there I'm caught up yeah I'm caught up and now back to incentives there's some kids are like do I care that I'm caught up but it's easy to incentive to want to catch up right and you can figure out okay what do we have to do you know one of the things we one of the things else is don't for whether infimously or not is we use extrinsic motivators right to drive yeah use money you pay a good time back is the most important one it's more important than money is you know sort of the you know the West Lake track we got to do you know honors track where it's you know six hours day and eight zillion homework hours I don't think you can pay a kid enough to like love school by going through that versus you know we're two hour actually and just because we're two hours a day for a non-honors track we're three hours a day for honors back at the 1550 it does take more time but we will take middle school kids like this is there's a middle school active program kids come in and we will pay them $1,000 to get to top one percent and you know there's a lot of stories right around this where kids view look I can't do that it's not okay I'm not the smart kid I'm like the math science girl I can whatever it is and well if you get there and do these lessons and we're just going to keep giving lessons and you do the work you're going to get $1,000 you know you're the will pay kids right coming in middle school $1,000 to get to top one percent and the point of this is you know what's even more important than the academic knowledge it's their internal view of themselves that changes that kids come in and say I'm not a math science girl I can't be a top one percent I can't do this whatever limits they have and a lot of education when you talk about it is you know holistically you're trying to take limits in kids and release them right have them understand your limitless you can do all this and this is the best way academically we've found to do it and so they come in and the AI is going to say here's all the lessons you need to do to get top one percent and just go through them and that motivation will get all these kids to top one percent and the number of stories we have you know I have one my own daughter but all you know the alpha families where their student is like they come back and they're like I didn't realize I could be top one percent and my personal self confidence in view of myself that I had to do hard work right you had to do the work right now I'm you know I and then once you take a middle school kid just top one percent as they go into high school they're not going to give it up because and there's this mental view of oh I guess I am a smart kid right or I'm a capable kid right and that unlock is so valuable and so for us that's when you know we think you know juicing it with money I mean we spent 20 grand a kid in this country per student right and you're like in middle school give a kid a thousand dollars in order to have them realize there is that the height there's no limit why does why would most people I assume listening to us have sort of an uneasy feeling about that like they can't reconcile what you just said which is well-weighted and on the one hand I know we're spending twenty thousand dollars per year per kid on these kids and we're getting nothing for it and you're proposing we give them a couple of those thousands of dollars strategically to incentivize half of the equation which is them having the motivation to do this and yet that's going to make a lot of people feel uneasy why so there's a view that there needs to be an intrinsic love of learning for it to be pure and that if you it has to be intrinsic not extrinsic and that if you're buying it it's solid and not good right it's just it's wrong it's fundamentally wrong and you know and that is a common view are there any data that would support one view being favorable to the other how would that be tied there there is a set of papers that have been written that show that you know if somebody is not intrinsically motivated or is intrinsically motivated and you pay them they lose intrinsic motivation now that's not the case that we're sitting with we're have kids who aren't motivated who aren't intrinsically going through it right they need the boost and if you actually ask alphacids and maybe we'll do a study someday no parent who has their kids at alphacix my kids lost their intrinsic motivation if anything it's the opposite because now they think they're and those papers don't talk about is how much of the issue was I didn't think I was capable I now realize I am and I get this crazy intrinsic boost around it right I my younger star or again would be this example which is you know she came in to middle school you know at that she hit top 10 percent and to write the end of eighth grade sorry this was before this is going in seventh grade okay she was top 10 percent coming in so she'd been there but she's like that I'm not like my older sister I'm not top one percent right that's just not who I am right I'm ticked off girl you know if we're gonna and I was like you know you know what I know you know love more than anything it's shopping and all bet you $1,000 that you can't get to top 1 percent and so she literally would fill her a Amazon cart with $1,000 stuff and in the morning she'd then look and look at the lessons she had to go through and she'd do it right she just grind through it now back to this thing it's you know we had a lot of family discussions around this because my wife she was like wait there's two things and this is most parents are or like this there's two things you're one you're setting one percent top one percent and most parents like that's too hard right and you know why are you putting that pressure you know for on on the kid and number two it doesn't feel right to pay a thousand bucks to get this this is just we're all brought up that there's something wrong and so and but back to the thing so she does it she has top one percent I really buy his but then she sits down right with my wife and she's like mom I know you didn't like us doing this but you need to understand what this is done for me which is I never thought I was as smart as my older sister and now I realize I can do everything right that she can do and it's totally changed my internal view right and that element there of right her and now back she's also the one now it was top one percent on the SAT tried to decide if she wants to do the extorque to get perfect score right that there that change in their view of their capability that unlock is so valuable and I believe we should do this for every kid in America right that but that's the dynamics of why people don't like it and it's you then just have to decide if you can use extrinsic motivation whatever it is I'm concert ticket by right go shopping whatever whatever mode of screen time video game time whatever it takes to get the kid to realize I can go be and learn all this and be top one percent when I previously didn't think that right and I go through that struggle fail sometimes cry I have the road to success loop that then unlocks my human potential and right the point education beyond academic right you're trying to unlock human potential and this is just a great easy way to do it and it's not failed in times the system yeah that's the thing you know it does is not necessarily something that has to happen indefinitely it's it's what I when I think makes sense here is that it's it's an unlock that then creates a new state of awareness that therefore becomes self-perpetuating right in many ways it's like the kindling that leads to the fire you don't need kindling indefinitely sometimes you need kindling exactly that I think that's I'm gonna steal that from you because that's a great way to think about it which is I'm not paying her to decide to go get a perfect score on RSAT I don't need the extra right it's intrinsic right it's her decision to her capability she just needed that kindling to jump started and whatever block was in the month right you're all right good coaches like how do I unblock them and that's what this does you know and since we're on this of paying I'll give you my my second one which if I um the Secretary of Education's coming down next week to meet with Kenzie around Alpha stuff and if there's one thing to fix education in America just the what's the simplest unlock it would be this which is and it's all around wholefilling and paying kids which is so when I first started um I wanted kids to go back and wholefill right we call wholefill I go back and do your pre-rex and so I'm sitting down with seven graders the boys and I my guys you could get a hundred percent before that I'm sitting down with them and you know it does not motivate us to a seventh grader doing fourth grade no kid wants to do that right no one wants to be going back and the only people who want it less than the kid are their parents yeah their parents are like every parent America has been trained my kidneys be a great level right which once again the learning science is right that is not right get your kid to master the basics and if it's previous material give it to him and so I and I tried to convince parents look you kid these wholefill we're going to get this thing whole thing working and stuff and I base again it up giving up on the parents and so then I went to the seventh graders and I was just like okay here we go guys you could get a hundred on the Texas star you know our state test they're like no way Mr. Lee what I'm like no no all in Sanctuary I'll give you a hundred dollars bill for a hundred on the test they're like that's still impossible I'm like no no there's a catch any grade level they're like I can take a kindergarten Texas star and you're giving me a hundred bucks I was like well it starts in the third grade they're like I'm in they take the third grade Texas star they get a hundred I give a hundred dollar bill they're like a fourth grade I'm like absolutely same thing hundred get a hundred by fifth grade they're running and take out 75 85 right they get 75 85 they're the schools and I'm like well do you want the AI tutor to generate the lessons you missed and they're like well let me see how many of it it's they're like I can do that in a week they're in right get the hundred then you know on the way six and then seventh grade and for four hundred dollars four hundred dollars and you can get up to grade level up to grade level but more importantly they all think they can get and know they can get a hundred on the state test which used to be only the GT kids and smart kids get it like if you survey incoming alpha parents and say can your kid get a hundred on the Texas star fewer than 10 percent say yes they can after you've been at alpha year 90 percent of kids are like I can totally get a hundred on Texas star because they've done it right our building you know over there you know gets more hundreds on the Texas star than a school district of a hundred thousand kids right and it's just because we have a mastery based system where you tell them so our advancement now in this built-in door system is we'll actually advance a kid if they get over 90 right what is our mastery standard it's in the 90s so you have to score in the state test above the 90 to move on to the next grade level material but we also have a hundred for a hundred and so the kids are like okay well I guess I'm just gonna get the hundred because I want to get the hundred dollar bill and so you have this concept where and it just changes and where I could advance that's an interesting experiment in and of itself it's it's sort of what we would call a natural experiment because it's not randomized which is if the kid is motivated basically just to do the bare minimum right they're going to just take the 90 right and so you so and if you make it a hundred it's just back to there's a little reality of bringing your parents and everybody along with you on the crazy journey we're on and so that hundred it lets us out of it which is you know when you get to the higher material and you've done 90 our apps still couldn't go back and fill those 10 percent because it's the best way to learn but it just get them advanced let them go and and do that but the hundred the kids all just do it because they know they can and it just gets the right mindset going which is why our kids literally for the SAT everything you know oh you can't get perfect scores they're like it's just some extra work right I five's on apes people like that seems impossible like oh how many hours is it right it takes 75 hours to go through like ap world history or ap uh u.s history it's 75 hours and they're like oh I got you know 15 hours left to get a five and so you just change the concept that these you know now there's some upper bound where there is you know conceptual understanding and everybody can't get there but k through a curriculum what would change education in America we can totally do this so let's now talk about the the AI piece which we haven't really explicitly talked about and then you you you you said something to me once that I think was actually remarkable which you you compare to medicine right you compare education to medicine in terms of an unlocks so so talk a little bit about that you know if you go back you know to um the sciences right and whether it's biology or medicine chemistry physics all of these had periods in the wilderness I'm sure doctors bloodlighting and things like this but there was the invention of an instrument right in each of those that allowed more precise measurement that unlocked and inflected the science right and medicine had theirs I don't know which one you thought I think I yeah when when I've heard you discuss this I think it's the light microscope if you were going to talk about one instrument that took us from what would what I described as the dark ages of medicine 1.0 into medicine 2.0 which is where we are today that inflection point came primarily around without the light microscope it couldn't have happened some of crg wrote very eloquently about this in his most recent book The Cell but basically until we could actually start to see microscopic organisms we couldn't really handle germ theory right and until we could eradicate germ theory we couldn't really live past about 40 on average right there were just too many people dying too young and so that one piece of technology unleashed an entire change in the way medicine has been practiced which of course has spread out far beyond infectious diseases but but that's I think it's impossible for me to imagine a scenario whereby we are alive today in the way we are without that right so and so when you when you look at AI that learning science these papers have been written for 40 years but they all start with this doesn't work with the teacher in front of a classroom time-based model right you need to change it up so you had the solution you had the conceptual solution for the last 40 years on how to fix education right but there's been no technology to make it up you can't you have a microscope you haven't had a microscope and AI is finally that microscope because of a couple things the first is you know before you know your effect size when you put an experiment you know into a classroom you're like well is the teacher teaching it correctly you know is it you know using space repetition correctly are the students engaged you know do they have the pre-reacts you just don't know and so your environmental variables dominate your effect size and with AI right you get two things you get absolutely precise teaching you know exactly what is being told to the kid and then second you have this closed loop measurement you can measure what do they know and what they don't know and so you know the pre-react you know all of it and then you can create you can do science you can create this closed loop so our system right we rolled out our new system time back you know to the student to to all our all our students this year a couple weeks ago and like our math curriculum we believe this year is going to be uh better kids will learn more in 20 percent less time and we know that because we've been measuring it and we looked on last year's math and we're able to say okay we have this idea okay the kids what percent learned were they 95 percent right how long did it take each kid to go through the lesson what do we need to change what learning science concept can we put in the lesson right that's going to then allow them to learn better and faster and what's going to change the scheme of their brain you know not cramming but really understanding this and then okay they took the standardized test oh look it did work right and you can just create this closed loop system where you're able to do science right and that but nobody else has that and that's the that's the problem right is we need to create that system but to do that you have to give up like the most treasured notion in the world which is the key to good education is a teacher in front of a classroom right one of the things that's true about education you know 200 years ago before there was tutors right yeah you know soccer teams and play it on Aristotle and Alexander the Gray and all the lead had tutors right and then 200 years ago like we have to educate everybody the only way cost effectively to do that is teacher in front of a classroom and that is all any of us know our parents know our grandparents know we've all been in that and it did great things because at scale we have educated people that never would have been educated before because what fracked I mean I would have I wouldn't have been one of the two dirt ones correct right and it is and you can go to the poor school district in India and there's a teacher in front of a classroom not very nice building you can go down to whatever private school that started in your $50,000 teacher in front of a classroom in a very nice building but that model is all we know and we think and great teachers matter and this is always the part with our new model and AI tutors that I I want to take a second here because people get freaked out adults 20 years from now parents are gonna drop their kids off at a building and in that building are gonna be other kids and adults and those adults even call them teachers guide coaches whatever you want you know we think the day will be very different but that concept of a school with teachers and other students that's not going away we're not moving to this AI robot terminator you know whatever that's not that's not what's coming kids are gonna you're gonna drop the kids off at a school and it's gonna now if we do our job right you don't sit in class for six hours a day and have this miserable experience it kids love it and all of those but back to the the science of it we now with AI right can have a one-on-one relationship the AI knows what is the kid know what are they not know how do I give them this lesson and if you look and if you want to talk just about where we're headed the futures even you know gen AI is changing everything that was the the part for me that I saw which is I can craft personalized lessons for every kid that takes into account you know what goes into the L.A.L.A.M. sort of on the technology side you have what what are you trying to teach them what's the curriculum what is their knowledge graph what do they know and what do they not know what is their interest graph right what do they interested it because actually if I know your interest I can engage it oh you want to learn baseball I mean you love baseball and you want to learn stats I'm an internment and that and kids are gonna get engaged to it oh you're the fashionista who's you know I'm gonna teach you fraction is the app already able to do what you just describe so where we are today in 2025 we generate static content with human review because we still have too many hallucinations okay and so we're not we're not there now in 2022 we expect we'll be able to do it there is one meaning just to make sure I'm putting this in perspective so my eight-year-old who is that kid who loves baseball yeah and all he does is talk baseball stats he's a literal he is a walking baseball statistic do you know so and so hit 326 that the this many homeruns and do you know he was able to hit 477 feet above above so he will be able to get to know his AI tutor they will figure out in short order that the way to his heart is baseball and anything that you can teach in baseball terms he's fixated exactly and AI will be able to give him a lesson to pursue mastery but under the guhyes of baseball under baseball amazing and it's just and we all know this which is you're always that's what teachers are always trying to do is how do I get what the kids like and associate with it but at scale you don't have 30 kids who like all the same thing you know etc so here's an example what you can actually do today there's if you we have so static you know you have hallucinations and so you don't you don't want to release those yet but we have a dynamic reading generates called teach tales and the goal of this is to get kids to love to read so if you take a third grade boy it's like I hate books right I hate books I'm not book guy and you're like what's your favorite movie the Avengers who your soccer buddies okay and you create the AI generates a choose your own adventure where you're saving the world with your soccer buddies and you know they have to keep the key to age be an Avenger and each be one and literally in the lexile level right the difficulty goes up it knows right so it's keeping you in the zone approximate development within 10% of you know what you know your lexile level kids will sit there and click for an hour right just totally in game non-stop reading non-stop and just all of a sudden you know because we do have a reading problem in this country people don't read books and all the things this is the kind of thing where Gen AI is going to be able to suck kids in right and you know our competition is fortnight in TikTok right and we need to use things like Gen AI to create such compelling content for kids that's related to what they care about that also teaches okay I gotta teach your fractions but we're doing this baseball thing so you're fine right you love that you know there's a whole program that a lot of people in finance where you know and there's actually program where they have a mother daughter thing back to a different way to try to solve it without an AI tutor where there's all these finance moms who teach their daughters poker in middle school and they're like I'm gonna get them into poker to teach all these skills and the math skills and all the things that aren't being taught in my school but with us we can get that engagement level where the kids are interested in it and to give you a couple of examples and I'll use some of our high school kids so you know when you transfer into you know alpha high your knowledge of history is very limited which is if it's in the musical Hamilton you know it occurred and if it didn't occur you know it's not in a song in Hamilton you don't know it you know because we don't teach history very much anymore and but all the kids know Hamilton they'll sing songs so our our US history AP world history they literally used AI they did this on their own it wasn't our stuff they used AI to generate here's all the facts you know there's nine units in US history for each unit they created a song and they said give me all the facts that I need to know for this unit and they pumped into sumo which is an available you know song generator and they got they created just their own album of songs and they all would just sit around and sing the songs and you know learn the facts that way and do it in a way they all were very interested in right and they all got five's on their AP because you can do it to mastery and and so Jenny I is going to allow us to create this awesome dynamic content that's relatable you know and focused on what or applicable to what kids want the other part is you know there's learning science concept also bells event frameworks of you know the fastest way to learn is basically analogy and so do you have a knowledge graph right this is the A in the ABC so so Dean Schwartz's book which I guess people were going to link to that in the show notes goes through A to Z everything that learning science has come up with exactly right so he has so Dean Schwartz from Stanford right school education one of the leaders in the field right his written a book and he's like here it is you know um and every letter has a different one but this one A is analogies and other ones are remember and analogies right where that's the fastest way to learn and so if you know what a kid knows like part of we have a content team when I talk about those hundred facts ideas and concepts for our what they're using as reference is they're using TikTok memes as because kids know TikTok right and they know what's on TikTok you know like well let's take what we're trying to teach them and use something they already know and that's actually the fastest way to have kids learn concepts and so those are all coming then even when you talk even further the part we don't have in yet but you know our our team's working on it is we also take into account we will be taking into account the cognitive load right of the brain which is we know we're going to be able to create a lesson that where we know how many working memory slots you have we know what you know to fluency and what you don't and we're not going to give you a question that's going to overload your working memory or we also know how many reps you need right and GT kids need fewer reps and so we're not going to bore you by giving you too many reps to memorize it conversely we're going to make sure you have enough reps if you need them and so this personalized learning where you're generating the content dynamically um I is going to be just as crazy unlock for these kids um and you know five years from now I was going to look back and be like okay obviously you know kids can learn 10 times faster you know it's we're we wake up every day and they're just like you know it's like neo in the matrix right where that's a physical upload ours is right using learning science concepts kids can learn 10 times faster and when you think about that you have 12 years right you've 12 years to fill your kids head with cool stuff knowledge right because they have to hang out in that right in their brain for the necessary life and we've allocated 12 years to fill it up we just need two hours a day a 10 times faster and all the kids can have more stuff and more cool stuff about stuff they like in their heads to mastery level levels none of us is as parents could ever imagine right and still give the kids their time back for the rest of the day to do all other things about three years ago you sort of decided like the you know you got to step out of trilogy right like it's this incredible company you've built um or any of your co-founders still there I think it's your you're you're sort of are they no so I people who've been so three years ago sort of the transition was when Gen A I came out right which three years ago neural nets are here yeah finally and you know that was an unlock for me where I had seen the kids he's great school and seen you know my kids in there and there were issues like my daughter failing or seventh grade tests and stuff where the apps are good enough you know and all those issues and I'm like Gen A I will allow us to take the magic of alpha make it better and scale it to a billion kids right because there's lots of good educational things that just don't scale yep and so what this was was my realization this was your white microscope this was it light microscopes here okay I've been doing software so I went to my team who've been there for 25 years so my guys for 25 years you've been telling me you're better than me we'll see I'm gonna go be a principal and so they run it you know I'm now you know chairman and I am now literally the worst shareholder you've ever seen because I'm like guys I need more cash flow I need more dividends to fund this whole thing you know the kids you need through a million dollars to open up all these schools you know where we're gonna you know get it for or so so how much of your money have you spent on this now so I took on three years ago I took a billion dollars out of trilogy sort of as my first lump sum and said I'm gonna go use this billion dollars to figure out what I can with education and fix as much as I can now what's crazy about that is a billion dollars is not enough to fix education it's a trillion dollar industry and we obviously have made incredible headway but we have to go back to building schools right back to McKinsey she's opening up you know 25 schools 25 alphas around the country right she needs hundreds of millions of dollars for that we're opening up these sports academies which needs hundreds of billions we're opening up 500 gifted talented schools right so you know the total capex that's gonna be required the second part is I'm gonna do this the next 20 years right I got 20 years in this right my job is to go fix education right and make get it to a billion kids and give kids their time back right change change use the light microscope use AI to totally change the first 12 years of you know a billion kid now at what point jode of the two systems have to merge because one of the reasons that you're having to deploy such insane amounts of capital is because you're basically rebuilding things that are technically already there and we have buildings we have schools we have guides they're called teachers we have all those things but you're creating a new system of infrastructure but I assume you don't want to scale you don't want to have to build the scale to a billion at some point this way has to merge with the existing way that's what point does that merger take place well my view is there's a point of if I had perfect randomized controlled trials with you know back to a billion kids I don't know I do any 10 million kids going through it for everybody be like okay this looks like it works but the bar is so low I mean I guess that's the thing that's amazing to me right when I think about places in medicine right where massive clinical trials are necessary to to change the direction of something usually when the state of play is so bad so let's let's talk about an example which again I don't use this example to be offensive to people that are within education but like let's look at HIV in the 80s and early 90s it was a death sense like the bar was pretty darn low when heart therapy highly active anti-retroviral therapy came out in 95 or 96 and that I mean that's it like boom which changed the protocol now of course pharma is easier than education in the sense that it's you know a simple intervention it's a you know but who's pushing back right when you say hey guys what if we just prove this out in a million kids right like why do I need 10 million kids well especially if they're spread out over abroad enough socio-economic background exactly and so back to that's my sort of our next phase right and why I'm doing my first podcast in 20 you know years is that uh there's a lot of there's a lot of impediments to it let's go back to that discussion of parents don't care about academics so we'll start there and I will do that second believability there's been a tech pitches right everybody every five years Ed Tech's gonna solve the world and you know technology's always gonna solve the world and it doesn't solve it and so there is good well our natural skepticism yeah so let's just go let's just take it right evil billionaire tech guys trying to fix education are the right to meme no it's a meme like a make a movie and so the skepticism should be super high right and it is and so that's part of what the job is and why it takes a billion dollars to we have to go prove it across every right across everybody and in a broad way so completely agree with that but let's talk about some of the problems with it which is you know let's talk about academics right here in Austin right there's there's been three failing middle schools in Austin right and you know I look if I was a super intended of a school or principal of a public school I mean like I want to be really clear that's like a hundred times harder job than mine because you know I'm a product guy people who come to my school are aligned with what I'm building in my offering because it's you get selection effects yeah people come to out for like I know I'm gonna have a screen time for two hours because you don't come right but at public school you know you get what your schools are F's for five years they're not educating the kids and the superintendent you know you made his first proposal whatever months ago he's like well I want to shut these schools and we have these A's better schools right by the kids just go to the school or the kids are learning you know and literally the protests that have been from parents you know and it's you know and you listen to them you know and you know it's the mom who's just like look I know that seventh grade math teacher she'd probably not teaching math very well but my older daughter had her and that she changed her life and so you know what and my kids can walk to school and it's community and so if they don't learn seventh grade math so much so what and so the you know the superintendent you know he's you know you if you take into account community feedback which is supposed to all of a sudden your parents are like I care about other things because schools are bundle and so that makes this hard so there's one just do they even want it the second is obviously just skepticism of this doesn't really work and you know why don't we do randomized control tiles or pharmaceutical caliber stuff with education because there's all these ideas of work we we have a lot of ideas that we're rolling out like no multiplication tables that somebody should have done it's control tile to realize that's a really bad idea right and so all these fads in education because it's not science right the learning science is not if you actually ask one of the scariest data points if you want this go there's three million teachers in the world they're not taught learning science they're not taught learning science and so you know these concepts will be new to them and so back to how do we fix it we have to go teach all the all the teachers about learning science do you get push back on that point do you get I mean how much time do you spend talking with the teachers that are in the trenches right now um I'll give you an analogy for my world right so you know I talk about this idea of medicine three point out right so we're do medicine two point I was been amazing like it's an amazing run you and I wouldn't be alive without it literally we would be dead by now but I would argue like it's time to move on we've plateaued like we gotta do medicine three point out right we have to unlock the next thing um but when I say that I'm not being critical of the doctors who practice medicine two point out because I haven't met many of them who wouldn't in a heartbeat say look I wish I could do medicine three point out but the system I'm in doesn't allow it I can't get reimbursed to practice medicine three point out the entire system of billing and coding and diagnostics and prescribing it's all predicated on this system it's predicated on make the diagnosis for the disease treat there's no prevention I don't get paid to nor do I have the education to learn about nutrition exercise all these other things that are necessary medicine three point out but if I could wave a magic wand my bet is 80% of them would be like if there's a way to fix the system in the structure such that I can be balancing my practice between two point out and three point out I do in a heartbeat do you have a sense have you got enough reps with teachers to understand if you had the that proverbial magic wand how many of the superintendents in the teachers would say oh my god I'd love to be to transition from being a front of the classroom teacher to an in the classroom guide who's helping the student with the AI with their personal AI tutor correct so the answer is it is at least 80% of the same example which is you're on the same tree no no because we have you know our guides right they're ex teachers right I mean and we got into this whole name naming thing but you know do you call them teachers if they're not doing academics and and what whatnot but fundamentally you know when they tell their story of what they do all day and let's just talk about teachers specifically right teachers are great and critical and teacher in front of the classroom is bad right that's and it's the but you're a point it's the system that's not very huge analogy it's the same thing where you know teachers right they got into teaching to transform kids lives they did not become a teacher to grade the seventh grade science test right and so let the AI do the seventh grade lesson in the science test and you connect with your kids right your students so during our two hour blocks we do 25 minute pulmetoros right our guides ex teachers who don't they're not in front of the class lecturing they literally take the kids one on one you know and say hey don't you you know your language today comes sit down and talk to me for 25 minutes how was your weekend how the softball turned ago hey you don't see them is motivated lately what's going on and they connect with them right and there are the ones right our guides do to right they provide motivation and emotional support they set high standards and high support they're the ones guiding these kids right through the journey and that's why teachers became teachers right they didn't I want to write a lesson plan nobody woke up and said that's why I'm becoming a teacher they did it because they want to transform kids lives and that's what this new model does right and so when they see it they love it right so that's what you know we you want to pay more but also the teachers see our model and once they really understand it and talk to our existing ones they're like this is awesome I love this and so there isn't resistance now at the systems level you know so I've talked to a lot of superintendents and they're like what do you want me to do with this what might be supposed to do they're like to our what are the kids do the rest of the day right this is the problem this when you talk about it this is a rebuild around the school day yep it's not six hours a day in class right with teachers right it's been classroom hours a day of learning in the screen and four hours a day of life skills and we're short and all the sorts of other things that are going to be imperative to create well balanced kids right and your life skills curriculum is leadership teamwork storytelling public speaking right relationship building socialization right grit and hard work entrepreneurship financial literacy right those things and they're doing workshops in the afternoon right they're you know this is if you go to McKinsey's Instagram it's you know kids climbing rock walls you know in kindergarten or they're running five k's in second grade or the fifth graders launched a food truck you know and so there's all these different things run in tough mutters eighth or eighth graders you know do that stuff and so you're like if you're a superintendent like okay my system's not set up for this it's right there's just there's no end right now there's no demand from the parents because it's it's not true for obvious yeah and even and let's even get out of public school okay let's go just talk about super high-end private schools right you can go down the street and try to get convinced the super high-end private school and say you have all the flexibility you want there's no vote there's nothing you should transform and they're like oh my this seems like a bridge too far right and so that's why my my view of my job so is that why essentially alpha exists as an independent school at the moment is you just need to get the scale of holy owned alpha's that that build this out and at some point the others probably the private schools have an easier time joining the model yeah and and and and eventually the hope is of course the the public schools do so as well it's everybody yeah so I got 20 years and I got to get a billion kids so you got to you know 89% of kids are in public school you got to get it to public school and provide it to everything but what is the current cost to you could I'm sure you're hemorrhaging and losing money at the moment what is the current cost to deliver the education to a to a child and does it vary by their grade like a middle school period and so for alpha our job is and that's why we're opening across country in every city there's going to be this alpha exemplar at the high-end where you're like this is what's possible now it's also one where it's money no object it's really expensive and back to the things today my AI I'm using the latest models is you know we're real time streaming video to coach kids you know it's 10,000 bucks kid and so it's $1 per kid per year in just AI just in the AI cost so just your day so much now I absolutely believe in our our teams going to deliver it where you know sometime in the next three years maybe five you know everybody on the planet will have a tablet that's less than a thousand dollars that will teach them everything they need to know in two hours a day or less and the compute will be what do you think it'll be local it'll be local yeah so you'll be on device like a lot of our stuff right now is vision models yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there's on device and the all the hardware manufacturers are putting their AI chips on device where we'll hit that wow and so you know and I'm sure there's still be some stuff in the cloud for higher-end stuff but you what the common core curriculum through eighth grade on device less than a thousand dollars that's absolutely coming and then and then then the second part is you know in part of what alpha is is because it's this high-end expensive stuff you like let's re-invision what a school is from the ground up right so we set around you know I'm a product I'm like what makes what would make a school ten times better than you know old school that we went to you know and so we we sort of have five dimensions that we do when the first is kids must love school and we literally measure more than vacation like that has to be it and we get 50-ish percent of kids depends on the vacation depends on the workshop it's really good 50% of kids were like yeah I want to go to school instead of vacation I plenty parent who will my highlight as a principal was you know in in May this year two thirds of the high school kids sent me a note and they're like can we keep alpha high open this summer because we don't want to take a summer break as we love what we're doing right the girl doing it or you know Broadway music she's like this is I want to keep on just going doing it right and so you know we're you know back to my world where I was not in school it was you know shirking and my dad you know I'm like make a place where kids love school and vacation is good standard number two kids need to learn 10 times faster we just we need an engine that teaches kids 10 times faster and so our AI tutor based on learning science teach just kids 10 times faster right and between five and ten we'll get it up and you know so that's the second part so that you can then that gives you the chance to give the time back the third dimension of a school is what are if you academics isn't everything right to developing kids everybody knows that what are the life skills that every parents has that is what I wish I knew and some are you know traits behavioral traits I hope they they are love learning in our self-driven learner right you want things like that and I want somebody who uplift others in his classroom and behavioral is an independent person others are like those ones I talked about where you're like no I want entrepreneurs and is them in financial literacy or I want storytelling public speaking those those type skills and so the third is have that curriculum of skills the suite of skills that every parent wants so we actually have spent you know the last three years developing life core right the common core curriculum for life skills that because I have four hours of data fill right with all this awesome stuff the kids can do and it's just amazing what they do like if you take atomic habits right that book of one percent better most people don't read that till after college right and then they're like oh this is the way I can really develop last year you know our guide face second grade you know she sat down and she was working on her her workshops you know in her life skills she's like you know what I want to teach atomic habits called the second graders because the concepts they all can understand and she's like you know how I'm going to do it I'm like she's like I'm going to have all our second graders run a 5k in under 35 minutes and that interest I'm like oh no okay the parents are not going to like that right that's too hard back to high standards they don't want struggle fail it where's that road just success part and what percent are going to make it and so I was she's like don't worry it's told I can do this she was a UT athlete and she's like we totally can do it she was like a head cheerleader whatever she's like everybody can do this and so she sits down with the second graders first day and is like who who can run a 5k and they're like that's impossible miss fate the parents all are like that's a possible it's face she's like why sign you all up for the jingle 5k you know what to do me and so she goes out to the track in the first day they walk it and they walk 5k she's like okay so we all will stab but she's going to finish the race right and then the next time they ran a quarter lap walk the rest next time half a lap walk the rest and buy December right all the kids are running the race right and you know when they cross the finish line just that achievement back to the key to kids happiness is high standards that's a really high standard but they loved it and they did have to struggle and go through and learn this but they also learned that life skill of 1% better right and so the second graders like dad I can do anything I can do 50 pushups I'll do one today and two tomorrow and you know build up and that skill that life skill we don't teach kids in school it's a great life skill to have and if you have half the day you can do that so that's the third element of like how do you build a great a great school the fourth element in this gets to the teachers what would make a teacher 10 times better than what it is today and the answer is well not grading science test all day and you know writing lesson plans but instead connecting it's meant to be the kids right and so we ask here's the questions we ask you know the students and the parents which is to kids you know you know kindergarten really do you love your guide right and but you know as you get older it's every adult had one or two teachers who transform their life right back to that is your guide that for you right and that is what our guides right that is the expectation that they are the ones that the students are like you are helping me achieve things that I didn't think is possible miss Faith you told me taught me how to do the impossible right and so that right that level and actually then you know at the parent side this gets into you know doctor Yager you know has a book 10 to 25 right child psychologist development expert and it's you know from kids how to what matters for kids right from 10 to from 10 years old to 25 right and his whole theory mentor mindset you know high standards high support the the heart most parents are not high standards and high support which is what really matters to develop kids they're either low standards high support that's what happened all our expectations or they're the inverse high standards no support you know this would be your classic you know Tiger mom would be you know good luck figured out right in the real answer for child development you need both high standards high support and so that's our guide but the question we asked parents in middle and high school right back to having what's a school re-invisioning it it's like do you trust your alpha guide to hold high standards for your kid so you as the parent can provide the unconditional love and support right which transforms for those who have lessons it transforms your relationship where you don't have to be the naggy parent for the high the high standards you know my daughter my oldest daughter you know she's writing her college essay and I'm like you want to let me read it and she's like no right no interest in that yeah she's got she's got a taken care of and got someone else and for me I was super relaxed because I was like I know Chloe right back to our guide right she's a Harvard grad I know she was totally high standards for for my daughter and I know it's going to be fine and I don't have to get a fight about it or whatever I'm just like okay yeah I can get my daughter a hug and be like good luck right and so that transforms what teachers can be right versus I'm delivering those seventh grade lessons and so you know and then the fifth dimension that we talk about is the seas character community classmates and culture and these are also the hardest parts to measure but at the end they're what parents care about the most right which is at the end of the day all those other you don't character right is do I have a good kid did I raise a good kid right and is the school helping me make right raise a good kid and so those elements are what we looked at and said now that you want to re-invision school right from the ground up here's the dimensions and so alpha's trying to be the exemplar you know for for all of it and then the question is okay how do we get the price point down right so we have opened a whole set of different schools right a half the price of alpha right so alpha depends on its location is between forty and seventy five thousand dollars right but we've opened other scholarship programs tons oh so tons so we have a huge scholarship so you know we have a school down in Brownsville right where it's a second poor school district we have in Texas Brownsville's a second poor school district in the country you know and at that school it's you know SpaceX is there it's so star bay so you have much space ex kids and then we scholarship all the locals to come in and it's we're sixty forty fifty fifty between that make up and to be clear they all learn to exit two hours you're right there's not a right back to where we we tested it out it works with all kids so I want to read you something that is fits right into this so this is I think I read this in New York times before kindergarten the children of the affluent are much more likely to be in preschool by sixth grade students in the richest school districts are four grade levels above children in the poorest school districts that's just by sixth grade by high school richer kids average reading skills are five years ahead of poorer kids by college according to a 2017 study by Raj Chetty children from the richest one percent of earners are seventy seven times more likely to go to Ivy League schools then children from families making thirty thousand dollars a year or less um the academic gap between the affluent and less affluent is greater today than the achievement gap between white American and black American kids in the final days of Jim Crow in other words might read of this is that there is no greater predictor of academic success and failure than the wealth of your parents so are you really suggesting that that could be wiped out wiped out I there's always relative versus absolute and I believe we can raise the absolute standard right and maybe it's always an arms race and you know that and so but if you said today can we take we're people this right years behind instead of the gap being seventy seven x could that gap be twenty point two x you know what 100 percent and the back to that issue because here's what what happens right you're in a rich school district right and I was up in New York and you know these are seventy five thousand dollar private schools teacher in front of a classroom but every one of those parents also is spending seven hundred and fifty dollars an hour on a tutor after school because the school was in teaching them back to that problem but an extra seventy five grand tutoring them hundred and fifty grand a year right and you're right yeah you need the tutor who's going to go back and fill the holes and stuff and know if I am in a school district right and I'm a poor school district I'm not I'm not I don't have the tutor I don't have the access to that right you know if you look in after covid right the number one intervention you know a lot of government funding was spent this was high dosage tutoring everything knows this right it's not a secret it's just it's expensive to get if you know individualized tutoring and there was a study that came out a few weeks ago or a month ago that was like it was really working and then sometimes it they did some you know as it expanded out it did less well and the difference was what it was really working as one on one and then they started to say the same money that six to one and tutoring six to one is not it's not individualized it becomes class because it's just cost driven right it just that's the issue with you know if you have thirty kids you can't generate an unending stream of content eighty five percent accuracy based out with the kid learned it has to be one on one it's just and it just that is the delta it's for each kid it's personalized learning a personalized lesson plan is what every kid needs and so and and I believe that if you get all the learning scientists together and say yes AI is the life microscope don't you agree and can we create a program right that's available to everybody right then and I think they'd all say yes yes we can and that that the the the software is not insurmountable right I believe we could do you know I was actually talking to Stanford has their Stanford Accelerator for learning which is you know how and Dean Schwartz runs it and I was like you know we create an X-Price right for an open source available to everybody right you need you also need better credible people than me you don't mean me saying this you need Dean Schwartz and Stanford and the Ivy League right the people that everybody looks up to an education in america and saying we know this we know this learning science we can run right we can take Stanford CS and AI department with the learning science right and put that together and create this project right for not that much money that we can then get to every right and get it into every public school right they have the relationships with all the teachers we're you know they don't need the randomized controlled trial or the skepticism you know obviously get from talking to me so I this is all very doable you know that's that is this mission what is the biggest risk right now is it the equivalent of what we call market risk where let's just adoption it's just it's the leap of faith that yeah we can somehow abandon the only model any of us or is there still technology risk embedded within the AI that says I mean there he is still some technology risk but that's literally like you can ratchet down and you don't have to be 10 times learner but could we get him three times five times today with more static versus some of the cool dynamic stuff that yes you could right but it's are you willing to change the motivational model for the kids are you willing to tell the kid use this app and I'll give you your time back are you willing to say you don't have sitting class for six hours a right it's it's the rebuild that's the problem right when we if you take our software or magic AI tutor right whatever it is and you put it in a standard classroom and the kid has to sit there for six hours a day I can promise you won't work it will not work and so that's the issue is are you really willing back to what Brian told me a decade ago are you really willing to say kids must love school are you really willing and then go rebuild your school system around that because if they do they're going to engage in the app right they're going to you're going to give them their time backs to do stuff they love is that all are you going to make those changes because it isn't an ed tech solution it's not go build this ed tech drop it and it's going to work that's just we have that those apps do generally work right and to get the real revolution you need to say are we going to rebuild what we think k through 12 the first 12 years of the kids lives are and if that's true then the sky is the limit and what we're obviously doing is trying to say look at this look at these examples right because parents parents need I've learned as a principal they need two things to want to change the school remember I was skeptical for two years right I'm I'm the average parent you know was they need a reference from an adult they trust how's it working for your kid did it work for your kid and second they need to see the kid do something at the school that their kid can't do right and if you have that that's actually the magic that unlocks you know a parent saying okay I'm going to go I'm going to move to this new model and you know what what it is that the kid can't oh he loves school I'm like I can wake up in the morning he's you know he's waking me up so he's not late and he used to cry on the way to school or oh wow some parents are like I love the academic performance right or those life skills I really care about or he connects with his teacher so much more as guide you know because it is different and back to the choices like why we're opening all these different schools we have a gifted talented school right we have a sports academy school we have a wilderness school right where you're fishing an archery and you know farming you know we're going to be opening arts theater music parents want different things and kids want different things and so it's showing these things that is going to be the connection that causes parents to say I you know I want this and if you do and you know a good example of motivation you know if you put the GT moms you know McKinsey has you know her roundtables the GT moms with sports academy gifted and talented and talented and talented and then the sports academy moms you know and they just look at each other like the other parent is you know off the rocker where you know the sports academy moms like you know my kid was just you know comes home just sweating for just running around all day and I literally throw him in the shower with their clothes on you know in the GT moms okay they were having a chest tournament in the afternoon and then we came home and continue it right and it depends on the motivation each kid's different right and all your kids are different and you everybody knows that and you know like when we ask like I sat down with at the guides we're like okay how do we make these all better so on you know staff days you know because we have all the guides from all the different schools and I'm like okay what's going to make kids really love school how do we get it from 50 to 60 to 70 on love school the GT guides are like more they want a third power hour of academics and they want math Olympia and all the other guides are grown in because right now our students do not want more academics they want sports or let's do a better workshop or you know what what it's going to be and so the key on all of this is saying how do we you know focus school on making it awesome for kids right making it great have a culture where it is high standards high support where you have this magic on lock of they can learn 10 times faster which then enables you to give them the time back to do all these other things but that's a big lift right that's why it's it's going to take 20 years right but I do believe that you know everybody every parent right the most important thing is raising your kids it's the same at a societal level right the most important thing a society does is raise this next generation and everybody cares about it and one thing I we spend enough money in this country or globally right that there's enough money to actually rearrange this and build an education system that's great for the kids you know 5% of G&P right I mean $7 trillion right that there is recognition at both the societal or parent level right that this is where we should spend money and we do so it's kind of amazing to think back you in the spring of 1989 you drop out of college to go start a software company obviously there's no way you could have imagined both the success you would have in that company you know creating a multi-billion dollar company and and along with it a fortune for yourself but then somehow deciding right it's your peak that you were going to completely walk away from that take that fortune and pour it into another endeavor that seems as far from anything as possible relative to what you what you what you what you started with like I feel really fortunate to that you're starting this that you started this in Austin for the listener I think maybe I probably should have said this at the outset you know my daughter spent two years at alpha it was an absolutely exceptional experience for her really kind of experienced all the things you talk about right so showed up in what did she show up she showed up in seventh grade shows up in seventh grade with the absolute negative story of you know I love reading I love arts I love these things I'm a musician I'm not I just don't do math in science like that's I know you did dad that's not me I can't do math I never want to do math I made the awful mistake of spending the past you're trying to help her do math that was a disaster that only resulted in tears but it really I think what would appeal to me when we made that switch was it just seemed so entirely logical that the reason she was struggling was because there were things in third and fourth grade she never mastered and I really appreciated the compounding nature of that gap and and it just made sense it really clicked and so it wasn't a big leap of faith to say oh okay yeah and I feel very fortunate that as just as you predicted by the end of eighth grade I mean she was asing math and that has continued all through high school she did go back to public high school I think you know that's probably something you you do encounter is that are there are kids that ultimately just want to be back in the big public high school they want to play sports on the public you know in the public high school they want to be you know and of course she's at a high school with a billion kids and she's very happy there but I don't think there's a chance I don't think there's a snowball's chance in hell she would be doing as well as she is if not for the fact that she had that two year sabbatical to alpha where she really got to academically create a solid foundation and I will share one last anecdote here which is at her eighth grade graduation she was in tears saying goodbye to her guides to your point it's think of what the impact of those guides were on her life she loved those people and you know it's not that she doesn't like her teachers in high school but she doesn't have that kind of relationship with them right and back to you know you guys were I came in actually you know right then and Andy M who runs our academics you know since you're such a broader up wants to give her a call out because she spent hours with him going through lessons helping figure out why is this not working or what is it and you know one of the things when you're you're starting these new schools you need the this concept of a founding family right and you know your family was one of the most important and your support where you got it but your daughter you know Andy wanted to say you know thank you to her because she did go above and beyond where our lessons and all this learning science in this close loop you know he's like I'm way better because of the feedback and the time she spent with us and so you know it is it is transformative to kids and to your point of high school you're not if you want to be the quarterback on the West Lake team and run track we don't have those in our high school and so we can get you prepared you know we say our middle school prepares kids for any high school right and so all our kids in middle school can get get their pick of high school that they want to go and someone alpha you know of a high which is that but someone you know the traditional play but we hopefully have a quick term where they know they're a self-driven learning and can do it on their own yeah I'll tell you that maybe the last story I'll I'll share Joe which is no surprise to you is it really doesn't matter what corner and I mean this literally what corner of this planet I am standing on when education comes up your name always comes up and this is these are people who don't know that I know you right they don't know that we are friends and I'll be I will be literally on the opposite side of this planet and if if I'm talking with anybody about a education it's like what do you know about AI and education? Have you heard of this guy Joe Leem on at Alpha and it it's it comes up so often which tells me that it is getting out there it is this is no longer just that little niche school downtown Austin I mean it's hard to believe what has happened in five years it went from one building one place to how many now right so we have we're now we open 12 campuses this will be a 25 alpha campuses we also have 25 non-alpha campuses where back to lower price points you know we have we have campuses open where you know it's charter so it's free for kids we have ones where it's five thousand dollar pay for the parents five hundred dollars a month you know some of twenty thousand so we're trying to figure up back to innovating we're like what are the right price points and everything but yes you know we expect 12 months from now there to be hundreds and hundreds of schools that use this model you know you know the demand for the sports academy is through the roof and we think that's going to explode for sure well Joe I appreciate you taking your time to come out today but of course more than anything I just appreciate what you're doing and again I know this is you know not something that is really fits into what we talk about in this podcast but again I don't think you can care about medicine science health and not care about the foundation upon which it's built and it all starts with education so you're if you're working on such an important problem and if there's one last thing I can do since I've had a great career obviously before this in three years ago moved education if there's other people out there and one of the things if you're listening to this and you're excited part of my job is let's go get more talent into education and I can tell you the last three years have been awesome and my next twenty years is going to be better than my last twenty years and so you know if I can if I can convince you to come on in the water it's the best way for because I guarantee you there's a million people listening to us there's going to be a non-zero number of them are going to want to reach out to you what's the best way to get a whole of you great literally my email which is Joe dot lee mont at alfa dot school and send it to me and you know I am overloaded right up to your point the hype has gotten very high about alfa what should they what could someone who wants to get your attention put in the subject line heard you on the purge on the dive podcast or something like that. on the drive podcast right and you know we're looking for you know all sorts of people want you want product people you want engineers you want everybody every week come in we have to go build you know we're building a eyes right there's back to expansion we need entrepreneurs where you know G.T. school needs 500 schools we need entrepreneurs who are going to expand it like it's you know a Chipotle chain right we need a I guys right I'm going out Silicon Valley where we we have to you know current chat bots aren't good we have to make the L.L.M. better we need people we need educators right people who are like okay I want to do this new thing if you're one of the learning scientists that we don't have on our team right come do it right that is we're a sound if you're back to capital we're going to need a lot of capital as well to expand this if back to philanthropy right it's we need to be giving scholarships we're funding a lot of it but we need to make this available to everybody right we have to your problem it can't just be for the elite it's got to be for a billion kids so education touches everything and if you're just in we're like that description where of what they're building I'm in then come aboard because it's awesome Joe dot leem on at alpha.com will alpha dot school alpha dot school okay we'll put that in the show notes just so that people can click directly on it. Joe thanks again thank you for as always this is great
