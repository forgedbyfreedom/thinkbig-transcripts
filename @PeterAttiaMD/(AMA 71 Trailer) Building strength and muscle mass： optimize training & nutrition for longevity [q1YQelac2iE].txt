If I don't have much time in the gym, I'm only doing compound exercises. For today's AMA, all things related to muscle mass and muscle strength. I mean, the truth of the matter is you always need to be kind of trying to push this. Why should everyone who's listening to this? Care about this topic. A very active individual, lower level of decline, still declining. A population average, quicker level of decline, and a sedentary individual, much quicker level of decline. How would someone implement progressive over mode? Maybe the most obvious way that people would naturally think of which is you can increase the load or the weight. But you can also do it by increasing the reps. Any other aspects of nutrition? Really one of the few supplements that I almost universally recommend. What are some ways that I can start this? In hopes of knocking an injured and doing this for a long time? Act is though you've never done this before. Focus on injury prevention. What does some programming look like for them? And how could they take that information to a gym? Thank you for viewing this sneak peek of an ask me anything episode of the drive.
