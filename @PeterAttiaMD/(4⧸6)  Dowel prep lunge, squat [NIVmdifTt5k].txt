That was what I was supposed to get my position right so it takes a pretty narrow stance of something like a power slider and if you think about it. If you have aduction, avoiding a knee dogus and trying to get hips back. I sort of aligned the mirror a little bit. Make sure the knees are covered by the toes. I'm not trying to do the deepest squat, I'm just trying to get my can of hips right. Mostly paying attention to the glute fire. My feeling is more than glutes and the quads. And then quickly transition into a lunge. Feel free to point out for all of what I'm doing. Yeah, so his heel is high on the ball amount of his toes. He's getting that maximum, great toe extension. Make sure that his lumbar spine stays neutral so he descends down into his lunge. He's really eccentrically loading the right quarter step and not just collapse into his lower back. So by staying really strong in his transverse abdominis and seeking straight down, he's maximum of the left quarter up here and extending his thoracic spine instead of just collapse you right into the lower back. Right glute, left quad. Let's get back together.
