It lost a legend in the peptide world. Research M is now indefinitely closed. Release this statement saying, all orders will be shipped out. They are no longer taking new orders. And their customer support will still be live for the next 30 days. A lot of you guys think that we just sold peptides and that was it. But it was so much more than a brand. The culture, everyone involved, it honestly felt like family. These guys are my brothers. These girls are my sisters. So I don't want to see any misinformation. They just said that they're moving on to bigger things. It's not an FDA shot down like a amino. Now that two of the biggest players in the space are gone, where do you go next? Straight labs has been my backup for a while now. If any of you guys have issues with them, you can always send them an email and they will fix the problem. I need you guys to understand that that is a temporary fix. The long term of the chemical industry is going to be a place like Algo. I know you love the gray markets. I'm the same way, but it's starting to get a little bit uncomfortable because we know that the government's collecting data on consumers. That means you. Please be patient. While I update all the links in my FAQ, if you guys want full guides on how to use these things safely and find reliable sources, you know where to go.
