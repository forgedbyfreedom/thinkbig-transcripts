Never felt better. Seriously though, I can't say any more good things about it. So besides the injection pain, what are the actual side effects of TRT? Let's make this super simple. TRT stands for testosterone replacement therapy. It's the practice of using injectable testosterone to assist a body that doesn't make enough. Naturally, key word is replacement. When we start injecting testosterone, our natural production goes to zero. Now what consequences does that have? So natural testosterone production is closely tied to fertility and to particular size. So if you're not using fertility drugs like HCG or HMG, it might become pretty difficult to have kids in the future. Because we're all different genetically, some guys are more sensitive to testosterone than others, which means they might get issues on TRT doses where most guys don't. Even if you do run into issues on testosterone, Algo RX has all the prescriptions you would need to stay healthy on it. So blood pressure, heart rate, estrogen, anti-aging, fertility, they've got it all. You got it all.
