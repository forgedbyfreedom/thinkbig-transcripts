Welcome to Cocktails and Chemicals. Today's topic, why should we start taking human growth hormone? Human growth hormone is something that's already produced naturally within the human body, and it's responsible for a lot of growth, especially the secretion of growth factors such as IGF1, IGF2, TNF, and other things. IGF1, you might have heard of, it does come in an injectable form. When we bring in HGH, one of the main concerns that we need to be aware of is how it's going to affect our fasting blood glucose levels. Our blood glucose levels are pretty good indicator of what our insulin sensitivity is looking like. We want to stay insulin sensitive on cycle, so that all of the nutrients that we're putting in our body are being allocated towards muscle growth and not so much towards fat storage. So to that extent, when is the right time to bring in growth hormone? You might see a lot of guys online say things like, oh, you can only use growth hormone once you're a pro, or you can only use growth hormone once you've reached your nati potential. Whatever these limitations are, there's no physiological change in the human body that all of a sudden allows it to handle exogenous growth hormone. You can bring in the growth hormone whenever you feel that you're ready. I personally feel, and in my own clients, that is a relatively safe compound and you can bring it in within the first couple cycles. It's not going to cause that many side effects except for water attention, which is something that you should be aware of, and you should adjust your dose accordingly as well as any other supplementation and diuretic practices. If you decide to go that route, in order to keep everything as healthy as possible. Best of luck.
