Is in chromophane gonna make a big difference, assuming diet and training are good? Let's talk about it. So if you guys aren't familiar with in chromophane, it is an oral compound that can help you improve your natural testosterone production. It's mainly gonna be bottlenecked by your natural LH, maybe FSH production. Primarily, if you have low LH and you bring in in chromophane, you might see a very significant increase in your testosterone levels. Now, more testosterone does what more testosterone does. That includes more muscle mass. Of course, this is dependent on your diet and training. So let's say that that's good. How dramatic of a difference are we really gonna be getting? Well, I've seen some people using chromophane and get their total testosterone levels up to 1600. There are guys that are on TRT that don't have numbers as high as that. If you are someone who responds that strongly and your Androgen receptors are very sensitive to testosterone, you might make some significant gains on chromophane. I don't think you'll ever achieve a physique that looks significantly-rooted up like any guy that's on steroids if you're purely using in chromophane, but you will definitely make more progress than if you weren't using it. See the step-by-step guide to in-clomephane in the FAQ in my bio, as well as sources on where to get it. Best of luck.
