Ask my girlfriend gear question. What is something that you would want to change about the industry right now? Social media, fitness, gear, Fake Natties. Fake Natties. Yeah. It's beyond us. Guys are girls. Both. I mean mainly girls because I feel like I've gone over this topic. You've gone over this topic where I mean you have a whole video on it but there's so many girls that take PDs and they don't say anything and then all of their followers are like oh I want to look like them and then they're like okay drop the routine girly. Yeah exactly and then they do and it's like okay they do that they don't get the same result or like I'm doing everything the same what's wrong and they're like gets you just doing it wrong but no it's like it's just um be honest and if your followers don't want to take it then they don't want to take and that's fine but don't give a false reality don't be fake. Don't be fake.
