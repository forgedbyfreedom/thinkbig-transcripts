So some guys might be wondering how his gear altered my mental state in terms of aggression, vigor, business, etc. Let's talk about it. All these different types of gear are going to affect you in different ways. I can say from personal experience, the most positive, beneficial one that I've had is just getting enough testosterone in my body to start functioning. I come from a history of low T, my testosterone levels were only 300, and getting onto testosterone has dramatically improved my confidence levels, my drive, you name it, including in business entrepreneurship and willingness to take risks. Second point, Echo Poise. Volanone was one of those compounds that just gave me an overall feel good emotion that has never left me as long as I've been on that compound. I like to keep it in my cycles, and if I'm cruising, I try to keep it in if I'm able to get healthy blood work. If not, obviously it's outright a way. Some compounds that I had very negative experiences with. First, trend. I personally love trend. I love the way it makes me feel. But unfortunately, that is a selfish belief because the people around me, the people that I deal with on a regular basis and I loved ones like my girlfriend, she does not like me on trend. I'm way too business oriented, and I do start to neglect her or kind of see her like a piece of cardboard, like more like an object and not so much of a human being. Then we start talking about Nangerloon. Deca was the worst steroid experience of my entire life. I felt horribly depressed. I felt like all of my confidence was gone. Anything that I tried to do, I felt like I failed even if I wasn't really failing at all. The safe, the cautious, and be gentle with yourself as you go through this whole process. That's a vlog.
