Silly question, but maybe not enough people know. What happens if you never cycle off? If you never cycle off of testosterone, what that means is you never stop injecting it. Maybe this individual is cycling other things along side to testosterone, which could put them in an unhealthy position. But for this example, say, let's just say testosterone. Well, if you're getting your blood work regularly, let's say every eight weeks or so, maybe four times a year at the absolute minimum, you would understand your health on a month to month basis. If you're getting your blood work done regularly, you'll understand what markers are out of range and need some help and what markers are in range and are completely fine. If you are able to keep most of those markers within range, at least the main problem markers, then you're not gonna have any problems. Tastastron can be run without any effects or impacts on your longevity if you are keeping your body healthy. A testosterone total number on blood work does not equate to an early death. Whether that's 2000 or 3000, the really important thing is, did you track your blood pressure? Did you keep on top of your RBC count? Did you make sure that your cholesterol levels are good, healthy, and overall, you're living a healthy lifestyle that's conducive to longevity. Keep that in mind, that's a vlog, you guys.
