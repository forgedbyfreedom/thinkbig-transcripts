If you're almost at your natural potential and you hop on roads and then come off, do you lose all the gains that you've made? Let's discuss. So whenever you get on gear, you are going to be exposing your body to a brand new hormonal landscape. Whatever it was working with before, let's say your natural testosterone levels were 500 nanograms per vessel liter and then you get on testosterone and those levels go all the way up to say 1500, maybe 2000 nanograms per vessel liter. That is a three times, maybe four times difference that your body is not accustomed to. So any amount of muscle that you build in that landscape is an amount of muscle that can only be supported by that landscape. You can imagine it like a creature that is being brought into a new environment and it is built for that environment, it can survive there. But once that habitat changes, it can't survive there anymore. Just as your gains cannot survive in a low testosterone environment. So once you come off of that testosterone and you go back to your natural levels, the gains that you were able to sustain on 2000 nanograms per vessel liter are now unsustainable on 500 nanograms per vessel liter. There's a couple other factors to consider. Whenever you come off of exogenous testosterone, you are going to lose all that testosterone in your body as it's clearing out. It doesn't just go from 2000 back down to 500 comfortably. It goes from 2000 down to zero and then you need to use PCT drugs and if you don't use them wait six months until your testosterone levels come back to normal bottom line, any gains on gear cannot be sustained by a natty. There's a sprinkle that you'll keep but the rest is gone.
