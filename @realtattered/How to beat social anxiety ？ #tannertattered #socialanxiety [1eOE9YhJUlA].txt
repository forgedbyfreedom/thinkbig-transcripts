If you are one of those people and it's a little bit tricky to have an elevator conversation out of nowhere, practice, start small. Any like one minute opportunity for interaction you get, whether it's like the girl at the front desk, and you're like, oh, you know what are you doing this weekend? She tells you something like that's cool, how big of a weekend. That's it. That's literally all it takes, seriously.
