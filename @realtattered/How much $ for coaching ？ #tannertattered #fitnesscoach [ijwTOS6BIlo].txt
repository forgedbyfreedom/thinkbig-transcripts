How much do you charge for coaching? All of my coaching, which is one on one. You guys set up a 30 minute consultation call with me. That call itself is $250 USD. That rate is gonna go up at the end of the quarter. So if you do want to sneak in and book a call with me, now it's definitely the best time. Obviously means it's gonna be busy for me, but of course that means I can get you guys the best deals right now before things start creeping up. And then also keep in mind, if you have booked with me previously, you do get a discount on the coaching call. So normally it would be 250, it then goes down to 150. The new prices haven't decided those yet, but they are gonna go up. They're still gonna be that same system in place. If you're a regular customer, that price will go up, but it's gonna be slightly less than the typical standard first time or price. What the hell's man?
