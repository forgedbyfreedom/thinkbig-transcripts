What is the best long term half-naddy stack in strategy? Let's do some strategizing. When we're talking about being coming a half-naddy, we're going to be using things that will be artificially loose. Sauce, thrown, our performance, anything that we can get our hands on to get us some extra gains without legitimately being on steroids. So what do we start with? First thing I start with is just boosting your natural testosterone levels. We could do this with something like a diploma-fane, select the best from the set to the modulator. We could do this with something like HcG, LH-minetic, and then beyond that, we start looking at things that will increase our growth performance, MK677, GHR, Hume's like a propellant, hexarelling, CGC-1295, with DAX, GHR-P6. All of these options are in our toolbox and can be leveraged depending on your goals. So be sure to check out my FAQ for full guides on how I went to use it.
