can testosterone be fake? Yes it can, but that's like faking a penny. Like why would you want to do that? Everyone can make them. They're so cheap. It's honestly just like you're shooting yourself in the foot by faking testosterone. For me personally, I don't think I've ever seen anybody fake testosterone. The only issue I see is people that are using testosterone, but they are using it irresponsibly, or the testosterone itself is being brewed irresponsibly, as in they're using nasty solvents and nasty carrier oils, and all that nasty junk that's going to make you all inflamed and feel nasty and you're like, well why is it hurt every time I inject? G.I. wonder, probably because you're pinning that bathtub gear, Gary?
