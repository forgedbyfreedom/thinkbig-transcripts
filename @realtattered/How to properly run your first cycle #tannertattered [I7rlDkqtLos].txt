If I could go back in time knowing what I know now, what would I take and not take in order to build the best physique possible? I'd start training early, I'd start researching how to die it, and I wouldn't touch anything except pre-atine until the age of 16. At 16, I'm going to get my testosterone checked, my LH and FSH checked, and if those two numbers are low, I'm going to start using incolmouthine. I'd also start MK677 on my bulks and cardering on my cuts. If my parents allow it, I would be injecting L-Carnatine. I'm 18, I've got some half-native mass, and I'm moving off the college. It's time to eject some testosterone. Before my first injection, I'm getting advanced blood work, and the seamen analysis because I want to have kids in the future. I'd fall the testosterone guide in my FAQ that determined how to dose and run my first cycle and what things I'd need on hand to prevent side effects. After a couple more cycles of adding in one more compound at a time, I'd decide if I have the genetics for bodybuilding or if I want to do this more casually.
