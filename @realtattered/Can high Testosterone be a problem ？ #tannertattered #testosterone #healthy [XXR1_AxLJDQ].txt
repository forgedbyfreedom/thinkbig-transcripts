Does your total testosterone blood marker actually affect your health directly? Let's get into it. So when you get your blood work done, you might notice that there is a total testosterone marker. It might say somewhere like 1,000 nanograms per desoliter if you're on cycle or TRT, maybe you're pushing big doses, we could get up until the 3000's, 4000's, 5000's. With numbers that high, can you actually stay healthy? Definitely with some medications, I would argue yes. But it's all going to be a little bit genetic, dependent. If your total testosterone on blood work is something like 2000 nanograms per desoliter, if you start noticing that your blood pressure is getting up until 120 over 80, 130 over 90, or even above that, regardless of whatever your testosterone dose is, you need to do something to control that blood pressure. If you're noticing that your RBC or your hematic rate markers on blood work are getting elevated, far beyond the reference range, then no matter what your testosterone levels are, you're going to need to do something about those elevated numbers. So keep in mind, as we start noticing this trend here, there's a pattern of if there's a problem, fix the problem. One is total testosterone ever the direct problem, the answer is, technically never. It is more of an indirect problem. If you've tried every medication under the sun, every supplement under the sun, every diet under the sun, and you're still getting things out of range on your blood work, then that would be the time at which you have no other choice, but to bring down that testosterone number. Best of luck.
