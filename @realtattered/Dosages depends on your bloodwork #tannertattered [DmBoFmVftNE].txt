Would I recommend running test to mast at a one to one ratio? Let's talk about it. Whenever I'm dosing compounds, keep in mind, it's always going to be dosed for you and your genetics. I haven't seen what your blood work looks like, so I don't know how much estrogen you'd like to have and how suppressive that mass tron is on your estrogen levels. So in that case, you're just gonna wanna adjust that mass tron dosage to get to that sweet spot for you and your personal genes. Now, for anyone that I'd be starting out with, who has never tried mass tron before, I'd like to start out that mass tron at a dosage of half your dosage of testosterone. I personally prefer airing on the side of having a little bit more estrogen rather than less estrogen, so I'd like to start with a mass tron at a lower dosage. But of course, we can gradually build that up according to you and your personal preferences. Now, if you do decide that you tolerate mass tron at a one to one dosage with testosterone, then by all means, run that until the sun sets. That's of luck. Talk to you guys soon.
