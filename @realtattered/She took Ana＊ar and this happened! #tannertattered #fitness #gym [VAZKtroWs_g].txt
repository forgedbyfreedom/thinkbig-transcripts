So, question for Luz, context, my girlfriend. How did var feel the first time you took it? Honestly, I didn't really notice a difference. The first time I took it, it was like a six week long cycle. By the end of it, I could tell a difference. But during it, I just felt a little bit stronger. Honestly, no difference. I definitely filled out a little bit. Then afterwards, my strength kind of went away. And then I was like, okay, cool, great. My voice didn't change at all. The first time my voice is different now. When she got on real anime. Yeah, how is the second experience? We upgraded the quality. It's a lot better. Strength went all the way back up. Voice did change a little bit. And other ways nothing else changed. So that's good. But no negatives. Guys, no side effects. Staying down with those side effects. Yeah, that's about it. Let's go ahead and see if it's pretty much it. Yeah. Let's pretty much it. Do it.
