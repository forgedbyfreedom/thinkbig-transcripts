Not everybody is gonna support you and your bodybuilding goals. So how do we approach unsupported family and friends when you start telling them you wanna get on stuff? So when it comes to bodybuilding and pursuing this sport or powerlifting or strong man, if you are deciding to go the enhanced route, a lot of people are gonna take issue with what you're putting in your body. Of course, there's always my body, my choice argument. And in that case, there's some validity to it, but the downside of that is that these are things that are going to actively interfere with our health. When we start talking about enhancement, there is that added aspect of how much are you willing to sacrifice? And to what extent do you value the opinions of others when making those sacrifices for your own personal goals? One example that I like to look to is professional football. Of course, in professional football, there is the regular risk of concussions and other head trauma. To what extent should your mom have a say in whether or not you're allowed to expose yourself to that risk? Oh, same as true of bodybuilding. Although it's not head trauma, it is organ trauma and other things that if not mitigated properly could inevitably become a problem down the line. This is something that I want you guys to be very, very careful of. And as you start weighing the pros and cons of going down this route, also taking a consideration, you might strain your relationships with family, friends, and loved ones if you do decide to push things pretty aggressively. Only you can be the captain of your own ship. That's a vlog.
