What is something that you would want to change about the industry? Fake Natties. Fake Natties. Yeah. It's be honest. Guys are girls. Both. There's so many girls that take PEDs and they don't say anything and then all of their followers are like, oh I want to look like them and then they're like okay. Drop the routine girly. Yeah exactly and then they're like, well they do and it's like okay they do that. They don't get the same result. I'm doing everything the same. What's wrong? And they're like, oh, it gets you just doing it wrong. But no it's like it's just be honest and if your followers don't want to take it then they don't want to take and that's fine but don't give a false reality. Don't be fake. Don't be fake.
