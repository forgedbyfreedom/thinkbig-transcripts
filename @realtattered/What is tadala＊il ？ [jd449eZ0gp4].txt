Can I take to Adelphill just on its own? I'm 5'8, 250 pounds to make this a little bit longer than just saying, yes, yes, you can. And also, if you would like to use to Adelphill, let's keep in mind a couple things about using it. First, common side effect that guys will get from using to Adelphill is headaches or nasal congestion. These are pretty easily dealt with by just reducing your dose, but if you do notice that you're still getting side effects, on say 2.5 milligrams, 1.25 milligrams, you just might not have the genetics to handle to Adelphill properly. And that's okay. If you are the type of person that notices dizziness or faintness as you use to Adelphill, this is due to the vast of dilation, bringing your blood pressure way too low. Especially when you're training, this is not a good thing. The last thing we need is you crumpling like a lawn chair under the squat rack. So be mindful of that. Make sure that you monitor your blood pressure on a regular basis and decide if to Adelphill's right for you or not right for you. Now, on the other side of the spectrum, if you do have high blood pressure, Adelphill is a great way to actually lower it a little bit. Usually like 5, maybe 10 points if you're really lucky.
