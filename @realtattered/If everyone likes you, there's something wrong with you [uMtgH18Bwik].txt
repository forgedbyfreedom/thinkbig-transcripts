You sound like an asshole, but it's not actually that. It's just literally just content. Like it's your job. So you do not everyone's going to fucking like you. If everyone likes you, there's something wrong with you. Everyone likes you. You're hiding things. I don't trust you. You'll see that with a lot of the major, major influencers. I think they kind of build up these brands that are super pristine, overly sterile. They're so clean. They're so perfect. They're so mass appeal. They work. I mean, they've found the success that they have. But behind the scenes, they're very different people, which is just kind of an uncomfortable experience. It's really good to meet someone on camera and then talk to them off camera and they're basically the same person. Well, it's what's Mr. Beast hiding, bro. That would be something. It's gotta be something. You look at his eyes, man. He's like a crazy person. There's some kind.
