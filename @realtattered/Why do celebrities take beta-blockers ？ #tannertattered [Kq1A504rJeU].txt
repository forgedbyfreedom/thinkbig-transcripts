I look in the mirror and I go take that beta blocker girl. So why do celebrities and CEOs take beta blockers before they make public appearances? Let's dive into the science. And for guys on how to do all of this safely, make sure you check my FAQ. Beta blockers are named that way because they block the action of adrenaline on these things called beta receptors. When you block that adrenaline, it slows down the heart rate and reduces overall strain on the heart, which is why it's used as a medication for CVD. Now, here's where things get interesting. Even if you don't have cardiovascular disease, you can still use it to present as a cool common collected individual. Effectively, it's a chill pill. And doctors have realized this as well, given that they've started prescribing beta blockers to patients with anxiety, even though it's not FDA approved for that purpose. Just imagine all the scenarios where an abivolal could help you. Going on a date with a hot girl, don't want to be a ball of nerves. Got to present something to your boss, got a little bit of social anxiety, having a hard time calming down after a tough workout. All of these things. The end of law can help you with it.
