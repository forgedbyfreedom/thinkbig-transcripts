Alright, your teenager and you want more games. What can you do without long-term side effects? Let's talk about it. So in order of least risky to most risky, we do have a lot of options available to us. The most obvious things are a good diet, training and tensileaks, and a lot of you guys aren't. I've seen you in the gyms. With all of these out of the way, then we can start talking about some of the limitations. Creating, most studied, now we start talking about the funny stuff. So we start looking at things that could potentially increase our testosterone. One of the most obvious choices would be something like declumaphine because it is oral and really easy for you guys to take. But that doesn't mean it's the safest. There are some issues with long-term inclumaphine use, potentially, with blood clotting. Let's also consider HCG. HCG is an injectable compound, but it is going to increase your testosterone levels with, in my opinion, a lesser side effect risk profile than inclumaphine. For that reason, I would prefer HCG over inclumaphine. But of course, if you do live with your parents, please do not be using needles.
