You know how often I deal with people, especially in the fitness scene, that like to say things like, yeah, I want to six pack, you know, I want to look like David Lade, I want to look like Alex Ubank, I want to look like the trend tweens. They want these things, but they're not actually doing anything to achieve that. If there's something that you want, chase it, actually try.
