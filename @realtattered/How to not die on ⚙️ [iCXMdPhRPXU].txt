Welcome to Bedroom Scientist where we talk about barely legal drugs. We know steroids are dangerous and scary and give you gambling addictions. Everyone tells you to stay safe and get your blood work done but what does that actually look like? Well if you look at the most popular blood work places, um, I'm not paying that shit. It is flat out retarded to charge people prices like that to see if they're healthier or not. So me and some friends made our own blood work company. Zing let's say you want to check your liver health after a cycle of sarms or oral steroids. That's not really a good number in this economy. How about 25 bucks? Yeah. The actual process is super easy. You get the panel that you want. You can even build your own if you'd like to. And then you go in person to a lab corp. They draw your blood and you'll get the results in about a week or so. If you notice you're unhealthy in a couple categories, don't worry. I have full guides on what to use to get that cleaned up in my FAQ. And in just a couple months, Algo will be able to legally get you prescriptions to these things, which is perfect.
