How to gain more height on the age of 32. Help a man let out. That's really bad news for you. If you're 32, your growth plates are basically 100% sealed. The only way that you're going to gain more height is if you get the bone snapping lengthening surgery, which is really disturbing, first of all, just a thought of it makes my spine chill. And then you have to crank your bone. Like every single morning. To try and push it by a fraction of a centimeter or something. And over time, you will get taller. We've cared about lifting weights and staying healthy and staying fit. That's just not going to be possible. Because honestly, once you go through that surgery, your body is forever predisposed to wave more injuries than you would have otherwise. If you want to go through that route, that's an option. But no chemical, no peptide, no hormone is going to help you, brother. Sorry.
