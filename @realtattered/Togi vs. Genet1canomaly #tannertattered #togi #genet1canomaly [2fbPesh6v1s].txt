Have you seen that guy, a genetic anomaly? He's fucking massive, but he's always saying he's a vegan that way. Kim and Togi, there you're dead, you have some big beef, there you're not. I'm friendly, you're one. So I DM him, this message, he sees it and he responds with this video. What would be a good meme, I think if I step into the ring with Tony?
