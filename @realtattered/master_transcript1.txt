Yeah, these guys online, they tell me I'm supposed to take this. Like my blood pressure has been like, I don't know, like 131 over like 89, like that's not that bad. Well, I'm young. I don't really need it right now. Yeah, your body's younger, you're more resistant. But the more years you go, not managing that stuff, it's gonna catch up with you, your cooked.

You sound like an asshole, but it's not actually that. It's just literally just content. Like it's your job. So you do not everyone's going to fucking like you. If everyone likes you, there's something wrong with you. Everyone likes you. You're hiding things. I don't trust you. You'll see that with a lot of the major, major influencers. I think they kind of build up these brands that are super pristine, overly sterile. They're so clean. They're so perfect. They're so mass appeal. They work. I mean, they've found the success that they have. But behind the scenes, they're very different people, which is just kind of an uncomfortable experience. It's really good to meet someone on camera and then talk to them off camera and they're basically the same person. Well, it's what's Mr. Beast hiding, bro. That would be something. It's gotta be something. You look at his eyes, man. He's like a crazy person. There's some kind.

Yeah, that video is actually a 100% true. Sometimes weird quiet kid just means you're low tea. I went through all the puberty with barely enough testosterone to be a man and I look like a little fumbley twink. You recognize these symptoms? No confidence, no self-esteem, can't talk to women, can't make friends, no drive? It's testosterone dude. I'm not gonna glorify gear but I'm also not gonna lie to you. As I'll strong completely change my life, I would do it 10 out of 10 times. Even if it took 30 years off my life, I would do it every single time.

But a question from Matt, Jacobson, he's asking about starting MK677. Good physique, always eats clean. Is there anything he should be worried about when starting MK677? So I would say definitely look out for your blood glucose. You want to make sure that you have a blood glucose monitor at home that way you can check and make sure that your body's sensitivity to insulin is exactly where it should be. General practices for checking your blood glucose is to take a look at it about once a week. If you are within say 80, 90, and under 100, that's a pretty good spot to be in. That way you know that your body is relatively insulin sensitive without testing other insulin sensitivity markers on blood work and other things like that. With that being said, definitely be using a self-nut like burbering to control your blood glucose levels, make sure that you bring them down. If they are in the three digits, stored something like 90, 80, you're keeping yourself healthy. You can use something like first detachment suppressor match. That is the most bioavailable burbering on the market right now. And if you don't have that available in your country, you're totally fine. You guys can find burbering anywhere that you find supplement stores. Best of luck. Open it's a successful one for you.

=== FILE: Alex Eubank's bloodwork ⚙️ #tannertattered #alexeubank [Ng3-bVajUQI].txt ===

Alex U-Banks just dropped his TRC blood work. Let's take a look and see how he's doing. It's testosterone clocked in at 932, which is still in the natural range. How often he injects matters a lot. If he's only injecting twice a week, that number would be a lot higher on injection days, but a lot lower on breast days. If he's injecting every single day, it's going to be pretty stable right there. Blood glucose of 71 indicates pretty nice insulin sensitivity and that is pancreas is doing okay. Next two markers are out of range, so is he dying? What's going to happen? Blood urion nitrogen and creatinine typically are elevated in men who are doing heavy resistance training and eating a lot of protein. He's not dying. Kiddy marker, EGFR is just barely in range, so it would be a really good idea to get his system and see checked, which is a much more accurate reading. The rest is good until we get to his liver enzymes, AST and ALT, which are a little bit on my side. That either indicates that he's been having some recreational compounds, or he's been enjoying some oral steroids and hasn't told anyone.

=== FILE: Best place to get needles [3Pu12uDdumI].txt ===

So a lot of people might wonder, where do I get all the equipment to actually fully ready for something like a first cycle? Needles, alcohol swabs, you name it. Now of course there's always Amazon as an option. They do have a surplus of these things, but then it brings in the question, the concept of quality. We want to make sure that you're not using some cheap foreign brand needles. And that's why I do recommend if you are going to go with a needle source. Please do so from a license research outlet, something like Research M store. If you don't want to go that route, of course you can take the risk at a place like Amazon. Before you can go through another outlet for such medical equipment such as GPC Med Lab, to know the common one. They have all the sorts of things that you might be looking for as far as standard syringes and insulin needles as well. Make sure that you have all the vials ready in addition to some additional vials. If you do plan on using any kind of an anabolic oil and if you drop one and it shatters, you don't want to be up the creek without a paddle. You always want to be ready for the worst case scenario. So make sure that you have your money up before you get into this stuff because although the gear itself can be cheap, handling it as an entirety, all the medications, all the supplements keep yourself healthy. Yeah, it kind of adds up. Make sure you take care of yourself. You get your blood worked on and your thorough with all of it.

=== FILE: Best stack to be shredded ⚙️ #tannertattered #shredded #gym [oDMgux0wrtQ].txt ===

So like your questions like this a lot, it's best stacked to be shredded. Something you guys need to understand about using anabolic is that they're not exactly gonna make all of the fat fall off of your body and replace all of it with muscle. I don't even need to just not happen overnight. It's especially not gonna happen if you're diet and you're training and your cardio is not in play. You can't take an infinite amount of testosterone and expect to lose all that fat. There is no exact steroid that's all of a sudden gonna make you lean. I see this massive misconception with windstrawl making you shredded or anivar making you shredded. All of these things are really gonna do is once you are lean enough, you'll start to get a freaky or cosmetic look. Then you would have if you weren't using them. That's about it. Although technically there is some studies that would suggest that they do speed up the process, it's minimal. The real needle mover for that process is gonna be eating the right foods and getting on the damn treadmill. Go out there, do the work because the steroids don't work unless you do. Remember that guys.

=== FILE: Best ＂illegal＂ pre workout ⚙️ #tannertattered #togi #bodybuilding #gym [FamJUmKIFyU].txt ===

There is something better than every pump pre-workout you've ever tried and you need a prescription to get it. To Dala Phil and as you probably know it, Cialis, the erectile dysfunction medication. All of your favorite influencers look so sick online because they're hopped up on Cialis level pumps. To put it simply, it works by inhibiting an enzyme called phosphodiastraise 5 which causes your blood vessels to expand. This allows for a lot better blood flow in that area, but also in your muscles. Cialis is better than Viagra for this because it also inhibits an enzyme called phosphodiastraise 11. Best practices to start lower with your dosing somewhere around 5 milligrams on a daily basis and then you can work your way up to 10, 20, or even higher if you handle it. It's been proven safe on children as young as four years old, so you don't have to worry about this happening to you. Whether you go with Tidalafil or Sildenafil, you can get either of them from Algo or X. Thanks to their AI, you don't need to deal with a doctor at all in order to get legal prescriptions for either of these.

=== FILE: Can TESTOSTERONE be FAKED ？ #tannertattered #testosterone [Rb_qFrz-bE4].txt ===

can testosterone be fake? Yes it can, but that's like faking a penny. Like why would you want to do that? Everyone can make them. They're so cheap. It's honestly just like you're shooting yourself in the foot by faking testosterone. For me personally, I don't think I've ever seen anybody fake testosterone. The only issue I see is people that are using testosterone, but they are using it irresponsibly, or the testosterone itself is being brewed irresponsibly, as in they're using nasty solvents and nasty carrier oils, and all that nasty junk that's going to make you all inflamed and feel nasty and you're like, well why is it hurt every time I inject? G.I. wonder, probably because you're pinning that bathtub gear, Gary?

=== FILE: Can high Testosterone be a problem ？ #tannertattered #testosterone #healthy [XXR1_AxLJDQ].txt ===

Does your total testosterone blood marker actually affect your health directly? Let's get into it. So when you get your blood work done, you might notice that there is a total testosterone marker. It might say somewhere like 1,000 nanograms per desoliter if you're on cycle or TRT, maybe you're pushing big doses, we could get up until the 3000's, 4000's, 5000's. With numbers that high, can you actually stay healthy? Definitely with some medications, I would argue yes. But it's all going to be a little bit genetic, dependent. If your total testosterone on blood work is something like 2000 nanograms per desoliter, if you start noticing that your blood pressure is getting up until 120 over 80, 130 over 90, or even above that, regardless of whatever your testosterone dose is, you need to do something to control that blood pressure. If you're noticing that your RBC or your hematic rate markers on blood work are getting elevated, far beyond the reference range, then no matter what your testosterone levels are, you're going to need to do something about those elevated numbers. So keep in mind, as we start noticing this trend here, there's a pattern of if there's a problem, fix the problem. One is total testosterone ever the direct problem, the answer is, technically never. It is more of an indirect problem. If you've tried every medication under the sun, every supplement under the sun, every diet under the sun, and you're still getting things out of range on your blood work, then that would be the time at which you have no other choice, but to bring down that testosterone number. Best of luck.

=== FILE: Cycle without side effects #tannertattered #sideeffects #fitnesstips [PVwC30qMGpM].txt ===

Alright, your teenager and you want more games. What can you do without long-term side effects? Let's talk about it. So in order of least risky to most risky, we do have a lot of options available to us. The most obvious things are a good diet, training and tensileaks, and a lot of you guys aren't. I've seen you in the gyms. With all of these out of the way, then we can start talking about some of the limitations. Creating, most studied, now we start talking about the funny stuff. So we start looking at things that could potentially increase our testosterone. One of the most obvious choices would be something like declumaphine because it is oral and really easy for you guys to take. But that doesn't mean it's the safest. There are some issues with long-term inclumaphine use, potentially, with blood clotting. Let's also consider HCG. HCG is an injectable compound, but it is going to increase your testosterone levels with, in my opinion, a lesser side effect risk profile than inclumaphine. For that reason, I would prefer HCG over inclumaphine. But of course, if you do live with your parents, please do not be using needles.

And they're like, oh, it gets you just doing it wrong.

What some people would do is they look at those numbers that he was putting out and they kind of just got uncomfortable with the idea of it so they're like, well, let me just try something lower. So at a certain point, you have to realize if you're injecting like maybe 65 milligrams of testosterone a week, you might actually be putting yourself in a position where your test levels are lower than what they were naturally. And you think you're like on a cycle, like you're here to make gains and look sick and whatever, but you're really just shooting yourself in the foot.

=== FILE: Dosages depends on your bloodwork #tannertattered [DmBoFmVftNE].txt ===

Would I recommend running test to mast at a one to one ratio? Let's talk about it. Whenever I'm dosing compounds, keep in mind, it's always going to be dosed for you and your genetics. I haven't seen what your blood work looks like, so I don't know how much estrogen you'd like to have and how suppressive that mass tron is on your estrogen levels. So in that case, you're just gonna wanna adjust that mass tron dosage to get to that sweet spot for you and your personal genes. Now, for anyone that I'd be starting out with, who has never tried mass tron before, I'd like to start out that mass tron at a dosage of half your dosage of testosterone. I personally prefer airing on the side of having a little bit more estrogen rather than less estrogen, so I'd like to start with a mass tron at a lower dosage. But of course, we can gradually build that up according to you and your personal preferences. Now, if you do decide that you tolerate mass tron at a one to one dosage with testosterone, then by all means, run that until the sun sets. That's of luck. Talk to you guys soon.

There's going to be a lot of things changing about your body. A lot of them are going to be good, a lot of them are going to be bad. You got to be prepared for all of it.

=== FILE: Gear vs. Natty ？ #tannertattered #fitnesstips #bodybuilding [QVGMmmmnBHM].txt ===

Fent Max Central, asking all around life benefits, gear versus natty. Let's get into it. So I honestly want to say it's going to depend on where you were naturally. If you already had good hormone levels naturally, everything was balanced, you were not experiencing any level of mental disorder. I would honestly say getting on gear probably is not going to change your life that much. Of course, more testosterone floating around in the human body, binding to receptor sites in the human brain, will undoubtedly contribute to some level of neurological change. Some guys are more or less sensitive to this than others, just genetically. What I noticed coming from my background, where I did have very low testosterone, and I jumped that from 300 nanograms for best leader total testosterone on blood work, 2,3,000. I noticed a lot of change. Self confidence went sky high. I felt a lot better about myself. I felt a lot more rooted in who I was as a person and what I actually wanted to do during my life on this planet. Now of course, that's like very large. And this isn't necessarily to say that I'm glorifying gear, but obviously I'm going to speak honestly about my own experience. So for anyone going into this for the first time, I would genuinely encourage you to be prepared for what it's going to be like when your hormones are now under manual control. Because not only is that a blessing, but it's also a very, very large responsibility. Make sure that you're reading the guides in my FAQ and educating yourself through my resources section, on how to stay as healthy and to try and do this as safely as you possibly can. That's of luck.

Obviously means it's gonna be busy for me, but of course that means I can get you guys the best deals right now before things start creeping up. And then also keep in mind, if you have booked with me previously, you do get a discount on the coaching call. So normally it would be 250, it then goes down to 150. The new prices haven't decided those yet, but they are gonna go up. They're still gonna be that same system in place. If you're a regular customer, that price will go up, but it's gonna be slightly less than the typical standard first time or price. What the hell's man?

=== FILE: How to NOT LOSE your TESTOSTERONE during CYCLE #tannertattered #testosterone [T56gxvs9LS0].txt ===

Hoping on EQ and tests in June, what can I take to keep up my natural testosterone during cycle? First of all, I got some bad news for you. That's not possible. If you're going to be injecting exogenous steroids, you can kiss your natural testosterone goodbye. You should understand that when you are using exogenous testosterone, you feed back loops in the human body. Understand it as, oh, I've already got enough testosterone. I don't need to produce any. And so it's going to take the outside testosterone that you're popping into your ass. And it's going to take the inside testosterone that your body normally would be producing shut all those factories off. So with EQ and testosterone, you should understand that depending on the ester of testosterone that you're using probably an antherior sipping a, that's like 5, 7, a half life. That's going to be in and out of your system in about 4, 5 weeks time. When you're using the Eccopoys, you should understand that the half life of that is about 14 days, which means it is going to take you some around 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, before the Eccopoys is completely out of your body. Now what does that mean? Well once it's completely out of your body, that's the point at which your body will start trying to produce testosterone again. But 2 and a half months after you stop all of your injections, then there's a chance for your natural testosterone to start coming back a little bit. Of course you can speed that up with PCT drugs, but I would say off the bat, you're probably not a candidate for PCT if you're using Eccopoys instead you would be better off switching to a cruise dose of testosterone something like 100, 200 milligrams a week. And then once all of the Eccopoys is cleared out of your body, that would be a good time to PCT from the testosterone itself. You can check out the PCT guides in the FAQ in my bio, wishing you the best of luck man.

How to gain more height on the age of 32. Help a man let out. That's really bad news for you. If you're 32, your growth plates are basically 100% sealed. The only way that you're going to gain more height is if you get the bone snapping lengthening surgery, which is really disturbing, first of all, just a thought of it makes my spine chill. And then you have to crank your bone. Like every single morning. To try and push it by a fraction of a centimeter or something. And over time, you will get taller. We've cared about lifting weights and staying healthy and staying fit. That's just not going to be possible. Because honestly, once you go through that surgery, your body is forever predisposed to wave more injuries than you would have otherwise. If you want to go through that route, that's an option.

Rule of thumb, it's gonna be a lot better to just be open and honest about anything that you're deciding to do with your life. I get a lot of DMs. Let's say that guys are hiding stuff from their wives, or their children, or their family members, just don't do it. Just be open and honest. Stop being a fake nanny, whether that's on the internet, or on your household. Better than that. Communication. Communication.

=== FILE: How to increase your testosterone ？ [C4w0Q5pmMZU].txt ===

Is in chromophane gonna make a big difference, assuming diet and training are good? Let's talk about it. So if you guys aren't familiar with in chromophane, it is an oral compound that can help you improve your natural testosterone production. It's mainly gonna be bottlenecked by your natural LH, maybe FSH production. Primarily, if you have low LH and you bring in in chromophane, you might see a very significant increase in your testosterone levels. Now, more testosterone does what more testosterone does. That includes more muscle mass. Of course, this is dependent on your diet and training. So let's say that that's good. How dramatic of a difference are we really gonna be getting? Well, I've seen some people using chromophane and get their total testosterone levels up to 1600. There are guys that are on TRT that don't have numbers as high as that. If you are someone who responds that strongly and your Androgen receptors are very sensitive to testosterone, you might make some significant gains on chromophane. I don't think you'll ever achieve a physique that looks significantly-rooted up like any guy that's on steroids if you're purely using in chromophane, but you will definitely make more progress than if you weren't using it. See the step-by-step guide to in-clomephane in the FAQ in my bio, as well as sources on where to get it. Best of luck.

Welcome to Bedroom Scientist where we talk about barely legal drugs. We know steroids are dangerous and scary and give you gambling addictions. Everyone tells you to stay safe and get your blood work done but what does that actually look like? Well if you look at the most popular blood work places, um, I'm not paying that shit. It is flat out retarded to charge people prices like that to see if they're healthier or not. So me and some friends made our own blood work company. Zing let's say you want to check your liver health after a cycle of sarms or oral steroids. That's not really a good number in this economy. How about 25 bucks? Yeah. The actual process is super easy. You get the panel that you want. You can even build your own if you'd like to. And then you go in person to a lab corp. They draw your blood and you'll get the results in about a week or so. If you notice you're unhealthy in a couple categories, don't worry. I have full guides on what to use to get that cleaned up in my FAQ. And in just a couple months, Algo will be able to legally get you prescriptions to these things, which is perfect.

=== FILE: How to properly run your first cycle #tannertattered [I7rlDkqtLos].txt ===

If I could go back in time knowing what I know now, what would I take and not take in order to build the best physique possible? I'd start training early, I'd start researching how to die it, and I wouldn't touch anything except pre-atine until the age of 16. At 16, I'm going to get my testosterone checked, my LH and FSH checked, and if those two numbers are low, I'm going to start using incolmouthine. I'd also start MK677 on my bulks and cardering on my cuts. If my parents allow it, I would be injecting L-Carnatine. I'm 18, I've got some half-native mass, and I'm moving off the college. It's time to eject some testosterone. Before my first injection, I'm getting advanced blood work, and the seamen analysis because I want to have kids in the future. I'd fall the testosterone guide in my FAQ that determined how to dose and run my first cycle and what things I'd need on hand to prevent side effects. After a couple more cycles of adding in one more compound at a time, I'd decide if I have the genetics for bodybuilding or if I want to do this more casually.

=== FILE: How to remove gyno ？ #tannertattered #gynooperation #gyno [yBmdDl3NQps].txt ===

Hmm. We're gonna cocktails and chemicals. Today's topic, how to reduce Gino-Commastia. If you guys have experienced Gino throughout puberty or as the results of steroids, you do know how unsightly, uncomfortable and that sometimes painful this thing can be. So is there anything that we can do to actually reverse this issue? In the studies that we have, there are a couple different topics that we can bring up. That would be the topic of Reloxophine and the topic of Tomoxophine. Reloxophine is indicated as being the most successful in the studies, reducing or eliminating Gino-Commastia in about 90% of cases. In Tomoxophine's case, the effectiveness seems to be about 80% or so. If you're looking to decide between the two of them, Reloxophine might seem to be the most effective, but depending on genetic differences, there are some people who might respond well to Tomoxophine, but get no results from Reloxophine. For more information on how to use these things safely, and to effectively get rid of your Gino, check out the FAQ in my bio for full guides and sources. Cheers.

=== FILE: How to stop gyno ？ #tannertattered #gyno [9jvxzXDxoOQ].txt ===

Nobody wants nasty gyna. So here's how we can fix it. If you're ever experiencing any gyna-comascia or even the symptoms indicating gyna might start to show up, we're talking nipple puffiness, sensitivity, pain, irritation, any of that stuff, here's a couple things that we should bring in. First, you want to have a hormonal balance that is not conducive to gyna growth. That means your estrogen and your blacken levels should be just low enough that you're not causing any additional gyna. Once these hormones come into range, gyna will be incapable of growing in your body. The next step is if you already have some gyna, and you need to reverse that gyna that's already built up in your body, using something like relax a pain or to moxifin, select the best estrogen receptor modulators, can help to shrink that gyna tissue and eventually in a lot of the studies that we've seen, reduce that to nothing.

=== FILE: How to tell family about this ？ #tannertattered #enhanced #health #fitness [P1ZRtYdzPzQ].txt ===

Not everybody is gonna support you and your bodybuilding goals. So how do we approach unsupported family and friends when you start telling them you wanna get on stuff? So when it comes to bodybuilding and pursuing this sport or powerlifting or strong man, if you are deciding to go the enhanced route, a lot of people are gonna take issue with what you're putting in your body. Of course, there's always my body, my choice argument. And in that case, there's some validity to it, but the downside of that is that these are things that are going to actively interfere with our health. When we start talking about enhancement, there is that added aspect of how much are you willing to sacrifice? And to what extent do you value the opinions of others when making those sacrifices for your own personal goals? One example that I like to look to is professional football. Of course, in professional football, there is the regular risk of concussions and other head trauma. To what extent should your mom have a say in whether or not you're allowed to expose yourself to that risk? Oh, same as true of bodybuilding. Although it's not head trauma, it is organ trauma and other things that if not mitigated properly could inevitably become a problem down the line. This is something that I want you guys to be very, very careful of. And as you start weighing the pros and cons of going down this route, also taking a consideration, you might strain your relationships with family, friends, and loved ones if you do decide to push things pretty aggressively. Only you can be the captain of your own ship. That's a vlog.

=== FILE: How ？ #tannertattered #togi [gNV8nTVcO4U].txt ===

I'm gonna hold your hand when I say this, training does not matter that much. Only 20 something days between these two pictures. His training intensity did not change. His diet and his droop intake changed. I coach Toki and I know his tolerance for pushing sets hard. The answer is he really doesn't push them that hard at all. So how does he look this good? Diet and droop. The bodybuilder Paul DeLet barely trained hard at all. There are so many podcasts of guys talking about how he basically treated the gym as if it was a joke. Other guys have the intensity their form is complete garbage and they still have insane physics. Like is Rital had a video on the exact same topic. Most bodybuilders don't really train that hard and how are they so big? I'm gonna break your heart and give it to you honestly. The most important thing to build a good physique is eating the right food and doing the right drink. You're better off spending 30 minutes in the gym and getting all your meals in than spending three hours there and screwing around with everything else.

=== FILE: If everyone likes you, there's something wrong with you [uMtgH18Bwik].txt ===

You sound like an asshole, but it's not actually that. It's just literally just content. Like it's your job. So you do not everyone's going to fucking like you. If everyone likes you, there's something wrong with you. Everyone likes you. You're hiding things. I don't trust you. You'll see that with a lot of the major, major influencers. I think they kind of build up these brands that are super pristine, overly sterile. They're so clean. They're so perfect. They're so mass appeal. They work. I mean, they've found the success that they have. But behind the scenes, they're very different people, which is just kind of an uncomfortable experience. It's really good to meet someone on camera and then talk to them off camera and they're basically the same person. Well, it's what's Mr. Beast hiding, bro. That would be something. It's gotta be something. You look at his eyes, man. He's like a crazy person. There's some kind.

=== FILE: Infinite cycle ⚙️ #tannertattered #gym #bodybuilding [M9bAnYSbhrs].txt ===

Silly question, but maybe not enough people know. What happens if you never cycle off? If you never cycle off of testosterone, what that means is you never stop injecting it. Maybe this individual is cycling other things along side to testosterone, which could put them in an unhealthy position. But for this example, say, let's just say testosterone. Well, if you're getting your blood work regularly, let's say every eight weeks or so, maybe four times a year at the absolute minimum, you would understand your health on a month to month basis. If you're getting your blood work done regularly, you'll understand what markers are out of range and need some help and what markers are in range and are completely fine. If you are able to keep most of those markers within range, at least the main problem markers, then you're not gonna have any problems. Tastastron can be run without any effects or impacts on your longevity if you are keeping your body healthy. A testosterone total number on blood work does not equate to an early death. Whether that's 2000 or 3000, the really important thing is, did you track your blood pressure? Did you keep on top of your RBC count? Did you make sure that your cholesterol levels are good, healthy, and overall, you're living a healthy lifestyle that's conducive to longevity. Keep that in mind, that's a vlog, you guys.

=== FILE: Mental state on ⚙️ #tannertattered [Zxq5BeJkBmw].txt ===

So some guys might be wondering how his gear altered my mental state in terms of aggression, vigor, business, etc. Let's talk about it. All these different types of gear are going to affect you in different ways. I can say from personal experience, the most positive, beneficial one that I've had is just getting enough testosterone in my body to start functioning. I come from a history of low T, my testosterone levels were only 300, and getting onto testosterone has dramatically improved my confidence levels, my drive, you name it, including in business entrepreneurship and willingness to take risks. Second point, Echo Poise. Volanone was one of those compounds that just gave me an overall feel good emotion that has never left me as long as I've been on that compound. I like to keep it in my cycles, and if I'm cruising, I try to keep it in if I'm able to get healthy blood work. If not, obviously it's outright a way. Some compounds that I had very negative experiences with. First, trend. I personally love trend. I love the way it makes me feel. But unfortunately, that is a selfish belief because the people around me, the people that I deal with on a regular basis and I loved ones like my girlfriend, she does not like me on trend. I'm way too business oriented, and I do start to neglect her or kind of see her like a piece of cardboard, like more like an object and not so much of a human being. Then we start talking about Nangerloon. Deca was the worst steroid experience of my entire life. I felt horribly depressed. I felt like all of my confidence was gone. Anything that I tried to do, I felt like I failed even if I wasn't really failing at all. The safe, the cautious, and be gentle with yourself as you go through this whole process. That's a vlog.

=== FILE: Negative side effects of Testosterone [tiU-hcenpok].txt ===

Never felt better. Seriously though, I can't say any more good things about it. So besides the injection pain, what are the actual side effects of TRT? Let's make this super simple. TRT stands for testosterone replacement therapy. It's the practice of using injectable testosterone to assist a body that doesn't make enough. Naturally, key word is replacement. When we start injecting testosterone, our natural production goes to zero. Now what consequences does that have? So natural testosterone production is closely tied to fertility and to particular size. So if you're not using fertility drugs like HCG or HMG, it might become pretty difficult to have kids in the future. Because we're all different genetically, some guys are more sensitive to testosterone than others, which means they might get issues on TRT doses where most guys don't. Even if you do run into issues on testosterone, Algo RX has all the prescriptions you would need to stay healthy on it. So blood pressure, heart rate, estrogen, anti-aging, fertility, they've got it all. You got it all.

=== FILE: People are impatient [kz8gjab-F_U].txt ===

=== FILE: Pros & Cons of Tr＊n ⚙️ [1AdUgrqfSvg].txt ===

What gear topic do you and Liz completely disagree on? Trend. Positive and negative. Negative. Oh, starting with the bad news. You have to. Negative is very business oriented, which actually can be a good thing. Very productive. He can be a little lazy at times. But the girlfriend kind of turns into not the girlfriend in more of an object, if he says. It's fine. Maybe little doses. I told him to completely take it out. But so no more trend for me, basically. If you guys are going to use it, keep in mind it will change how you see other people, even if it's your wife or your girlfriend. Yeah, she's right. It helps with my business and I get more productive. But that also means less girlfriend time. So, I'll be nice to you now.

It lost a legend in the peptide world. Research M is now indefinitely closed. Release this statement saying, all orders will be shipped out. They are no longer taking new orders. And their customer support will still be live for the next 30 days. A lot of you guys think that we just sold peptides and that was it. But it was so much more than a brand. The culture, everyone involved, it honestly felt like family. These guys are my brothers. These girls are my sisters. So I don't want to see any misinformation. They just said that they're moving on to bigger things. It's not an FDA shot down like a amino. Now that two of the biggest players in the space are gone, where do you go next? Straight labs has been my backup for a while now. If any of you guys have issues with them, you can always send them an email and they will fix the problem. I need you guys to understand that that is a temporary fix. The long term of the chemical industry is going to be a place like Algo. I know you love the gray markets. I'm the same way, but it's starting to get a little bit uncomfortable because we know that the government's collecting data on consumers. That means you. Please be patient. While I update all the links in my FAQ, if you guys want full guides on how to use these things safely and find reliable sources, you know where to go.

By the end of it, I could tell a difference. But during it, I just felt a little bit stronger. Honestly, no difference. I definitely filled out a little bit. Then afterwards, my strength kind of went away. And then I was like, okay, cool, great. My voice didn't change at all. The first time my voice is different now. When she got on real anime. Yeah, how is the second experience? We upgraded the quality. It's a lot better. Strength went all the way back up. Voice did change a little bit. And other ways nothing else changed. So that's good. But no negatives. Guys, no side effects. Staying down with those side effects. Yeah, that's about it. Let's go ahead and see if it's pretty much it. Yeah. Let's pretty much it. Do it.

=== FILE: Should you hop on ？ #tannertattered #gear #bodybuilding [6HH7MSeh3Fs].txt ===

Welcome to Cocktails and Chemicals. Today's topic. What is a good reason to get on gear and why did I get on gear? So we'll be talking about enhancement practices. Whenever we look at the enhancement world, we want to understand what value is it bringing to our life and is that a price that we're willing to pay? For me personally, I decided pretty early on that I was not going to be happy with a non-enhanced physique. The reason I got into bodybuilding in the first place was because I saw Ronnie Coleman, if you know what he looks like. I do know that I won't be able to hit a size like that, but somewhere between what a peak natural looks like and Ronnie Coleman would be a range within which I'm pretty happy. For those of you who are looking for just a good physique, maybe just a six pack, some abs, some cap delts, and an overall body that someone would consider athletic, you might not need enhancements for that kind of a goal. If your goal is to compete competitively, then you'll understand that all of your competitors are probably also using things to try and get ahead. There is no natural trophy, there is no lowest dose award trophy. Everyone is trying to do what they can to win the competition. And if you're not doing that, you might fall behind. Keep all of these things in mind as you start deciding about whether or not the trade-offs of antibiotics are worth it for you. To help you decide, I do have an are you ready for gear section in the FAQ in my bio. You can skip through those questions and make that decision about if it makes the most sense for you to get on or not. Cheers.

That's just one of those people that you see their content. You immediately know it clicks in your brain. This person is going to be huge. He was the same the Toby the way they spoke naturally in his videos. He had an actual sense of humor to him.

=== FILE: TRT = Shorter lifespan ？ #tannertattered #testosterone #trt #health [5crMzRAbLdQ].txt ===

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Cocktails and Chemicals. Today's topic is using gear, signing a waiver to a shorter lifespan. Let's talk about it. So as we start considering antibiotics, we need to understand that obviously our health is now being jeopardized to minimal or extreme degrees depending on our dosage. The devil is always in the dosage. So for using very aggressive dosages, we'd like to maybe compete on a national level or make it to the Olympia. We're going to be accepting a lot more risk than someone who just wants to look a little bit better every day or wants to feel a little bit better every day using something like TRT. We do understand in some studies that for example, TRT has no effect on mortality. Well, that's quite good, especially when the TRT dosages use in that study are up to 250 milligrams per week. That's pretty aggressive. From some of my mentors, they have commented things that 300 milligrams a week could be sustainable for most men until the end of their lifetime without any change on lifespan. Especially if you're controlling your blood pressure and your cholesterol. Now thankfully, gear users are actually more in tune with these markers than most humans are because we have to be so hyper vigilant about them. The average person when they're in their 60s or 70s, it becomes a chore to check their blood pressure or take their medications or whatever it is that they need to do to stay alive. Thankfully for us, if we hammer in these habits early, we know that taking care of our bodies just becomes part of our regular routine. In doing so, we actually might live longer and more fulfilling lives than everybody else. Please consider the risks very carefully as you start deciding to get on gear or not. That's a work.

What is the best long term half-naddy stack in strategy? Let's do some strategizing. When we're talking about being coming a half-naddy, we're going to be using things that will be artificially loose. Sauce, thrown, our performance, anything that we can get our hands on to get us some extra gains without legitimately being on steroids. So what do we start with? First thing I start with is just boosting your natural testosterone levels. We could do this with something like a diploma-fane, select the best from the set to the modulator. We could do this with something like HcG, LH-minetic, and then beyond that, we start looking at things that will increase our growth performance, MK677, GHR, Hume's like a propellant, hexarelling, CGC-1295, with DAX, GHR-P6. All of these options are in our toolbox and can be leveraged depending on your goals. So be sure to check out my FAQ for full guides on how I went to use it.

Rule of thumb, it's gonna be a lot better to just be open and honest about anything that you're deciding to do with your life. I get a lot of DMs. Let's say that guys are hiding stuff from their wives, or their children, or their family members, just don't do it. Just be open and honest.

Jim's wondering about my life before research end before I went viral before I am where I am today. So I don't think a lot of you guys have been here since day one, but if you have been, you would remember when I was making videos on TikTok talking about the very low hanging fruit topics of the fitness industry. Things like, is gearing a mutate you overnight? Is it going to make your organs explode overnight? Handling all of these topics was really interesting for me, but also very eye-opening in the sense that it allowed me to show you guys and debunk a lot of the really, really stupid myths in the industry. As time went on, I obviously built up a huge reputation. I've been able to help a lot of guys achieve success on their own cycles, help reduce inflamed blood markers, anything like that. Research end was really the catalyst of basically funding this lifestyle so that I was able to do it indefinitely. Because if they didn't come into the picture, they would have undoubtedly come a day where I would not have been able to do this sustainably. So to everybody that's used my code on research end, whether you got yourself a nice little treat, or you've been using things that they've put out in order to help keep yourself safe, I'm super, super ecstatic for you guys and I'm super, super grateful and thankful for everything that you've done. Because I'm now in a position today where I'm able to fund myself entirely with this as my day to day job. It is still insane to me and if there's any kind of content that you'd like to see me put out by all means, let me know.

=== FILE: Togi's new cycle ⚙️ #togi [uydRIH57_ds].txt ===

I've had a hundred tests, 300 pre-mo, a hundred EQ. I built that cycle for Togey. It's not something I give to everyone, and I have a lot of reasons why. People in the comments saying that they wouldn't use this, or they change this about it. Your genetics are not Togey's genetics, so although those changes would make it better for you, they would make it worse for this retar. One of the biggest considerations is that Togey has micrositosis. His blood cells are abnormally small, and they don't carry as much oxygen throughout his body. As a compensatory mechanism we're using EQ, and as an added benefit, he likes the way he feels mentally with a little bit of EQ in his body. Primo works best aesthetically for his genetics, delivering a little bit of fullness while also maintaining some graininess. We maximize that graininess with the occasional add-in of an oral steroid, depending on the context and what he's going on. Remember that Primo and EQ can't have downward pressure on estrogen. If it gets too low, he is going to suffer some symptoms, so we need to be careful with our ratios between those two, and it's a sauce for him. If you'd also like a cycle built for your genetics, just hop on a call with me. Let's make it happen.

=== FILE: Togis favourite compound #tannertattered #togi [bkxomThOzUI].txt ===

Let's talk about injectable super draw. Togis favorite compound. So if you guys are familiar with Super Draw, it is methyl draw standalone. Draw standalone is master on. It's basically the orally bioavailable version of master on. So why would we then take it and put it into an injectable form and then inject it into our bodies? And the answer is, because it's gonna offset some of that liver toxicity while also allowing us to use more. So for the same amount of liver toxicity, we can get more milligrams of injectable super draw in our body than we would oral super draw. Now keep this in mind. Super draw is a very stressful compound. We've seen this mess up liver values left and right. And so if you are going to be using something like injectable super draw, the number one thing I recommend. I wouldn't even say this is suggestion. I would say this is mandatory. Would be injectable L glutathione. It's going to be a very potent antioxidant that can dramatically help improve the outcomes of liver health in individuals that are using compounds as stressful is something like super draw. As far as the milligrams of dosing, you've want to start out at 10 milligrams per workout. And then you could maybe work your way up into 40 milligrams. Keep in mind this is genetics dependent. If you have the genetics to handle more, I'm not gonna tell you that I told you so, but 60, 80, I've seen these numbers before. Best of luck, please stay safe.

=== FILE: What did bro say at the end ？ 💀 #tannertattered #colorado #weather [xO60mnAwYSQ].txt ===

I've lived in Colorado for five years so I'm used to this but Dude, I was tanning a week ago. Just snowing everywhere. This happens all the time, but Can we get like a little bit of UV back? Maybe? Is it bad? If I say that I like my women, how I like my weather? Whitenfly?

=== FILE: What happens ？! #tannertattered #testosterone #fitness [gk_tKLgYbdU].txt ===

Silly question, but maybe not enough people know. What happens if you never cycle off? If you never cycle off of testosterone, what that means is you never stop injecting it. Maybe this individual is cycling other things along side to testosterone, which could put them in an unhealthy position. But for this example, say, let's just say testosterone. Well, if you're getting your blood work regularly, let's say every eight weeks or so, maybe four times a year at the absolute minimum, you would understand your health on a month to month basis. If you're getting your blood work done regularly, you'll understand what markers are out of range and need some help and what markers are in range and are completely fine. If you are able to keep most of those markers within range, at least the main problem markers, then you're not gonna have any problems. Tastastron can be run without any effects or impacts on your longevity if you are keeping your body healthy. A testosterone total number on blood work does not equate to an early death. Whether that's 2000 or 3000, the really important thing is, did you track your blood pressure? Did you keep on top of your RBC count? Did you make sure that your cholesterol levels are good, healthy, and overall, you're living a healthy lifestyle that's conducive to longevity. Keep that in mind, that's a vlog, you guys.

=== FILE: What is growth hormone ？ #tannertattered #growthhormone #gains [pbpVsrKaG3A].txt ===

Welcome to Cocktails and Chemicals. Today's topic, why should we start taking human growth hormone? Human growth hormone is something that's already produced naturally within the human body, and it's responsible for a lot of growth, especially the secretion of growth factors such as IGF1, IGF2, TNF, and other things. IGF1, you might have heard of, it does come in an injectable form. When we bring in HGH, one of the main concerns that we need to be aware of is how it's going to affect our fasting blood glucose levels. Our blood glucose levels are pretty good indicator of what our insulin sensitivity is looking like. We want to stay insulin sensitive on cycle, so that all of the nutrients that we're putting in our body are being allocated towards muscle growth and not so much towards fat storage. So to that extent, when is the right time to bring in growth hormone? You might see a lot of guys online say things like, oh, you can only use growth hormone once you're a pro, or you can only use growth hormone once you've reached your nati potential. Whatever these limitations are, there's no physiological change in the human body that all of a sudden allows it to handle exogenous growth hormone. You can bring in the growth hormone whenever you feel that you're ready. I personally feel, and in my own clients, that is a relatively safe compound and you can bring it in within the first couple cycles. It's not going to cause that many side effects except for water attention, which is something that you should be aware of, and you should adjust your dose accordingly as well as any other supplementation and diuretic practices. If you decide to go that route, in order to keep everything as healthy as possible. Best of luck.

Can I take to Adelphill just on its own? I'm 5'8, 250 pounds to make this a little bit longer than just saying, yes, yes, you can. And also, if you would like to use to Adelphill, let's keep in mind a couple things about using it. First, common side effect that guys will get from using to Adelphill is headaches or nasal congestion. These are pretty easily dealt with by just reducing your dose, but if you do notice that you're still getting side effects, on say 2.5 milligrams, 1.25 milligrams, you just might not have the genetics to handle to Adelphill properly. And that's okay. If you are the type of person that notices dizziness or faintness as you use to Adelphill, this is due to the vast of dilation, bringing your blood pressure way too low. Especially when you're training, this is not a good thing. The last thing we need is you crumpling like a lawn chair under the squat rack. So be mindful of that. Make sure that you monitor your blood pressure on a regular basis and decide if to Adelphill's right for you or not right for you. Now, on the other side of the spectrum, if you do have high blood pressure, Adelphill is a great way to actually lower it a little bit. Usually like 5, maybe 10 points if you're really lucky.

=== FILE: Why do celebrities take beta-blockers ？ #tannertattered [Kq1A504rJeU].txt ===

I look in the mirror and I go take that beta blocker girl. So why do celebrities and CEOs take beta blockers before they make public appearances? Let's dive into the science. And for guys on how to do all of this safely, make sure you check my FAQ. Beta blockers are named that way because they block the action of adrenaline on these things called beta receptors. When you block that adrenaline, it slows down the heart rate and reduces overall strain on the heart, which is why it's used as a medication for CVD. Now, here's where things get interesting. Even if you don't have cardiovascular disease, you can still use it to present as a cool common collected individual. Effectively, it's a chill pill. And doctors have realized this as well, given that they've started prescribing beta blockers to patients with anxiety, even though it's not FDA approved for that purpose. Just imagine all the scenarios where an abivolal could help you. Going on a date with a hot girl, don't want to be a ball of nerves. Got to present something to your boss, got a little bit of social anxiety, having a hard time calming down after a tough workout. All of these things. The end of law can help you with it.

=== FILE: Why so expensive ？ #tannertattered [YSFX9ubpVio].txt ===

So many of you have probably wondered why is Primo so expensive and is it really that good for cycle design? Let's talk about it. So Primo Bolin is a very interesting compound in that compared to basically every other anabolic that we have available. Its price is about 4x if not 3x or sometimes 5x in some cases. The reason Primo so expensive is partially due to the demand. I think a lot of educators online have definitely popularized the usage of Primo to the point where the price tag on that Primo has increased, and so many people are looking to get their hands on it. Now it doesn't help that the raw materials involved in the creation of Primo are also somewhat more expensive, but overall is the price worth the gains that you get from it. Well, if we assume that Primo being 4x as expensive as testosterone would mean that it should give you 4x as many gains as testosterone. Unfortunately, that is not true. Primo is definitely a good anabolic, but it doesn't really add as much more muscle, or that much more muscle compared to EQ or NPP or any of these other anabolic. Bottom line, if you do want to use Primo, you're typically using it because you value the safety largely of Primo compared to other compounds, assuming that your body is unable to tolerate the other compounds that I'm referring to. Be sure to check out the guides in my FAQ for how to stay safe on testosterone among other drugs, and I wish you guys the best of luck.

I kind of disagree with coaches that will push their clients into territory like mentally where they don't feel okay on a daily basis. Prep is aside because you know you kind of got to suffer a little bit. You got to feel good to look good to some degree.

=== FILE: is Togi cooked ？ 💀 #tannertattered #togi [iIlYcERYRQQ].txt ===

This is where I first found out the Twitch Max really weird. The level of estrogen at which he feels the best is also a level of estrogen at which he's a crew in Gain. Woah! Yeah, which is really bad. So when his estrogen's just low enough that his Gaino stops, like he stops getting the chinist, whatever he feels depressed, like he hit his head, his life, every day. That sucks. It's really bad.

=== FILE: 💉⚙️💊 #tannertattered #testosterone [1IFQSq8AL8c].txt ===

If you're almost at your natural potential and you hop on roads and then come off, do you lose all the gains that you've made? Let's discuss. So whenever you get on gear, you are going to be exposing your body to a brand new hormonal landscape. Whatever it was working with before, let's say your natural testosterone levels were 500 nanograms per vessel liter and then you get on testosterone and those levels go all the way up to say 1500, maybe 2000 nanograms per vessel liter. That is a three times, maybe four times difference that your body is not accustomed to. So any amount of muscle that you build in that landscape is an amount of muscle that can only be supported by that landscape. You can imagine it like a creature that is being brought into a new environment and it is built for that environment, it can survive there. But once that habitat changes, it can't survive there anymore. Just as your gains cannot survive in a low testosterone environment. So once you come off of that testosterone and you go back to your natural levels, the gains that you were able to sustain on 2000 nanograms per vessel liter are now unsustainable on 500 nanograms per vessel liter. There's a couple other factors to consider. Whenever you come off of exogenous testosterone, you are going to lose all that testosterone in your body as it's clearing out. It doesn't just go from 2000 back down to 500 comfortably. It goes from 2000 down to zero and then you need to use PCT drugs and if you don't use them wait six months until your testosterone levels come back to normal bottom line, any gains on gear cannot be sustained by a natty. There's a sprinkle that you'll keep but the rest is gone.
