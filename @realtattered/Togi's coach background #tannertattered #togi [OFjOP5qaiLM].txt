Jim's wondering about my life before research end before I went viral before I am where I am today. So I don't think a lot of you guys have been here since day one, but if you have been, you would remember when I was making videos on TikTok talking about the very low hanging fruit topics of the fitness industry. Things like, is gearing a mutate you overnight? Is it going to make your organs explode overnight? Handling all of these topics was really interesting for me, but also very eye-opening in the sense that it allowed me to show you guys and debunk a lot of the really, really stupid myths in the industry. As time went on, I obviously built up a huge reputation. I've been able to help a lot of guys achieve success on their own cycles, help reduce inflamed blood markers, anything like that. Research end was really the catalyst of basically funding this lifestyle so that I was able to do it indefinitely. Because if they didn't come into the picture, they would have undoubtedly come a day where I would not have been able to do this sustainably. So to everybody that's used my code on research end, whether you got yourself a nice little treat, or you've been using things that they've put out in order to help keep yourself safe, I'm super, super ecstatic for you guys and I'm super, super grateful and thankful for everything that you've done. Because I'm now in a position today where I'm able to fund myself entirely with this as my day to day job. It is still insane to me and if there's any kind of content that you'd like to see me put out by all means, let me know. You guys change my life and it's going to be my occupation to kick the bucket to change yours for the better. Talk to you guys soon.
