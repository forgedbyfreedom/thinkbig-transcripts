Welcome to the bedroom scientist where I talk about barely legal drugs. It's summertime so that means all the gym boys turn into the little sorority drugs, a surviving on nicotine in coke to get mean for the summer. Just use the tanning drug. Stop being a baby. Suppresses your appetite increases your sex drive. Makes you tanner. Makes you hotter. Could you ask for anything more? The catty without you did. I get face-bushing in my tummy. Just take less. Just don't use as much. You need to get serious for a second here. It does not cause cancer. Shut up! When UV light hits your skin, it causes damage. Pigmentation, protection against damage. Good! More pigmentation. More protection. Less cancer. I mean, where you drop on the head? As a child?
