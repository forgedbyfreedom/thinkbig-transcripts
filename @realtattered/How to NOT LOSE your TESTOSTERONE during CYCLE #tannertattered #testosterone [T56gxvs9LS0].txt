Hoping on EQ and tests in June, what can I take to keep up my natural testosterone during cycle? First of all, I got some bad news for you. That's not possible. If you're going to be injecting exogenous steroids, you can kiss your natural testosterone goodbye. You should understand that when you are using exogenous testosterone, you feed back loops in the human body. Understand it as, oh, I've already got enough testosterone. I don't need to produce any. And so it's going to take the outside testosterone that you're popping into your ass. And it's going to take the inside testosterone that your body normally would be producing shut all those factories off. So with EQ and testosterone, you should understand that depending on the ester of testosterone that you're using probably an antherior sipping a, that's like 5, 7, a half life. That's going to be in and out of your system in about 4, 5 weeks time. When you're using the Eccopoys, you should understand that the half life of that is about 14 days, which means it is going to take you some around 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, before the Eccopoys is completely out of your body. Now what does that mean? Well once it's completely out of your body, that's the point at which your body will start trying to produce testosterone again. But 2 and a half months after you stop all of your injections, then there's a chance for your natural testosterone to start coming back a little bit. Of course you can speed that up with PCT drugs, but I would say off the bat, you're probably not a candidate for PCT if you're using Eccopoys instead you would be better off switching to a cruise dose of testosterone something like 100, 200 milligrams a week. And then once all of the Eccopoys is cleared out of your body, that would be a good time to PCT from the testosterone itself. You can check out the PCT guides in the FAQ in my bio, wishing you the best of luck man.
