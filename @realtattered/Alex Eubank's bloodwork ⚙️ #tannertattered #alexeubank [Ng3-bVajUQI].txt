Alex U-Banks just dropped his TRC blood work. Let's take a look and see how he's doing. It's testosterone clocked in at 932, which is still in the natural range. How often he injects matters a lot. If he's only injecting twice a week, that number would be a lot higher on injection days, but a lot lower on breast days. If he's injecting every single day, it's going to be pretty stable right there. Blood glucose of 71 indicates pretty nice insulin sensitivity and that is pancreas is doing okay. Next two markers are out of range, so is he dying? What's going to happen? Blood urion nitrogen and creatinine typically are elevated in men who are doing heavy resistance training and eating a lot of protein. He's not dying. Kiddy marker, EGFR is just barely in range, so it would be a really good idea to get his system and see checked, which is a much more accurate reading. The rest is good until we get to his liver enzymes, AST and ALT, which are a little bit on my side. That either indicates that he's been having some recreational compounds, or he's been enjoying some oral steroids and hasn't told anyone.
