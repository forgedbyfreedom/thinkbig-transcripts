Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Cocktails and Chemicals. Today's topic is using gear, signing a waiver to a shorter lifespan. Let's talk about it. So as we start considering antibiotics, we need to understand that obviously our health is now being jeopardized to minimal or extreme degrees depending on our dosage. The devil is always in the dosage. So for using very aggressive dosages, we'd like to maybe compete on a national level or make it to the Olympia. We're going to be accepting a lot more risk than someone who just wants to look a little bit better every day or wants to feel a little bit better every day using something like TRT. We do understand in some studies that for example, TRT has no effect on mortality. Well, that's quite good, especially when the TRT dosages use in that study are up to 250 milligrams per week. That's pretty aggressive. From some of my mentors, they have commented things that 300 milligrams a week could be sustainable for most men until the end of their lifetime without any change on lifespan. Especially if you're controlling your blood pressure and your cholesterol. Now thankfully, gear users are actually more in tune with these markers than most humans are because we have to be so hyper vigilant about them. The average person when they're in their 60s or 70s, it becomes a chore to check their blood pressure or take their medications or whatever it is that they need to do to stay alive. Thankfully for us, if we hammer in these habits early, we know that taking care of our bodies just becomes part of our regular routine. In doing so, we actually might live longer and more fulfilling lives than everybody else. Please consider the risks very carefully as you start deciding to get on gear or not. That's a work.
