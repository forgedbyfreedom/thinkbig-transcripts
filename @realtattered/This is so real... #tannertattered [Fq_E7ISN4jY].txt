You don't appreciate the things you have until you lose them. When you get sick, all of a sudden you're like, oh please, I just need healing, I'll go back to normal. And then you're healed. And the day you're healed you're like, oh, I'm sorry for better. Hopefully that thing's over with. The next day, normal. You don't really thank you, you don't really pray appreciation over the fact that you have good health. There are a lot of things that you possess that you don't really and realize are complete blessings.
