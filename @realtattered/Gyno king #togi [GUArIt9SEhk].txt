This is where I first found out the Twitch Max really weird. The level of estrogen at which he feels the best is also a level of estrogen at which he's a crew in Gain. Whoa! Yeah, which is really bad. So when his estrogen's just low enough that his Gaino stops, like he stops getting the chinist, whatever he feels depressed, like he hit his head, his life, every day. That sucks. It's really bad.
