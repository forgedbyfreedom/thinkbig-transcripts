I've had a hundred tests, 300 pre-mo, a hundred EQ. I built that cycle for Togey. It's not something I give to everyone, and I have a lot of reasons why. People in the comments saying that they wouldn't use this, or they change this about it. Your genetics are not Togey's genetics, so although those changes would make it better for you, they would make it worse for this retar. One of the biggest considerations is that Togey has micrositosis. His blood cells are abnormally small, and they don't carry as much oxygen throughout his body. As a compensatory mechanism we're using EQ, and as an added benefit, he likes the way he feels mentally with a little bit of EQ in his body. Primo works best aesthetically for his genetics, delivering a little bit of fullness while also maintaining some graininess. We maximize that graininess with the occasional add-in of an oral steroid, depending on the context and what he's going on. Remember that Primo and EQ can't have downward pressure on estrogen. If it gets too low, he is going to suffer some symptoms, so we need to be careful with our ratios between those two, and it's a sauce for him. If you'd also like a cycle built for your genetics, just hop on a call with me. Let's make it happen.
