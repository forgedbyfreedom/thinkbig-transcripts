My client, Shane, you guys know him as Togey. From the get go from the first time I ever talked with Shane, he had a star factor. He threw a shot in the dark to try and see if I would respond to him. And I did the first couple things that he said, the way that he took advice and how he approached the conversation and he was very respectful. Always like being humble and saying thank you and everything along those lines.
