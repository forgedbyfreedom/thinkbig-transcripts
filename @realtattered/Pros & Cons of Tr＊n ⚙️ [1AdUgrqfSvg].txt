What gear topic do you and Liz completely disagree on? Trend. Positive and negative. Negative. Oh, starting with the bad news. You have to. Negative is very business oriented, which actually can be a good thing. Very productive. He can be a little lazy at times. But the girlfriend kind of turns into not the girlfriend in more of an object, if he says. It's fine. Maybe little doses. I told him to completely take it out. But so no more trend for me, basically. If you guys are going to use it, keep in mind it will change how you see other people, even if it's your wife or your girlfriend. Yeah, she's right. It helps with my business and I get more productive. But that also means less girlfriend time. So, I'll be nice to you now.
