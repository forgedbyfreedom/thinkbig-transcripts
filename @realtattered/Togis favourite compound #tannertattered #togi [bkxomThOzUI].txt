Let's talk about injectable super draw. Togis favorite compound. So if you guys are familiar with Super Draw, it is methyl draw standalone. Draw standalone is master on. It's basically the orally bioavailable version of master on. So why would we then take it and put it into an injectable form and then inject it into our bodies? And the answer is, because it's gonna offset some of that liver toxicity while also allowing us to use more. So for the same amount of liver toxicity, we can get more milligrams of injectable super draw in our body than we would oral super draw. Now keep this in mind. Super draw is a very stressful compound. We've seen this mess up liver values left and right. And so if you are going to be using something like injectable super draw, the number one thing I recommend. I wouldn't even say this is suggestion. I would say this is mandatory. Would be injectable L glutathione. It's going to be a very potent antioxidant that can dramatically help improve the outcomes of liver health in individuals that are using compounds as stressful is something like super draw. As far as the milligrams of dosing, you've want to start out at 10 milligrams per workout. And then you could maybe work your way up into 40 milligrams. Keep in mind this is genetics dependent. If you have the genetics to handle more, I'm not gonna tell you that I told you so, but 60, 80, I've seen these numbers before. Best of luck, please stay safe.
