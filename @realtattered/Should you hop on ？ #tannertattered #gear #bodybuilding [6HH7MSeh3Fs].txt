Welcome to Cocktails and Chemicals. Today's topic. What is a good reason to get on gear and why did I get on gear? So we'll be talking about enhancement practices. Whenever we look at the enhancement world, we want to understand what value is it bringing to our life and is that a price that we're willing to pay? For me personally, I decided pretty early on that I was not going to be happy with a non-enhanced physique. The reason I got into bodybuilding in the first place was because I saw Ronnie Coleman, if you know what he looks like. I do know that I won't be able to hit a size like that, but somewhere between what a peak natural looks like and Ronnie Coleman would be a range within which I'm pretty happy. For those of you who are looking for just a good physique, maybe just a six pack, some abs, some cap delts, and an overall body that someone would consider athletic, you might not need enhancements for that kind of a goal. If your goal is to compete competitively, then you'll understand that all of your competitors are probably also using things to try and get ahead. There is no natural trophy, there is no lowest dose award trophy. Everyone is trying to do what they can to win the competition. And if you're not doing that, you might fall behind. Keep all of these things in mind as you start deciding about whether or not the trade-offs of antibiotics are worth it for you. To help you decide, I do have an are you ready for gear section in the FAQ in my bio. You can skip through those questions and make that decision about if it makes the most sense for you to get on or not. Cheers.
