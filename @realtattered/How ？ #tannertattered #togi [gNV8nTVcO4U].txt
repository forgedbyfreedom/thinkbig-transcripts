I'm gonna hold your hand when I say this, training does not matter that much. Only 20 something days between these two pictures. His training intensity did not change. His diet and his droop intake changed. I coach Toki and I know his tolerance for pushing sets hard. The answer is he really doesn't push them that hard at all. So how does he look this good? Diet and droop. The bodybuilder Paul DeLet barely trained hard at all. There are so many podcasts of guys talking about how he basically treated the gym as if it was a joke. Other guys have the intensity their form is complete garbage and they still have insane physics. Like is Rital had a video on the exact same topic. Most bodybuilders don't really train that hard and how are they so big? I'm gonna break your heart and give it to you honestly. The most important thing to build a good physique is eating the right food and doing the right drink. You're better off spending 30 minutes in the gym and getting all your meals in than spending three hours there and screwing around with everything else.
