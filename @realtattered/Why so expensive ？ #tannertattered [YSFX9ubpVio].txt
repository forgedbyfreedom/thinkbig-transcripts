So many of you have probably wondered why is Primo so expensive and is it really that good for cycle design? Let's talk about it. So Primo Bolin is a very interesting compound in that compared to basically every other anabolic that we have available. Its price is about 4x if not 3x or sometimes 5x in some cases. The reason Primo so expensive is partially due to the demand. I think a lot of educators online have definitely popularized the usage of Primo to the point where the price tag on that Primo has increased, and so many people are looking to get their hands on it. Now it doesn't help that the raw materials involved in the creation of Primo are also somewhat more expensive, but overall is the price worth the gains that you get from it. Well, if we assume that Primo being 4x as expensive as testosterone would mean that it should give you 4x as many gains as testosterone. Unfortunately, that is not true. Primo is definitely a good anabolic, but it doesn't really add as much more muscle, or that much more muscle compared to EQ or NPP or any of these other anabolic. Bottom line, if you do want to use Primo, you're typically using it because you value the safety largely of Primo compared to other compounds, assuming that your body is unable to tolerate the other compounds that I'm referring to. Be sure to check out the guides in my FAQ for how to stay safe on testosterone among other drugs, and I wish you guys the best of luck.
