Doing Q&A with my girlfriend, Liz Lift. First question, how to hide gear from your girlfriend? You can't. Girlfriend's find everything out. You can try, but... You'll find everything out. Rule of thumb, it's gonna be a lot better to just be open and honest about anything that you're deciding to do with your life. I get a lot of DMs. Let's say that guys are hiding stuff from their wives, or their children, or their family members, just don't do it. Just be open and honest. Stop being a fake nanny, whether that's on the internet, or on your household. Better than that. Communication. Communication.
