Nobody wants nasty gyna. So here's how we can fix it. If you're ever experiencing any gyna-comascia or even the symptoms indicating gyna might start to show up, we're talking nipple puffiness, sensitivity, pain, irritation, any of that stuff, here's a couple things that we should bring in. First, you want to have a hormonal balance that is not conducive to gyna growth. That means your estrogen and your blacken levels should be just low enough that you're not causing any additional gyna. Once these hormones come into range, gyna will be incapable of growing in your body. The next step is if you already have some gyna, and you need to reverse that gyna that's already built up in your body, using something like relax a pain or to moxifin, select the best estrogen receptor modulators, can help to shrink that gyna tissue and eventually in a lot of the studies that we've seen, reduce that to nothing.
