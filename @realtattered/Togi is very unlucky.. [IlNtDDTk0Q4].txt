This is where I first found out the techniques for next really weird. The level of estrogen at which he feels the best is also a level of estrogen at which he's a crew in Gain. Wow! Yeah, which is really bad. So when his estrogen is just low enough that his Gain O' Stopp's, like he stops getting the H&S, whatever he feels depressed, like he hates life every day. That sucks. It's really bad.
