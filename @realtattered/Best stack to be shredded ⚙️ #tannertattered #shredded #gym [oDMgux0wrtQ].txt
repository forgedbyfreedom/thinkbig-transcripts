So like your questions like this a lot, it's best stacked to be shredded. Something you guys need to understand about using anabolic is that they're not exactly gonna make all of the fat fall off of your body and replace all of it with muscle. I don't even need to just not happen overnight. It's especially not gonna happen if you're diet and you're training and your cardio is not in play. You can't take an infinite amount of testosterone and expect to lose all that fat. There is no exact steroid that's all of a sudden gonna make you lean. I see this massive misconception with windstrawl making you shredded or anivar making you shredded. All of these things are really gonna do is once you are lean enough, you'll start to get a freaky or cosmetic look. Then you would have if you weren't using them. That's about it. Although technically there is some studies that would suggest that they do speed up the process, it's minimal. The real needle mover for that process is gonna be eating the right foods and getting on the damn treadmill. Go out there, do the work because the steroids don't work unless you do. Remember that guys.
