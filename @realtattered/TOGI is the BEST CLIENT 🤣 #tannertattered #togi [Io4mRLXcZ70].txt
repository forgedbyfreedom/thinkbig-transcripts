If you find a bodybuilder that's doing similar doses and I post a blood work like, you know, then their blood was in a person. But if you keep in mind that told you if doing Coke and eating completely off-plan and like, talk about it and whatever, every night, like it's just such a nightmare. I, you know, I told him, I know, obviously I'm gonna tell my clients, like, hey, you should probably help you die and not do drug every day. At a certain point it was so bad. Oh, so the change in my text messages, like, listen bro, like, I know you came clean of Coke, like, can you teach me how, like, can you actually help me, like, come clean?
