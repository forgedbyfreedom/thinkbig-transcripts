Some people have the spark and some people don't. My two case example might have best examples of this would be Sam Suilik and Toby. I was friends with both of them before they exploded. That's just one of those people that you see their content. You immediately know it clicks in your brain. This person is going to be huge. He was the same the Toby the way they spoke naturally in his videos. He had an actual sense of humor to him. He had a weird mysterious drive about him where he didn't want to get about no matter what obstacle is thrown his way. And he was very creative with the ways that he approached his problems.
