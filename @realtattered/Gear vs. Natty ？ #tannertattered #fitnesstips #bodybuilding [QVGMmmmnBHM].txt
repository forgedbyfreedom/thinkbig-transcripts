Fent Max Central, asking all around life benefits, gear versus natty. Let's get into it. So I honestly want to say it's going to depend on where you were naturally. If you already had good hormone levels naturally, everything was balanced, you were not experiencing any level of mental disorder. I would honestly say getting on gear probably is not going to change your life that much. Of course, more testosterone floating around in the human body, binding to receptor sites in the human brain, will undoubtedly contribute to some level of neurological change. Some guys are more or less sensitive to this than others, just genetically. What I noticed coming from my background, where I did have very low testosterone, and I jumped that from 300 nanograms for best leader total testosterone on blood work, 2,3,000. I noticed a lot of change. Self confidence went sky high. I felt a lot better about myself. I felt a lot more rooted in who I was as a person and what I actually wanted to do during my life on this planet. Now of course, that's like very large. And this isn't necessarily to say that I'm glorifying gear, but obviously I'm going to speak honestly about my own experience. So for anyone going into this for the first time, I would genuinely encourage you to be prepared for what it's going to be like when your hormones are now under manual control. Because not only is that a blessing, but it's also a very, very large responsibility. Make sure that you're reading the guides in my FAQ and educating yourself through my resources section, on how to stay as healthy and to try and do this as safely as you possibly can. That's of luck.
