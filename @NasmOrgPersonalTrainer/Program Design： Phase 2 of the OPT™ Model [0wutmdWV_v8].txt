Good afternoon everyone and welcome to NAS and live. My name is Prentice and I am here again with Wendy Bats and Marty Miller. How are you all doing today? Excellent. Thank you. And we have the man behind the scenes keeping everything together. Grig these behind the scenes. Not quite behind the Iron Mask, but he is a he waves hello to everyone and he's going to keep it together. He will answer all of your questions this afternoon or he will send us your questions to answer this afternoon. So let's get started. Today we are going to talk about program design in phase two. Our clients have come to us as a lump of clay and we are starting to slowly sculpt it to get to what's underneath, realizing their flexibility, their stability, strength and eventually power. So tell us what's going on when the in phase two what do we want to accomplish and tell us about our client today? Absolutely. Well, you know, last week we spent some time talking about the program design in phase one. So when a client came in, you know, what was the best approach on collecting the information and then doing the assessments that we saw fit based on their goals. So today, Marty and I wanted to go over a program design using phase two with the superset and this program, we will be performing exercises back to back in the resistance portion. So we're going to go over again some subjective information and then provide you with the assessment results and based on what we gathered how we came up with the program and that we will share this program with you. So you guys will be able to follow along with us as we talk about why we chose what we chose and then at that point either throughout the presentation or after the presentation, if you would like to print it, you guys have the chance to do so. Okay, so let's keep, let's cue this up a little bit and just tell us briefly and I know we've covered this and this information is in the book but why did we do the superset now and why do we choose the exercises that we do when what are we trying to accomplish with the acute variables? I gave you a lot there but I'm pretty sure that you got it. Sure, so in phase two we're working on strength endurance. So basically in the warm-up there's going to be a change we are still going to foam roll we are going to go from static stretching to active stretching again because maybe there are not areas that need to have the 30 second hold in order to get the proper length back into certain tissues. Now we're going to do more reciprocal inhibitions so we're going to relax muscles and then activate the opposing muscle to try to get better range of motion through the joint and then we'll go into our pre-warm-up. So again we are going to be doing core balance and plyo but again with a different approach to that and as we go through each section we can talk about what the differences are and then when we get to the resistance part when you're talking about a superset now what we're trying to do is not only focus on the stabilizers or the the small muscles that protect the joint but now we're going to really focus on building more strength in the prime mover. So that's what we do and then when we call it a superset again under the NASM definition we are talking about doing something that is stable with one particular muscle and then going into something unstable with that same muscle group. Okay, okay great so yeah that's that's an important information to get because there's different ways that just out in the fitness community with the way supersets are represented so we want to have everyone understand what we're trying to accomplish with with how we call supersets. So let's go ahead let's learn about if we go to the next slide we can learn about and talk about yeah let's talk about Greg. So our client's name is Greg Beth he's 35 years old and his occupation is the computer self-aware analyst so just knowing his occupation you know that he is sitting for majority at you know majority of the time in front of a computer so automatically think about some postural some typical overactive muscles that we may see with someone that has to do this type of work on a daily basis. What's sitting down with him we wanted to know some histories so with this particular client he's never played sports in high school or in college or anything outside of just playing with his with his twin voice and so he wants to you know he enjoys being active playing kids running around you know the typical things that you do as a parent and the past he has had low back pain and right shoulder pain but it has been consistent with a program for four weeks now so he he did go through a phase one four week program we did reevaluate this client and so because of that we have seen some changes in his assessment but he does not take any medication and once again when you look at his park you it should nothing to report that would give us any concerns that he is not ready to perform this type of program and his current goals are to lose 20 pounds again you know when you're asking a client about how much weight to lose you do want to try to see if there's a particular time frame with this particular individual he just says he wants to lose 20 pounds and he wants to again do it the safest and in best way possible so he did not you specify a certain time but he wants to continue to improve his fitness level and stay active with his kids so with this information you know Marty and I thought that you know based on what we're going to show you next with his assessment results that he would be be good for a phase two so let's go to the next slide and show you what we found so there we go for for this particular individual again you know there are a multitude of assessments that we could have done with Greg in the past and in the first four weeks when we had him the two that we chose to do were the overhead squat in the single leg squat so we wanted to reevaluate where he was could we start adding on other ones absolutely but you know we we got a good amount of information from just these two particular assessments alone so when he did his overhead squat again we had him remove his shoes we put him into the five-connected chain check points and then from that point we had him squat and what we noticed is he had very slight external foot rotation and his arms still did fall forward and then based on that information again we felt it was safe so we had him do the single leg squat and the only thing that we noticed was that he had a right side only inward trunk rotation and for those the view guys that are unfamiliar with that we actually put a picture of that on the slide and it's just basically as as this client went down into his squat he slightly rotated toward the leg that that was on the ground so as you can see he's rotating towards his right foot okay so now when you so let's let's paint that picture a little more when you say that he has slight foot external rotation and I'm I'm looking more into can you just elaborate a little more on had that was there an improvement was there an improvement in in that observation between his previous assessment to now what what happened there yeah so when he started and came you know came in the very first time we did his assessment his feet turned out I mean he was the typical it was very very noticeable I mean even in his static posture there was no I mean there was no denying that this this individual had extremely overactive lateral gas trucks and shorthead of the bicep film and so now when he did it we have been working with him again for four weeks he's very compliant so he does do things at home as well we went over at specific things for him to fomeral on his own so he's you know very compliant and then again we were seeing this individual anywhere from two to three times a week so that's how frequently he was coming in to see a trainer or seeing us and so when he did it this time they still I mean ideally when you're looking at someone again we're looking at the knee and the second third toe and do they stay in line and this time when he went and did his overhead squat there was just slight external rotation meaning that his feet when he would go out a lot of times kind of shift out but when he came up they almost straightened back out meaning straightened back into the forward position so he kind of and a lot of it too as as clients come in and they know what you're looking for because you have constantly been saying straight in your feet look at your feet you know correct your feet they start to realize what you're looking for so oftentimes if they feel that they're going to go out they will straighten it back up when they come up and that's just because they're brain and you kind of being in their head for so long that's that's kind of how it worked out for this particular client but we know that it's still there again it's not as extreme as it was we have seen a ton of progress over four weeks and so that's why we say slight because even as Marty and I have both talked and said over the last few weeks even if it's a little bit you want to note it because as they get tired it could become more of an issue yeah of course and of following up on how we categorize slight and I get this question quite often and I'm sorry I'm going to do this early just get it out of my system this is a curve ball and this is for both of you do we have let me see if I can ask this properly it you can decline to answer if it's not asking appropriately but we have a reference a reference a point of reference in which we can classify slight moderate severe when we're looking at these compensations in the overhead squad assessment so how would you like how would you categorize this slight as opposed to moderate and I know you know but can we help the people listening understand what that means was sure I mean for me I mean again anything that kind of deviates from the second third to so for me if it's slight it's anywhere slightly from the big toe maybe a little bit past the big toe again you know everyone to their own because again any deviations should be noted obviously if it's their turned way out that would be more severe moderate would be well they kind of I mean they go out they stay out and then for me if there's any kind of movement and there's I mean again it's better safe than sorry and it's other stuff we can continuously be working on and this particular individual again wasn't noted in the in the subject of information but he does where dress shoes when he goes into the office so I know that he is in a high heel if you will pretty much majority of the day Monday through Friday anyway okay okay yeah thanks for that thanks for that explanation because that always comes up well how do we classify what makes it what makes it slight what makes it severe what moves it up or down the the priority when we get into the program design a little bit later and a big thing is as you want to you want to notice too where did he start and where is he at at this point and if you're seeing I mean we saw a ton of progress just in four weeks and ideally four to six weeks is when you would reassess so if we didn't if we waited maybe even another week or two we may not see any however I wanted to note it because it was there okay sure and in practice the one thing and when he did such a great job covered the only thing I would add in my this is my own way I do it is you'll I can watch at what depth the compensation starts so let's say early on in their squat their foot started out what compensation is even if I'm start starting to see it and it's getting less but if they're now loading themselves more and having better control and deeper versions of the squat to meet at still progress okay you could judge you know how much more stress is on the muscular system as they run into the squat so those are another little ways to add on to see if people are improving and that's exactly what I was trying to get at and you all did it you both did it master masterfully we just there there are some things there are little nuances that you're going to to look for to be able to to track progress to have that and so that influences your programming in a certain way so thank you for that explanation and I will let you both continue. Which sure so now that we've gathered the assessment results again we could maybe start doing more dynamic or assessments and stuff with him at this point however again we want him to just start to go through maybe phase two and then later on maybe add in different assessments if we want to move him up the OBT model like if he wants to continue training to get to like a phase five however at this point we feel like we got some some great valuable information now again people are you know may say but there are still some compensations why would you put him in phase two why wouldn't you keep him in phase one and again this is really up to the trainer however because we have seen such progress from in just four weeks and we are still going to be working on stabilization in phase two Martin I both felt that this individual was a good candidate to start him in phase two even though there were some slight compensations noted okay and just again to to be clear and I know that we've all talked about this before and I've actually spoken about this with one of the members on our advisory board Matt Jordan but we the cousin patterns that we find ourselves in during the day during the day and with our our sports etc we're never a hundred percent never a hundred percent compensation free compensation free and I think that's one thing that sometimes sometimes it's difficult to to understand but we want to get as close to as close to ideal as possible what are your thoughts about that? I'll jump in so you know the other thing too is when we're looking at the strength and endurance you know when we start to add the strength and program you'll see that the exercise is that when the nitpicked are very targeted so that's still going to help correct the sort of movement this functions that he may have and so again we don't want people to stay in corrective and stay with us training forever it's just you know with my sports medicine background how I always thought was if somebody was within 90 percent of ideal we did very very well it doesn't have to be at a hundred percent of ideal but we want about 90 percent of ideal so I think those factors really help us then you know we we're not adding in here that we could do a very specific target of corrective exercise program as part of the warm up and then moving to the face do we're just going to do this as a phase to program so that was kind of you know the thought process behind it and you can see from the assessments and now that we move into the program how we try to accomplish that and another over-hand money no no go ahead I didn't see on camera so I just want to make sure that you should let go of that yeah one thing to add in as well I mean phase two to me is one of the hardest workouts in an individual can do in the model I mean phase five is extremely challenging as well don't get me wrong however because this is a new type of training that many people are unfamiliar with with the super set component that we could undulate it as well so if Greg again he's a two to three or time a week two to three times a week coming into trainer on Mondays we could have him do you know a phase two on Wednesdays we could go into a phase one again to still work even more on just the stabilization and then again on Friday we could do a phase two so so we can still remember revisit phase one just to solely focus on compensations but to Marty's point I mean we're still going to target this program to what we found as well okay okay perfect and that's that's another thing that that I wanted to make sure everyone understood is that you you still have to allow your your clients to to progress and if they're within ten I've even heard people were a little more liberal with that 10 15% of ideal of what ideal is it's okay to progress them just as long as the stuff that you're doing with the warm up and some of the CES content is still targeted and you're still working on motor programming and that aspect as well so if we're are we ready to find out what you how you programmed for for Greg. Sure so so what we decided to start with is we're going to perform the self-mile facial rolling the areas that we're going to target are the calves of course bilaterally by lateral TFL and Lats and Marty if you want to go into detail online yeah I mean we know what he had before we're still seeing that slight foot turning out and then with that TFL you know when we see that for that internal rotation or trunk internal rotation you know you're going to see a little bit of a forward spine with that position and that really tells us that the glutes aren't really ready to accept the full load of his body went on a single leg so that hip flexor complex is still going to be a little bit overactive and then with the foot turning out the TFL is associated with that and then due to his arms falling forward we wanted to hit the lats. Yep and then from there we went right into active stretching again that is active stretching is what we do in phases two three and four so under the the strength kind of block and we chose bilateral calves hip flexors and lats Marty. Yeah so we're going to stick with the same muscles that we targeted in self mouth fashion lease and when we're doing the active you were going to look at you know we did one set with eight reps at a medium tempo and you're going to hold each stretch for one to two seconds so I'll just use the example of a hip flexor I'm going to drive into hip extension by firing my glutes that obviously when I fire the glute has to inhibit the hip flexor the muscle on the opposing side of the body so you can look at it almost as a targeted warm-up or targeted activation of the muscle that you want to fire and but that is still a stretching technique now since when he brought up the other parts that you can undulate there's nothing wrong if you had the time where he could have foam rolled and did his static first then moved into the active we didn't put that into this workout but that would not be wrong especially since we know there's a couple small little compensations we might want to work around so again there's another way you could have built through the continuum but we chose to go right from the foam rolling right into the active for this example yes and then obviously you know after we inhibited and and and activated through active stretching you know now we're going to go into the actual activating of the muscles of the core and balance and so we'll we're talking about phase two you know the difference forward we're a core remember and and there was little to no motion of the spine and that's when we did the bridges and the planks and those types of exercises well now in phase two we're going to add a movement of the spot of flexion and extension of the spine so we're working more of the global muscles and so we chose the bulk crunch and then a ball back extension and because we have worked with Greg we know that you know he's able to kind of move in different planes of motion because we targeted some of different types of exercises in phase one again if you've never worked out with the client before you may want to hold off on the rotation for example in the back extension but wanted to to note that as well okay and now moving so let's talk about that single like squat for a second and all of you are familiar all of you familiar with the the pistol squat and if you if you aren't you can when we're finished with all you can contact me on in the ram and I'll have it as a stupid human now it's actually good exercise I I kid about that that something that I do like when I'm doing a body kind of a phase five routine but why do we not want to do a squat of that nature and why do we opt for the single like squat as it's referenced here please try and I'm already out throw it it was for both of you okay it was for both of you but I will let's and you answered first Marty the question is yours looks like a hit the buzzer first what you're saying yeah you hit the buzzer first Alex tell me pistol like boss for 200 this is what so it is a cool movement that you see on instagram except for is it friends I'm not opposed to it would we we would throw any SN hats on we're going to say okay why do we need to do it if we do it what's going on in the kinetic chain is that appropriate for what we're trying to accomplish so with the people that can do it under slow control you got great mobility of your ankle I'll tell you that much yeah I could not do that just I do not have the mobility my ankle so I'm impressed when people can do it under control but when I see what's going on in the movement pattern is what's going to move them in and out of those positions that's where I start to say okay the why so if I'm solely trying to get our client here stronger on a single leg and getting him in to be able to triple flexion triple extension I'm always going to stick with a single like squat now when you watch someone do the pistol squat there's nobody on the planet that can get you know what to grasp I'm going to say it here without moving out of their five kinetic chain you have to go into a deep posterior rotation of your pelvis at some point it'll be different for everybody but you have optimal hit range motion you're going to have 110 115 degrees of hit flexion at that point your femurs not going to move your posterior going to post your tilt and tuck under it's really cool to like I said to see people be able to control that but when you tuck your pelvis under that radically your glutes are not going to be the prime move anymore and when you come on your ed up your magnet really has to fire and then if you look at if my glutes not involved nearly as much and I'm going to post it or tilt any load that you might be carrying is going to put more stress on the lumbar spine so again you just have to weigh these things in is it cool to watch is it something I've always wanted to do like a muscle up to a accomplishet or am I really improving my human movement system by doing it so those are the two factors I'll you will make your decision on what you think's most appropriate but if I'm trying to teach people how to move properly to eventually get into the power phase or other strength phases where I might load their squat pattern I need them to be able to maintain neutral spine and make sure their glutes are really doing a lot of the work and then I've always said as an athletic trainer in my head it's wrist reward what exercise give me maximum reward with the least amount of biomalcanical risk so again I'm always going to lean towards keeping their spine in that neutral position and to add on to that I mean it's extremely hard I mean to be able to hold your your other leg out I mean it does require a lot of strength in your hip flexors which you know again with with this particular client he is in a seated position even though he didn't have any any compensation he's in a seated position for you know multiple hours so he may not have the strength to really perform that without compensation and the one thing that I can add you know I know a couple of you've heard this you know if you're on the webinar from before and when the imprentice you've heard this a thousand times you mean is I'm okay with people doing sports I didn't mix martial arts not safe biomalcanically it's that's not why I did it I did it because I enjoyed the competition of it and but my job in the fitness in my mind is get myself moving is properly as possible so when I go do crazy or stuff my body can handle the stresses of it so I must allow you know the squad that we're talking about here the pistol squad those are more sport like movements in this like handstands etc so I'm not afraid to build people towards getting better at those but it's not a primary focus of my human movement strategies that's that's my philosophy so I'm speaking for myself on this one but that's kind of how I justify some of these unique movement patterns versus what I'm going to talk about and restore an ideal proper human movement okay thank you both for for that explanation and yeah absolutely boils down to understanding what you're trying to accomplish number one we're trying to develop balance trying to develop balance and proper movement patterns off that single leg risk to reward and then restore know what you're doing and is it acceptable is it going to move the mark for you in your training oh well this you can take this off both both of these uh both of these questions seem like they're for me so uh have a moon and then if I pronounce your name improperly please forgive me and thank you for watching joining us today a moon wants to know want us to explain bilateral what do we mean when we say bilateral and we're going to go back to latin school you know I've never took latin in school but I'm just making that up but we have that one word by and lateral on lateral meaning on a side on a side and we have that by meaning two sides so when we say we're doing an exercise by labyrinth that means we're performing that exercise it's usually when we're doing it with a dumbbell we're doing that exercise on both sides of the body so whether that's and it's a thinnet becomes a differentiator if we're doing a scaphtion for example or let's take the squat pattern we could perform that unilat really we could do the single leg squat or we could do it bilateral or just the squat both feet down on the ground and that kind of works for every exercise and Melissa Melissa wants to know and thank you as well for joining us today Melissa I guess this is for the entire panel what do you think about the pistol squat on a suspension my opinion is that it's okay invited that again under what you're trying to accomplish with the exercise we we never want to be in the position of doing an exercise just for the sake of that exercise we actually want to have rationale behind it if you're if you've owned the strength the the mobility is already talking about to do this movement and you understand the risks and reward to associated with it it's perfectly fine it's perfectly fine to do know how you want to use it make sure that your staying is safe as simple and go for what do you say about it if I was going to say nothing changes from what I said before the only thing is the suspension trainer is a teaching it so if somebody really wants me to get them to do it and they have the right rationale to do it and I've decided that okay this is why we're doing it and they need they're not ready to do it yet without the suspension trainer you know the suspension trainer is a to get them to do it without it but mechanically in the reasons why I would or when do it did not change it's just the suspension trainer now gives me another ability to progress it so that way but by mechanically nothing changed right okay Wendy I'm the same way I mean again I I don't see anything wrong with somebody performing an exercise as long as it's safe so there are some exercises that you know that we see could be very harmful because of just the positioning of different joints but if if Melissa enjoys that type of exercise and she's getting full gluten quad activation she's getting out of it what she needs to there's good mobility in the ankles and the five kinetic change checkpoints she can stay within alignment and it's it's something that that client or herself enjoys then go for it all right and finally for this round of questions Paul Paul wants to know and thank you for joining us today Paul if someone has bad ankles and I think this is a question for you Wendy if someone has bad ankles what replacement would you use for the single leg squat assessment or maybe this was for Marty let's go for it well I mean I think I think again you want to keep it safe and so when you mean bad ankles is it bad ankles because of a lot of ankle springs or something like that or is it bad ankles because they had a plate put in like you know there's there's multiple ways of bad so I mean if Paul there's something more specific you can you can provide than maybe we can give you a better better answer but again if that client cannot do a single leg squat I think it was assessment that you asked about then I wouldn't do it you know then at that point just do the two legs get the information that you need and then and then continue to design a program that's beneficial for that individual okay great thank you for that so let's and I don't want to speculate for you Paul but let's go ahead and do this and this is for both you Marty and Wendy so let's take two cases someone who has that chronic instability chronic spruce and has all of the inhibition and spasm that will come with that or let's take someone now when we say and Paul is clarifying that it's a left inversion let's inversion spring and inversion injury okay so there's that case chronic instability chronic ankle spring inversion springs and then let's take someone where they may have a truly bad bad ankle like rheumatoid arthritis where you eat that does that autoimmune condition affecting all of the joints so let take those cases and talk through a possible assessment for that person well to me I don't think there would be any changes I mean I wouldn't assess them then single leg a if it's the arthritis candidate and it causes pain we definitely don't want to cause pain to your clients and again you can gather a lot of really good information on two feet you know just doing the overhead squats if if you could and you feel comfortable maybe doing go any a metric or some of the new mobility assessments that we really go into detail about in the CES that can actually give you some better idea on range emotion in that particular joint again if somebody is unstable because of ankle springs no matter what type of spring it may be again I may not assess them utilizing the single leg squat however balance training would be extremely important in phase one to really try to work on this stability component of the of the ankle itself the arch alignment and the muscles that protect the joint so so that's my answer Marty I don't know if you have a different thought process no so just to add a little bit to it because you know we're completely agreement is you know I've trained every type of individual so I've had people with total ankle replacements you can just do a single leg balance assessment just you know having by something that's safe that they can touch or they know they put their other foot down and you be surprised when they stand on a single leg all of a sudden their knee starts wobbling well you can now speculate what do you think's gonna happen if they ever had to hinge from that hip and put more pressure on to that joint we do to you know the low category of course you're gonna see more faulty equipment patterns so that's where you can start looking at what you're seeing on two leg which you're seeing with the mobility and then start to put the piece of the puzzle together and then same thing with your ankle inversion hopefully if you're in this webinar as a fitness professional they've gone through a rehab because it's so important to rehab so don't just rest it and let the information away because we could get into the statistics on how quick the gloomy media shuts down the reoccurrences the lack of range of motion so if they want through that process and they're coming into fitness you should be able to hopefully do some type of single leg now if you cannot do a single leg squat assessment on a younger athletic person who had an ankle spring previously that might be a red flag going hey you're not you're not back from this yet so that could be a time to sit to refer them back out because you know so to begin there's a little bit of gray area there but if there's normally a healthy individual but two weeks ago they just bring their ankle and they can't do a single leg squat assessment that might be time for you say you might not be fully back from that yet okay so thank you for those explanations and Paul I hope that cleared up that question for you but let's start let's continue working down to template we're going to do some skill development and resistance training and when details why you why you picked what you did in both of these blocks now again considering that we have already been working with this individual for four weeks and we know that he's super active with his clients I mean I'm sorry with his kids and he's he's out running around with them and catching we know that he's a good candidate you know that's one of the the reasons that we feel very comfortable with doing some type of play and in a repeating fashion now with that bit being said we want to move him out of just the sadgital plane so we you know we could have the client do squat jumps and sadgital and then at the same time maybe do some sadgital some frontal some transverse and again maybe it's you know you know just a few reps per time like when per I'm sorry per plane for the very first set or they could do two or three sets and different planes it's really up to you but we would actually have this individual do frontal plane and transverse plane squat jumps okay one thing that I see that's missing there is the fall prevention post stepping on Lego has kids I think that should be an important skill but go ahead and carry on let's talk about resistance training yes well so again you know what we have you know Marty and I am very often term this is the pre warmup so again they've done you know two sets anywhere from you know 12 reps or eight eight a piece depending on what what they're doing they've done they're warmed up their bodies ready to go we now put them into the actual quote workout which is the resistance portion so just to clarify core balance and plyo and phase two does not have to be supersetted that's just warming the body up for the superset routine that we're going to do under resistance and so with that being said we wanted to start with a total body exercise combo and so we paired up the deadlift to bicep curl to alternating overhead press along which which is done on a stable surface so he's on the floor on two legs and then we are going to have him immediately go into a single leg Romanian deadlift to a single arm scapcion and Marty you want to go into why we chose that yes so again the first exercise is to really attack those type two muscle fiber types get those kind of fatigue so that way when you go into your second exercise and superset you're primarily really working on those endurance that type one so the reason we did the deadlift to curl to alternating overhead presses we love that hip it you know the hip pinch patterns it's great you get some core stability in there because obviously he's maintaining his five Canadian chain checkpoint and then we decided because there's still a little bit of the lat-typeness to go to one arm overhead press alternating because when you put both arms overhead you're going to need full range motion of the lat so this is kind of what we call our work around we can still add in that overhead press but we're not requiring as much mobility due to this that's still something we're working on and then the single leg Romanian deadlift again similar pattern but now we're on one legs and now we're getting more you know the entire leg that's keeping us in balance from the foot all the way through the hip and obviously as I do a single arm scapcion now I have to have more balance through my core where if I had both arms out you can kind of use that in a sense like a teeter daughter so there's more core required met when you're doing the single arm so that's again for those that have been on with us here for a while you know when you like to sneak stuff in and in this program you're going to see that we provided rep ranges I mean when you're designing your own personal program you want to pick a an actual rep and then that's your target rep so we wanted to provide you guys with the actual anywhere from eight to twelve um to in order to to really focus on the strength endurance however when you're designing your program choose anywhere from eight to twelve and then after we did the total body we went right into working the chest so for this particular individual we are having him do a floor pushup again you're going to look at his tempo um so when he's doing his tempo he's at a two zero two so two seconds down and two seconds up and there are continuously maintaining the proper alignment but that's the that's the tempo that for that exercise and then he immediately is going to go into a ball chest press okay that's good and just a word about the ball chest press want to just give a disclaimer or warning for everyone out there just make sure that your client has the the the the wreck the requisite control to stay on a ball and press at the same time if you have if you have these tools available there other things available like the the bozu or even the leave that's the terracore terracores another thing that provides similar uh similar instability challenges for you that you could use and it may be it could be a good regression to doing a chest press off of a stability ball. Yes and a great point and then again you know we know that he's ready for this stuff you know because he's gone through four weeks and phase one so we've done a lot of ball things but great great point and then we're gonna go right into the back and so again a one arm dumbbell row again we're still following the two zero to two two tempo and he's immediately going to go into a single leg two arm dumbbell row as well and um Marty I don't know I mean I mean obviously we're targeting the back I don't know if there's anything you want to throw it up. No we just like the single leg two arm row because again we can save a little bit of time you know we'll do the one leg the first set the second leg another set and then the third set if you're doing the if you went into the third set you can decide which leg needs more work or you can go half the reps on each but you know to try to again you know be efficient with their time but it's a tremendous amount of core work because again we're always gonna be focusing on that spine and that hip positioning the chin tuck position just like on this stability ball chest press he thinks he's doing a chest press exercise and we're getting a ton of core work in because everything has to be in those five kinetic chain and then the the last um grouping that we did was a frontal plane lunge again he did sagittal plane single leg squat touchdown or a single leg squat excuse me under balance and obviously then went into working a lot and focusing a lot on the the deadlift so again in the sagittal plane so I wanted to take him out of sagittal movement to the frontal plane so he did a frontal plane lunge and then immediately followed that up with the side step up to balance and Marty I don't know if you want to add anything to that because working with him for we wanted to get something in the frontal plane not to keep everything sagittal so that frontal plane lunge is great you know make sure he has good control and then go right back to similar pattern but instead of a lunge we just went back in the regression one and went to a step up because again in that way it's a little bit lower not quite as much triple flexion triple extension but similar movement patterns but now we can really have to slow it down and really go into that slow control longer tempo and and Princess is just Marty and I actually had a really we had a fun time designing this program for this client and we actually spent a lot of time talking about the rest because in the textbook it says you know go from strength right into stabilization and then rest 60 seconds and Marty and I both have the same philosophy and mindset however you know based on time and based on this particular client Marty I don't know if you want to talk about our conversation but I thought it was I mean I enjoyed it so you know how we put the whole program together or now just when we talk about the rest you know the zero to 60 or so we we look at it you know interesting thing now with our COVID situation this might be where we would maybe shift off this vertical load because in a vertical load you're looking you're going from one thing to another to another kind of moving around the entire gym in the past you know that was kind of finding acceptable people may not want to do that nowadays and now we've always taught two ways to do it but this was the conversation when and I were having earlier so if we went more of a horizontal load where we're doing just you know the total body to total body rest 60 seconds total body total body rest 60 seconds total body total body and then we're done moving on to the chest or whatever it's it's they're both strength endurance programs it's just if you had a categorized and my focus really on the strength endurance of a muscle group or movement pattern or do I want to do strength endurance where I'm bringing it some total body conditioning so again this is something you have to wait if you're really focused if let's say they're a marathon runner you're like this person does not need to elevate their heart rate so I'm going to focus really on maybe what their weakness is which is really hitting these body parts one at a time absolutely go horizontal not a problem at all but if you want to sneak in some total body conditioning and more color expenditure and keep your heart rate up you might go more the vertical route so they're both very very applicable it just depends on what you want to accomplish but I have a feeling temporarily going out of this coming out of the COVID going back in the gyms I might purposely do horizontal for a little bit and just keep people okay we're going to be on this bench with our dumbbells and our stability ball we're going to do all three sets we're going to clean it up why you know you go drink a water and then we're going to go to the next body part so they're both phenomenal workouts it just depends on what you're trying to accomplish and now what's the environment that you're training in yeah yeah absolutely there's always multiple ways to to finish a program and yeah that's a good example there's when you're working with the marathon runner probably their challenges and I'm sure all of us have worked with marathon runners before it isn't there it isn't their cardiovascular fitness so we may we may want to we may want to help them in strength and building more local strength endurance to help them bring that back into their their running technique and so on and then there are people who just don't have time for additional cardio or hate cardio like the present company unless it's involved in unless there's some jujitsu martial arts involved so this may be a way to help get those extra days of cardio by doing the program vertically so more than one ways to handle that it just depends on the person like Marty's saying it depends on the person who's in front of you and your environment so now let's go ahead Wendy now I was going to say and then when you look at the the template I mean obviously you'll still see clients choice um for this particular client you know we're very lucky because he's like whatever you want me to do that's my choice like he doesn't have something specific however if you look at this workout it is a very very challenging workout that is pretty much targeted every muscle in his body so we didn't seem that you know it didn't seem that we needed to add something in however if somebody wants to just poke target the triceps or target you know maybe even the mediocre calf because we noticed that his feet were still slightly turned out we could add those exercises in this part it's just we left it as optional because again with this client and trying to keep it within 60 minutes we felt that that he was this program was good as is. Yeah perfect and I would I would just say the break we're heading into Memorial Day weekend that optional should be tricep press downs and curls you have to priorities my friend priority well he did and he did a bicep curl with the deadlift in the total body so just be that in mind as well can never do enough you can never do enough of that but Camoon has now asked this for both of you whoever shines in first how moon wants to know what about the renegade row would that be a phase one or a phase two exercise that's an it depends question for me it depends on it depends on your athlete and what they're able to do and then for those of you who don't know what a renegade row is it's getting into a push-up position on arms extended plank on two dumbbells or kettlebells and doing a row while holding a plank position doing a dumbbell kettlebell roll or holding a perfect plank position some people do a push-up in between each rep but what do you say about his phase one or phase two question I personally use this more of a stabilization it's an advanced stabilization exercise for sure so you need to make sure or you know when I've done it with my clients they need to make sure that they they pretty much quote own a a very good plank as well as a 41 count push-up so as long as they have both of those pretty dialed then I absolutely add that in and again when they're in phase two if they've gone through four to six weeks with me in phase one I know that they're ready for that so I could have him do a one-arm row and then go into a renegade row as a stabilization choice okay and Marty what do you when the of course but to add you know some of the different thought is if I really need the e-centric on the back portion the exercise I'm not going to use a renegade row because the odds of someone be able to do a four to two one tempo with the holding that high push-up on one arm so another way I might use it outside of a Wendy said would be maybe as a dynamic warm-up as we're going into proper power phase giving some light dumbbells because it's again it's so hard not impossible so hard to control a four-second e-centric on a renegade row so if they can do it that's phenomenal but just another way to think about it is you could let them go it a little bit more of with the tempo you tend to see if you're not training with someone like Wendy who's really going to be spot on with it and then use it kind of like in a dynamic warm-up okay so two very good options two very good thought processes for you how moon to use that renegade row in your in your training programs so now we're ready for Greg to cool down and his cool down should look familiar yeah so we did have him foam roll obviously the calves TFL lats which is exactly what he did in the warm-up and then you'll notice that we went from an active stretch which is to prepare his body and before he got started which again is using more reciprocal inhibition so now we're trying to get the you know proper resting length back into the tissues that were used and so we had him statically stretch his calves, his hip flexors and his lats okay now regarding the cool down in the order in the order of modalities here does it matter if you foam roll first or static stretch does the order when you're in the cool down phase of the workout Wendy? Well to me I obviously want to try to get the lean straight foam roll because again I'm just trying to kind of flush out the muscles kind of you know basically just try to get the better chance of a better stretch so I would say foam roll first and then statically stretch last. Okay okay so we are really that's a great program and well let's has Greg gone through this already. He has actually so this is a workout that he has completed and yes it can be done within an hour. Yes okay so then my next question is in my final question about this is when you did your when you reassessed what did he look like? Reassessed after him after completing phase two. He looked like he was drenched first of all and so so you know how he came in he was dry and ready to go he left exhausted but he you know again you know we're going to foam roll again he foam rolls I actually do his stretching techniques at the end as well but I didn't put him through an overhead squat assessment or reassessed his actual alignment but you know as long as the client feels that they got a really good workout you know that they're leaving walking straight and you know not walking out with some major compensations like that's that's a good workout. Okay okay perfect so now we're at the end of the hour and we can actually go to that next slide just the mark and anyone has questions now time to ask this before ask your questions before when the and Marty go away for Memorial Day weekend so and while we're waiting for other questions to come in Marty what's your what are your takeaways from today's session. Just like I can pretty much say every week let the model do the work for you just really hone in on how you program accordingly like for example is that Renegade wrote a lot of different ways you can use it you can use it as Wendy said you could use it as I said so it did just like really trying to fully understand why the model is put together this way it does the work for you you just have to do the assessments properly make sure you follow the solutions table through the different phases pick the right exercises we gave you some different examples of the wise and then it will start falling to place beautifully before you and then you know get creative with it is always a science is still applied. Okay thank you for that and we'll get to the get to your information on the final slide but Wendy what's your what are your big takeaways from today? Well I think you know Marty did a great kind of recap of everything I think that the big thing is don't don't pigeonhole and exercise you know think about what what makes you know be creative in your programming follow the acute variables because again we're looking for specific adaptations that's why we do the tempos that we use that's why we give you the rep range so therefore we're working specifically on the stable is it or may not excuse me the strength and endurance however if you want to use a Renegade wrote use it if you want to use the TRX use it you know just just think about like you know what purpose is this supposed to be strength this is supposed to be a stabilization exercise and then and then you know maximize you know the client output make sure the five candidate change checkpoints stay in line that makes sure that they put own the exercise while they're performing it and if you need a regress a progress do so again make it safe but but have fun with it again be creative but make sure it makes sense. Okay and finally we can I think this will just let you read your information off and tell let's start with you since you since you just finished up when you how can and you're first on the slide how do we find you? Sure to email me you can email me at windy.bat at narsm.org or you can catch me on my instagram at windy.bat 13. And Marty. As you'll see there, Marty. Miller and asm.org and then instagram is Miller.Morty 72. Okay and thank you everyone who stayed with us for the hour. I hope you got your questions answered. I hope this gave you a little more insight into programming phase two workouts using the OPT model. Thank you Wendy. Thank you Marty and thank you Greg there in the background and we'll see all of you next time have a great day.
