It's a company wide mantra you all have to believe in the same thing and and and you know my my core foundation of how I do business I actually take from Lamar Hunt who was the owner of the Kennedy Chiefs I cheered for them for five years and the first time I walked into a meeting When I became you know part of the team That then Lamar Hunt came and he spoke to us and he said I want everyone in the Chiefs organization There's one rule you don't treat the guy cutting the grass any differently than you treat the quarterback He said everybody's the same you're listening to the peak physique podcast with Andre Adams on the NASM podcast network Hey guys welcome back to another episode of the NASM peak physique podcast I'm your host Andre Adams NASM master trainer and I have BB physique Olympian today Our episode is going to be building an empire in fitness with Shannon Day of team bombshell AKA bombshell fitness from the dawn of the bikini division to building an empire CEO and founder of bombshell fitness Shannon Day It's going to join us to talk strategy Strength and evolution of women in fitness And you know just a little background before we bring her in Shannon has a master's degree in health education With an emphasis on sports management exercise science Shannon has dedicated her career to empowering women through fitness And I actually was just down in Shannon's current home town, which is Orlando Florida for the NPC women's workshop So she's always been there just supporting and empowering women welcoming to the show for the very first time Shannon Day Oh, thank you Andre I'm so excited to be here. I love it. Thank you All right. If you ever need a height person you let me know. I'll be your height man I will. I'm gonna take you everywhere Let's do it and you know I love Orlando. I got to say though, so I'm in Kenosha with Scott's in and I was a little disappointed when I came to Orlando and January Because I think I brought the snow with me. It was pretty cool. Yeah, you were there in the cold spell. It was freezing Everybody's got to put Sunny Orlando and not so much right I was disappointed. It was actually the same temperature. It was like 31 degrees Fahrenheit when I arrived there Same temperatures it was here in Kenosha. So hopefully it's a little bit better now So it's all your fault. It's definitely my fault. I'll take the blame on that one All right, well Shannon. I want to share your story and kind of like the origin and the vision of You know how team bombshell was even started because there's so much history here Especially at a time when bikini wasn't even a major division just yet So let's start there. What really sparked that initial vision for you know team bombshell and how did you get started? Well, here's what's crazy is there wasn't even a bikini vision at all yet when I started I I had earned my I'd be pro-card in fitness in 2003 and I was in the gym business So I bought and sold health clubs for several years and Lady that actually owned a health club across town from us contacted me and said hey I want you to train me to compete in a show and I said listen You know I only use clubs. I have tons of trainers that are amazing. They can train you whatever She goes, no, I want you so she asked me over and over and over and over and over and over and I finally said listen I'll do it, but I gave her this ridiculous huge amount for 45 minutes and she said yes And I said I'm a trainer now So I know how it started and she won over all in our figure division and people to start of coming to me and When the bikini division came around I went to the national meeting for all the states in the NBC because I'm also the Florida women's chairperson And they just said we're going to do this new division and it was funny Steve Wyberg was stood up there and said they're going to stand like this and like this and that that was it that's all they said So The guy that was the chairman of Florida at the time was having a seminar And he called me and said hey can you come up with some poses and show Sandy and see what you think so I had a Chris is party my house with some clients And we started playing around with bikini posing and that's where bikini posing was born. I took it down to Sandy She said yes, that looks great and which is now the football posing right so that came from And it was crazy I I'd cheered in NFL for several years and and the thing you learn when you cheer is that groups of women are seen as being hotter than they might really be. So when they're dressed alike right so I thought you know what I'm going to take these girls and I'm going to go to the first national that we took them to and I dressed him in matching a Valor Brown track suits and we showed up and no one had done that before. I mean it just hadn't been done and and at that time all the fitness magazines were there and all the photographers were nuts because my girls were all dressed alike And that's where team bombs show was born it was just it just went like this and and yeah here we are meeting Yeah, it's no ball effect from there. Yes, yeah, it's crazy how a lot of times I tell people this all the time You know like even right now right my initial goal was the retired from the corporate world by 30 actually by 40 and I did it at age 35 about five years ago And you don't always know how things are going to evolve or shake up what you've got this kind of big fuzzy vision that you can start to zoom in on and it sounds like that definitely happened with yours You're the well right you have a certain vision of direction and then it just starts happening right and you're in together so I love it. It's organic growth and you saw a demand in the industry and need in the industry something you're passionate about when you marry those two things up you can do some really amazing things One thing they're shanning let's let's go a little deeper right how did you are background in the say health education you know the gym business How did that help you when you first really recognize that demand and then decided all right we're a team let's scale this business let's do some crazy things how do you think you're background help support that oh my goodness you know I When I was in grad school I actually started a program called K you 15 years of University of Kansas that was Did you know personal training and group exercise for the student recreation center they didn't have it before and I started that called it K you 15 and put it together And when I graduated from my master's they actually create a position for me at the university to keep that going because I brought in so much revenue for the school So we I continued that for a couple years before moving to Florida and falling in the health of business is a whole another story But you know the I hate to say that you know you kind of you actually said it a moment ago things just kind of role You know when something is right you have to fight you know you have to fight and work and and I'm a silpra claimed work of hollock But you don't have to fight against it and that's one thing that with bombshell and forming it sure I had to fight you know When the kidney started everybody was complaining that you know all the old school people that it was ruining the sport and that it was like you know this terrible thing and and Believe it or not you know back then the internet wasn't what it was now But they were calling me a cold leader it was the dumbest thing ever and I had to fight against all that but I didn't have to fight the process You know it just kept going and and And you know my business background in the gems taught me how to deal with employees and do all of those type of things which you know That's a whole another ball game from just training on your own so my background in in the health club business surely You know help me with that aspect of things and Like I said just loving what you do and and putting everything you have into it every day Mm-hmm. Yeah, definitely that business acumen and those leadership skills that you develop and a lot of times we're developing like you said in areas that might not directly tie to what we end up doing But it builds the foundation those critical thinking skills relationships, you know the ability to network and and ultimately we got to be likable Right for for us to be in any kind of leadership position Whether it's in a corporate setting or it's running you know a team and a business people have to like you have to be able to motivate and inspire them to do their best if they're athletes or for our staff right when we're developing staff You know, let's take it back to so we're going to stick around in those early years. What were some of the biggest obstacles or challenges Launching that first all female bikini team you mentioned one of them Like you know people not right understanding thing and it's taken away We're hearing the whispers now with fit model Yeah So what other big challenges did you really have to overcome the first couple years you know I I went It was it was in 2007 and it's funny on things happen, you know, we had the big market crash in 2008 and I had been buying and selling health clubs Back then you know the big corporate gyms weren't really a thing so if you own to health club you worked it and then you sold it to someone else that worked it and they bought it on You know sweat equity and they paid you so I had this whole business going to buying and selling gyms and when the market crashed in Oh, eight I had people that I had sold gyms to saying yeah, I can't pay you anymore. So it was it was a terrible time And it was funny because bombshell are just started and I thought you know, but I'm going to put on my effort in the business and see what happens I had nothing. I mean, I'm telling you when I tell you I had nothing I had nothing and the biggest thing that I hope people can come away from From our store here at bombshell is you can build something from nothing, you know, I didn't have I don't have I've never had a bank loan I don't have investors I you know what didn't have some rich husband that funded everything everything we've done has been self funded so Learning that aspect of sacrifice for your business and you know there's times where you're like how am I going to do this If you just keep going and you push every day and you believe in what you're doing It may not turn out exactly as you wanted I don't know mine mine actually has but it it leads you in the right direction as long as you're pushing And and that was really a biggie, you know, I would go to shows and walk around with a notebook and ask girls for their email addresses You know, there because there wasn't really anybody doing what we did and the internet wasn't wasn't is now But I go home with my notebook and enter all my email addresses we got fatses with applications but one of our facts machine You know, things have changed a lot with technology but just pushing pushing pushing and that's what I hope I can inspire other people to do is Is believing what you want to do and push every day you've got to be myopic and your focus Yeah, and that's exactly right you've got to be relentless and one thing that you're hitting on there that resonates definitely with our audience is going to be the passion right passion is really that Thing that helps ultimately reach the highest expression of our talents to an even behind passion being relentless You're going to do some amazing things but you can't get off the gas and it's continuing right we can't like sit back and think oh we've made it Stop learning stop and prove because we'll get past just like anybody else so yeah, keep that motivation and keep that momentum going 100% So you know you mentioned something there and this this is actually good point for discussion Shannon when we talk about how things evolved a lot of times We we talk about how you know the look for bikini has evolved but we talk about that stuff all the time one thing we don't talk a lot about Is how from running a business and a competition prep team for example how has that process evolved you know you mentioned back in the day right I want to get back to his there's no like Google to Google prep coach, you know there's no NSM from BC course But like how how has that part of the business evolved for you guys let's say since 2007 Actually it's gotten easier and it's gotten harder, you know, I don't have to go to every show and collect email address as any more but you know Everybody in their brother is a prep coach now, right? So which is one of the so happy you guys are doing this sort of vacation So that people can really get educated and and those that want to really Thrive can rise to the top with this certification. I think it's amazing But it's it's gotten harder to because the field has gotten more crowded So you have to now, you know, I've turned into a content creator who to thunk it 18 years ago that I'd be you know on my phone making graphics, I mean, I you know, I've got a full-time web guy But in this day and age one person can't do all that right So we all have to learn how to be content creators and do all these things so that's changed dramatically In that sense and and people expect more, which I think is great, you know, I was left in the first probably five years of bombshell I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a no every single girl got the exact same diet and the exact same workout for about five years They all look amazing But it was a very different ball game that it is now Right, you know, we have thousands of different combinations of training programs every month that are you know available to our people so That changed dramatically as well Yeah, it's crazy to see the evolution you know I'm a lifelong fitness slash body building enthusiast myself and you know my dad actually he never competed, but he was he was that guy around here right now He's probably the best shape here where I'm from everyone knew who he was, the call them the beast I remember like being a kid and wanting to be like my dad, you know, at 20 in charms and I remember him drinking like this really nasty amino acid liquid and what I was like, who tasted like day quill or something that's disgusting And there's a one or two protein flavors that tastes like chalk and terror And you know now whether it's the nutrition whether it's the amount of information You know, it's actually scary how easy it is to get information because it might not be the right information Yeah, that's why I'm so happy you guys are doing this that's what's so amazing about this They'll get the right information and it's so important We contacted me that you guys are doing this I was thrilled just thrilled Yep, yeah, now I'm honestly we had an overwhelmingly positive response from the industry which I was so happy to see I know Tyler is very proud of that and like you said, it's really about elevating the entire league Whether it's for our athletes specifically producing better outcomes in a safer, more effective way But also for our coaches right these are tools that people that are maybe just starting out or they're transitioning from athlete to coach This will help give them the framework of actionable strategies to produce physics and help their clients right like you said Help them in the right way though, where we're not putting out bad information either I love it. Yeah, guys, if you guys are just joining us This is the NASM peak physique podcast. We've got a very special guest my friend Shannon Day the founder and CEO The very first bikini prep team team bombshell Shannon, let's keep going with this we got some great time And we love talking business. So Right That's not all when we get to do a deep dive on business and let's keep it going Let's go into maybe a little bit of mindset and lifestyle With prom shell, I know one of the core values that you guys represent is really emphasizing empowerment and community And everything that you guys do especially for the women How do you instill that mindset into whether it's your athletes or your staff? How do you guys instill that mindset and those core values? You know, it's a company wide Montreux. You all have to believe in the same thing and And you know, my core foundation of how I do business I actually take from Lamar Hunt who was the owner of the candidate chiefs I cheered for them for five years and the first time I walked into a meeting When I became part of the team, that then Lamar Hunt came and he spoke to us and he said I went everyone in the chiefs organization there's one rule You don't treat the guy cutting the grass any differently than you treat the quarterback He said everybody's the same And you know, I've always felt that way but it hit me the way he said that And made that part of his I've always felt that way and he said that's the way he said that And he said that the way he did that is what he wanted for his organization And I brought that with me over the years to all of my business and To bomb shell so we don't treat a girl that is competing for Mecellinvia any different than we do a girl to getting ready for a first show Everybody has value everyone is there to chew each other on And you know, it's funny over the years I've had athletes come through And they're the ones who maybe didn't have that attitude and they don't last with us They just don't last with us so it's very it's a community based on Women supporting women to be the best they can be no matter where you are in your journey And that has been really the core of who we are and what we do And I say to my staff every day we have five million text groups It's funny I turn my notifications off for this I'm sure it's going crazy somewhere You know, we say our motto is kicking ass and changing lives that's what our motto is so You know, it's it comes from all of us working together with that same goal And you have to you have to nurture that it doesn't just happen automatically You have to nurture that and I've found the most successful athletes on stage Or the ones that can celebrate the success of others and I know that sounds And I'm not going to I have I really bad mouth I'm being so good I'm not going to say one bad word on this But I call it it's not puppy dog rainbow BS it's true Women and men that can support other people's success and are truly happy for them are oftentimes the most successful just in general Absolutely I agree and that comes down to a bit of you know humility Right, that's mean that we're not confident in fact I think it speaks volumes You've got to be a more confident person to congratulate someone else Even if we lose to someone else right when you can be confident enough to congratulate them and respect that We're going to do better in everything and I think a company culture standpoint I love that we talked about that because it really starts from the top down And that's where like you know having those strong leadership skills can really help set the tone for the any organization Whether it's a contest prep team or business and again, I think that's beautiful that you guys share that mindset I say about our company Bomb show is a ship it's a big ship and all I do is I steer it that's all I do everybody else is the heart of it They run it they do everything I just hopefully decide to steer us in the right direction God willing But it's all of us together that really make this thing happen Yeah, it's got to be a team effort for sure and the collective knowledge on the team too Is definitely going to help drive better results and build that some artery so I love that All of our coaches are going to be and are they all know required to take your certification So yes, I can't stress it enough and you know I'll actually be curious to hear the feedback too And you'll see what I'm talking about once you get the dialogue going among the team like hey, how did you guys feel about this concept that you know I just learned about in Chapter three or the peaking strategies and it's cool because it gets that dialogue going And then you're going to come up with new ways to put those ideas together and build even new or better strategies So it's exciting to be in bodybuilding and Shannon you mentioned something on athlete attitudes too And I want to go deeper with that one of my questions for today was what role does mental toughness play in an athlete success on and off stage Right, so we'll just we'll go being mentally tough, but maybe even having a positive attitude how far does that play into an athlete success Oh my goodness, it's really everything and you know I have been accused of I'm old school I'm a little harsh, you know, but I I always tell people and I tell our athletes and I tell our coaches just just do it just do what you got to do you know don't complain about it don't This is a choice and I think that's a big thing that people need to remember you're not a martyr because you're doing your cardio and you ate your food You're not a martyr because of it. This is your choice. You're choosing to do it enjoy the ride or get off this ride. I mean, it's really that simple to me And you know the thing about this sport that I think is amazing and there's so many things about it that are But it teaches that mental toughness you can't rely on anybody else to do this and I think you know I one thing that we hear a lot of time from our transformation clients is I don't have any support. I don't have any support I don't have any support at home. We'll guess what in body building. Yes, we support each other. But at the end of the day you're going you're the one eating the food no one else is doing it You're the one that's going to jump you learn to be tough on your own and to push yourself and and that Not that self awareness and knowledge is invaluable. You know, we say there's no crying at bombshell. I lose it. You know I'm going to be like, I've been I've been accused of being a little too old school, but there's no crying a bomb show. You know, we you don't live and I've got to show you you if you're going to lose more than you're going to win. That's part of the deal For anyone even Olympia champions if you go over the record of their of their their time on stage. They've lost more than they want so you just got a Do it because you love it and you got to just keep going and and don't complain about it. Right. You know, we've got a hashtag that I actually trademarked and it's ain't done yet and that in that In fact mindset right, no matter how good we do we might when the Olympia we might place dead last the second that we step off stage. We have work to do right and that process is a continuum. So ain't done yet We live right highly encourage you guys to just you know, think that mantra on the wall if you need to And you just took the one more thing to before we move on, which is for you guys that are coaches out there. You don't have to be everything to everyone Right. The confident in where your niche is and your core values and if you have athletes that may be apply or you know, it's just starting out and you feel like it's just not a good fit for your coaching style Don't chase the money the money will come get really good at what you're doing and find the right athletes and the right staff and team and support That aligned with your vision and your core values because to Shannon's point if they don't it might be a month from now it might be a year from now you're going to have falling out So we've all been there. I've had staff that start out maybe good and then you realize they don't share the same core values or paradigms as you do and eventually end up Going separate ways, you know that's so true and I got to say what I anybody to ask me about getting into business. I tell them you don't realize You know Anybody can make money and we really anybody can make money, but the dealing with people if you're going to grow past just just yourself That is I think the most difficult and the most challenging thing that a business owner deals with. I'm I'm so you know, not going to let it bust and lucky right now I've gotten an amazing staff and amazing coaching team, but we've had rough time throughout the years and you know we've we've had some Anybody doesn't business, but you're so correct in that everybody has to have that same vision for where you're going in order for it to work They're doing sometimes you don't always know out of the gate, but that's one thing that you get more experience and you know you get further along in your business and you start to scale It's a little bit easier to recognize people that are maybe vibrating at the same frequency as yourself or your business So keep that in mind guys. I'll save you a big headache later 100% 100% All right another thing I want to dive into is women's specific coaching and this will be the hormone for us Shannon so one of the things that we can maybe chop it up on Bum shell emphasizes empowerment and community so we talked about you know instilling some of those other attributes into maybe your athletes or your staff How do you instill that empowerment mindset and a sense of we'll call it self worth in your clients because as you and I know there's a lot of people to get into the sport for the wrong reasons and they're validating their own self worth off of a placing So what things can we maybe what advice do you have for athletes? You know to instill that self worth mindset You know we we talk about this a lot and we have training camps with our clients we do we have a private social network where we do Lecture topics We have like 20 a week it's it's extensive and you know You don't get confidence from looking a certain way or from External factors or someone telling you you want or whatever that's not how it happens Confidence is born through action So if someone comes in and they're not confident the action of becoming Usually we'll bring that confidence out if they approach it with the right mindset if they come in and say you know I only want to win I remember I had a girl a couple years ago come to a camp and she raised her hand and she said How you know how often do people win their first show and I go you're not winning your first show so don't even think about it I don't know I was being I still happening If you do you can come for me wrong, but she looked at me and I said that's because if you go into this with I have to win in order to be happy with it It's not going to work You have to challenge yourself to see what you're capable of and that's where the confidence comes from the confidence doesn't come from I don't look for certain way so I can win and do whatever that's not what it is And we also make sure that we tell women I think this is so important for women It is not a contest of who the most the most prettiest girl in the world is If you don't win it doesn't mean you're unattractive. It doesn't mean you're bad person. It doesn't mean you're not sexy. It doesn't mean anything You know anyone on that stage that day would walk down the street and people lose their mind right so you you're working toward A standard it is who is closest to the criteria on that day you are in a beauty contest you're in a criteria contest And women need to understand that because they want to internalize oh I didn't win so I'm not attracted by look bad You know and I say I'll bring your neck because we don't talk like that, but it's a criteria contest And I think if you if we can get women to understand that they'll go into it with a much healthier attitude It's true to the I've seen the most I've seen girls that I'm like if I looked like her I would be the evil queen of the universe It would be done right I mean I've seen it for like man she's gorgeous and they get less place because they weren't in the criteria on that day They weren't the closest to the criteria so when they understand that and I think we all need to understand that You know athletes can come at it with a little bit different mindset and find the confidence and find the stealth esteem in the action of working toward that goal Yeah, and I love that you touched on redirecting some of the negative self-talk because we can all go through it Right, we don't place as well as we think we should have at that particular show and let's not forget as objective as we try to make our sport There's always a bit of subjectivity as well right these aren't it's not a power lifting contest where we lifted this way Or we didn't lift it it's you know the angles and the conditioning and the way that we present our physique the lighting The suit selection right the whole nine yards and then who else is on stage next to us that particular day So to Shannon's point it's really who meets the criteria the best on that specific day and then displays that in the best possible way But you know it's redirecting negative self-talk because we we all will get in our own head and like oh, you know Maybe I don't look as good as I thought or you know I'm not a good athlete or maybe I need to change coaches that For inexperienced athletes that's the first thing that pops in their head Yeah, that's a really But I mean I I that you know you don't have to throw everything away It's little tweaks it's a little tiny tweaks and and again you can't live and die by the show and that's that's a big advice for not only athletes But for coaches in the beginning I would live and die by the show I go to a show and if our girl didn't we and I'd be like oh my god It's over we're done, you know it was like this big dramatic thing and then you realize listen there's the show next weekend And we just keep pushing and they keep getting better and you know there's times where you think your athletes should have won and they don't there's times where you're like I looked at an athlete on stage that I had never liked me and she didn't look good and they won you know So you never know how it's going to go on that day I can't live and die by the show you got to you got to learn from it right learn from You know whatever your athletes didn't do well that day figure out why don't just say oh well I'm going to go next show you need to think that through but you can't live and die by it because you'll drive yourself insane 100% and it's an iterative process Right, so make sure that we're getting like the judges feedback we are doing our own feedback like we've seen enough physics and athletes We kind of know what things we need to work on But once we get to that certain level right when we're coaching pros and ultimately Olympians It does get hard even for us coaches to figure out well Shoot she looks amazing what are the few things that we can improve because I guarantee you you can be the reigning Mr. or Miss Olympia There's still some things that we can fix on that physique of course You know it's just a continuous improvement and like you said sometime it's just as simple as natural progression of staying in prep a little bit longer and tweaking a few things Maybe tweaking the peak strategy and then you know just really continuing to make those improvements over the long haul And what did you say your hashtag list? Ain't done yet Yeah, see you there you go So you know one of my good friends in the sport is actually called wasser and we kind of paired her mantra and my mantra I always say ain't done yet and then she'll chime in with just getting started and that's the mindset that you really got to have like like for her after 50 wins It's like just getting started right? I love it Alright guys if you're just joining us welcome back to the NASM Peak Physique podcast We have a special guest Jan and Dave from team bombshell in the house Jan let's go down a little deeper on some business and coaching Okay, one of the questions that I get often is you know about people that are maybe transitioning as we did from athletes to coach And I'd love to hear your advice to new coaches especially women who want to really break into the competition prep space Maybe they were previously athletes current athletes or maybe their personal trainers But they want to start working with athletes Well my my new number one recommendation is to get this certification. That's my number one recommendation. Yes, and Actually go to shows. I'm always shocked if people that are coaching and like oh, I've only been to two shows go to shows And take a clipboard and judge the show sit there like you're a judge and judge and they come back to finals and see how you did that's how you learn You don't learn by just you know going to a show and running around and chatting with people you really need to study what's happening on stage and what the judges are choosing That I think is so important so you know go to the show take a take a notebook take whatever and you know do your own judging and see if if you have the same eyes the judges because that's what matters You know it doesn't matter like I said I've seen the most beautiful mirror the world get last place. It doesn't matter what I like it doesn't matter what you like it's what the judges like So you have to be able to understand what the judges like in order to create the body that the judges like So that's a biggie take the time do your research go and and do that to really educate yourself as you know as you go Yeah, you're exactly right and I think to your point there's so many whether they're new athletes or you know new coaches that are just can start it That don't understand the value of really getting at the shows constantly talking to the judges Build relationships with other athletes coaches this is you like you got to be a sponge like you got to be a student of the game and I love just studying the sport right if there's a big show happening I'm gonna be watching you know if it's it's pro if it's the Arnold if it's a limpia. I'm watching the trends. I want to know what's going on and then regionally right when you when you have a series of regional shows you in your coaching athletes at those You certainly want to be at those to understand what things maybe are trending in my area because there can be subtle differences right it's a universal standard however There's going to be subtle differences when you go to a show in Tokyo and you go to a show here in Kenosha, Wisconsin Right, so you got to make sure that you're staying up on all of these trends especially for the newer divisions to write Something like fit model for example if you think about when wellness first started it was it was a nightmare But at the same time it was a huge opportunity for coaches to be up with what is being rewarded and where could the judges are also figuring out the new divisions as we go Right, so it's like the first few shows I think a lot of people with fit model this year I think muscle contests had the first fit model overall champion and I can't tell you how many times I bet you 15 to 20 times I got that video sent to me and they're like coach is this the so is this the standard we need it because I don't look like I'm like guys Go to the standard I'm going to say it's the standard but that's the best to your earlier point She had the best your closest mesh to the criteria that we think we want to see if we're model that day right on that stage And so you really do have to stay up on those trends So you guys have it there right there's some good advice for new coaches and definitely to Shannon's point make sure you check out the physique and bodybuilding coach course And the meal prep course because these are going to give you different tools to help build out some of that framework when you're just getting started And then also have consistency because in anything we do Shannon you know better than anyone When we're talking business and we're talking coaching we've got to be able to repeat those results right it's got to be sustainable over time So what I see often I think some mistakes maybe we will touch on that So common mistakes that we see with new coaches is they don't really have a system and it's kind of just flying by the seat of our pants And it's going into peak week and this show clients over fed this show the clients under fed But when you got a solid framework that you can just refine and tweak based on you know individual clients you're going to be able to repeat those results a lot more 100% 100% Yeah, the thing about being a coach in this business you got to be married to it you got to be ready to to be married to it You're not taking weekends off you're not stopping work at five o'clock and saying I'm done You have to really be dedicated to this and I've seen you know I've seen so many people come and go over the years that that or you know huge flashes in the pan and then they're gone But they they don't stick with it and have to allow yourself chance to grow It's not going to happen overnight. You're not going to have 500 clients tomorrow You've got to allow yourself a chance for things to grow and progress Right and make mistakes along the way right because we I think everyone just assumes because they see the the outcome right They see where team bombshell is that today right we just interviewed my friends over at fit body and it's like no it didn't start like that I wish it did but it's not an overnight thing. This is a journey that takes years of dedication and passion to build and the commitment to continuously improve our results are you know Quality relationships long-term relationships with clients and yeah, it just never stop so you know and speaking of that too We talked a little bit about building up our teams whether we're talking our prep clients or we're talking about staff What are some of the top things you look for when you are developing or hiring coaches for team bombshell What are those top attributes that really resonate with you Surprisingly enough it is not who has the best genetics and is one a bunch of shows because that's you know not always the case You know Honestly No complaining no rudeness no ego. I'm big on that. I'm really big on Just our coaches are all good people I want I want us to be surrounded and for our clients to be surrounded by people that want to coach because they really want to help someone do something amazing with their life They don't want to just be a coach so they can you know walk around being all cute and say I'm a fitness coach, you know I'm really big on people that truly want to make a difference and That's really where it all starts. It's really where it all starts And and just being you know being on top of it being someone who is going to go to the extra mile who isn't going to disappear because they want to do XYZ with our personal life But they're going to be dedicated to their athletes dedicated to our sport who love our sport and want to be a part of it In order to be a great Prep coach or anyone in this industry you have to want to spend time in this industry you can't say I want every weekend off and I never want to go to a show and do this you have to be better in what we do And those are are traits that are are not taught the you know those are things that either you're that are either you are that or you're not But those are big those are babies those are babies. Yeah, those are definitely some good and tangibles, right? And like you said some of it can be developed over time Some of it cannot some of that is just these are inherent traits that people are born with right the same drive and ambition that we have To grow scale and build our business Me that that drive actually started for me as an athlete first as a kid And I tell people this all the time like when we're talking about developing character body building is one of the best things you can do to weed out the good from the great right With bodybuilding we're building things like discipline self efficacy confidence All these good things that consistency right all these things that are going to mirror other facets of life and help us improve whether it's at work Relationship going to school whatever might be so you got a lot of bodybuilding Yes, yes You know Shannon we've got a couple more minutes here and I want to do something funnier. We're going to do some fun kind of rapid fire here I want to get your I want to let our audience know more about Shannon outside of business. Oh my goodness. Okay.

Yes, I'll save it for my off season for sure But I definitely got to get down there visit For the next question. This is actually given to All right, so let's think outside of this stage right or outside of the we'll call out the body building of Reena's The others sneakers He'll just listen I I'm going to make you laugh. I complain that that women don't know how to run in heels anymore and my favorite quote is women that run in heels should be fear So I can definitely run in heels I love you know I am seeing insistent heels. I love that But I also have a sneaker head my my sneakers always have to match my outfit when I train is a problem So both yeah, yeah, depending on the occasion Yes, yes, yes, well one day you'll have to post up a picture of your sneaker collection Or you'll be looking and we're going to see what one is bigger. Right right Last one I got for you today Shannon out of all your years of coaching this might be a hard one because I'm sure you have multiple Responsive of this one, but what is the most rewarding transformation story that you've witnessed and this we're talking specific to like your team bombshell athletes Do you have one or two that just really really stand out? Yeah, I do and you know one of them is actually I promote the NPC IPv girl power here in two weeks One of them is actually competing at that show. She and her husband both have you know we've coached them for years She's started out with Having never even been in the gym, you know very much overweight And she placed in women's physique I think third last year at team universe and is going for a pro court again this year And her she and her husband are just really good people that have completely changed their bodies and their lives through bodybuilding She's now a VIP coach for me. She tans I own Ice Taining company that does a lot of the shows the ice taining makeup And she works for that so we've had a lot of women come from non bodybuilding backgrounds at all We have big transformation so we don't always get you know we don't always get the girls that are already in change We get a lot of women who are never done this before and they end up being a part of the industry and love our industry And and that is really Amazing to me because it changes the entire course of their existence So that that that's what makes me go to bed at night and feel good about what I do Yeah and like I said a lot of times they didn't know what they were missing until they felt that energy maybe they came to one of our events They were right on you know some of the team and they can feel it and you inspire them A lot of times we inspire people we don't even know we inspire so I thought you're in no stories What had I've actually got a couple good ones too. I'll drop out maybe my two of my favorites One of them goes you know big shout out to good friend of mine Charles Hanson. We call him big Chuck We used to get down at all the quest nutrition boots. If you guys ever went to a quest nutrition boot that the LA FedEx bow or the Arnold or the Olympia Probably from 2015 through about 2019 I'm sure you met me and Chuck there at some point Chuck was actually let's see Chuck's got to be about six five He's a big boy and he was 430 pounds when he started his journey and he says coach I want to get on stage in classical busy and I told Chuck let's let's start chunking it out We're gonna have some you know a lot of work to do. I think his stage weight goal had to be 245 pounds So from 430 the 245. I love me a good challenge So this was one where I was able to set some milestone it took us about 18 months And we actually got Chuck all the way down to his 245 goal put him on stage in classical music and he placed top five got himself some hardware And then I think just the month or two later ended up getting married and now they have a beautiful sound together So it's it's amazing Helping or being a part of these journeys and like you said now whoever watched that journey I'm sure is gonna get inspired right so it's it's a snowball effect And we're gonna keep it going through bodybuilding. That's a big thing and and we at home show we have a transformation part of our company and a competitive part And those ladies they mesh right so you know last year when one our coaching director Jessica Lies went to the Olympia She has this signature post she does and before she went all the girls got together and on our private social network They all did the post we had ladies that were you know still two 300 pounds that were big life so clients that were coming down do the liest pose to in support in their bikini it was amazing Those are our community Doesn't just inspire other competitors, but it inspires people who you would never think To to strive to do more and as long as we treat them with kindness and we are open to them in the gym When people who are you know transformation we'll come up and ask us questions at the gym We don't brush them off and act like we can't be bothered when people in our community are kind and treat people with respect We're just gonna keep inspiring people and growing this thing And like I said that at night, that's how we go to bed night, that's what it's really all about Yeah, I love that that mindset Shannon and you guys have done some amazing things with team bombshell So it's a pleasure definitely for me to be able to hop on here and chop it up together Shannon before we wrap let's let the followers know where they can find you Maybe social media website all that good stuff.
