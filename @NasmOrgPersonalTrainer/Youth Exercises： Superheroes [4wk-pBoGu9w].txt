What's up everybody? My name is Katrina Pilkington, NASM, certified personal trainer and youth exercise specialist here with another idea of how to get the family moving with a youth exercise activity. I'm here with Super Kai. What do you want your name to be? Super Gecko. Whatever. Yeah, whatever name you want your character to be. Your kids can use socks. You can cut holes and socks. Use a pillow case as a cape. Whatever you want it to be. We're going to be five exercises that you can use to teach kids some sport skills. So what my little one is demonstrating right now is actually as an underhanded grow. We're trying to save the kitty from the tree. That's the first exercise. And then you can use any toy car. We're going to practice super human strength by lifting cars. We're going to have a superhero fly. A run so you can go super speed and then we're also going to have leaps throughout the buildings. You want to leap? What do you want to do first? If you want to throw, here. You want to leap? With one feeder, two feet. Or throw a cat. Have a little throw. Ready? Go over there. You go over there. Can I throw to you? Ready, superhero? Save the kitty run run run run mommy run run mom you're going to run mom. They'll pick their favorite exercise when it's throwing and they get every skill or stage, which is toddler to early elementary. It's underhanded. What about over? Can we do over is over hand or under hand. Over hand or under hand can be throw over. Good job! Do it! Link they're the buildings. Really fun activity, really fun way to get dressed up with your kids. That means you say thank you. Thank you.
