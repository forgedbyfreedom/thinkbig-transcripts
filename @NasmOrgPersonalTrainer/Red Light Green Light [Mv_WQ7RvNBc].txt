Hey everybody, it's Katrina Pilkington, and a S.M. certified personal trainer and youth exercise specialist along with being a mama. So I'm here to give you another youth exercise idea of a movement activity to do with your kids. We are going to play... Do you remember? Red. Red. Red. Red. Red. We're going to run. Skip. Hop on one leg, which is good balance practice, and then we're going to do one more. Gallup. We're going to do a Gallup. Okay, so where do you want to start? Do you want me to call or do you want to call red like green light? So this teaches kids about how to start, stop, pay attention, listen to directions as best as you can. Are you going to be the caller? Yeah! Okay, you got to stay still and you got to tell me what to do. Am I going to run? Skip. Hop or Gallup. Red. Okay, so I got to get back. Red. Red. Red. Red. Red. Yellow. Yellow light means do what? Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Are you going to meet a caller now? Yeah! Okay, so I want you to Gallup. So Gallup means taking one foot in front of the other. Green light. Gallup. Gallup. Gallup. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. What move is next? Skipping or hopping? Skipping. Who's going? Me or you? Green light. Green light. Green light. Green light. Green light. Great. I just tried to have fun with your kids. Teach them how to start and stop. You can even pick for older kids. Exercise is like, what? You don't have to do it there, girl. Fair crawl. Um, it's done burpees. We've done running. We've done pushups. We've done hops. Any kind of activity to get them going. Can we done in five to ten and increments? Let me get a drill. You can now throw grass and then they can throw grass. So have a good day guys and we'll see you soon for another youth exercise idea or tip.
