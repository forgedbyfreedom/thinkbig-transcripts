Good afternoon everyone and welcome to NASM Live. My name is Prentice and I'm here as always with Wendy Bats and Marty Miller who seems to be off camera right now. Well, good afternoon both of you. How are you doing today? Fantastic. Great thank you. All right and as always we have our man behind the scenes making sure this train runs smoothly and that's Greg and how are you today Greg? Yes he salutes us as always and today what we're going to talk about is CES Pro Sign and how you can use the model to design programming for boot camps because designing a constructive training program in the front of your session is much better than trying to do it on the fly. So with that said why don't we get started and Wendy, why don't you tell us a about the persona of the group of people we're going to be working with in this boot camp? Absolutely so Marty and I was excited when we got asked to do this because we often get questions on how do you design programs that's going to benefit a group of people or how can you train people that are on different levels? And so with that being said we wanted to try to think of it in a very broad spectrum. So when designing a program for a group whether it's boot camp or any type of team you want to try to scan the room you know when people are walking in and you're going to look for things such as you know do you know are they're feet turning out how are they standing? Did they have an arch in their lower back? You know are there shoulders? You know do they have a forward head? Just making a note of what you're saying you know as people are just kind of coming in and dropping their stuff off. And then after that you're going to take that information and then you're going to kind of best you know think about the best exercises and stretches and things that you can do to help you know with those particular competitions that you see. So you want to think too you need to be flexible because you may think that everyone's going to have certain you know there are there are typical compensations that you're going to see but not everyone's going to fall within that. So you want to try to think of what is the best one of the best stretches you can do that are going to benefit the clients or the people in the groups and then also what can you do activate muscles that you are just scanning the room seeing they're probably underactive. So you know again as you guys know when you're getting the subjective information just be sure that all of the participants are signing a waiver and that they are cleared to do some kind of cardiovascular strength-based program. So let me ask before we dive into the assessment and you can always tell me if you're going to cover this later. So clearly boot camp if we're out there trying to make money we can't be super restrictive. How do you manage this process here when you're putting groups together with different athletic abilities maybe different different levels. Well I think we just really want to think of what is going to be beneficial for the common kind of to comment and nominate or that are coming into your boot camp because again you are going to have people for all different levels. You know you may have people that have been doing you know strength training for a very long time you may have someone that just got off the couch so you need to be flexible and when we get into the program we're going to talk about exercises that can be regressed and how you can progress exercises to benefit you know the participants that are in the class. Okay great thank you. And so if we go to the next we wanted to bring this we wanted to bring this up because again you want to think about you know when you're doing an assessment when when you're doing a one-on-one obviously the first time you meet with someone you're building the rapport you're finding out their specific goals and you know specific information regarding medication history and all that. Then after that you go into the you know transitional movements and so you're doing overhead squats and single-like squats and dynamic movements and possibly mobility assessments. Obviously in a group or when you're dealing with the team we don't have that time obviously I mean that would be most beneficial if you could do that one-on-one however that's not the case. So if you wanted to do a group assessment what you could do is set up the room with all the participants facing you and then you could actually have them spread out and put that everyone in the five-connected chain checkpoints. Yes they still may be in their tennis shoes but you can still see a lot of what's going on and then you can have everyone perform 10 squats and you're just scanning the room from the very start. They haven't had any stretches. They're just coming in and you're kind of seeing what you're you're starting with and again that may help give you some ideas of oh you know what I noticed that there you know people's backs are actually rounding more than I thought then they are going into an anterior pelvic tilt and from that point you may have to stretch some different muscles and you can make those adjustments on the fly. Now if you're going to set up and I know a lot of trainers do this if you do a you know a 10-week boot camp and they're coming twice a week they may be the same type of you know same participants coming in each and every week and this would be extremely beneficial for somebody that's setting up their boot camp like this. However we also understand that there are other trainers that may just offer a boot camp at a certain time and everyone is welcome and so you know you may not want to start doing an overhead squats. Each and every time those participants are coming in even though it would be very very good information to gather. So it's really up to you but just know this is a way that this could be done and and again if they're coming into a boot camp you feel pretty confident that these participants are able to do a body weight squat safely. If not then you may want to ask them you know what their goals are coming into your class. I'm already I don't know if you want to add anything to that but no I think you covered it you know perfectly well and you'll see when we designed these programs that we did not use any equipment at all every single part of this boot camp is going to be body weight so that way it's easy to adjust progressions and regressions also to keep people moving so that way you can make it a little more intense by not having people like look for dumbbells doesn't mean you can't do a boot camp with other tools we just decided to keep very simple right now and use all body weight and you know the key thing is when you look at boot camps the majority of people that come to these type of activities they just want to know they got a good workout. They're not going to necessarily say we know what we didn't do burpees or we didn't do this type of really high level aggressive exercise. If you could create it with your programming work on their movement and make it better while you increase their heart rate appropriately and give them some safe and challenging exercises at the end of the day that's what they care about. They want of burd enough calories feel like they got a good workout in and you can really sprinkle in some of that accidental exercise to ensure that just because you're doing a boot camp doesn't mean you throw out all the other rules that we always teach you with any SN. Okay great and then we have one question from a viewer before we move on. 5 to 10 people is a lot to manage on that front end of the boot camp. How are you? What are some suggestions that you have for managing documentation that dirty it's not a four letter word but you get the idea? How do you document all those people and keep the keep the camp running so that everyone's getting what they need out of that training? Well I can jump in a couple of ways I've done in the past as I set the ground rules at the very beginning so if Wendy gave you two scenarios it could be new people every single time it could be the same people obviously if you have the same people they're going to understand your way of communicating in the ground rules so they know how to tell you in a sense that hey I might need some assistance here or you're going to know how they normally move compared to maybe what they're doing. So some of the things that I'll always do and we can highlight this a couple of the examples is I always as I create my programming think of three different levels of the exercise. Can I progress it? Can I regress it? So that way if I have three different levels of people they're all doing similar or the same exercise but it's easy for me to coach it and during the transition time I'm as I explain the exercise I'm going to give them the progressions and regressions too and I just give them a cue if I walk up and I snap my fingers twice that means go up a level or if I snap them once go down or whatever works for you so that way you can coach and communicate to a large group of people because it's hard to cue one person while you're looking at everybody else so sense yourself up for success and find what works for you but your people will adapt to understanding what that terminology is and that there's going to be a progression and regression that you might give them a media. Okay yeah thanks for that that's very valuable feedback and I hope that that does answer the question Wendy do you have anything to add to that? No I mean I think you know I do exactly what Marty does except for I don't snap my fingers mainly because my snap's not very loud but I mean once you show when you're demonstrating and we're going to show you ways that Marty and I both actually we have a lot of similar ways of doing this type of boot camp but we set people up in pairs and groups and then once you demo that and you do show progressions and regressions per quote station then again I just coach them like hey make sure you squeeze your glutes watch your right foot you know like I set them up in the very beginning every time I come to you I'm looking for the five-can-edit change checkpoints what that mean is this so I do a lot of the coaching on the front end as well so therefore when I'm walking by and giving quick quick hit cues it makes sense to the person and they know exactly what it is and I'm asking for them to correct because you do have to look at you know be able to scan the room and be very very good at multitasking so and in one each year point you just need me think about it is sometimes I'll just blur it out a cue not knowing if anyone's compensating but one of the key cues for that exercise because somebody might need that reminder so that's a great point Wendy for sure okay so I think I think we're ready we have the we have the principles of the overhead squat for a large group now let's get into the program design we can go to the next slot and the big thing with this is that we have principles and we don't want to abandon the principles just because we're working in a large group so Wendy can you again take us through how you manage these four steps in the corrective process and throw in that into program design for a large group well sure one thing you're going to notice it's a little bit different in the way that we set up our programs and we are going to offer you guys two separate programs so you can see how we can change it up from one day to another one class to another so we did not include inhibit meaning we're not using any type of formula because we were thinking realistically most individuals if they have 20 to 25 people in a boot camp which is not uncommon they're not going to have that many foam rollers and so with that being said I think it's important to when they're signing up for your program when you are you know kind of marketing yourself to say hey it would be a really good idea for you to do some type of foam rolling or some type of quote inhibit techniques on your own before you come in and if they don't know what that means maybe it's a good time when you're introducing yourself to kind of show them what a foam roller is and why it's important and maybe some typical areas to foam roller or you know to foam roll but just keep that in mind that it is still extremely extremely important it's just we want to be real with you guys and show you some programs that Marty and I have done with different groups of people and you know we just know that that's not realistic so with that being said we will go through some some linkening so we are going to do some different types of static stretching as well activation as well as some dynamic stretching and then we're going to still activate specific muscles that we know are commonly underactive based on what we've seen in the in the decade that we've been doing this as well as we're going to do a lot of integration exercises we're going to add cardio components to it so it's super super fun very very challenging but they're still getting as Marty always says that little accidental exercise of what they need because they're still getting you know they're getting um they're butt kicked really during this type of programming and we're going to we're excited to kind of show you how we have it laid out. That's outstanding that's all really good advice and just regarding the inhibits piece one thing that I've even done when I've run group classes is knowing that we're in the same situation can't do a lot of inhibition is that that's that's the homework I document that and email them a nice spreadsheet with their corrective exercise program so that they can do that and come in prep ready to go through what you have for us on the next slide so let's take a look at that. Okay so so again two different programs it doesn't matter which day and we're you know we're just trying to think of common compensations or common muscles that we find to be overactive and majority of individuals who are sitting for long periods of time who drive a lot I mean just the common common things that we normally see. So with that being said you're going to see that the the first area we are going to statically stretch would be the hip flexors and I have Marty right some of this stuff down and we're going to talk you through why we chose this as well as the ad dr. Magnus and then again we have the quads and calves and then the last and some Marty D1 and I kind of talk through why we chose those before we get into some of the the different movements. Sure so you'll see here that I kind of piece together so I'm looking for a flow so I worked with large groups in baseball so I will have during spring training I might have 40 to 60 athletes so again it's how can I keep a flow going so I can communicate and cue. So if I'm in a kneeling hip flexor position we all know how to do that instead of switching sides what I tend to do is go into a flow that just saves time for me and keeps my teaching and cueing to a minimum. So I'll have them start let's say I'm stretching my right hip flexor now I can just have them drop their left elbow to the inside of their left ankle good posture nice you know it's a rex spine now I'm stretching my ad dr. Magnus on the left side then I'll have them come back up and then I'll have them grab their leg as long as it's on a soft surface and do a quad stretch so I I flow from the hip flexor to the ad dr. Magnus to the quad and then I would reverse that switch sides get the left hip flexor right ad dr. Magnus and left quad and then what I like to do is you can do whichever one first I might do the lat stretch or like the child's pose and again there's all the little techniques with the external rotation post to your pelvic tilt just have them drop back and then right from there I have them push up into that pipe position to do a calf stretch and again we're always making sure that the foot slightly internally rotated that they've extended their knee and see if they can slightly the external actually rotate their knee without their foot coming up all these cues that we've teach anyways but also sneaking in some of that external exercise I have them push into the ground like they're doing almost like a military press knowing now I'm actually activating the scapula and other little posture or muscles that support the scapula so again sneaking stuff in now they're actually getting some activation of the rotator cuff so again there's ways that you can create a flow doesn't have to be this exact flow but think about how you can keep it moving along moving from one thing to another to save time make it efficient and then how can you sneak in some other things to that so that would be our first five that we would do we'd use these three together and then we kind of pair these two so I might start with the calf drop down into the child's pose or vice versa whichever you prefer yeah and then after we stretched the lat then we were talking about the deep squats as well as the posterior shoulder and then the forearms and so do you want to talk about the flow on that as well yeah so again chimsy you know more that add doctors like we get that deep squat have them hold it for 30 seconds you can even put a little rocking into it right after to get a little more active stretching they come right up and get the post to your shoulder now the key thing with the post of your shoulder is we're not trying to stretch to the rhomboid so really good tall posture stretching arm across the chest and I actually have them retract their shoulder to make sure that they keep that scapula where it needs to be then you can go through your forearms the series of your flexors, extensors, switch side so again it just kind of makes for a very nice flow and if I wanted to do two sets of the squats after I stretched one go out of the squat stretch one arm one side forms drop back down to squat and I can come up and then repeat the opposite arm for those two stretches again so it's always a flow yep and then so so again these muscles are just typically overactive and again some people they may not feel the stretch because they may not have needed that but if we're not doing an individualized program we got to think about the majority of people that are coming into your classes so right after we get down with stretching we're going to go right into now more of an active stretch so we're kind of activating the muscles that we know are usually underactive and so with that being said we're going to go into bridging and we're going to do a plank right in to a push up with rotation and then a posture reset series and I'm going to let Marty kind of talk you through kind of our thought process and we were putting this together and why these would be great in the activation section so again the way I tend to do it I might break them down into like a flow so I start on their back do their bridge flip right over have them hit their plank in the sasal plane then rotate to one side so I'm getting a little bit of transverse plank motion as they go from the plank to the side plank instead of just dropping and then starting you know turn your side out I actually try to get them to do it if they can right from the plank position go to a side plank then come back to the plank just temporarily go to the other side for the side plank so again I'm adding in some transverse plank motion that they don't even realize that they have to try to stabilize so again I could pair these three together then the push up with rotation again we know a lot of people are overactive in their chest but we do get it and get their heart rate up and do some stuff with their chest but from a posture reset series there's a lot of different things you can do again if you had bands and things like that you could do the shoulder squeezes but one of the ones that I like and I stole this from one of our other regional master structures can Miller is I'm just going to put my hands behind my back right at the top of your glutes I push into my glutes and I try to squeeze my elbows together why drop my shoulders low and again I'm going to make sure I'm neutral in my lumbar spine and also tucking the chin at the same time so again I just got done doing those push ups that come right up now and get those rhomboids and the mid-trapped low trap firing and keeping my chin tucked so I get all the nice muscles that stabilize my cervical spine why I'm in a neutral lumbar spine so great way to follow right from the push up back into getting those shoulders back and working on that posture so just a really nice flow to do with that way and then that's how we've set up the stretching and some of the active stretching and activating the muscles that again were underactive or typically underactive now we're actually going to still do the same thing but we're going to do it mainly like for yardage versus like specific reps and so you're going to see like in the in the actual template here that we have about 10 yards and we're going to do it at a moderate tempo so with that being said we're going to do things such as a heel walk and again we'll go into my toe if I we chose these but a heel walk and then right into walking lunges with an overhead reach and then a walking figure four and a leg swing to opposite hand I call him Frankenstein's but Marty didn't call him that so we went with what what it looks like and then arm circles and and he has reverse because he's it'll be in a backwards position so Marty do you want to kind of talk about about each of those? So what we did is you know imagine if we had you know 10 people you space five you know space people out you give them 15 yards and the heel walk is again I'm looking at my posture again don't just focus just on what's going on the ankle set their posture chin tuck shoulders back neutral their pelvis cues it you know that they've heard before you're going to teach very time and all I'm bringing up now is a bring my toes towards shins door surflexing and trying to ice it magically hold that as I walk slowly the distance you feel appropriate a lot of people will really start to feel a burn in that anterior tip muscle so it's not isolating it like we would incorrective exercise if somebody really needed to do it off the edge of a table with the band or a cuff weight but at least we're putting something in there to address the anterior tip which really in these type of workouts almost always goes unnoticed then the walking lunge there's a lot of different versions and you'll see another version of the workout I'm just trying to get people to extend again open up that spine so as they get motor control they're lunging and as they decelerate or going to the eccentric they're trying to reach up with their arms so again a lot of motor control a lot of things going on so and as they move their arms there's going to be more demand on the core including the glutes so that way get I know that they're making them I'm asking them to do more as they get that spinal extension walking figure four it's going to be a single egg exercise so as they walk they have to come up grab their knee grab their ankle pull it into that figure four get that pure form of stretch again nice posture so has to be able to stabilize and moving and have to be able to stabilize on a single egg so foot and ankle all the stabilizers need the glutes all that fun stuff gets in there having to do it slow and control and legs swing opposite hand or the fringes dynamic movement of the hamstrings the key thing here guys is you'll see a lot of people collapse at the spine if you can't kick and reach your hand that's fine let people know that the beginning is you demonstrate we don't want people to collapse their spine and I'll see that way too much people are so worried about getting that leg up there that they don't have the mobility the spine compensates if we won't let that happen and again Martin can I add something to that opposite hoax at arm legs wing is that also what you want to look for is compensation through the foot and ankle in addition to that lumbar are that thoracic spine flexing you'll see people want to go into extra planar flexion on the stand to get a little more height in that leg as well yep absolutely so again that's why we like it because it's let's say you didn't have time to assess people having these single leg exercises if they can't balance and they can't control themselves that's going to tell you something as if you had done the assessment so it's going to warm them up give you a great understanding of foot ankle all the way up and it's just to them it's something that's fun and they get their heart rate going and then arm circles we can we want to include the upper body I'll be honest I tend to do more of my work going backwards than forward because the majority time we're forward doesn't mean you can't do arms swings forward but in for me I'm always going to spend a little more time pulling than pushing and rotating backwards into external rotation than I would internal doesn't mean I won't do it it's just I might do a two to one where I do more of the arm circles going backwards yes and then when the d so I think we covered it yeah and so then again we want to still kind of think about you know we're still following the model we want to think about again on a traveling standpoint next what we're going to do is a single leg hop to both plan or hold like well I'm sorry single leg hop to hold but in multi-planar so again we're still going to go for yardage on this and Marty can you want to talk about like how that can we can do that yeah so again we like to spend a lot of time on one leg under control for a lot of the reasons we've talked about gives us that ability to see what's going on now can they control it so that hop I'm not we're about how far they hop I might actually purposely set the guidelines so let's say I'm at 10 I might say guys this isn't a three hop distance I want seven or eight hops I want short little hop because a lot of times people are going to bound and try to cover as much distance as possible and you might add that purposely at some point when they're more advanced and you know they can decelerate all that momentum but early on given the expectation you go guys no more than two yards at a time get at least five hops in or six try to make it right versus left so you can go hop straight but you can also hop like I like to use a clock as example so if I'm on my left leg I'm going to hop to a one o'clock land and then on my right leg I'm going to hop to 11 o'clock so that way we start to add in a little bit more of things that are just in the sagittal plane I use the clock as well so it's very easy to cue because most people know how to read a clock and then then you're going to see that we're doing use a approximately 10 on each leg but we're going to do a single leg Romanian deadlift as well as a single leg squat and we've touched those two specific for those two exercises for specific reason and Marty you want to kind of talk us through that so our DL again we're you know we want these people to feel like they're working without having to do things crazy and potentially dangerous so we all know that feeling when we're working on a single leg but also that accidental exercise we know we're getting more glued activation we know we're getting more core activation all the muscles in the foot ankle which are so important and corrective exercise and again you'd be cueing all the time about watch your foot keep straight ahead don't let your arch fall all those things as Wendy said she just we we always are giving that feedback verbally but the RDL is now getting that hinging pattern so with the core stabilization again we want great posture at the core we're also getting a glued and hamstring dominant exercise and then when we do the same thing like squat now we're getting a glued and quad hamstring glued and quad dominant exercise so we're working both movement patterns the hinge and the squat yep and then also wanted to add on to that we did that as well because if you did not do an overhead squat assessment or you or you didn't do it this round and let's say again if it was a group of people that you commonly see we're also still assessing because now here's the time that you did your single leg squat assessment you're just doing it in your program and so before you get into some more of the resistance portion that's a little higher intensity you can actually help someone do a correct single leg squat you can see where maybe some compensations are still occurring help those individuals by giving them cues and then if not you know that when you get to some of the exercises and the resistance portion you may need to to be very specific with individuals have how they can regress that especially for a safety standpoint because you're not one on one and there are multiple people in that group. Sorry for the question. No I just just wanted to get some questions as they were coming in and we have a question from Brent for watching to Brent and he wants to go back he was asking about the flexibility and he wanted to know why the doctor magnets we have so add doctor muscles in that complex why did you Marty or Marty and Wendy choose the add doctor magnets overall the add doctors in that group. Well we chose your magnets one because it flows beautifully with that hip flexor into the quad and also the add doctor magnets is often neglected in a from a flexibility standpoint and you know we know most people have very weak glutes so the add doctor magnets is that muscle most people woke up two days later after a heavy leg dance like oh my glutes are sore but they dug kind of underneath their glutes so it's one of those things that is often overutilized so we threw that in there and plus when we did the deep squat we are going to get some of their add doctors as well. And Wendy okay and thanks for that I think Brent I hope that answers the question for you and we have one more before that you get to the rest of the program and this one is from Tony thank you for watching today Tony and Tony wants to know since the glutes is often underactive why do we why do we focus can you talk about why we focus on that figure for stretch in your warm up. Sure so both 29 could jump in here but really when we're doing that it's going to be an active so we're not particularly holding it because it's the walking figure for but also when you get a figure for you're also hitting the peer formus which is so that can be very overactive for an underactive glute it really tries hard to stabilize and it tries to help when the glute is not firing so yes we're going to get a little bit of a glute stretch which is not a problem we're doing it actively but then we're really targeting and opening up that peer formus as well. Okay and I hope that answers your question Tony let's let's keep working down the template. Yeah and then under skill development we put in quick feet and there are so many different exercises that you can do with quick feet. I mean you can just do something where you're just going in place and it's literally like moving your foot as fast as you can back and forth trying to maintain proper posture. You know so again we didn't put something specific on what we mean by quick feet because you can be creative here. Some people do some of the different patterns that you would do inside of the speed ladder so everything from like an in and out out or you know an Ollie shuffle or or different types of patterns it's really whatever you want to do and what you think would be beneficial. So that's how when we say quick feet we left it kind of open for you guys to be creative but I usually do the in and out out type pattern as fast as someone can for 20 seconds but again making sure feet are facing forward they're maintaining proper alignment at all times. And then as soon as we get down with that we would go right into the quote resistance part and again there are so many different ways that you can do a boot camp or you can train and we don't even want to just say it's boot camp but when you're working with team working with multiple individuals and whatever type of layout or of group training you're calling it we're going to show you how Martin and I actually both do this is we do something like exercise A and exercise B and so what we would do is take the group and we would put people in pairs okay so again if Martin and I were on a team Marty would be teammate I would be be okay but we're we're together that's our pair and so the first thing that we would do we're thinking about setting it up into yards because again a lot of times that's easier for the instructor so for me if I did pay 15 yards and I and I set up different barriers of what 15 yards is then I can have one go you know doing the exercise to a certain distance and then coming back and then they can kind of tag team and then the next individual go do you have to do that no but a lot of times it's easier than worrying about specific numbers and counting and everything because everyone's different everyone's going to move at different paces and as an instructor it just makes it easier so with that type of set up and framework in mind the first thing that I would um Marty and I would have like maybe this particular group do is group A or exercise a similarity would go and do a bear crawl which is a total body exercise and then while he was moving and Marty you can kind of talk how that layout is while he was moving I would stay in our starting position which I would be exercise B and I would do jumping jacks until he returned so Marty do you want to add anything to that? Certainly mine so exercise A is going to be traveling exercise the way that we created these workouts again there's ways you can do it in stationary A and B could both be stationary but when you and I wanted to look at more of that bootcamp or if we had the ability to travel let's do some things that are unique because as we travel there's a lot of that neuromuscular coordination that has to go on so again that accident will exercise so whether you have you're out in the field and there's you know you can go to the 15 yard mark from the goal line or what I do is you could you know feel free to set up a battling growth or cones or they could put their water bottle at the end as long as it's safe if you're putting down something like rope put it a yard further than you want them to go to and just let them know that stop before but you know it doesn't have to be anything that's too complicated so exercise A they're going to travel the 15 yards exercise B stays put and then we rotate now again from a progression standpoint let's say someone is getting fatigued in the bear crawls you tell people ahead of time if I come over and give you this cue whatever that is they get up and they just jogged the rest of it that's fine maybe they don't only compare crawled 15 yards there they can't crawl back not a problem you give them the opportunity for what I always call the exit strategy on any exercise so you just set that ahead of time because you know what if somebody's just you're going too slow and you know you're waiting for them to finish for the rest of the group you just instead of you know given them something that now they stand out in the group just say whatever the cue is and now they get up and they run to the line into the back so that way we can keep the the class working and that's just where they are currently maybe they can only bear crawled there and that's totally fine and you'll see two under reps where it says A M R A P and that's just as many reps as possible so again it's saying that they have to do 20 or whatever it's do as many as they can until their partner comes back from they exercise the the traveling exercise so they would do that pair and then as soon as they're done with that they would go into quote the next pair so again we Marti and I would say is our pair but again he would be A I would be B and so Marti would do the inch worms to push ups and while he was doing that going forwards and backwards I would stay in place as as the B person doing something like a plank walk and all a plank walk is as it's not traveling it's staying in place it's maintaining proper alignment so you're looking at the five-minute change-check points and glutes drawing in chin stays back and and you're coming up into a low plank up into like a push-up or also termed as a high plank and then right back down and so you can alternate arms you could do however many you you know one person can jab would say go up on the left and then go up on the right and alternate back and forth because again you don't know how long it will take that client to return or I'm sorry your partner to return so so just keep that in mind and again guys you know we look at the bear curl and the inch worm the closed chain upper body exercise where my hands are on the ground so as I'm doing this properly think about all that core activation shoulder stabilization if I'm teaching it right and they're pushing into the ground that you know great stabilization in throughout the scapula thoracic joints keep in the chin touch now I'm accessing you know addressing the the cervical stability as well plus now I have that movement in that contour lateral motion with the bear crawl and that hinging pattern with the inch worm to push up so these are just things you want to consider and of course I want to think about what makes sense in pairs because I know what the next pair is and my overworking they're upper body too much and again that exit strategy so if I knew I had beginners and they take them a while to do the inch worm to push up I might say all right on the way there inch worm to push up on the way back let's just do the inch worms very easy control that and same thing if my clients are struggling because maybe it's taken their partner too long to go back remember your regressions all right when he down to one knee boom she knows what that means if she's doing the plank maybe she stops doing the plank walk and just goes to the plank or go down to two knees all those things are very easy to set up the very beginning and but it can still be a very dynamic and challenging program for people that can handle this level so it's very easy to have all kinds of you know different types of abilities within that same class yep and then to piggyback off of what Marty said I mean it is super important to really think about when you're choosing the exercises as Marty said for body versus lower body but you really need to have regress and progress exercises for each thing that you're doing because again you want to think to you're you know some people are you know you're going to be doing exercises where you're standing and then you're going straight down that's you know think about the demand on the hearts you know obviously it cardiovascularly as well so so again you want to think about your clientele you want it to make sense but definitely have backup exercises just in case somebody needs to completely kind of change change what they're doing all together and you know what may seem simple to us could be extremely challenging for a beginner so always have that in the back of your mind when you're going to work with with your group yeah that's cool and I have a question that just came in here from Fabio and what Fabio wants to know is well what he says is it looks like in your resistance block there's a lot of anterior chain dominant exercise it seems to predominate that part of your template why don't you have more posterior chain stuff and to me Marty it looks like there's some hidden exercise in there can you talk us through that yeah so two things I think Fabio is going to be real happy with the next exercise we pick and there's a reason why we put it at the end because remember how I said I'm always going to try to finish with some pulling so the bear crawl again think about what I'm doing I'm pushing into the ground and I'm really doing the bear crawl to focus on what goes on at my shoulders I want that great protraction I want you know that core stabilized and then if you look at how many pushups I put in there it's not as many because I'm doing the inch worm to get to travel and that I purposely did that so that people feel like they got their chest in where I didn't put the push-up down here where you're just rep and amount for a minute or two while you're waiting for your client to come back and also that inch worm if you get to a good hinge again you're pushing into the ground which they think is upper body but they don't realize how much retraction and depression of their scapula is they'll be getting at the same time so sneakiness stuff in there and then again that's what brings us back into the next one and I I mean hopefully that answered Fabio's question if not please let us know but to Marty's next the next pairing that we had was the frontal plane lunge would be exercise A so we're traveling on that and then we would have the exercise you know that your partner perform a single leg cobra and so again really focusing on you know the mid lower trap rhomboids that that type of a specific area so we're finishing with that again the term that we used before is postural reset just after we did some upper body of course they wanted in there we're going to finish with getting their body reset again yep and then one thing too because it is a boot camp you know and so people you know you want to think about running and doing all that stuff people just usually have fun back and forth well Marty and I like you know it's actually an assessment but I do this a lot with groups is finished with what you know what we have turned the kind of the left test or um and when you're doing an assessment but basically you're actually running down and back um so there's a specific pattern so you're going to run as fast as you can from one one area to another you choose the yardage you choose the distance then they actually back pedal and then they will do a side shuffle facing the same direction they shot side shuffle back then they carry ocha and then they carry ocha back against still always facing the same way so they're getting each side and then they sprint out as fast as they can to the end to the end mark and so super fun to do really you know you could do it as a group you could say okay I want you to do this pairing as soon as they're done they do the left test or whatever you want to call it your agility you know type running finisher and then they can redo it again or you could have them just do all the resistance and finish with with two of the metabolic finitures or what we have listed as the left test really up to you but super fun and the way I drew it makes it look like you're traveling forward but I can you know just to because of the board I just drew the arrows but I'd be in my same line so I would start here sprint when I get to that point I'd back pedal when I get here I turn and I would side shuffle side shuffle carry ocha carry ocha and then you sprint to the finish line so you're not moving forward I just wanted to draw it out how many repetitions you're doing here so it could take about 15 seconds you know for a moderate person maybe you get it 12 or under if you're at around 15 yards but again feel free to change that distance as you see appropriate and if someone's condition is down you can have one group do 10 yards and other group do 15 yards so that way they can aspire to you know to work towards that other next goal okay perfect and this next question is for both of you and Annie just wanted to know really quickly if you could describe the the karaoke sometime she has trouble working with her clients cueing them do carry ocha so do you have any cues tips for Annie to get her clients to do the the carry ocha a little more efficiently what do you want to take down? well I mean it's really I mean you really want to to just teach them the the footwork the best that you can I mean it's basically like you know the old school kind of like a great vine if you will but at a faster pace on a more you know an athletic level so you know I think it's just really slowing it down going through you know that you know step forward them behind and then and then how how the pattern works um I really don't have any any awesome ways to teach it other than just slowing it down and teaching them of pattern um Marty I don't know if you have just remember guys we always try to teach by tell show do yeah most of us are visual learners so if you cannot demonstrate exercise fairly well maybe you don't put that in there so again as Wendy said you know your body's gonna be a great position we're gonna be going from side to side so you build off that side shuffle and now you just have them cross in front they travel then they cross behind and then switch their legs and how they're doing it so again the best way to do it is to visually show somebody how to do it. yeah keep it simple and slow is smooth I think those hopefully Annie that that answer question and one other thing yeah I mean another thing I want to throw in there I mean you don't have to use that pattern again if you have like something else that you really want to um a client to do and you don't really know how to do that correctly then just take it out maybe they side-sup shuffle twice or maybe you have them do something like bounding hops instead um or bounding jumps excuse excuse me or hops I guess um so so you can be creative there we just use as an example because again you know it's in the textbook you can read about that but it's also something that Marty and I both happened to use when we were doing group training so yeah and then it's really cool and it looks like so the cool down is gonna be pretty much the same it's going to mirror our uh warm-up here so that's if everyone's been following along with us the last several weeks we want to cool down with some of those same uh alternative muscles that we identified in the beginning but now let's go over to the second template uh quickly because we're coming up to the end of the hour what is different about this template um let's go ahead Wendy yeah you'll notice that we kind of changed up some of the different test static stretches I mean again we're still focusing kind of in the same areas we did add a little bit of neck obviously so we're focusing a little bit more on the levator and the scaling as well again you're gonna choose the ones that you see best fits your group and and maybe some of the things that you're seeing and as people approach you and coming into your class the active um section again you know you're gonna see toes um you know some some great exercises that would activate typically interactive muscles um but these these are ones that you're pretty much familiar with so again if you have questions you can always let Marty and I know and we're happy to uh to go through what those are um we would still have them do the heel walks again for working the anterior tip we've added walking lunges with rotation so you know getting a little more more transverse uh work in there uh walking knee tuck instead of the frankenstines so we're just trying to show you guys that there are some different things that you can do just to kind of spice up your routine um one thing that I love to do especially in the dynamic warm up is a frontal plane lunge with just to figure eight so therefore you're getting your shoulders as well as working um muscles in the and their frontal plane lunge which is just a side lunge um and then you know trunk rotations again just preparing the body for what's ahead um and then we would go into the activation so the single leg balance with reach I mean you guys are all very very familiar with that particular exercise and then going into a stationary reverse lunge to balance so again still following a protocol making sure that it makes sense thinking about you know the corrective exercise you know strategies that we've been talking about for really you know the last few weeks and then thinking about like you know the OPET model as a whole um so you want to prepare everything as much as you can um we also for skill development when into some jumping lunges we did that again you could stay and do all like 10 of them on your right leg and then go 10 on your left or you can alternate them as well see what works best for your group see what you're comfortable with if you don't like those then change it and do something like a squat jump so you can again all alternate this I'm sorry you can do something like a speed lunge if you can't leave really go back yep and then so those that's again just our warm up Marty I was trying to go through it back and I worked a lot on time but is there anything else you want to add to that if you guys look deep you know we did a lot of scapula type of stuff we snuck in and you know you'll see that we did a little more hip-in-term rotation type of stuff with the walking lunge with rotation and some of the other things because there's always going to be areas that we just know we want to address so it's kind of like what's the hidden message in this workout or can you get multiple hidden messages but there's always more than meets the eye you know as you know from what apprentice understands and some of the questions and you know we're always trying to sneak some things in there and then we would go into the resistance again Marty and I set it up just with A and B soror pairs again if you don't like doing pairs and you have a better way that you want to set it up than feel free but we like the the traveling and then the other person stationary again just think about room and you know being able to control the room itself as an instructor but but also making sure that your participants have enough room to execute whatever it is that you're trying to accomplish with the exercises so you want to you know want to set them up for success always and so with that being said we wanted to do a frontal plane bear crawl this time and pair that with a spider-man push-up which are super super hard so if a person cannot do those then again they could do push-ups on the knees or you could think of something else like even just staying in a high-push-up position doing the shoulder taps and one thing one the I've done when I've done something more challenging I'm like all right give me five and then rest for 15 seconds give me five so I'll build in a you know a target so that way they're not doing them for a minute and a half if you so you can sprinkle that in as well exactly and again you you really want to make sure you're you're honing in on the five can edit chain check points at all times because again this is super super challenging so people will start to drop their head they'll start to you know go into scapular winging I mean they just they really need to focus on maintaining proper alignment or you need to regress them for sure and then after we did that we went into crab walks again forward and backwards and then paired that with the rotational planks and so for you guys that are on from you with those I mean again it's just being in a plank position usually I stack the arms this way and then they would go into one side they actually can increase and reach and get kind of a peck stretch which would feel great after doing the pushups and then they come right back down and just do that stack and then go into the other side so they can just rotate from one side to the other again it'll actually stretch so as an active stretch again from what they just did with the parent front but um a very challenging but fun exercise as well and then the last sorry Wendy we just got a question in from Kyle and he made a point about you wanted to know about exercise is like the bear crawl and crab crabb walks and he recognizes that sometimes there it puts a lot of demand on the shoulder stabilizer so what are some regressions that you would do in the boot camp setting to keep everybody moving and as you said Marty not really pointing anyone out but so that they can still get the same benefits from these two exercises. Well I'll jump in there because it would these were my ideas for this workout not that Wendy doesn't use these all time the way I've done this in the past is if when I assess the group that I have I know about their fitness level so I'm gonna set them up for success set them up for queuing knowing okay I got some people that'll easily do this I got some people that aren't there yet how do I address it ahead of time so you know as I get the class warm dump say all right for those that are haven't done five classes yet I want you just to bear crawl there and then get up and run back for those of you that don't over five classes I want you to bear crawl there and bear crawl back so that way I'm not pointing out that they're not good enough at it again it's that exit strategy what comes if fatigue hits and I'll always tell people guys if you don't have it today here's your regression because what if you just traveled in in our jet lag or you didn't sleep that night I think them feel comfortable with regression because in a lot of boot camps and a lot of workout people they they it's failure it's not failure it's just what's it's it's setting the tone from a very early and then knowing you give them those queues ahead of time so that way they automatically know what's happening and they don't feel that they're being called out in the middle of it because then it might might point to them in their mind that they're doing something wrong okay thanks and Kyle I hope that answers your question so let's let's keep working down template yeah so the last thing that we had was something is a broad jump to a hold again you're traveling now but you're also making sure that you kind of own that jump and what's so when we say hold it's not that you're you just want to make sure you're always in control so that's what we mean by that and then of course repeating until you get to the 15 yards and then turning around and coming back and while that person's traveling the other partner could do something like a single leg Romanian deadlift and Marty I mean I don't know if you have anything to add to those but no I just think you know where we're adding in some things that you require multi-joint stabilization eccentric deceleration and again when you're doing your broad jump give them the understanding of it's not how far you can go start off set one guys I want you to do eight jumps between these 10 yards or you pick the number so that way you know they're not overbounding then again from a okay guys if you've been doing this here for two weeks you should be able to cover this distance in six jumps or four jumps so again setting the stage and then again we're always going to spend some time on single leg we love the hinging patterns it's just something that we put in there free one leg yep and then again some type of metabolic finish or we think those are super fun sometimes you can do it as you're challenging the group or you know like okay all the A's line up and let's do this and now all the B's line up and let's do this you know so it just makes it fun and it makes it a little bit more competitive too I mean you don't have to set it up that way you definitely could just keep your pairs and do it that way it's just make it fun be creative we just want it again to provide some examples be sure to do it you know very very good warm up to prepare the body for this type of demand and then always always make sure that you finish with a cool down that's you know because again if you don't do it as a group they're gonna leave and say they'll do it later and they won't good point okay well that looks like yeah we have the finish or and again like the previous template we're going to cool down identifying those those overactive muscles to send them out proper posture after being trained aggressively by windy and mariting for the entire hour so thank I want to thank both of you very much this is very informed about the people who are listening to us today are able to take information and and start to leave this into your bootcamp practices when you're able to get back out there in the fields and train with your clients so while you're eating for a few more questions to trickle in windy what do you take away from today and tell us where to find you so I think my big takeaways is you know I'm always think you can do any type of corrective exercise so any of the CES in front of whatever type of training you're doing it if it's in the lives with a client or yourself as well as in a group think about what would be super beneficial what is typically overactive you know again it's not individualized but try to think big picture and what you commonly see and then and then design a fun program make sure it makes sense again think the big keys were making sure you have an exercise that you can progress and re-cress as Marty mentioned multiple times you know give them out so therefore they don't feel like a failure always keep it fun and be creative and the best way to find me you can email me directly at windy.bats at nsm.org or you can find me on instagram at windy.bats13 okay thank you very much windy and Marty what are your big takeaways from today and again tell us how to find you after this is all done. So a key thing is just because of a boot camp or group doesn't mean all the science because out the window and again boot camp I know people want to just hammer people give them a great fun workout a challenge on but if you follow the science they're going to be able to keep coming back and they're not going to be injured or sore they're going to burn their calories they're going to get what they want out of it and you can see we pick some very basic exercise that weren't on a scale of high intensity you know they weren't the burpees of the world things like that it was something that everyone should be able to do first day in and you could progress it for advanced people but it kept it safe but very very challenging and I think that's the key when you program and like Wendy said sneak in that CES before anything you do and then right there you'll see how Marty dot Miller at nesm dot dot dot org and then Instagram is Miller dot Marty 72. Thanks again for all of your information and thank you to everyone who spent time with us this afternoon I hope you are able to take this information and start to weave it into what you do and thank you as always to Greg who's been running the machine in the background. We will see you next time.
