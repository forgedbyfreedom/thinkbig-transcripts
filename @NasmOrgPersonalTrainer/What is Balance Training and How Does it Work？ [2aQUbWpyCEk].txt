Welcome to that NASM CPT podcast and our Facebook Live webcast, my name is Rick Richie. And I want to thank you and welcome you for being here with us today. And today we have a wonderful guest. I'm really quite excited about it was at Optima either last year or the year before that I had seen Dr. Scott Cheetam speak and it was really quite fond of him and the work that he's done and we had some opportunities to actually meet and work together on some projects. And one of those projects is the newest version, the newest iteration of the NASM correct of exercise specialist. So he is not just a subject matter expert for us on that. He did a lot more. His roles and responsibilities for helping us develop that role that out were really much bigger than what they think they started you at. But with that being said, I want to welcome Dr. Scott Cheetam. Thanks for being here. Yeah, hey Rick. Thank you and I want to thank you for allowing me to be on this podcast because to be honest, I feel complete now. Yeah. But I'm part of your podcast. I do. You had me at Hello. There are all of us. I am just kidding. But yeah, I know I want to I'm just excited to be here and you know just a chat and just have some fun and talk about you know some some of the topics that we have but also be with the NASM family and just kind of sharing. So so I just hope everyone out there's being being safe and healthy during this time. So, hey, thanks a lot man. Thank you. So I guess one of the questions I initially have for you is you brought up this idea of one of the research studies that you're working on right now and it has to do with balance. And that really peaked my interest because it happened to be doing an actual workshop at Optima this year 2020 on balance because it's all throughout the OPET model as you know. And so when you said you were doing some work on balance, I said, I can't wait to have this discussion because maybe I'll learn something. So I can go and teach some extra stuff over at Optima that I didn't have in planned on. So before we get into the actual study, can you just tell me how do you come up with the ideas that you end up doing research on and this is not your first rodeo. You've done multiple research studies. Like what what kind of poke you and says this is the direction to go in? Well, you know, I think that's a hard question because you know I because you know, I even though I'm you know, I teach and I do research and stuff. I still have a thriving clinical practice. So I don't know about all of our all of our family out there listening to the podcast, but I don't know about you guys, but I when I see something in the clinic that I don't know or if I have a question, it comes up. And so a lot of my a lot of my stimulus to create these studies or create these clinical questions through these studies is questions that I can't answer in the clinic. You know, and I'm seeing that I'm seeing this with it. I'm seeing this with with with clients and at all different levels and stuff. So a lot of my more recent research was, you know, is this trying to find out these practical questions that will make our client sessions and our treatments if you're out like health professional or your your fitness assessment and your vision is training better. You know, so. Well, can you talk as a get us into a little bit about what this research study was? What what happened with this one? Why did you choose to? To go into this particular topic? Okay, well, I think it's interesting because the study we did was on a concept called balance conference and you know, this has been a very popular kind of area of study for older individuals and you know, I don't want to put everyone to sleep this morning, but this kind of look at the research for older individuals, they the majority of the research is found that if an older person is confident with with with with static or dynamic movements, there is a decreased risk of fall. And so I thought that was interesting because when we when we look at that concept in it, if we do like let's say the state of the state of the rehabilitation or if we do balance training a lot of times in the clinic or the gym setting, we use all the unstable objects, right? You know, the famous boasts or we use the airfield discs. We use the phone pad and you know, there's there's the wobble board and the voodoo board. You know, there's all these two these different props that we use, but the thing is is that when we talk about younger populations and we talk about let's say the OBT model and we start with you know phase one and move to phase five with our clients, we typically use a lot of these unstable objects just to kind of switch it up and just kind of have final with our clients and stuff. Well, one thing I noticed over time is that when I started doing rehabilitation on you know athletes with like ACL repairs, right? You know during my rehabilitation being an orthopedee and also like ankle springs and stuff, you know every time we put them on an unstable object, it took a couple sessions for them to build that confidence, okay? And so one of the, one of the I believe one of the psychological barriers could be that if someone's not confident with the object just like just like like you know like for example, like if you and I were walking all the sudden we're walking the snow and then we hit like an ice patch. We kind of all of a sudden going to that ready squat position, right? And then we're kind of you know we're kind of like you know we're kind of finding our way. Well over the years I've seen that when someone gets put on like let's say it both do all of a sudden they're in that crouched position. They're looking straight ahead and they wouldn't even look you remember that they had to pick something on the wall and balance, you know and they don't acknowledge you and they're just sitting there and so so that that came up with the idea of saying okay well what, you know how does this, how does this concept, it's very popular in the elderly population translate to a younger act of population. So we looked at you know the, and I'll kind of get branched at the study element. We looked at two things we looked at anticipated which you know you know where they were, well we looked at anticipated versus actual ones. So what we did was is we took five common objects within the ground, the foam pad, the discs, a balance board and a boast. And so we we tested 65 after the adults with no injuries and then during phase one of the study we set everybody a survey that showed the pictures and we had them rate their confidence just checking them out like oh yeah that was easy you know and stuff like that and then we we did what's called a washout period where we give them a week off of the study so that they can kind of forget things and function and then we had each of them come back and then we had each of them actually stand to lake and one lake so bilateral and you know, lateral on each object and then rate their confidence again. And so we were trying to do anticipated and actual real confidence because believe or not just kind of a side note there's a there's quite a bit of research out there that shows that that active adults get injured in gyms because they overestimate the exercises and I think we seen that with our clients I figure this grab a bunch of dumbbells and start working out but there's actually some studies out there that show that injury rates are high when it comes to like machinery and and clients doing things so that so that kind of that kind of set us up and so just kind of ensure we we found that obviously the anticipated was a lot more higher because before a lot more confidence with with these unstable objects than they were actually so so so it was it was the first in a series of studies that we're doing but looking at balance confidence we we found that the actual you know that them actually trying it seems to be a better qualitative thing so so so the take home here is is for like you know fit pros and now at health professionals it's better for for the client to possibly do a trial on the object first and then you know so and then we use days zero to 10 scale for them to measure their balance confidence and then that that kind of gauge how we can progress or regress the activity through this construct and I do have a question is this this indicating that that people seem maybe they're more confident before they get on this object and when they get on the object suddenly they're hit with about a humility that these objects are maybe a bit more than they expected is that well where what you're saying yes exactly yeah when we're we're and so and again you know when the study comes out it's a little bit more clear but yes exactly so when people get on the objects they they automatically became fearful and then they started doing all their balance strategies right you know their hips are moving their ankles are moving and and so because if you lot if you look at a lot of the research Rick on you know the the performance of athletes on all these balance objects it's all about observable performance it's not there's nothing there's nothing there's nothing in the research that's considering the person's psychological perception you know their confidence with that what are they usually qualitatively what are they usually trying to answer then well sorry I say because I know I read through the proposed research study and one of the things that was said is that you know they want to to know if they feel confident to go back to play right so to go back to their sport are there other things that they they've been kind of looking at and this is the first time you've looked at confidence for a balance yeah so a lot of times they're looking at more of like motor controls stability it says pretty interesting so so these these you know these researchers were looking at any type of like a single like squat they're looking at the depth jump you know single like hops they were looking at more of a motor control strategy but they never looked at the correlation between you know the confidence during the rehabilitation and then the confidence is that as the effort returns to play and so I think yeah and so I think that that translates over to our no clients because that that can open a motor neuro window you know if they're confident with the object to build more progressive law now there is a question at least I think in in the research us to whether or not and you alluded to it in the beginning but as to whether or not these tools that we're talking about actually help support people in their balance um what have you seen in regard to that and you know what are the purposes of using these tools um if you know do they relate back to assisting somebody with balance that is on a stable surface and if it doesn't then why do these these modalities get implemented yeah I think I think that's a great question so so I think the first thing is and and I think it's important to bring up is the term balance is such a broad term as you know right and and I think that any of us in family will realize that if we if you read different research articles or different pariotic goals or different things the the term balance is used for many different things but if we go back to the science we know that balance is a compilation of three physiological systems right it's it's our eyes because we have to see what we're doing that works with our inner ears which is our most individual system and then obviously we have our somatosensory system which we typically call properception right so so those three systems working unison to give us that balance and so a lot of this um a lot of this research has just used these unstable objects without truly defining balance and looking at the translation of function is is what you're alluding to and so a lot of these modalities are used just just for fun and stuff but if we go back to the research and we kind of look and I don't want to get too many names but you know if we we kind of go back and look we can see the we can see the two though that um that if we look at the squat right they there's been some really good research coming out that is shown that if you squat on an unstable object your your the the power of the movement decreases compared to the stable surface right and and one thing we one thing we talk about is is when someone's standing on an unstable object we call the leaking energy out does that make sense so someone's having these big perturbations and they're shaking everywhere and stuff they're leaking energy elsewhere and they're not translating energy through their feet with like a closed-chain activity and so so a lot of the research shows that on an unstable object we you are getting multiple muscles contracting because that co-contraction for stability but you don't generate power so a lot of this research doesn't have a clear purpose and so that's where I think people are getting mixed up because they we all want to use these modellies to make it fun for our clients but again we go back to the the of the smart goals right and we have to say hey what is what is the goal of this exercise and that's where that's the out of training people you know that right connecting the modality with the purpose and so to mean those are kind of the strengths and limitations and so just kind of in summary there's really little translation right now to say okay I can have someone stand on a bow suit for two months and then their gaze is going to be great you know I'm going to get a skip on out of the gym you know like that so right I mean you know or you know they're going to do river dance or right you know after the most you know which I must hand over to so the road that yeah so yeah so that's kind of that's kind of insured you know I'm not trying to get to your but yeah it's it's it's it's it's a lot to it you know yeah well I remember I'm not sure story about my dad this was probably 10 years ago and he lives he lives where I grew up so my mom and dad are still there and place called Florence Alabama and my dad says to me one day he goes Rick the city of Florence gave us these big garbage cans and we got to put a trash and these big garbage cans I got to take him out to the street and then they can use the machine and dump it and they put it back down and bring it back down to the garage so I rolled that can up the hill and I got to the street and he goes some a balance has gotten so bad that I didn't leave the garbage can there I had to walk back down with it so I have something to hold onto and and I said wow man that's you talk about taking for granted things that that you just have until you realize you've lost it and then how scary that can be and I had him just you know just quick assessment you can you stand on one leg and you know hold on get get close to something and as anybody does he did his best leg first and it was terrible and then I said let me see your other leg and you could barely pull his other leg off the ground he was scared to so now we're looking at that confidence again and this is kind of what you were talking about except the folks that you were doing this with were were about 24 years old and my dad at the time was it was in his I think it was in his early to mid 60 so not even that old and he was getting very very concerned he was very apprehensive regarding his balance you know I don't want people with bad balance to be cavalier about it right like like people seeing the disc or the the phone pads and then looking at it and going oh I can do that but when you actually try it you can't can can this research kind of make any correlation with you know my dad's perceived confidence and what's going on with him and and clearly something for him to be aware of and as he built his confidence does that actually relate to better balance. Wow you're you're asking all the questions today. Yeah I love it yeah I know that this is that it's not what you've studied it's not what the research is about and I know it's just speculation unless we have evidence to show it so just you know yeah no I love it I encourage you I love the questions no so so you know so a couple things so first thing is as far as research and stuff yeah we needed you know my group we needed to figure out how the engine works so that's why we that's why we did healthy people first so our next study that we had and it was about to start before the COVID came out was we were going to compare older individuals to a engine population so so yeah I'm a Kiely's 10 and 10 and no so so we were going to compare those so we're going to hopefully house the answers about that too now talking just plainly you know I think I think there is some translation because we're we talk about when we talk when we look at the whole idea of what's called fear of wind or confidence issues and an individual's that typically the confidence the confidence someone's confidence almost drops by greater than 50% after one or two falls as I'm an extent okay so so so so when we so when we look at the older population like I don't know 65 or older a lot of times there were sedentary they're not as active and it's like that they they have these these postural syndromes and so like that so a lot of their their body isn't as mobile as it was and so you have this whole muscular skeletal kind of decline will that obviously affects that obviously affects balance right because balance is all the receptors and it's muscular skeletal so so it is true though that we do see at the client and confidence in general as people get older but and so that's why there's there's such a push right now and I'm sure you know you're on a bike I am that's why we're trying to to disseminate the information is that you know balance has to begin at the early ages and continue all the way through because you know if we like it or not if we're carrying groceries up the stairs right if we're if we're rehabbing an ankle spring whatever scenario you want to come up with we used balance proprioception whatever we want to call it all the time and so it's a system that doesn't go away but as everyone knows if you don't usually lose it right and so yeah and so I think what you're saying is totally true that the researchers getting but I don't have any definitive citations that I could give it the team the smarting to say okay this is one said even clinically yeah we see it we see all the time I have older individuals where they do their balance is get better when they stand on an object for a month or so you know I mean I mean it's it's pretty obvious but now we're trying to look at more of the whole psychosocial you know the whole you know bio you know biomedical model to help us look at the whole person now this is one of the things that that is included and I think brilliantly within the OPD model is that it doesn't matter what what level you're in or what phasor in there are balance components to it and sometimes in my estimation it gets overlooked and people just kind of brush it under the rug because it doesn't feel like exercise until they come to class with me and I am notorious for doing as one person once called it the the single leg excursions of death so taking these single leg excursions and challenging your sense of balance so much and and it doesn't take much that's the thing before you feel your feet start working which let's be honest you know we we basically cast our feet from the time our children are born and so these intrinsic muscles in the feet aren't really doing as much as they normally would be doing foot naked hold the same thing hips then are our competency so what we're doing is we do single leg exercises in particular you have this this core activation the the hip activation the foot naked complex all trying to have conversations with each other and then maintain that center of balance you know and then and base of support right there so with that being said I challenge balance and I make balance feel like a workout it is a piece of the OPD model and it's not just a warm up it it is actually can get you quite it can be quite exhausting quite challenging what have we seen or have you seen with either the folks that you worked with or some of the research that shows you know our our fit principle here what is the frequency that people used within the research to see some of good outcomes what were some of the intensities how long did they do it how many times a week did they come in how long were the studies before you start to see an average of where it's been efficient for people regarding balance yeah again awesome questions I love it so yeah so so when we so I think to it's it's at least for my humble perspective is that you know you know when we take our typical training training session with our clients you know balance typically begins with a warm up like if we're doing dynamic warm ups and they're standing on the one leg that's a full balance you agree you know and and then and then I think as we go through and we do seem to like squats we might do some some type of client metric stuff to me those are all balance type of exercises and so the OPD model stacks on itself like a bunch of blocks and if you don't build a foundation right and and phase one and two how can you safely progress for three foreign products and so so on that note we know with with basic science that neurological return or better motor control or if we want to get all by mechanical and nerdy we can say stability so like you know so like let's say for example some of the single leg balance on a disc with airfield disc and we're we're looking at their core and they're shaky and they're doing that that hip strategy they're they're they're swaying everywhere they're leaking energy then the angle strategy are going they're they're not very confident well then we know that that exercise could be a little bit too advanced so we may need to regress them down to the foam and then I'm saying what the phone we notice that those blocks stack up right that their kinetic chain all those kinetic checkpoints are starting to line up well and you're like wow okay they're demonstrating more stability so then from there we know that if they continue with that exercise and they they they feel confident because that's why we used the zero to ten you know they're feeling confident and let's say ten is not confident one is a hundred percent confident you know or whatever whatever scale people want to do it once once they clear that then you progress them into the next object well we we know the research and I'm kind of connecting this try to be practical is that we know around four weeks you get neurological terms so we're starting to see throughout the research and and more so clinically then around four to six weeks we start seeing adaptations occur in the mile you know neuro mile fascist is it makes sense you know and and so when we when we get that four weeks of return we start seeing that people are demonstrating better stability they have better normal control they're not so shaky and their confidence goes up okay yeah so let me ask you another question is we get this a lot as instructors teaching workshops especially when we talk about doing assessments people always want to know well how much you cue somebody into the assessment so my question for you is when you get somebody on there how much cueing is going on are you are you telling them to tighten anything or you just having them get on there and say stay on it as long as you can yeah that's that's a great question because there's research that has used the three systems in the vestibular right I mean the three systems in balance so there's been studies that had people in case and an object so they they fixed right so they fixed vision and then sonata sensory and vestibular had a work harder so there's been studies that are played with the three systems of balance what we try to do is in our study currently and what I do is I just have them stand on the object and see how confident they are because people you know because I get because it was funny because a lot of a lot of people in the study were young and they were active and they had used one of our criteria was they had used a balance object within like the last like I was like 16 or 18 months if I recall and some of them were pretty confident like I'm a wallboard I'm like okay Rambo you know like that and they're like whoa you know and I'm like ooh that confidence in there you know but you know but you know but we had some really young fit people in the study you know I'm like okay you know and it was funny because you know obviously we were right ex-num to protect them but we had some good laughs too because we had a lot of young adults from the university and their super fit well they thought that they could stand on that most you know you can be flip it over with a base up they thought that they were the coolest thing you know I I can serve you know and so so it was it was fun so so yeah so I think so I think if we're doing a true assessment I'm forcing the researchers really no time period when we look at the fit principle so when we look at frequency usually usually it's kind of daily right when we look at intensity it's really the the object and stability that's really what we're really looking at when we look at time and the different parameters and stuff for some reason 60 seconds seems to be the magical time we do a playing for 60 seconds you know everything is one minute I don't know why but I use it too and I do three sets of 10 you know have you guys have you noticed every physical therapist on the surface of your visit 10 is it's I I'm just getting ready for it but yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna get a bunch of emails down from my call and like do and when you do it but but no it's so funny so so 60 seconds seems to me this magical number when I comes to balance so when we when we talk about the fit principle probably the first couple letters or relevant the other ones are kind of up to the client I mean if the client's fatigue even are showing a lot of instability it you know safety's first because we know to the injuries can occur to make sense and when when someone's on unstable object you need to stand close to them and you need to be at least what's called a contact card cyst when you're right there and you protect them stuff so so seriously speaking a lot of these unstable objects they're great to do but it should really reflect the client's goals right and that's that's just in my humble opinion and we teach it and we embedded it in the CES when we did that and stuff but we really need to have a purpose for these for these modalities and stuff they're all great stuff it's fun to switch it up but if we're really working on someone's balance then the the fitness professional needs to go back to some type of what we call an astrics sign or some type of assessment so if they're working on a very gate will then then then their the balance exercise should be gate related does it make sense it's got to have a purpose if we're working on an athlete who is you know they're they don't have a very good single-click squat okay well then your assessment after all the balance training should be an improved single-click squat does it make sense so so the assessment has to support the balance intervention and then you do a pre-test and a post-test to look at your results and that's what research is mostly about right we have to look at before and after so I think I think just kind of talking amongst our colleagues who are listening today is this I just recommend you know that you know that if you're going to be doing balance and stuff just for fun no big deal do it for 60 seconds make sure that they're stable you know you can you can go from you know a you can you can do the ice closed progress it you can have to move their head you can throw a ball if I'm you can play dodgeball right you know you can you can bring number whatever I'm kidding but you know you can you can you can talk about exactly totally you know we need to get out videos and stuff so so yeah be creative but just be safe right and one other thing I want to better than there too is remember you remember and I think it's important to realize too is is that you you want to screen the client before you start putting them on objects that's the whole point of balance confidence is that they want to be confident but also too like if they've had a history of ankle sprites okay you got to be careful put them yeah and I think this is a good reminder and I even go for myself is that you know you might need to put a brace on their ankle just to protect them before they do a bunch of balance stuff so like I have a couple of ankle sprites of work with right now currently because of their essential they they had they had surgery and all that well if we're starting balance I made sure that before I put them on an object yes I look at their confidence but also I kind of I make sure that they've been stable on the ground than they did the phone pad so what's what also part of our study is we also did a sub a sub assessment where we kind of looked at perceptions of the width is easy and hard and it was pretty obvious the grounds easy that the phone pad and the discs they're both you know it kind of goes like that but I recommend for everybody start easy and progress slowly but also though too if they have a muscular skeletal injury where they're unstable you want to be really careful because you don't want to have an injury because as you know you know we want to protect our clients as much as possible but also make the session fun and create an experience for them and so that's that's I think is kind of why balance confidence was that you know we want to dig a little bit deeper into their the psychology of things because that's where the industry's growing and you know that there's so many things it's looking at confidence pain how we perceive that rest regeneration there's so many constructs well one thing that hasn't been touched is how was confidence you know feeding into someone's program and we use these balance to so much every day we need to look at it you know I think we also need to be aware and careful that when we do things in front of a lot of people in a gym like an open gym then there are people that want to emulate us and do what we do and do clients do and if we're having people go on to these unstable objects we have to be careful that other people in the gym might see what we're and and and just gravitate towards it and I say this out of experience because years ago when I first started training it was you know it was functional training then to in the personal training world was like you know put a a balanced blade in one hand and an eye patch on and stand on a stability ball and and wiggle and shake and close your eyes and recite French backwards and there are all sorts of things because we made balance challenging then that was quote functional training now we know that that's not true but being in that environment where we're all challenging each other standing on stability balls and throwing men balls at each other seeing who who would fall off first which I don't recommend and I don't recommend doing an in front of people because one of the members at the gym said can you teach me how to do that and I said you know what this is it's just games like this is just funding games I'm not going to teach you how to do it because there's no reason anybody in their right mind should do it and he said okay and I turned around and walked away and 15 seconds later not even I hear a giant funk onto the ground and I turn around and this man is lying face up on the ground and he goes you were right so with that being said I it is I think it's important for us to to be aware of what we do how we do it the words that we use and that people are seeing us do things and we do need to make sure that we are careful as we present things that that things that are this challenging are not just for everybody and and this isn't really a question to you it's just a conversation to have I don't know what being careful around that looks like but I do know that other people may challenge themselves with it and so maybe it is very important for people to see us do progressions with our clients so if they do decide to do some of these things then maybe they when they take it into their own hands will try it at least as far as this is concerned the progressions that we put for them I don't know what your thoughts are and that which is what they're that out there no and and I think that's a great point because you know the visibility of a fitness professional we're always on TV right you know when we're in the gym we're around public and stuff so you know and it's funny because you know I interface with a lot of different professionals and on telling you it's you know it's funny because we talk all the science and we take all these seeking classes and we have all these certifications we all these letters behind our name for each other because the clients don't get care right they don't they don't know what it is but the thing is is that when it comes down to it a lot of times we're so busy we just pick an object and we put someone on it okay and then people replicate that and and as you know too I do a lot of work with the all the big change in stuff but if as you remember a few years ago for people to try to stand on a bowstool with the base up and you squat with the bar or do thrusters right you know they're doing squat presses you know and and and that's because it was shown on social media so I think I think it is important for us to to to be logical and what we do and that's that's one of the reasons why we came up with the construct of just balance confidence so it's a way of documenting progression for clients as well as looking at motor control and you know can they stand on one leg for 30 seconds so you can do a temporal assessment how much time they're standing so we have all these assessments and stuff but like you said is there has to be a logical progression that that also reflects the clients goals and the smart that's just kind of my humble opinion because number one is like you said we're always on TV and we need to be professional and progress people systematically so that other people can follow but also secondly it also protects us you know somewhat protects us legally because we we we documented it we charted say hey look you know we progress them systematically through you know and so I think that there's there's a lot to this study as we did and hopefully the future studies we do we're going to be able to come up with a sort of like a protocol to progress the answer objects because as you know Dr. Richie is that these are these this is an untapped area we use these objects all the time one thing is is we even look at like TRX suspension train I mean there's so many different modes of this kind of balance per se but it's an uncharted area that's been used we talk about it search but there's really no refreshments of the questions either it's very it's very vacant so that's one of my new lines of research to at least try to come up with some recipe which our first thing was is we looked at the brain and now we're going to look at the the nervous system we're going to look at control and we're going to try to connect those two so that we can at least come up with something for professionals to guide them and progress into one of these objects and versus just the profession you know the fit pro or the aline up profession just pick it an object and say stand up you know let and and as you know two and most rehab clinics they're so busy these days it's really the assistance that has to watch them so there's a big gap so so we're seeing this gap in clinical practice um typical fitness as well as a research because we're not connected that's so I think there's any any time you can systematize something create you when you can show progression and support people at a starting point you brought up something that I think is really valuable and it's not necessarily for you but maybe something for us to look at for our community which is the the legality of things and over the last few years there have been more suits that have been put forth against personal trainers and facilities and and I'd like to to probably talk to somebody about that too and understanding the value of a systemized progressive means of getting from somebody from where they are to where they want to be an a safe effective and efficient manner and to have you going in and doing some research on how to fill in the blanks and what that looks like with these tools is incredibly valuable so thank you for doing that yeah thanks and yeah just to say you know I do do some some legal expert witness consulting and there's been a few cases I've had this last year out of Arizona where mistakes were made in the area we talked about so and usually usually it more so than not the professionals to visit they're not they're not thinking it through they're not focusing and mistakes are made unfortunately the intentions are good you know everyone has intentions but sometimes they put themselves back to back to back it could be a physical therapist it could be a chiropractor it could be out of the trainer a psychiatrist out of the trainer it could be a fitness professional but they're just get too busy and mistakes so exactly what your saying is is that if we have a more systematic way to work with all these very popular tools maybe it'll help as a as a holistic approach for the patient and the professional right I mean I don't who knows right we're still through your now but I think these are great ideas because as you know too and this is why you're doing the session at Optima which which of course I'm gonna attend it's really amazing and you know I'm gonna see that but this is an area that's kind of a hot topic because we're starting to see that you know we need to look at this area and address it because a lot of other areas are being getting attention like like my own fashion rules like Kylenheim I mean we've exhausted every foam roller you know so I'm kind of like I have a foam roll for tea so now now I'm looking at I know now now I'm looking at looking at this area but yeah I think I think this is a good hot topic for everyone to discuss and to check themselves you know yeah well well thank you for what you do all the research that you do from foam rolling to the regional interdependence model to now balance a lot of that stuff we have and your research and your studies have been quoted throughout our CES text so thank you for all the research that you do and now you're adding to it in a different area it's much appreciated let me let me just real quick to to Greg and see if we have are there any questions or any housekeeping things that need to be addressed before moving on and closing up you guys is a great job and covered everything that the people were talking about in the chat so thank you for that couple housekeeping things if you guys are
