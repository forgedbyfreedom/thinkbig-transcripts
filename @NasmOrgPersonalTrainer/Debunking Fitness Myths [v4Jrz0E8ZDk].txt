Good afternoon everyone and welcome to NASM Live. My name is Prentice and I'm here as always with Wendy Bats and Martin Miller and how are you all doing this afternoon? And pasting. Thanks so, thank you. Great and as always we have behind the scenes great. He's not the man in the iron mask but he's helping us keep this whole production together so thank you Greg for keeping it together today. So what we're going to do in this webinar is I have my brilliant colleagues here and we're going to talk about fitness myths. General fitness myths some of some things that you've heard going around that are pervasive in the industry been out there for for many years and we want to discuss and dispel some of these things so that you are better informed when you are working with your clients and if we do have time when these going to cover such topics our stars just pin holes in the night. Is the moon made out of cheese? People want to know about these things Wendy so hopefully we get through this and have time for you to answer those questions at the end. Fantastic. I'm ready. I'm ready. We can have Greg pull up our power point and we can walk you guys through some of our some of the topics that we want to cover. Again, Marty and I were excited because we put together a series and so today we keep it very general on just some of fitness myths that we hear throughout the industry in regards to everything from some cardio information as well as just you know just basic resistance and from it as well as you know different questions that we often hear or get regarding different populations. So with that being said we want to go ahead and go next slide and some of the basics. So let's talk a little bit about evidence-based science versus gym science. Marty and I were talking about this and again there is a big difference and we really wanted to come back to our NASM roots and what we mean by that is there's so much information that's out there on the internet you know you've got your fitness gurus you've got people that are providing you with a lot of information that is research based and then a lot of information from people based on experience and there is a very big difference when you're designing programs with your clients and just to be able to identify and talk about the differences and so what we mean by that is you know with NASM we really want you to think about your clients in individualization and so when a client comes in and you sit down with them obviously you're going to do the assessments that you feel is in their best interest to gather their information that you need. Based on that information you're going to design an individualized program and then of course you're going to put your clients through the program, per the phase and the recommendation based upon the results you gathered for the assessments and again if you're having a client go through and do an exercise they're not ready for that then you would regress them or if they excelled and they looked fantastic then you could definitely progress them as well which is stuff we've talked about in earlier webinars and so before we go any further Marty did you have any comments that you wanted to add regarding just NASM and in our roots? No just anytime we are training somebody whether it's you know a high-level athlete whether it's you know somebody that's brand new to fitness whether it's a group we're always you know in the back of our mind is the science the progressions the regressions we make it fun we make it exciting we bring in new tools and we use you know things like suspension training kettlebells and medicine balls and speed ladders but there's always a system into which we make our decisions and then we're always every single set of every single rep is in essence a movement assessment so we're always watching with their bodies are telling us so we can continue on in a logical progressive manner but the client thinks they're just having a fun time they they just know that they're working towards their goals but that's the process that we use we don't get caught up in some of the you know trends that are out there without kind of looking at them through the scientific approach and then we decide do those trends fit within the model where do they fit within the model can we modify it and or is it something that we view is too high risk and we can find a better benefit especially when we anchor to the scientific model that is an ASM and let me chime in there a little bit so that everyone who's listening to us understands what we mean when we say evidence based and if we can all picture a venn diagram we have we get an understanding from scientists of what's going on physiologically in the body like we're going to talk about cardio here pretty soon we understand what's going on physiologically so we that's the science that Marty's talking about that information that comes out in the labs the other part of evidence based is now that has to be applied in the field so we have practitioners like Marty and Wendy who take this and because not every you don't you don't necessarily see you don't necessarily see clients within the same test group that the study was conducted on so there's going to be a little variation in your results and that informs that informs some of the evidence out there and then the final part of that piece is actually what can people do actually what can clients do at the training level to sustain what they found out in the lab I would like to have someone cook my meals for me like 24 hours a day for seven days straight but it's just not going to happen so we have to figure out how to fit all of this in into our clients daily lives and you take little pieces from all of that and that informs our practices our practices as fitness professionals do you all have anything to add to that? No I think you did a great job I mean you know that's that's pretty much it and that you know kind of brings us into the to the next point that we have on there as well as like the non scientific information and you know the big question that we ask a lot of new trainers that are starting out in the field is you know when you're going through and you're learning how to design programs like where are you gathering your information and you know I actually had an experience working with a trainer who had been in the industry for a very long time but unfortunately he would get his information or his programs and we call it like the program of the day because he would get it from a magazine that just came out because it was the latest and greatest as Marty said quote trends but it really didn't mean that his clients could perform them at the at a level that they should have been doing it correctly and so you know you want to be very careful there because you know that's why we really want to take two steps back and say it needs to be individualized to what the client can perform and make sure that it makes sense for their goals as well as their assessment results. So when we say where are you gathering your information just make sure that you know if something comes out with a new tool and you really want to use that new tool is your client really prepared for that and then are you being a selfish trainer because you want to use that tool with them because it's something fun and exciting or is it something that really is beneficial and that your client can do in excel and do correctly to get the results that that tool was intended to help them with. So Marty do you want to? No I think you you really addressed it beautifully and what I've always said and if anyone's joined us on other webinars I'm sure you've heard me say this that reason I found that with any SM right away was I had heard about a lot of the different phases of training like I knew parts of it but to me any SM is our toolbox and then the tools that you see whether it's against suspension training kettlebells battling ropes pull out of your yoga I can take it through human movement standpoint say okay does it check in with the five kinetic chain checkpoints is it makes sense and now where do I slot these tools so that way is Wendy saying I don't just break out a medicine ball for a power phase if it's day one but I have other tools that I can use in the stability phase to make it interesting to progress towards those other tools or have I learned how to use a stability ball or a medicine ball for other phases so that's the exciting part of the NSM models it opens it up and just really then helps you evaluate all these other tools and then really get a mastery on when to use them in what type of workout. Yeah that's a really good point Marty and then I would I would also add to that that understanding the tools have the tools have multiple uses and as a trainer as a trainer fitness professional it's your job to first of all figure all of that out on your having a model as a framework like we do here within ASM and then figuring out how that tool works for all of your use cases like there's no you brought up kettlebells and then selfishly Wendy you're right I use kettlebells with people because I can transport them easily that's the only reason but you better believe that when I learned how to use them I deconstructed everything so that I you I learned how to use that for almost every client every client who could stand up and grip something there was a place for them there was something for them to do and then I want you to answer a philosophical question and you brought up I believe it was you when you brought up learning from gurus and there's this sentiment from that people who are put into that group that birds have been flying for millions of years I don't need someone in a lab to tell me how a bird flies the bird just flies out and the bird just goes out and just flies so therefore you should do my exercise because I know it works how do you respond how do you respond to that that that looks really attractive and then said forcefully you know some people are going to fall in line and follow that kind of mentality so how do you work if you were mentoring someone how do you work with that mentality I mean I think you know we have to go back to how personal training really started you know there was that one guy that was in the gym that had the rocking body the big arms the big chest or you know if you were the female they had like the the small body and you know arms and legs that that everybody wanted like you were finding that trainer that had the body that you wanted and then you wanted to do their exact workout and so so of course when you're starting you know when you think back on where we've we've come and you know where we started there's a big difference and I'm not saying that you know like some of the quote gurus are bad it's just again how do you get a client they're safely efficiently and effectively without causing harm you know because again we didn't want to do no harm we also want to make sure that it's realistic to the client and we want to get them there and a safe and an effective way and so you know I think if if somebody comes to me and says you know what I want to do you know this I do this exercise every time I go in or you know they always do the same workout my my question to them then is are you getting the results that you want and most of the time it's no because there's no progressions there's no regressions and the adaptation is you know is is just stagnant I mean meaning that they've always done like hypertrophy training and they've never challenged their core and stabilization or they've never gone up to power so I think you know that's kind of how I would handle it like let's just take a different approach let's look at it as as a model a stepping point which is what any SM is and let's kind of start from from the beginning and really get yourself to a level and we can kind of put yourself on a schedule every four to six weeks let's re-evaluate let's reassess let's make sure you're hitting your landmarks so you can progress and move forward versus just reading the big you know what was it the Arnold Bible that came out from day one you know I mean everybody was reading that because that's all that was out there so we've come a long way in the industry of putting research behind some of the stuff that we do and why we do it and I think that's extremely important yeah you brought up Arnold that steps to areas I did not have the Arnold Bible but my dog was Bill Pearl do who knows who remembers Bill Pearl I had that one. Bill Pearl is awesome all right so now now that we we've talked about the the overview let's get into some of the myths like if I do cardio during my phase four training and eat after midnight will I turn into a gremlin what do you say Marty? well you might enough but so there's a lot of cardio myths so Wendy and I just picked a couple that just for kind of you know top of mind and you know there's gonna be an opportunity for you guys ask questions and then you know maybe we can even circle back on some of these later today or at least maybe you know in the next weeks if we have the opportunity so one of the ones that when we were deciding this as like I've always heard this from day one is you know I need to do cardio before I warm up you know that's me the client talking to me and I would always ask okay why and you know they would pick well you need to warm up your muscles now some of these things that as we explain these we're going to say it kind of jokingly we're not always going to stick to the science but how I would speak to my client like okay so you're you're thinking if you go walk on a treadmill for five to six minutes you're magically going to just your muscles are going to be drastically warmer and they're like yes and I'm like well you know what's your temperature right now do you think and they're you know they like well maybe hopefully around 98.6 I'm like okay if you ever had a fever and they're like yeah I'm like how do you feel in the core of them like so do you think that magically by walking or running core temperatures are going to increase drastically and not talking about minor you know point one point two and they're like you know and I go through the science of it and I was like that's why you swear that's why we have homeostasis that our muscles are warm at all time now that does it mean that I should go immediately and do sprinting because now we're looking at a different type of warm-up from the central nervous system, inspiring rates and all that so when we look at doing a cardio before warm-up it's not necessary and that's why when you see the NSM model that's not first what's first is the things that are going to get people moving better the proper firm rolling techniques the proper stretching progressions then absolutely we can go do some traditional cardio but we want to ensure that the person's moving well because if they come in and let's say you know they're sitting at a desk all day or they had to drive to the gym and or males females depending on what type of footwear they're wearing you don't have tight calves and forward postures and all these things that are more than likely gonna happen what what happens when we put them right on cardio to begin with anyways we're just overloading that orthopedic structure now to quote unquote warm-up their muscles which are going to be 98.6 anyways and when you tear through the science of foam rolling we're increasing circulation we're going to get those muscles warmed up as well and a lot of my clients they start sweating during the foam rolling part of it so we're doing the same type of stuff using a different approach to get them really prepared for what's coming next in their workouts so I'm sure Wendy's got some things to jump in there as well with. No I mean I think you you were pretty spot on and in another thing too people also say you know I have to do cardio before I cool down and it's like okay what you also had the mindset that you need to do cardio before you warm up and it's they don't you know it's really just understanding the whole purpose of just doing again a light warm-up you know on a treadmill and stuff again like Marty said making sure that you've already foam rolled you've done your set of stretching and ideally some of the activation and again what we're trying to do is just kind of restore the body back at the end to work on again foam rolling and static stretching to re-align the tissues to restore the body back hopefully to ideal length and then they come back we can kind of repeat the cycle again but but yeah Marty I think that that hit it perfectly and that actually kind of brings us to the next one that I know you know that you really like jumping there really really quickly and I want to because you touched on something really important I want to make sure everyone gets this and when we talk about doing cardio very often we're talking in terms of the macro molecule currents if we're going to do that so that we can start the fat burn so we can start the fat burn use those macro molecules as energy but you brought up a really good point that I want everyone to understand in that the purpose of the so-called warm-up is to you are preparing the you are preparing the tissues but also think about what's happening neurologically now you can do warm-up on the treadmill but at best it's it's like a non-specific it's like a specific dynamic stretching and like you said there are better ways if you're following the protocol using the assessment there are better ways to to get there on the front end of your training and I will I'm sorry for interrupting Wendy oh no no no that's correct to you and again to you know another point before we moved on based on what you said Francis is also think about the type of of cardio we're not saying take the cardio away as a warm-up if if somebody really really feels like they have to but again doing the the rolling is and stretching before hand it really will be beneficial but again if somebody is sitting all day and they you know they sit in traffic and they're in their car a lot and then they sit at a desk all day and then you have them go through a proper warm-up and then you put them on a bike that might not be the best thing either so again really kind of think about what people are doing at all times throughout their daily activities and then try to balance it out when they come into the gym of doing something different so I just wanted to throw that in as well but but then again Marty I know you really were looking forward to this next topic so the low intensity cardio is the best choice to lower body fat yeah and I and I heard this for ever and I'm gonna age practice and I growing up in the late 80s you know the bodybuilding phase that was really your only way to aspire to you know as a fitness as a sport you know we didn't have any of these other things that are popular nowadays so it was basically bodybuilding and every guy in the gym would only do very low intensity cardio because one they thought it was better to burn just their body fat and they didn't want to burn muscle which is a whole other conversation but going back to my training days I'd have these conversations and again this is the way I talked to my clients and again you gotta you know decide what level of sarcasm you're gonna use but you know when people would argue all the time that no you got to do low intensity it's the only way to burn you know body fat is like well I've seen sprinters and last time I've seen sprinters and I've had the privilege of you know talking to Michael Johnson himself and you know Olympic champion those guys are jacked they don't do low intensity cardio so right there that should bust the myth right there but where the myth started from going back to the research that Brennan's was talking about guys in a lab they were doing research and they studied people at night time where they were sleeping and I go back to what I call my caveman theory the body has not changed much since the caveman days well first thing in the morning as a caveman or woman would have to go do you had to go search for your breakfast so you needed some carbohydrate stores saved so that way you could go use them to then go hunt and chase and gather your food for the day so that's just the way the body's been designed so yes at rest during sleep you are going to burn more calories from fat but you don't burn many calories overall so that's where this low intensity really came from is that's where the research started is at a lower intensity you are going to start to burn calories from fat however at the end of the day we all know from the research now that if I want to get leaner it's about how many calories did I end up burning overall compared to how many I consumed so would you rather burn a hundred calories over an hour or would you rather burn 300 calories and a half hour if appropriate so now Brennan's I know you like to do the movie drops but I view this is you know the million it was at Brewster's Millions back in the day where he had to spend as much money as he could in 30 days that's that's calories right there is how many calories can I burn efficiently in the shortest amount of time or the you know maximum amount of calories I can burn if appropriate by the phase of training of course we're not going to throw that out that's how you get to losing body weight and body fat so yes you can use higher intensities and you may not be burning it directly from your fat stores you're going to be burning it from your carbohydrate stores but after the whole process is done you've emptied the tank you burn the most amount of calories you will get leaner quicker that way now there's a a point time where there are days that yes do lower intensity cardio as a recovery day as an off day for someone this train or you're going to start with lower intensity cardio for someone that's brand new why they're joints in their body and their cardiovascular system acclimates not saying not to do it just like anything else low intensity cardio is a tool so is intermittent and you know moderate as well as high intensity cardio use the missed tools progressively in the right way you'll get a lot of benefit from it but just understand why you're doing it and also where the research and science came from is because people at rest or sleeping burn the least amount of calories overall but they're burning them from fat. Well that's 90. That's a funny point and and also when we talk about that that fat burn remember it's it's an energy source not just for directly related to exercise but remember those total commercials again I'm dating myself have a birthday coming up so you probably are going to be able to backtrack and figure it out by all the popular media references that I use but to burn a pound of calories you'll have to be on the treadmill for five hours it's not that long but think about burning you burn what three or four hundred calories in a bow of running on the treadmill that get rid of that pound of fat's gonna cost you about 36, 3600 if my math is right but if you're following a well a well rounded training program you are going to use some of that fat as because it takes energy to repair the system and that's that's also something that's going to contribute to some of that that fat loss that we're year experiencing. And then that would then bring us to the last point and you should avoid cardiovascular work when working to build muscle. Yeah I like that little left there so I kind of touched on that in the last one if you look at world class sprinters or elite athletes they're sprinting all the time and now it's easier to explain now and I'm happy that this is occurred that you know back in the 80s and 90s males really didn't want to do a lot of cardio vascular work unless they were an endurance athlete and females a lot of times didn't want to do resistive training right they each had their own fear this change over the last few years with high intensity training has really made males do more class work and females more do more weight training so each of us are now more well rounded which is fabulous and you can see the physics that you see in fitness but when you look at cardio vascular work again, practice talked about recovery you got to talk about nutrition so yes you can still build muscle while you're doing cardio vascular work you're just going to have to account for those calories as well as the recovery and again the nutrition pro course that and as I just came out with goes really well these topics so if you have a passion for that definitely check that out but you can absolutely build muscle and still do great amount of cardio vascular work if you know how to program and then know how to do your recovery as well as your nutrition and like I said look at sprinters they are jacked and they're doing a ton of cardio vascular work and they can still maintain and or build muscle mass yeah I think rugby players missed that day at school when this Smith was taught exactly both very big and muscular muscular athlete and have a high level of cardio vascular endurance so yeah you can do cardio and still and still be a relatively muscle-bound athlete yeah well and that actually leads us into myth number two and this one we go ahead and switch the slide here it's spin and it's trying it's trying oh no the computer is struggling so I guess we can pick it up right here so the myth is stretching oh yes and at first first remember clay was that if you do static stretching then like static stretching before you do any kind of intensity workout or training that you're going to have grease and that and and the reason being again there is research showing that if you do static stretching and then you go something high intensity and and and believe that there could be actual for injury so this that is true her there is research that's more current and actually very positive that states if you fall a continuum that you act to have better results and what we may buy that is you know static stretching obviously you want to stretch only the muscles that you have found to be overactive and you get that information from the assessments that hopefully you're doing with your hands and so if you found that they speed they rotated and you time stretching the lateral gap and then the short head of the bicep fem and muscles that are usually overactive when that occurs then then go into some type of active stretching which is working more on reciprocal inhibition to remember that the muscle nicely from each of the joints and then go into dynamic up which again remember the definition of dynamic warmup which is to go through the full available range of motion you're going to have a full available range of motion which is going to lead to a greater output and some of the things that we wanted we would discuss because a lot of times people think that you can't do static stretching at all when in all reality if you did stretching and then performed it in a continuum you would have a greater range in which would which would be very beneficial long term and Marty I don't know if you want to hit on that as well. Nope it's just again to file on the flow here it's all about a continuum and that's where again going back to an SM that's your toolbox that you're continuum and then you just sort of continue in this slot things in a progressive logical manner to get the best desired outcome. Exactly and then you know and again too think about if a client comes in and their feet are externally rotated and then you try to have them do a dynamic warmup following the five-connected chain check points they're probably not going to be able to do that because they don't have the range of motion so again if their feet are turned out their knees are okay and you didn't do any static stretching and you went right into dynamic the chances of actually increasing injury at a greater at a greater risk would be there and so just you know you want to kind of think about all the stuff that you've learned about you know the continuum and the process and follow the process and just be very very careful with that because if you don't it leads us to our next point which is if your hamstrings feel tight then you should stretch them. Marty do you want to talk about that? Yeah this gives me deja vu from about 13 years ago so working with high level athletes you know I had to convince them that the world wasn't because and what I mean by that is they would come up to me as an athlete or an say my hamstrings feel that I need to stretch them and I'd be like well let me watch how you move like well but my hamstrings feel tight so just because you feel something doesn't mean automatically just go right to what that seems to be always go back to the assessment because there can be a reason why something feels tight but does not need to be stretched so I think for all of us here that have been through an SM for a long time you're going to have a pretend a propensity to see far more people with excessive forward leans low back arches then you are going to see with a low background not saying that that's not going to happen and when we're talking about the hamstring here we're not talking about the short head the bicep for Morris because that muscle doesn't attach to the pelvis and it can cause that external rotation a lower leg and you may need to stretch that but we're talking about your traditional sitting reach type of hamstring stretch or when you laying your back and just bring your leg straight back so with this I always when I was talking to my clients you know they're like but my hamstrings always feel tight and I'm like okay how long have you been stretching for for years and again my sarcasm is well what's the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result so if you've always been stretching your hamstrings and they're not getting better maybe that's not the problem so when somebody has an anterior pelvic tilt or an excessive forward lean their hamstrings actually in a lengthen position so the central nervous system figures that out and is like okay you're going to pull me on this massive amount of stretch I'm just going to lock up in a lengthen position because if you go any further I'm likely to tear now we could go through all the other things that happen with that what's going on with the glutes and all that but that's why you see so many hamstring injuries from people who are runners or sprinters because they keep stretching them which it basically is pulling them apart and there's a lot of trauma to the to the muscle fiber in that as well then they don't ever focus on their hip flexors and the glutes and then they run hamstrings in a weak in position and it tears and then most people if you're watching professional sports on TV they're like oh they must not stretch their hamstrings enough and it's this crazy cycle continues so when something feels tight take that into account but don't make any judgments until you do an assessment because you're probably going to see that that muscle does not need to be stretched even though it feels what we would consider neurologically tight it's not short in tight it's long in tight it's still foam roll it but you want to hit the other side of that joint give that hamstring a chance to relax yeah and if you're a very visual learner or visual person which I am the easiest way to think about it as Marty said is as your pelvis goes in a forward position think about what has to happen that the hamstring gets into a length in position right so you're kind of like your butt goes up in the air which means your hamstrings have to lengthen and you can feel it's taught so it's like you could pluck it and that's why that's why it feels tight because when you feel it it's literally pulled from end to end and if you had a string and you did that and then you tried to stretch it I mean think about the stress that you're putting on to that muscle which is going to lead to the strains and the tears and those types of injuries so super important as Marty said you know stretch the hip flexors strengthen the glutes give the poor hamstrings a break and that usually will help kind of bring the pelvis back in a neutral position and one of the main reasons we stress so much about the assessments so you can actually you know take this myth and bust it very quickly um think that's super super important and then Marty why should she a senior's a boy dynamic stretching I don't think they should that's why it's a myth again dynamic stretching I'm going to keep using this term today is a continuum what might be dynamic for my mom and her mid 70s it might be very slow for me and then if you watch these elite athletes that we've you know seen I'm never going to move that dynamically because dynamic isn't how fast you can go it's how fast you can go with control so again a dynamic stretch could be for a senior could be just sitting up and out of a chair and then coming up on their tiptoes and it's moderately slow for most people but for them they're moving towards that dynamic over time I promised to even they will get more dynamic but it doesn't have to be that ballistic we don't use that term or excessive it's dynamic is the term we're using which is you're starting to move in a progressive manner with some speed but it's always going to be under control so this is really going to carry over to activities a daily living for these seniors right stepping up and on for curb or up and down a staircase or getting out of a chair in and out of you know a car so these are things that are going to be important for them that just helps their everyday life just again use the continuum don't pick a speed that you're going to use let's see how they move and then just progress them from what they can control and I want to talk about speed again and you brought up a really good point that I think it's all to common in the industry is that we have the we have this prototype of what speed and strength means that's not relative to the population that should work with and that's why people swear off doing plyometric exercises any so called phase four phase five training because they're they're rating that particular population against something that's completely unrelated and so just to get an idea of what speed is like if you if you ever have time just go into the USA track and feel look at the senior track track and field championships and look at the times and distances relative to age if you're going to make a judgment on what speed is you can you can judge it from those specific populations and by the way length for Christy still kills me in the 100 meters five out 15 seconds so what is very specific to the population yes absolutely and then our last myth that we're going to cover again we are going to do this as a series instead we're going to break up different types of exercises for upper body lower body core in the future so again we were just keeping it very general so when we said like myth number three on resistance we just picked some of the the ones that we commonly hear again and this is usually coming from a female unfortunately but if you lift heavy it's going to make you bulky and I can tell you that point number one as well as muscle ways more than fat they go together and so when you look at the difference again if you have one pound of muscle and you have one pound of fat then how how much do you have of each you have a pound so if you have a pound of one thing and a pound of another it's going to balance out but what the difference is the density of the two and as you can even see in the picture that we showed you and provided the fat obviously is going to it's going to take up a lot more space than muscle that's going to be obviously more dense so so Marty I mean you want to take that even deeper and go into some of the scientific fun stuff behind all this sure so first of all you know everyone's going to have their propensity to what their genetic code is right so bulky for each person you know for muscle hipperchrophy is on a on a scale of spectrum so yes there are some females out there that you see doing these you know these higher intensity workouts they have put on some muscle but by in large men who have a tremendous amount more testosterone in their body which is the key hormone you know in practice you know he and I can both the testes it's not always easy for us to add muscle mass and we have the advantage of having testosterone so what I would encourage females to do is if you can put on muscle we can monitor that you can always peel back in a sense of change your program up change your nutrition change your diet but if you have the blessing to put it on as a female take it because it's the healthiest tissue you can add it's going there's so many other benefits health wise and then add a certain age you're going to struggle anyways even if you had the propensity to put on muscle when you hit anywhere between 26 on there's going to be that slight decrease and then obviously in your 40s and 50s it escalates even more so it increases metabolism all these other factors so let's not be afraid of it let's just understand that for females it's going to be even harder than males and you can control it with adding cardio muscular work and or the nutrition as well so there's ways that you can balance that out but I would encourage you to add the muscle on first and then if you feel that you've added too much muscle on you can always change your program but a lot of people who assume they were going to get bulky they didn't have the genetic DNA or nor was there expectation realistic to what it would have happened and then also as Prennister talking about you know it's all going to be relative women should really be okay with getting a little bit stronger because of the bone density and going through these other phase of training again there's other benefits they're going to help them with their overall health so I would rather somebody show me that they're putting on too much muscle mass and then I can make the adjustment with nutrition and training then assume they're going to get too bulky and be afraid to even move into that phase of training when appropriate and then if you think about this too you know as you as you get lean you know so you're actually you know losing body fat and you're gaining muscle tissue then you actually are going to be smaller and I think that's the big key is that when people say it makes me bulky it's like what if you don't change your diet and then you start lifting like super super heavy then yeah you may get bigger but then why not lean yourself out so again I think that's when the programming is going to be very important as a trainer that you sit down with your client find out what is their body fat what do they want it to be and then also too think about the look you're looking at the OPPT model you know starting the stabilization phase if you're doing 12 to 20 repetitions you're not lifting a lot a lot of weight so you're probably not going to put on this huge amount of mass and the same thing even when you get to phase two it is a super set you are increasing the amount of weight you're lifting but it's still at a pretty high high rep count I mean you are maybe going to gain a little bit of size but I think you know it's just the mindset of understanding that that it's okay to to look lean and mean if you will versus you know trying to be and I hate to word it this way but like a skinny fat because you could be super super thin with no muscle mass but again there's a lot of health benefits if you do have muscle you know muscle on yeah and to your point when do a lot of people the only thing they judge for overall health is the scale so if somebody if you let's use female you know wants to get down to 120 but yet they're 124 they might they go oh my god I need to lose four pounds but if you look at that picture the 124 you may look so much thinner than you know to me because you've got muscle on the density is so compact because it's muscle that's where they get confused with the scale number and that's not always or generally not even a good indicator because that's not really telling the story it's what what is how do I feel how do I fit in certain clothes what looks good for me so if we can get sometimes people away from the scale only and get into body fat and all these other things then we can maybe pick a better target on the scale but the scale alone people can really get confusing get frustrated when they are actually looking lighter but yet they're caring four pounds more of muscle than what they thought and in another sorry keep going back to the suit Marti in our we can tag team this all day but as a trainer if you do have a client that this is a big fear I think it's super super important in the very beginning to include this a comfort measurements assessments so therefore you can see that they are getting smaller if they're saying that all of a sudden they feel like they're getting bulkier because they're actually you know gaining muscle so again as Marti said the scale shouldn't be the key factor to a client but if you can actually use the measurements to show them that they are getting leaner in certain areas and and all together they are looking hopefully the way that they want to look that that could just be a very big you know big numbers to have that could could really decrease the stress of a client that feels like they're gaining weight so Marti can you isolate a muscle what we're going to talk about it's more of the fitness myth of this not where we're going to start my corrective exercise in corrective exercise can we try to target a particular muscle yes but when we look at resistance training especially when we get into phases you know to and on people like oh I'm going to go do a bicep isolation exercise so you know back in the day apprentice and I how many concentration curls do every Friday apprentice that was like our finisher right you know because you got to isolate the bicep and do the peak so last time I checked something's holding the weight right so yes my forearms working you know we're focused on it being a concentrated bicep curl but also what's preventing me from falling forward there has to be something in my back you know keeping my shoulder in place whether it's good former bad form so there's always going to be other muscles working so really I always tend to say I I'm training movements that's an elbow flexion movement it's not just a bicep exercise doesn't mean I want to speak to my client that way because that's the terminology they understand but truly truly you know from a bodybuilding standpoint or a hypertrophy standpoint are you really ever isolating a muscle not as much as some people might think there could be unique situations but my and large there's always going to be other things that are in play there and there's another way to look at this too and it's something called the all-or-n-un law or all-or-n-un principle back in the day depending on on what book you're reading but I mean you want to think about this too like your motor units within your muscle fibers so you know your motor units are either going to contract maximally or they're not going to contract at all and so it is really looking at origin and insertion and on a different way of thinking about this is when people talk about the differences of of your peck for example there is some differences between like your upper peck and lower peck and if you do an incime press versus a regular press or even a decline there is going to be some some focus on different areas however the other portions are still going to be working just not maximally based on the direction of the pool if you will but you can't really train inner peck versus outer peck and that's why that all are non-comps because again origin and insertion if you're doing the actual exercise you can't just target the center part of the actual muscle it all either contracts or it doesn't contract at all so so again don't really think that if you you know go into a chess press and you supinate at the very end and you do all this and extra squeeze that you're going to focus more on your inner peck because that's not the case so I just wanted to also throw that in there too depending on when you're thinking about isolating a muscle it could go two different ways like how Marty said there are more muscles and synergists and and other key factors like core that's playing a part and positioning but then also when you're actually executing in the exercise you want to think of it a little bit differently as well and when you do mind going over just for clarity six I know what you're speaking about like upper peck lower peck inner peck that we have a peck major peck minor but if you can maybe expand on that all because we have that's another myth like oh there's an upper peck or lower peck well you can take it I mean it's it's a fan shape but I think that's what you're going with that I just want to make sure I'm going to answer your question correctly but go ahead so I mean you know people when they do incline back in the day they did it because they thought they were training their upper peck that's there is no muscle called the upper peck it's a peck major now as when he's explaining perfectly you might feel it more but the muscle fibers that are firing fire from origin to insertion and you will feel it differently but there's not a separate muscle there to target or like a lower peck to do decline variation is good and when you now cover some variations that are great when we get to body parts and some that might be higher risk from orthopedic standpoint but just from a clarity standpoint you have a peck major peck minor there isn't none of these other muscles that people in the gym will say oh I'm going to go do incline to train my upper peck it doesn't exist it's just you know the the muscle fibers are going to feel differently because of the body positioning and that's perfectly okay yeah absolutely and with with any exercise actually you can if that muscle inserts into one tendon well that's and like you said it's like you've been from yeah origin to insertion that's all you got but definitely you can get stronger you at different leverages so you may not feel as strong doing like a decline pushup but as you may not feel as strong as you would doing the pushup in the standard position but yeah you're you're not training different portions of muscle correct and then the last one spot training this one's also one of my favorites you got go for it so you know oftentimes you know you'll you'll hear people will come in and say you know what I really want to work on my my love handles or I want to work on my outer thighs because I've got thunder thighs and and stuff like that and unfortunately that's not how that works so you can do certain exercises all day long and yes you may be strengthening the muscles that are underneath that but what what you're seeing is actually fat and so um so you know again you can't just target fat tissue and and and and stuff in one particular area it's going to be you know something that's going to happen throughout your body and unfortunately the lot of that's on genetics and you know certain people will lose body fat and their arms faster than others or their mid-section faster than others or in their legs faster than others or of course the the glute area so unfortunately you can you can you can do exercises all you want and you can strengthen the muscles underneath the fat but you cannot specifically lose body fat in one centralized area it will happen throughout you got to pick the right parents basically exactly and Marty I don't know if you want to add any more to that but no like you know I would always join with the bot reduces you know that's out of my realm that's called plastic surgery and you know I will get you the best shape possible and the better shape we get in and you can go through all the different physiological benefits you're going to give your best chance at the best looking version of you but my goal is to get you the best physical shape from a conditioning standpoint and cosmetics take over from there and then we got the nutrition of course but you know I never tell a client I can promise them cosmetics I promise them improve performance throughout a you know a fitness model and that's what I guarantee I can do if they participate in work hard and do the homework that I ask them to do whether it's corrective whether it's focusing in on their nutrition whether it's extra cardio of ash to the work then they have the best chance but the models are going to work to get them in the best physical conditioning and then genetics and then a lot of work on the nutrition will give them their best chance at cosmetics okay so it looks like we have backed up to the hour I'm sorry Wendy you cannot you are not going to have the opportunity to explain Astro physics to us today I'm Princess I got that I don't worry I will save it for the next time but since I'm talking to you right now Wendy what are your what are you big takeaways for the day? I think the big takeaways is really think about you know just be very secure in using the model I mean you know gets know your clients do a proper assessment follow the model um utilizing the phases of training and they're going to see or get to specific adaptations based on the phase of training that you're putting them in just trust the science behind it again bring in tools bring in fun things that you want to as long as it makes sense the client can perform it safely and it's not about you it's about what's in the best interest of the client I think that's really kind of the big thing and just because something was printed or just because you read something really find out the research behind whatever was Princess to see if it really does make sense because there is some really good research out there and then there's some you know opinionated stuff that may not you know really kind of you know may cause some confusion so again you know if you have any questions or you want Marty and I to go into detail you can feel free to contact us my contact information is Wendy.bats at nasm.org or you can find me on instagram at Wendy.bats13 and of course I'm always happy to help the best way I can. Okay thank you and thank you as always for joining us today Wendy and Marty what are your big takeaways. Absolutely. Everything Wendy said absolutely spot on I grew you know that's why we've been doing this for so long and then the only thing I would say is you know I'm out there looking to see what people are doing on social media and all that when I see an exercise or whatever people are doing I whether I like it or not I just filter it through what what could I do to make that better I like where they're heading with that but I just filter it back through the model because sometimes I get like you know I had thought about doing a lunge that way but I'm going to tweak it here here and it goes into this phase of training I don't just randomly do it for every single person on Monday because I saw someone do another version of a lunge. Does it match up with the five kinetic chain checkpoints? Do I know where to put it in and do I have progressions and regressions from it then I'll absolutely hijack that idea but I just filter it right back through you know the process of the model so and then to get a hold of me you see my email there it's Morty.miller at nsm.org and then Instagram dr.marty.miller 72. Right thanks again Marty and thank both of you for putting this together thank you for your knowledge thanks to everyone who joined us today and thank you Greg for keeping us together not leaving us there in a black hole so we will see you I will see you the next time
