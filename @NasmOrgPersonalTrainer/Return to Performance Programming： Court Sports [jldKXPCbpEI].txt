Hi, how are you doing everybody? This is Ken Miller and we are here with the National Academy of Sports Menons Medicine and when I say we I mean myself out here in Alameda, California and my good buddy Tony and her right out there in Alameda, join us Hi, how are you doing, Tony? Hey, Ken, I'm doing great man. Happy to be back on with you. We've had a couple week hiatus. So I'm excited about today and hope everybody listening in as excited as well. Joining you from sunny Atlanta, Georgia right now and yeah, thanks so much for tuning in and what is this our sixth episode and our return to performance series? Number six and those first five went by really, really fast but you know when you you know as I was watching our hip complex video the other day and we we went over a lot of stuff in I mean a lot of a lot of content between the foot n ankle, the knee hip complex, shoulder complex as well as you know just the overview. So a lot of great things that you and I have had a chance to sit and talk about but I think as we get into this sixth episode and all the way to number 10 if we make references to some of the other videos or how to address the other parts of the body foot ankle knee hip shoulder you know you just just as easy as clicking on some of the previous video. So just a quick quick a little bit of information on that one on May 6th we did just the overview. Actually the foot n ankle on May 6th we had the knee on May 13th and we have the hip complex on the 20th of May and then the shoulder complex was the last one that we did so yeah so just to kind of tune up on some things and what we've covered and what we can address with court sports which is why we're here today. I was watching the the hip video and see what else we can that T-Off of or or or or kind of the springboard off of that when it comes to the recondition part but I'm really excited for today just because you know nothing gets me excited for about these webinars told me then to hear you talked about and share your experience when it comes to the athletes some of the high level athletes that you've had to work with on this so so likewise buddy yeah yeah if you're watching also don't be shy go ahead and type in your questions on the comments and at the end we're trying to save the last 10 to 15 minutes of this of this webinar four questions so we can address things as you guys may need or things that you've had questions on that didn't have the resources or have somebody that you can ask these questions towards or if it just sparks a thought on you know clients that you you might be working with not just you know volleyball players or basketball players but anybody who's active that might resemble the court sport environment that we're talking about so so Tony let's open up with with return to performance and again if we talk more about one sport versus the other like basketball and you know this could be volleyball and we talked about bad mitten you know anything that kind of looks like you know what you might do on a court so just a general activity might be something where you know like basketball you're running stopping jumping so there's there's a lot of dynamics that goes into this sport of basketball as it does volleyball for that matter so if I've had a chance to work with some collegiate volleyball players in my past and it's been it's one of those things and when we talk about sports sports is that there is a lot going on so when it comes to getting an athlete or whether they're professional collegiate or recreational and I do I do work with you know junior high and high school kids as well you know the the source of issues that can contribute to an injury can come from anywhere right or it can take one thing whether it was an acute injury let's say an ankle spring it affects everything that that person does right yeah absolutely absolutely and that you know speaking of an ankle spring there's a variety of mechanisms for that but and we'll get into this when it comes to the reconditioning elements specifically for basketball but the the amount of contact that's involved in addition to all the other things that you made mention of right so so let's let's talk about injury and sport now you know just kind of step back a little bit when it comes to return to performance and something that we might have said or might have emphasized in one of our earlier webinars the fact that especially at the higher level athlete they may be identified as the injury right so how many times do you talk to somebody and you're talking about a player that might have played collegially or professionally like years ago and like oh yeah you remember that one running back or that one basketball player what what was it that he suffered you know was it hamstring or what took him out that year was it low back was it is a killie so what happens when you when you're working with athletes is that they they become right their doctors report like they become their MRI they become their x-ray they become you know when you're watching someone get locked off the court and back into the locked room you're watching how they're carted off or how they're locked off and it's like oh they're already people are diagnosing and figuring out okay well that's got a bzacio it's got to be you know some drama with this tip so I think the one thing about return to performance just overall is that the athlete is not the injury right because if we start to pigeonhole when we start to pigeonhole or start to categorize an athlete even though it's been diagnosed it's is that they become that thing right so if it's a low back is she not he started to focus on the low back or the knee or the foot ankle and the reason why I'm bringing this up is because as we get into the assessment process you start to shut out other things right so if it winds up being a low back or hip issue you start to focus on that area right and you stop and you and you put your blinders on and you start to neglect other things that can be addressed as far as okay what's it gonna take for this athlete to get better what's it gonna take for this person to come back more resilient when it comes to this fourth that they're trying to to take a hold of so so when we talk about the assessment process and what it takes for us as fitness professionals strength conditioning coaches to get a player back onto the court and yeah and the context of return to performance there's something that took somebody out of this sport that took them off the plane field or off the court and it's our job to get them back on so what are what are your thoughts on that you're gonna be because you know in the realm of working with professional sports as you have you certainly that winds up being the discussion you know when you're talking to the coach or the athletic trainer or the physical therapist for the team and things like that so I just wanted to get your perspective on on that whole that whole concept sure sure what well you know as far as the assessments are concerned you know when discussing the players return to performance status with the coaching staff and player development you have to understand what are their benchmarks for success what are the things that they are looking for from the athlete that would signify that they are ready to return to to full performance but then on the strength conditioning sports medicine side there are a battery of assessments that can be done to establish baselines early on in the return to performance process and then that you can re measure against later on as that athletes getting closer and closer to to get back on the court and so I think one you just have to understand you know what are the expectations of the athlete what are the expectations of the the coaching staff that would indicate that they're satisfied with with where the athlete is in order to to return to to playing and return to performance and then how can you layer in some of the more objective assessments that you would use to determine their their eligibility or their their status when it comes to returning to performance and if there's a disparity there what then needs to happen in order to close that gap and so you know we talked as we went through each of our episodes week by week for different parts of the body ankles knees low back shoulders we discussed a variety of different assessments that could be utilized in order to help you determine help the athlete determine you know if they're ready and where they're at in their in their program to to come back but when we just look at some of those assessments will revisit those the overhead squat single egg squat you've got the depth jump or landing error landing error scoring system assessments more dynamic assessments you got vertical jump you've got a variety of different agility assessments when it comes to lower extremity injuries in particular you've got your hop series where you can do you know triple hops for distance single egg hops for distance crossover hops and so again revisit some of the the previous episodes if you want a little more information on that we've got our reactive assessments like shark skill tests our lower extremity functional test if you're looking at some agility stuff and then in the upper extremity we've got our Davies assessment and then really any other assessments that you feel would be relevant or that the coaching staff feels will be relevant to to get that that athlete back so whether it's a conditioning protocol or or anything else. I mean ultimately you can't you can't manage what you don't measure but you want to make sure that there's a sound ration out behind what it is that you're assessing and testing for and so with all of these particularly with the hops if you're doing power based testing like a single egg vertical if you're doing the reactive agility testing you want to see improvement over time and then one of the key benchmarks that's looked at a symmetry between the the uninvolved leg and the involve leg as the athletes come back the benchmark typically for that is you want to get them to within 10% or less of each other as it relates to performance during those particular assessments so you know if there's a particular distance that's achieved you want you want the involved side to be within 10% of the uninvolved side if there's a particular time involved you want the the involved side to be within 10% of the uninvolved side so those are some of the key things to to look at and you know if you get within that 10% symmetry then you know things are are looking relatively good as it relates to that individual being ready to to get back in and and stepping up and ramping up their level of activity right right and you know the thing about the assessment process is that you know sometimes if you're if you're working with an organization with which you have or alongside as a as a contractor you know sometimes you just it's got to be a little bit of a sales job to you know to create that little buy-in on some of the things that you're doing and one of the things that I found successful with that is it's taking taking video or even still pictures if I had to on okay if it's a compromised left leg or some like you know knee and you're doing the you know the hop to land you know not just the distance but also if I were to film how they got there so even if they got within that 10% that you mentioned because you know we we do need that symmetry because if they're gonna load right chances are gonna they're gonna try a little left if they can't do one of the other one side's gonna take the hit so if I'm watching you know if they get 20 yards on one 20 yards or like in the yards on the other well with them at that 10% but if they got there because they had an excessive forward lean or the knee was collapsing are they just drop the hit on every time they landed then you know qualitatively you know one of the experts that to the coaches or the athletic trainer or the physical therapist like yeah he's meeting your metrics however he doesn't mean that you know he's ready to go you know not that I'm trying to hold a player back because that's the last thing that I want but when the question comes up you know is this person ready for full integration and to practice and to competition you know can I put him out well if I'm looking at 19 and 20 close numbers and that's not bad for him out from you know coming back from injury or taking a little bit of a hate as however if we're using it as say hate these word predictive because there's no way you can predict whether or not someone's got to get injured or re-indred but we know that if someone moves more efficiently the statistically when it comes to the possibility of get hurt the less compensation the least less likely to something's going to happen although there's plenty of people that you know have been playing our competing for 20 or some years between high level and recreational that never get hurt right but you watch them during a competition or watch their compensation steering in assessment you're like how is this guy walking around with a pain you know it's because they're their feeder pointing one way and these are coming in they're all they're all full of competition but nothing ever happens but the fact that you know if we bring up some points you know with what we would call the kinetic chain checkpoints and if any one of those points are you know erratic ziggings and zagging one way or the other we can use those as part of our process because as we build in their self care program they're correct to exercise strategy something that they're going to do in addition to basketball or volleyball this you know the the the battery of assessments that you listen off Tony were you know can be looked at as okay not just how far how fast but how well yeah so especially with with this sports the hops jumps the depth jump the the last tests those those have been very impactful when it comes to how I decide or not just not just my decision making process but the information I decide to share with the coaches from that vantage point so so when it comes to the assessments you know you can you can take those all collectively as data points right no no assessment in and of itself is going to to weigh heavily you know when it comes to ways more than another when it comes to how we put a program together it's it's a it's a collective strategy okay so if you look at okay how are the different ways that we're challenging the hip how are the what are the different ways we're challenging the foot and ankles and now we can look at and even kind of hone the the the corrective strategy or the reconditioning plan if you will based on okay he does well going forward a lateral not so much right so so when we talk about these different assessments especially when we talk about the left test where you're taking somebody through forward lateral rotational backward motions something like that has been been a pretty impactful assessment if I were to weigh any assessment more than the others when it comes to assessment so do you have a go to that you might look forward to or or that you look to to give you the most information or how you decide where to bring somebody or how to program design for for an athlete now I think I think everything we just listed but the left the left is highly it's highly impactful all of all of the above yeah there's a reason reason why we highlighted these I think after you and I have talked about it a few times but yeah I think they they all have value they all allow you to look at at the individuals capabilities a little bit differently as you're all as they're all allowing you to to see a different expression of that athletes potential and where they're at you know but the left in particular is is useful it's not used as often as as I think it should be because you are able to assess how that individual functions dynamically and all three plans with changes of direction and different levels the shark skill test is another one it's it's easy and simple to use you know the nice thing about most of these is they require very little equipment you just need a little bit of space to be able to perform and so their their utility goes up quite a bit because of that right right now with all these do you find yourself and again I'm picking your brain here because I'm really curious on how how you how you approach the return to performance aspect with the different organizations and individuals that you work with but are you have you know how different is the conversation that you have with a player and the coach or the other sports medicine staff when it comes to the results how different is your communication when it comes to the results well sometimes it might not be a whole lot different you know depending on the athlete there's certain athletes that are driven by data they like to know the details and so what you share with them may may not be drastically different than what you might share with with the other members on the team that are involved in in the reconditioning and return to performance program but then there are others who aren't as concerned with with that they just want to know you know what your thoughts are you you know do you feel are they are they ready to go where they're at what are some of the concerns that you have and I think the most important thing is is just being honest and you know leverage the data leverage you know if you are using video or images you know include them in that process include that in your explanation and you know that way they know exactly where you're coming from you know however you don't want to instill you don't want to instill fear or you don't want to influence and athlete it's confidence either if they're feeling really good and and they don't really feel like there's a whole lot going on you want to try to you want to try to build and and springboard off of that too if they're feeling well and and they're excited you've got a temper you got to temper that with the reality if there is something that's you know a rire if something isn't progressing the way that the way that it should be so if there's again if there's a disparity between maybe what the athletes feeling and experiencing versus what the data is showing you have to be able to to temper that a bit and and you know pull the reins in without without completely shutting down the athlete in the in the process so you know it's a balance every situation's different but you know I've been fortunate that many of the individuals that I've worked with are they're inquisitive they like understanding where they're at they they welcome the the data and the information and then based on that they understand the decision isn't informed decision and the recommendations that are being made are informed recommendation so you know I don't know if that answer your question completely but yeah so you know it's interesting just because you've worked in a similar capacity where you know certain clients that I've had I've been I've had to be an advocate for the athlete as well because you know an organizational an organizational an organization an organization's desires or plan might be slightly different than what what may be most ideal for the athlete at a given time and so you know that's another area that you have to you have to be mindful of and that you know ultimately if if you're representing the athlete and independently of an organization you have to be able to advocate for them and what's best but also understand you know where the the organization and and and the staff there is coming from too and be able to have have a discussion that is based on on the data and that's where the the assessments and in the information that you gather are so important because you're able to communicate that with the team you're not just providing an opinion you're providing them with with statistics and and with information that basically supports why you're making a recommendation or you're sharing the perspective that you want right right and I just to kind of tag on to that yeah I mean the idea of talking to Dr. physical therapist where you know if it's something like a need they're talking about okay where our goal is 105 degrees of knee flexion and you know we're at you know we're at 95 okay well let's see what else we can do you know so numbers do come up quite a bit just because I think that that's their experience and and when you come from a world of or you got to work with people that are live in a world of protocols and you know timelines okay if we're talking about a three month rehab process how can we get through the rehab process or six months rehab or longer depending on the injury at what point do we start to do that hand off from from rehab to modified reconditioning or returned performance programming and then back into practice and play so that's where the numbers tend to you know can be wiggled with I guess as far as interpretation goes but I love what you said about you know sometimes you have to you have to act on behalf of the player and I mean there's there's been times where you know it's you know they want to get in there and you know they there's no obstacle in their way just tell me what I got to do and I'll do it I just want to get back on the court let me play but then sometimes you have to protect them from themselves right because if they are the guy that's jumping in the you notice a discrepancy between how you know landing on their right versus landing on their left or they're in denial about some of the pain that they want that they're that they wanted mid up to you know as you're watching their face as you're watching their compensation patterns as they evolve over the minutes that they play or minutes that they practice sometimes you do have to you know you have to be an advocate for them on behalf of the organization like you're seeing whether it's a school or a professional team but sometimes you also have to in my experience you know protect them from themselves and say hey you know I love for you to jump but here let me show you the video of how you're landing and this is you know and this is not gonna end well if this is how you repeatedly perform that move so I think it goes both ways when when you're involved at that level you know as far as you want you want them to do well and you want you know hey you know you're job if it's possible to tell this sports medicine or the coaching stuff that this player is in better shape and you realize right or they're progressing really well ahead of schedule however you want to put it but then there's also those times where it's like yeah they're doing well they're hitting these parameters however they're also doing this like you when I talked off line a little bit about you know player that you know Montesupple however you know they're they're mezer you know how their body reacts after after practice and some of the things that can happen after they go hard on the court you know because if it's matter getting that starting position and they're that alpha and they want to compete they want to get out there sometimes you just have to say hold on man let's you know let's let's take it easy we will get there we just have to do these other steps you know when it comes to that you know yeah I think too that's um you know what you said is appropriate and applicable to the programming piece as well not just returning to to play or getting back on the court but when you're able to leverage video let's say of an athlete of the athlete jumping and they are excited and eager to do more intense more dynamic activities but they can't control how well they land you know you know as well as I do one of the key elements is eccentric control and the lack thereof that many athletes possess and you know that's an extremely critical component to the return to performance piece that that's often overlooked so when we look at you know we get into our sample program it would be a phase one OPP program when you focus on stabilization stabilization endurance and you incorporate reactive and plyometric elements that that emphasize the eccentric and isometric eccentric and isometric components of a particular exercise that's drastically different than many return to performance programs and so I think that's one area that the kind of sets our approach apart from um or maybe a more traditional environment and so I think to your point if you're able to demonstrate to the the athlete hey look every time you jump this is what's happening this is why we need to focus on these things this is why I'm having you do this particular exercise in this particular manner because when you go and jump on the core or you go and perform this particular activity this is what's happening and this is this is what contributed to what we're dealing with this is what contributed to that in the first place so sorry I lost my screen here guys apologize so with that I mean let's get into the the programming and you know basically what we want to highlight are some different strategies using the OPP team model framework that you can implement as part of your return to performance process with with a client or athlete and so when you look at return to performance programming components a critical piece is the movement health or movement preparation component and so with that that's where you would implement some of the self-care corrective exercise strategies many of which we we highlighted in our previous episodes so based on the region of the body foot ankle knee lumbar pelvic hip complex or shoulders you know their specific corrective self-care strategies it could be implemented to help support the athlete returning from from an injury in those particular regions and then when you look at kind of preparing for activity preparing for practice or sport there's the dynamic functional warm-up process that would also incorporate some elements of corrective exercise and then blending that into you know preparation for the the activity itself and then can when it comes to the the performance programming what are some of the components that we we would focus on or that we will focus on and cover well it's it's gonna it's gonna change right the goals as as you progress through someone's training program you're gonna change focus from stability to strength and to power now ultimately you know you're progressing you know you you're athletes time your athletes bodies need to determine the timeline right so whatever you know there's been plenty of times I you know I come up with the yearly plan right from from a collegiate strength conditioning standpoint one of my jobs was to come up with plan for for the team and and it's not that different when you're when you're talking about expectations of you as a strength coach or personal trainer when you are working with an athlete who is a part of a team or an organization because one of the questions that they have is okay well what's the plan how are we going to get this person back on the field there are starter they you know this is their senior year they want to get back in a play you know what what are the chances of get this person back healthier or the chances are good but what's the timeline to get them in there so ideally you know to to get from from stability from a level of stability body control to strength now we're able to absorb and produce force and then when we talk about power we're talking about is rapid force production right so you know whatever this sport may be but but in this case when we're talking about basketball we got to get them first of all can they land well and then you know get them to go through the continuum to where they can jump and land explosively especially if someone's knocking into them on the way up or on the way down or if they have to be the one to react and get up there is quick as possible especially in a more defensive role so when we're talking about the the execution of speed agility and quickness which winds up being an important aspect of observing as a as a as a fitness professional or strength coaches you know how fast can they move but how well can they move fast winds of being the main themes of working with with courtsboards or any any sport for that matter when it comes to you know being on the court so when when you have to quickly accelerate decelerate stop you know your body is in one position with you know your feet are pointing one direction your torso is pointing another and your arms are doing something else are you passing or you receiving or you bouncing or you jumping you know your progressions have to have to make sense when it comes to to gradually and responsibly loading the body and the different needs that that athlete may need to move on the court so when we talk about the the program and you guys just so you know the programs that we're talking about is going to be a phase one stabilization endurance strength endurance for a phase two through the OBT model and then a phase five which is power now you guys will be able to download this so don't worry about if you're you know taking out a pen and paper and have to take notes just so you know that this the sample workouts that we're going to discuss are going to be available to you after this webinar so so when we talk about the execution of of a workout plan for stabilization first of all you're warm up in the best case scenario you are doing something that is assessment driven right and as you said Tony you know this is going to reflect how you're moving the things that you need to to address as an individual to move well and if you're in a team perspective and basketball volleyball those are team things teams sports where you're usually going to do some kind of team dynamic warm-up so so here as much as you can bleed in what you're going to do as a routine as a team routine as a team and you can you can kind of change it around or make make some kind of regressed variation of that so it's it feeds your purpose but it also helps you you know progress towards what you're going to do on a on every day basis with with the group but you know how you're going to address your your overactive your tighter areas that need the mobility where you have restriction and how are you going to up regulate and and activate those those latent muscles or the muscles that that aren't doing their job as far as joints stability goes so we're talking about rotator cuff hip cough foot n ankle stability you know getting those two to to fire up and be active while they while they're you know going to be integrated into the rest of the system for for your activity but one of the things when it comes to return to performance the speed agility and quickness and this is where I want your input Tony is that when we're talking about speed agility and quickness historically you know when it comes to working with you know athletic trainers or strength conditioning coaches getting somebody back into play a lot of times what all here is all right we're going to do this drill we're going to do a ladder drill right speed ladder drill and I want you to go at 40% right or I want you to go to 50% and that's how they'll grade the progression okay this week we're going to go 50% next week we're going to go 75% and then by the time it's time for you to get back into full practice and full play that's when we're going 95% right so with that I mean there are ways to build in stabilization versus all right you need a self monitor you need to somehow temper yourself so that you don't go so fast that you might get hurt but I do want you to get into the motion of running and slight change of direction and you know and a world will build up from there what's been your experience from a speed agility and quickness standpoint this is where this is the biggest gray error when it comes to return to performance has been speed agility and quickness when it comes to getting somebody what's been your experience going my experience in what regard can like if a basketball player let's say has to you know they're working on drills where it's maybe a lateral you know catching shoot lateral catching shoot they might say all right just go 50% kind of lock over there just with a with a jogging pace get over there you know and that's what I'll see from a strength conditioning standpoint as well or even if you have the athletic trainer trying to do some kind of variation of a rehabilitative speed drill or a change of direction drill what have you seen out there outside of because that was one of my first experience is when it came to the collegiate environment is 50% 60% 70 90 then now go full speed I mean they may be full of compensations but they're faster than the first day that they stepped onto the court and busted out the speed ladder sure sure yeah I think it goes back to what we discussed with with the symmetry index limb symmetry index and how you know symmetry while it's important isn't always sufficient and so you know if you give an athlete a benchmark of 50% they're likely going to try to push push that and you know that's all subjective and so it's hard to it's hard to determine what their actual 50% intensity is unless you have some pre pre injury benchmarks that you're trying to get back to it's really hard to objectively determine are they really going in 50% or are they going at 80% but but I think to your point you know while you do need those objective metrics to determine if you're progressing those can't be the only things that you're you're using to evaluate if somebody's ready to come back or not or to what level they're ready to come back because you know the going back to symmetry and apologize for taking a step back here but I think it is relevant that's assuming that the unindred side was functioning it's functioning at a high level too right so just because just because you have symmetry you can have two legs that are both not functioning optimally even though they could be symmetrical to each other so I think qualitatively looking at how the athlete is executing the drill not just the intensity with which they're performing it but how they're doing it is going to be extremely important and that's something that I would that I would tend to reiterate time and again with the the individuals that I work with is that you can't you can't just go off of the numbers you can't just go off of those those intensity benchmarks you have to look at the quality of what they're doing as well because as they get into reparturing and reprogramming and the reconditioning process you have to ensure that you know they're they're grooving optimal movement patterns which ultimately will translate to to improve deficiency and improve performance they don't always see that you know it's something I heard a long time ago and you know credit Alan Cosbro for this but you know he would always say you know more isn't better better is better and so we have to kind of keep that mantra in mind especially when you're dealing with someone who's eager to to get after it and demonstrate progress that they are improving great right um yeah no great great points now the one thing that that is built into the into the OPT model you know it's when it comes to reactive or a plyometric work is is that when we're in the phase one or the stabilization endurance phase where the primary goal is the adaptation is stabilization if we were just to do a regular plyometric it would be a matter of you know you do a squat jump to a hold where the emphasis is on landing mechanics right do they do they keep good posture or do they excessively forward lean do the knees come in do the feet turn out to the feet collapse to to an excessive amount all those things are normal but can they control the landing so so one of the things that you might have to add in there from from a speed agility and quickest standpoint is is building in that that concept of can you control the landing so so in an example of a speed ladder drill and for for higher level athletes is one of those things that they you kind of cringe at when you tell them you have to you know let's say it's a basic in and out so I'm zigzagging across um a lateral in and out so I'm zigzagging across a speed ladder so I might say go left left foot in right foot in and then as your left foot and your right foot step out of the ladder I need you to stop and hold right you can transition at a nice moderate speed but I need you to stop and hold check your posture take your hip position to hip me and toe and line everything's pointing straight ahead then you zigzagged the right step step stop and hold step step stop and hold and then the the next progression from there might be something along the lines of you're going to zigzag you would to feed in the ladder and then balance on the outside foot so now I can build in a little deceleration well isometric hold and stabilized and that'll give them out of the opportunity that's stopped for a second feel where you are you know evaluate what your what your hip situation is level or is it dropped right or are you hiking your shoulder you're not your shoulder square okay are you rotating down or are you flexed over right while you're standing on that outside of the same example you left leg where you until or at the end so then they would go through let's say maybe a half this wheel ladder that would time so go to scope in and out and then balance the other way in and out and balance that way I can control I mean can you can't say oh you you are going any percent of 50 percent can't call something out of something like that but what I can objectively look at is how are you accelerating how are you controlling your body when you're supposed to be still right so bad as you transition and I can tell what this is a bit too Mississippi pretty balanced and hold and that way we know that if you have nice upper and posture shoulders a little it's a little bit too long and you tell your alignment you know it can integrity from the start as you change direction or collapse you know hold your way to the next position right where this is done under control to where now if I can stop hold stabilizing now can you accelerate change direction with with kind of integrity so when it comes to the phase one speed agility and quickness is what we have to start to blend in it because this is what they're going to build up to right so if we can build it on it or stabilization temper to it all you know or we're going to get the player to you know to do a movement that looks feels smells like this part and that and another self can be great encouraging and the fact that it's like oh okay I am working my way back to to perform it so what it comes to you know flexibility core balance and reactive speed agility and quickness and then the resistance training part that has a cue is is one of those components of the work out that you know you're going to spend more time coaching up put them in real life as an area so if you can like holding the volleyball holding the basketball adding some transition look at as you're doing these drills however you know this is where you know we set it in one of our other webinars you know your ability to create a good program is only limited by your level of creativity right playing it looks mark people out there a lot of content out there but covering and a print together that's going to be encouraging to that athlete as far as you know their level of confidence and get back to collect yeah no absolutely I think you know that's something that's lost oftentimes especially as a release of the OBT model and the experience that experiences that I've had and that some colleagues of mine have had and I know you've had them as well in dealing with with different organizations and teams in the process is that you know stabilization as an adaptation is more than just doing a couple different exercises that involve standing on one leg as part of a program if you're training for stabilization every component in the program is got to have elements and follow some guidelines and variables that would elicit that adaptation and I think that's why we see the the tremendous results that we do is because we're we're looking at the entire program you know the program is more than the the individual components you know and so the the sum is greater than than the individual parts right and so I think that's where the concept of stability is is lost and so you know it's a critical piece to the puzzle when you're trying to get an individual back but you bring up a great point you know from a programming standpoint you can have the the physical authenticity you can have the biological authenticity so when you look at the the mechanical specificity of things the metabolic specificity but that behavioral component that that can encourage the athlete um encourage the athletes by and where you incorporate patterns, movements, drills, props and equipment that helps to mimic what they're what they're trying to get back to is is hugely important and that that creative element is is is a massive piece to getting the athlete keeping the athlete engaged and and enthusiastic about the process and limit limit to them getting discouraged along the way. Right and you know as a performance coach too I love tossing the ball right you know there's a lot of other things I'd rather do to you know it's like all right here you go if I you all right you okay right but if someone's doing let's say that that speed level maybe even a four-condril where they're going forward lateral backward and then lateral the other way nothing's stopping you from let's say you know tossing them a volleyball and while they're they're stopped or balanced on one leg have them bump the the ball back at you right and so you know it's challenging it's fun and then that's easily progressed for I'm going to give them these meatballs where it's going to be right in front of them you know I'm not going to have too much going on in the beginning but then I could I could serve it a little bit to the right I could serve it a little bit to the left and as they of course they have to earn it and that's that's the big thing is is looking for these opportunities anywhere during the workout and the conditioning plant and opportunity to say a adaboy at a girl good job nice work I see a work in hard you know what you're doing on on your offdays for me it's really showing up here any opportunity you can you can you can grab onto it and celebrate those successes of pat on the back good work keep it up and it also like you know what we're talking about here just you know something that they can look forward to but if it can look and smell and feel like they're sport volleyball basketball you know that's going to be encouraging because I mean you you it's you know we have to humanize the process and what we talked about earlier is that they're they're not there I'm a rider's not there you know they're not their last appointment they're not their injury you know and there's the big reason why people play things is just for that it's because they play right play is fun if and if you have the opportunity to play well high level high level competition you know it's our responsibility to you know as as movement fitness and and strength professionals to get them there the safest we can't but make it as fun as possible all right so moving on so I think we have yeah I think we've got some programs up right yep so what we've done for you all is we've created some example programs phase one phase two phase five and then mobility dynamic conditioning type program that can be done on off days or prior to additional training sessions or practices if you will and so what we'll do is we'll just kind of go through these each of these example programs as Ken mentioned they'll be available for you to download after this after this episode so no need to try and scrub all stuff down or take a bunch of screenshots we got you covered there and so as we go through each of these we'll just kind of explain in the rationale and the the reason behind each of the exercise options understand you know just like the OBT model is a framework there's a lot of variability involved in these and so you know this is just one example of a way that you could incorporate this type of programming and and so don't don't look at this is you know you're limited to to what we're providing here but hopefully the rationale is we provide give you some insight into why why we put these together the way we did but then also gives you an opportunity to leverage that same reasoning when you put your programs together and and you decide on specific exercise techniques or drills so with that I think Greg's got the first one up Ken do you want to you want to start talking through our phase one program? Yep let's talk about phase one or what we might call stabilization endurance for those that of you that are familiar with the optimum performance training model so you'll see here that you know in the warm up we have self-mile facial technique however you want to address it whether using a static formula or something long lines of music vibration and percussion like with the hyper ice vapor or the hyper vault you know again we we put on here just the TFL ad dr magnus lateral calf and lats and generally when when it comes to putting programs together especially when it comes to enhancing mobility first the four activity let me just from an approach standpoint I'll do something that addresses the lower leg the hip and the shoulder right and then depending on time I might add on to that depending on what the athletes needs are so again as a general warm up this is something that I might do but again any kind of assessment based program formability is going to supersede anything that I might do from a general standpoint. The the form of flexibility here is static because if you're working with you know pain discomfort that we're really addressing pain but someone's going back from a from a layoff they're coming back from injury they've had some time off and you know pain might be an issue but from from a from a scope of practice standpoint we're not here to address the pain or work on pain but what we can do again assuming that there is there is approval the the physician the physical therapist the athletic trainer are involved in the process it just gives you an idea where not to go so if it's it might seem aggravating or if they say they're an acronic to out of ten on a pain scale then you know if it becomes a two and a half or a three now you know that there's any adjustments to be made in their programming that's where you're going to back off and again respect what the body's telling you so back to the point static stretch we're trying to improve range emotion especially if they've been casted or if they've been in a sling or if they've been immobile for a while what we're really trying to do is just improve flexibility for the purposes of increasing or improving range emotion where it's been assessed to be damped deficient and then the next thing to do is get into activation so here we're trying to up regulate those muscles that have not been doing what they're supposed to be doing if you will so especially when it comes to the assessment process if I notice something like an excessive forward lean or a low excessive low back arch arms following forward this is where I want to address those muscles to to get them to do what they're supposed to do from a stabilization standpoint so it's in this case we've addressed the lats let's say for the sake of example arms are falling forward lats maybe pack back minor might be doing their thing to pull the arms down but what are we doing to strengthen muscles that are responsible for keeping things shoulder integrity so I can have that arm go up into that overhead position which is very important now if you're talking about a basketball player needs to go overhead or volleyball player that needs to serve or spike or block where their arms are definitely up in that position so the idea now outside of exercise selection is to manage the the acute variable so that we are focusing on stability and we're trying to reinstall if it's ever been there before you know the idea of you know can we control the bite can we can we increase or improve postural endurance and neuromuscular control from that standpoint so activation when it comes to core balance you know this is where that comes into play and you know athletes come from different backgrounds when it comes to what they consider for work so in this phase this is where we need to get them to hold still and work on those intrinsic stabilizers and give them the integrity that they may or may not have had before so when we talk about everything leading up to now flexibility range motion and now core and balance we're just trying to make sure that they can control their bite and something I've said before in another webinar is that if we can't control your body how can you expect to control your opponent right so that I attribute to coach David Zimbabwe what I mean is just encoders that work with a cow who taught me that early on and that's and that's that's been one of the drivers and how I explained that to a math and we talk about explaining the program to an athlete I tell them you you can't control your body how can you expect to control the guy on the other side of the ball right so about any thoughts on that so far Tony with with what we've done through the phase one program so far no no looks great you know on the balance piece I like the inclusion of the the the implement whether it's a basketball or volleyball you know I think two with some of those drills from a balance perspective reaching in different directions you know we have a lateral reach here but you could also incorporate overhead reach you know getting them to to put the the extremities into positions that they're going to encounter on the court so again going overhead using the arms as a drivers in different directions and then you can see where they're where they're most challenged and and that can give you insights into what you might need to continue to focus on with with their programming so you know again we have a lateral reach but you know play around with the different directions the different amplitudes of movement how far how high how why they're reaching to see where they they have the most challenge so you can continue to build on that over time right right and again when just like core balance is one of those things doing things on one leg that's typically a lot of times not seen unless someone's in a rehabilitative situation so balance I mean there's been plenty of times where I've worked with an athlete and their their injured side and we talked about this before and then their injured side a lot of times looks better than the un-injured side close rehab because it's the injured side that's gotten a lot of the love and attention and focus when it comes to the rehabilitative process and it's the un-injured side the side that hasn't been heard is the one that's been the most compromised so it's it's an opportunity to not just close the gap between the the injured and the non-induced but overall just elevate the performance on both sides right so skill development we talked about this already with with SACU adding the pauses giving them a moment to to look at their body check out their alignment make corrections when when it's necessary but also like when we showed here with the single leg balance in the and the lateral reach with the ball with the basketball or volleyball on hand this is an opportunity again they're they're starting to move in motions or or using drills that they might have used with the team but now it's an opportunity for us to get be creative have a little fun integrate a little bit of the sport in there as they're as they're working their way back and then once we've gotten things the nervous system cooked up a little bit now we can get into the resistance training so and this is the one that this is the one part of the workout where I tend to get most resistance when it comes to working with athletes and and coming back because one you know you have a lot of reps it's not the six reps eight reps that they're used to doing in a weight room now we're talking about 12 15 20 repetitions you know slow low intensity you know they're holding the purple dumbbells the light green baby blue dumbbells you know things that barely fit in there you know it fits in the palm of their hands sometimes and they're like what do you want me to do with this man but but again this is the one where the conversation definitely needs to happen on why they're doing it good but I'll tell you what there's been more than enough times where you take somebody day through let's say a floor or a ball or a ball cobra or a shoulder combo and they're feeling muscles that they've never felt before right so so when it comes to resistance training things like you know we're grass movements that encourage posture and awareness proprioception ball wall squat again if someone needs to work on their their their partial integrity that's going to be a big one push up with rotation especially when you do that slow that I can be a burner not just for the shoulders but also for their trunk and their spine especially when if you're Q&A okay tuck that button under let's get trained maintain more of a neutral hip or get to hip hop or move the hip forward get your head back chin in and again getting back into Q&A you don't want to put them into position where now I'm harping on you on eight different things but if I can right size the exercise for you there should be no more than two things that may need correction when it comes to the kinetic chain checkpoints that we're we are trying to to keep an alignment depending on the exercise but a lot of a lot of players you know if they haven't done stabilization before oftentimes their eyes are open when it comes to how how intense a two pound dumbbell or no weights can be especially when it comes to you know the slow high rep intensities that we're looking at in this phase of training what do you think Tony? Oh absolutely and you know oftentimes it's it's a great opportunity and the athlete once they experience it they they start to understand they get it like okay they start to think why can't I do this this looks like a piece of cake but as they start getting into the meat of the of the workout they start experiencing what it's like to move at those lower tempos maintaining proper alignment for those higher rep ranges they start to realize okay well these are areas that I I should I should be able to do this white can't I so let's let's take the time to get better and work on this so often you know with many of the athletes that are driven and thrive on that competitive element they take it as a challenge and and want to get better as a result of that when they aren't able to perform to the level that they think they should and so yeah well you may you may encounter some resistance at first over time I think the athlete starts to realize how important it is and how impactful it can be on their performance in all aspects of what they're doing and it's an opportunity again if you're if you're doing this correctly and you're able to implement stabilization training as we're laying it out you're enhancing that neuromus who are control you're enhancing that athlete's efficiency you basically just take in the you know taking the parking break off through them you're allowing their body to perform to the level that it's capable of by showing up some of these areas in which they're deficient and it's only going to set you up for greater success when we get into our face our strength and power base program so yeah it sucks it's it's not fun for them but they do start to you know appreciate it once they experience the benefit to that right so the exercise selection that we've got here just to kind of run through the the the exercises and you know quick bullet points on each is that you know the ball wall squat again emphasis is on keeping a tall spine posture while they're learning to you know ankle dorsi flex hit flex with good integrity and again up to you if you want to throw a dumbbell in there or maybe even do something like a curl and press as they're doing the ball wall squat push up rotation again having the the body rotate as a whole the spine rotate as a whole while kind of you know they're thinking of it as a shoulder and upper body strengthening exercise I look at this as a core and shoulder stability level exercise which again if you're whether you're playing volleyball right overhead shooting you got a guard you got to reach with the basketball and volleyball as well having you know having good extensibility through the the anterior shoulder complex can be huge lunges and multiple multi-planar standpoint again nothing happens just in front of you got to go to the ball you got to back up go forward move lateral get out of some's way or get in someone's way so you have to be able to get the hit to move in different directions and you know the multi-planar lunges is awesome for that I mean we could have even picked a step up a multi-planar step up you know to to to be a part of this program and then the ball dumbbell row and this is you know I love using the ball in a prone position because now you're engaging the whole post to your chain if you're if you're a volleyball player especially you know if you're waiting for that serve your flex you're in that ready position and you're always hunched over right basketball is the same thing if you're the guy with the ball you're the one you're flexed over you're dressing the ball you're pushing somebody or someone's pushing into you and you're in that and you're in that triple threat position so from that vantage point you know you're always flexed you're always forward so we're gonna do what we can to get somebody to engage as much of that post of your chain as possible right and then with a single leg dumbbell curl and overhead press any opportunity I can find a put a player on a single leg I'm gonna do it so because a lot of times they're gonna jump off of one leg and they're gonna land on one leg or they're gonna stop cut on on one leg too so any opportunity I can to to sneak in a little bit of single leg work that's what I'm gonna do now again going back into why we might do a stabilization exercise the other importance here is that this might be to go to on an off day so maybe something that they do after they play a game right just because if they've traveled they're fatigue they're tired they got a lot of playing time where they're getting back into this might be how I de-load or unload somebody off of off of you know a heck they travel schedule or competition schedule so anything to add to that Tony first all right so once somebody does I mean an ideal situation that can be compressed or that can be expanded based on how the athletes performing but then the next thing is strength endurance which is one of my favorite phases because it's the it's the phase where now they start to to get some you know they see the light at the end of the tunnel they they can see that okay things are starting to get juicy I am starting to do movements that I'm more familiar with I'm starting to do more more exercises that the team is doing and this is where again if you're not the strength coach and some some other coaches responsible for the team you want to find out what it is that they're doing because you can easily lend that into this phase of training now as we I'll kind of run through the the warm up and the activation part but here we're picking up the tempo still we want to use some kind of self-mono-passual technique just for the for the sake of variety quad I'd like to complex calf complex packs instead of lots little variation I mean that that can change on the date on the daily activations going to pick up a little bit more where we go from a static stretch to more of an active stretch or moving in a controlled motion into and out of the stretch position and then the activation again is going to be more a little bit faster so with control we're going to with a moderate tempo we're going to move into and out of position so as we're into this phase two strength endurance template that you guys will be able to download now moderate speed for repetitions so we have the ball bridge again blue activation we're getting off of the floor something less you know static as as a before we added it as the sciat flying straight leg raise um to activate the glutes now we're getting the hips to move with with a little bit more tempo not too much but um lateral box step up to balance catch and throw so we're now incorporating more of a more progressive balance movement so now adding catching and throwing so now they have to absorb and then produce force as they catch the ball and then throw the ball and quadriped reach and pull here this is not anything you're going to really find in our textbooks today as of now but reach and pull is just more of a you know reach under and reach up as we're rotating through the trunk and the spine and in this case you're on a quadriped position so it's a nice variation then you know your arm opposite leg reaches or your bur doggs as it might be called but adding more of a little rotational component to it and then as we as we move into now that we've got things fired up turned on you're moving while you have more range motion you have better control posture on endurance is there because you just finished phase one skill development so now we give more progressive with our speed agility and quickness of routines so repeat lateral squat jump so instead of just doing like say a lateral squat jump with a two to three second hold now we are incorporating a little bit of rhythm we're moving from one jump straight into the next with control again it's not as fast as possible but what we are looking for is good mechanics good extension can you move rhythmically with you know the integrity that we're looking for you to land and jump with now here we have a lateral shuffle with a single leg pause so again we mentioned you can pause and balance on the outside leg so there's still a little bit more of this now for looking at say maybe a set of cones that are three three yards five yards apart I can add some speed and have that stop balance and hold add some speed stop and then you know we can shorten that time of transition as long as they have good integrity when they're from cone to cone and then if you're on a on a traditional basketball court half court ladder so now we can start to add some conditioning on here formally inside the workout so that can be from baseline the free throw baseline to three point line back to baseline to have court and those could be managed right you know a player that's just starting up with me conditioning wise I might just go baseline to free throw baseline to the the top of the key and that might be the level of their of their shuttle run if you will but as I get more condition I can definitely have more reps I can I can have them go half court and you get from working on endurance now I can start maybe even using the whole court right so but if the goal let's just say it's more change of direction I can add in shorter incremental stop and goes in there but if it's more conditioning I can lengthen the amount of distance they're going to run between transitions so when we when it comes to the strength conditioning plan not only are we looking at mechanics do they have good body control but we also have to look at okay how are we preparing this this athlete for their conditioning right because if they start to get tired they're breathing heavy they're getting fatigued right it doesn't matter how much endurance and stability they have they're tired they're fatigued they're mentally they're not going to be there they're not going to be able to focus so it's also our job to get them into cardiovascular conditioning shape so anything to add onto those first three components Tony of of a phase two nope can you do a great man I love it I would say you know with some of these exercises and I know this has been highlighted before you were providing you with some recommended sets and reps the intensity level should be dementia with your with your athletes abilities so you know looking at let's say the ball bridge that doesn't always mean a body weight ball bridge so provided that the athlete is able to maintain proper alignment they're able to execute them the movement through the desired range of motion without compensation that is an exercise that you can load externally with a dumbbell or a barbell or whatever implement you you want to use sandbag so you know just make sure that the intensity level is appropriate for the phase in this case if you're doing a ball bridge with that's body weight and you have 10 reps programs the athlete might be able to do 25 reps body weight no problem so just utilize utilize your best judgment but it is it is appropriate to to externally load and in some of these activation exercises based on the the rep range is that that we're working with here some some exercises certainly you're not going to be using much load if any but others you certainly can so I just want to highlight that because sometimes we we get that question with regard to some of our programming at NSM and you know just because it's an activation exercise doesn't mean you can't load it right yeah great point all right so as we get into resistors training this has been historically for for the athletes that I've worked with you know a great background right because now you're giving me what I want and I'm giving you a you want when it comes to resistance training so it's a place it's our calming ground where we can meet on on what you like out of work out and what I love giving or what giving you what you need out of a workout so here we have the superset format as it's delivered so you're going to take a you know like motion or a similar motion and you're going to compound a strength exercise a traditional strength exercise like a bench crash or a front squat or a or a seated you know lat lat pull down and then you're going to combine it with a stabilization exercise so both exercises are going to reflect the tempos and the speeds and the key variables relative to that goal and purpose so if it's a strength exercise so in this case we've got a single arm dumbbell press right so here I want to go moderate speed good control no pauses it's just down and I put the dumbbell and I am covering a little bit more core in that and that approach when it comes to this exercise but then I'm going to immediately follow it up with a ball pushup so in this example I know it wasn't explained that's specifically but the intention is to put the hands on the ball so free feet arm brace against anything but I do want the hands on the ball and you are going to move as slow as you did in phase one with emphasis on the eccentric so as my chest is lowering down to the ball and lowering my body down to the ball that's what I'm going to spend a little bit time I'm going to float there for a couple seconds I'm going to have a strong pushup especially with you know with athletes that have done the traditional barbell and dumbbell work following it up immediately with a slow stabilization based exercise a lot of times it's something that they've never done so don't be surprised if whatever dumbbell weight you are using or whatever the intensity was for the first exercise when you go back for the second or maybe even the third set don't be surprised that you have to take down some weight so decrease the intensity because we're asking a certain level of intensity with integrity for the duration of that routine so here I know we didn't put any rest in there but at the beginning of a workout program so I can cue them up, coach them up it between sets I'm going to do more of what we call a horizontal format and resistance training so in this exercise selection you know single arm dumbbell press immediately followed by a ball pushup I might give them there 60 to 90 seconds in between so that I can coach them up let them know where I'm looking for them to improve it gives me a chance to adjust any weights we need to so if they're doing a 45 pound dumbbell for single arm dumbbell press but they're pushups really took it out of then I might say hey let's go to a 35 or let's go to a 25 and really focus on you you know maintaining core stabilization you know good integrity through the trunk as you press that dumbbell because there's been plenty of times somebody's done a bench press starts off with what they usually do or I think they can do 315 let's say let's back it off for a second let's go to 85 and bring in somebody down to 135 pounds is not uncommon because there's a certain level of endurance that comes with this phase of training especially if if you haven't been has not been a routine that you've done before or in the sequence that you you've got it laid out so I hope that makes sense but this is this is again a great transitional phase from stabilization industry because you're still you're combining both component adaptations if you will for that for that athlete anything add onto that tonniness for us the overall vantage point of the phase two resistance training. No I agree it's a bridge you know it is one of the more if not the most challenging phase of the OBT model but you know one that offers tremendous benefits from not only a strength standpoint but enhancing that stabilization and endurance. Right and overall I mean just to kind of get through this and so we can talk about phase five a little bit just know that you know when we're talking about especially basketball and volleyball if you can incorporate you know overhead positions so we have a lot pulled down and you know not every facility has a lot pulled down but it's a way to get them to move in that overhead position whether you're pulling or pressing but any opportunity again you can find to get them and moving into multiple directions whether if you have a cable set up and you're pulling from a cross-sabody or way from the body laterally not just what traditional specialized equipment will do for you just put everything in front of you but if I can even just turn the body a little bit get a different angle at which they're producing or reducing forces is one of the one of the things that we often times forget there's programs I've seen you know from other strength coaches and everything is this sagittal plane dominant but if we're truly trying to give the athlete the integrity they need we need to get them in the body positions in this case overhead but also rotations as they need to do a chest pass you know they they have to be able to turn and and be strong and confident when they when they do go into the different positions and I know we didn't say it on the last phase one workout but the cool down is going to follow the same format to where you can you can foam roll stretch percussion vibration and then follow with the with the static stretch okay and again and if they at this point time they still are incorporating some kind of self-care programs this might be an opportunity to do that but be ready if you're if you're athletes like I'm not really feeling right now because I just you know put 45 minutes on the court and doing another 12 15 minute routine if it doesn't drive with them you know they can do it later they can do it the next day but as long as we unload the body right and give them an opportunity to recover well with with ideal body posture and position the cooldown is is basically just as important as the warm-up when it comes to somebody returning to play anything else on phase two Tony that I'm missing? no let's get into to phase five yeah phase five power this is where things get really fun and interesting and because things are moving fast right and hopefully they burn the right to move fast and when it comes to the speed agility and quickness that we've done through phase one and phase two here you know this is where it's going to be a really big part of the workout because you know they're throwing med balls they're they're jumping they're landing and you know this can be one of a hair year parts as far as transitioning programs go but for the most for the most part you know we're moving fast they burn their right it wouldn't put them in phase five unless they they've shown that they can do it safely and effectively so when it comes to the warm-up this is where you can get into more of the dynamic we're not trying to improve flexibility range of motion but if that is still part of your objective then they would do it individual individualized assessment base warm-up before they get into the dynamic so they needed to do their more static range of motion work active and then into the dynamic whereas as long as dynamic as where they end off before they get into the routine lesson you want to do is see a static stretch and then get them to run and jump and throw things right so they can still do their individual work and then get into the dynamics so here as an example this is this is what we would call a normal walking warm-up so they might be blown from from from baseline towards mid-court for their for their warm-up routine so as we would call it a walking warm-up so they do different patterns as they as they do their warm-up so ankle grabs knee hugs you know basic hip mobility work double touches touching the ground reaching up to the sky so and this comes in and a million different forms when it comes to a teamwork out activation here you know depending on how you've built out your workout routine you may or may not need to put med ball work in or jump work in here because it may already be baked into what you're going to do for the strength routine but the idea is that we're trying to elevate the the activation of the nervous system right so as someone's doing in this case as we've got it exemplified in this routine med ball crunch and throw they could do that off the ground they can do that on a physio ball but now we're activating the core quickly right we're getting the nervous system to fire quickly um lateral jumps with stabilization so this is a part of a balanced progression so now we go from landing mechanics in phase one to repeat jumps and now we're working on single leg landing mechanics um why sorry when it comes to balance in stabilization we're a little to no movement in the in the stance leg and then and then movement flexion extension squatting um deadlift hip-hinging in strength and now we are working on landing mechanics on the on the power phase of balance which again something that I don't see a whole lot in in in resistance training programs for for for for for for a lot of sports but it's something that you know will will will will will be a difference as far as your ability to activate the hip and the same side leg and we got here a little bit of bear crawling and that's just to get a little rotation med ball clean get somebody up regulated a little bit but get that that counter rotation between the shoulders and the hips that's where you'll see a lot of bear crawls of bear call variations throughout a four week program especially in power skill development and plan metrics and speed agility and quickness this is where again we're we're not a handcuff in you as much as we did in the first one but what we are looking to do is just to get you moving quickly basically you're free to go right as far as when you're working out with a team now we can go we can go into then 90% to 100% intensity range you know still important to get in multi-planar movements lateral adding compound compound motions now we can do say lateral to vertical jumps so this could be a lateral shuffle with a vertical jump at the cones so if we have a three or five foot separation between cone we could shuffle jump land lateral shuffle jump land as an example cone touches and then we have a half-core of our ladders and shuffle so this now we can go without adding any pauses without adding any kind of single leg balance and reaches now we can just do a quick rapid response in transition from one landmark to the other and then as we get into the resisted train this this workout does not last long at all right as you get into this other phase where we do incorporate a superset if you will but now instead of what we did in phase two where it was strength followed by stabilization here it's strength high level high intensity level strength what we're doing now one to five reps immediately followed by an explosive movement so in the example here we have a dumbbell press so it's two arms when there is no core focus anymore it's just about how much weight can you push how intense how heavy can you go while still maintaining structural integrity and then immediately following it up with an explosive movement in this case it's a medicine ball rotation chest pass right both pushing motions one's going to be a slightly different direction but I'm going to go heavy and then for the sake of having that post action potentialation now I'm going to use a nervous system and get it to learn how to move get it to learn how to move quickly and as fast as possible so and that's that's what makes this workout intense at the level of intensity that it is because now we're strength followed by power and if there's anything a coach needs to do here is watch for posture and compensation and because speed is the name of the game as soon as my client starts to slow down we're done because how you did the last rep is what the brain remembers so as soon as they start to compensate as soon as they start to slow down they're done we're going to take a break and then we're going to go into the next exercise so resistance training here has a different meaning from the previous two examples that we've given you what do you think Tony? Sorry gang I've got my dog barking at a car in the background so I had mute on I appreciate you being yeah no it's fantastic I agree and there's Zoe again I apologize everyone one of the things too you know we've got the med ball rotation chest pass you can you can incorporate different elements into these power exercises as well if if you feel it's appropriate you know even as a lower sometimes what we'll do with with our athletes is you know have them perform the chest pass on a single leg if you want to incorporate a balance element there and then progress them to a more dynamic power exercise so a lot a lot of two here but this is a great a great phase of training and I think one that that most all clients and athletes love to be in because you know they're in their element and they get to get to get after a little bit so love it um that's all I got yeah I'll take it I know it's it's uh we're getting a little deep into the uh the clock here on this on this program but hopefully our review of a phase one phase two in a phase five gives you an idea of of how we would progress an athlete returning to performance just from the sampling that again it's it's not a traditional workout plan that you might see somebody do on their own whereas traditionally you might see okay go 50% 75% and then go 100% when it comes the intensity in the speed but the the idea here is that it's baked in those pauses and those stops those yellow lights are built into the program from stabilization to strength and to power but of course if you're in power if you've earned your way to that last phase of training um definitely it's green lights go I mean little to no restrictions but you you know you're always gonna have especially some of that's returning back to performance um they may need to have that individual individualize need to address whatever it is that they're coming back from to you know to incorporate you know that strength that power and again consider the whole person when it comes to what their demands are so I mean one thing we haven't talked about Tony is like position players so if you're if you're involved you're if you're in front if you're right next to net and you're in your you're blocking that your primary goal versus someone who's like a liberal and they're they're in the back court or somebody who's a point guard or shooting guard versus the center we have respect the demands of the different positions regarding those two sports so and that you know now you can get deeper into the leads when it comes to okay how am I going to return this player to sport based on what their coach is expecting. Again that goes back to earlier in this webinar we talked about talking to the coaches talking to sports medicine staff on how we can get this person ready for how they're gonna be used on the court and then the last workout routine that that you'll be able to download from us is what we call the self care dynamic warm-up. That was the title list Tony we changed it on. Yeah okay self mobility and dynamic conditioning routine just something that could be done as more of a d-load or unloading type session where you know you're working on improving or maintaining mobility throughout the week you're incorporating some some mouth-hassual techniques some static stretching in the areas that that need it followed by some activation and then you can incorporate kind of a graduated level of activity but not so intense that that would be viewed as a as a high intensity workout in and of itself so you know basically it's something that you could give the athlete or give your client to do on on those off days that kind of take some through that corrective process and hit it length and activate and then integration so there is there are some dynamic elements but it's not not full intensity or something that's meant to be viewed as a workout a traditional workout it's just something that they can do to unload and maintain some of the qualities and elements that you're working on throughout the week help get them prepared for subsequent sessions. Right and that example can take place in many forms so it could be a travel day where they get off of the plane they want to get a light exercise routine in there when they're at the hotel or if they're at the you know whatever the other arena is that they may be playing at so it has multiple roles and purposes so if like they're traveling and I'm not with them here's something that I know it's not it's not equipment intensive body weight stuff but overall just get you a chance to get the blood flowing especially when you're trying to counter things like jet lag and you just want a better night's sleep yeah so that's that's something that depending on the needs of your athlete can be implemented in different ways so I thought you know overall and looking at those four workout routine examples you know I think that's a pretty comprehensive you know line up when it comes to things that you can do or should be doing when you think about the progressions of your athlete from beginning to end when it comes to post rehab to performance and it was one more thing to add there on each of those phases because I can't remember if we've if we highlighted it or not talked about so many things but generally you know each each phase if you're following more galineiro approach is you know going to be roughly four four to six weeks you know obviously you have to look at the timelines within which you have to work but for optimal adaptations it's kind of what we're looking for and then as your athlete progresses and gets further along you can get into more of a hybrid type programming or angelating type programming where you incorporate all all three phases within a cycle within a micro cycle or weekly cycle in order to continue to see micro adaptations and micro progressions in each of those specific domains and and so again when you look at a plan an annual plan followed by a monthly plan followed by a weekly plan you know ultimately often decide how long you spend in each phase you know you may not have the the luxury of four to six weeks maybe much less but optimally that's kind of what we're looking at and and then with phase five sorry can I did we highlight that it's I know it's a super set but that the the exercises or biomechanically similar to to each other did you talk about that yeah I don't want it in bargain your dog was a part okay all right all right well with that Greg did we do we get any questions or or feedback from the listeners and attendees that we need to address no questions that you need to address but there were a lot of people that wanted to thank you guys for the the great info and the thoroughness of it all so thank you yeah Ken and I were all about the long form webinar series with all right so on that note let's say we will be back in two weeks and we are going to do a return to performance with field sports so this is for for soccer lacrosse feel hockey if you're on if you're on grass or turf this is going to be the the webinar for you so as always we appreciate you guys watching and if you're still watching thank you thank you thank you so much for hanging in there with us but Tony any closing statements or words no echo your sentiment thanks so much everyone for tuning in love the support and if you have any questions don't hesitate to to leave them in the comment section below also the the programs that we review will be made available to you for download and Ken and I both have our contact info on those templates if you need to reach out to us in any way our email addresses on there as well as our our Instagram handles so don't hesitate to to be in touch and until next time everyone has a great rest of the week and we'll see you soon all right take care everyone
