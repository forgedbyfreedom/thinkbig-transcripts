Alright, I'm Kim Miller with the National Calculus Sports Management Association and I'm here with Carolina Ray. I'm here with Cray Performance and we are at the training station in Alamina, California. In this video we're going to show you a movement prep, more for that intermediate level run. So when I say intermediate level, if you follow the NSM, OPT model, this is a runner or a lower leg bias movement preparation for somebody that has gone through stabilization and somewhere in these strength training adaptation of conditions. So here we've got somebody who's worked on stabilization, they've got a good body control and now we're ready to cooperate higher volume or higher intensity of conditions. So, but Carolina is going to start off with a little self-mile fashion technique and she's going to use the hyperized hypersphere to focus on the outer cap. Now when it comes to a lot of people, when we're looking at the assessment process and looking or muscle and balances, a lot of times it would be turned out and the knees come in, we can pretty much pick on the outer cap as far as the area over a part of the cap that will probably appreciate more attention relief. So here she's on the cap between the knee and the ankle and she's externally rotated the hip a little bit. That way she can put the hypersphere more under that lateral compartment. So we're getting more of the lateral gastroxolious complex. On this spot she's going to hold that for about 30 seconds. It went until she feels about 30 to 60. I'm sorry, 50 to 60 percent of the decrease in tension for 30 seconds. So once you get to that point where it's relaxed, she feels a significant decrease in tension. Then we can add a little bit of mobility. So here she can flex and tow up and point it down in a way. She can add some ankle circles, clockwise and counterclockwise. That actually helps move some of that connective tension and the muscles on top of the hypersphere. So once the self-mon�ational technique is done she's got some relief. Then it's time for a static or an active stretch. So in stabilization we can work on an active, a static stretch but here we're going to again more of an active component. That means that she's going to get into the same stretch position she's going to do a static stretch in stabilization training. But now she's going to go into and out of that stretch position. So here I'm going to have her just go and turn that field towards me a little bit. All right, perfect. I'm elevating her for foot using this hypersphere sandbag. Elevating her for foot that way we can listen a little bit more ankle dorsiflexion. She's going to come in, hold the stretch for a couple seconds and then come out with a little tension and a loop. Again, she's going to promote a little bit of rotation in the hip by just saying towards the outer part of the calf to a little bit that stretch. So even though this is the stretch I'm still looking at and concerned about kinetic change, I check points a lot of people that they have muscle and balances in other places. The area of stretch tends to get all the attention, but I still want to make sure that the low back. So it has good integrity, gears and shoulders, you have good integrity. So here's shoulders, hip to knees and ankles. All line throughout this calf stretch, as that view. Perfect. So here she's gotten about eight to ten reps. I'd replicate that on the other side. And now it's time to get some activation. So we're going to use this Viper Pro for a little bit of support to easily be against a railing or a wall for a little bounce apart from here. It's going to get a little bit of hip internal rotation and she's going to do a standing calf right. So the thing about this is that we want her to go straight up. Okay, a lot of people have a tendency to lean forward as they get their heels up. And the other thing is, as she gets his heel raised, you'll notice the control up and control down. She's got the whole forefoot on the ground. Some people will tend to kind of roll out onto outside of the foot. So I just want to make sure that the big toe has as much pressure as the pinky toe. All right, so let's get a couple more. So here, more you feel in this. Okay, so now she's activating more of that medial side of the calf. So if we relax this, now we want to activate or put more activity into the medial side of the inside calf. And here we get about 10 repetitions as well. Nice control. Awesome. And now we're going to put it all together with moving, called the pivot lunge. Okay, and with that pivot lunge. She's going to go ahead and she's going to lunge forward and with the animal rotation here. So I actually want us to rotate over that lead leg. And as a pivot lunge, those one foot's going to be on the ground. And she's going to have the other foot, step forward, get a rotation, and then she's going to step back. Get a rotation back here. Perfect. We get one more. And awesome. Great job. Take that. Nice. Now for her plyometric, we're going to do a repeat squat. Repeat split squat jump. Okay, but she's going to do this in an alternating manner. So she's going to start off with a split squat position. And in the air she's going to switch leg and then repeat jumping from that. So it's going to get 10 jumps. Okay, so from here, she's going to jump straight up and down. Good. Nice job. So I'm watching. Good lean. Good integrity. Hit me in the toe or in the line in the front. Perfect. Good job. All right, so that's what the technique is. It's a hit. All right, so we get about eight to ten as long as you can do it with good alignment. She's not buckling in. She's not getting excessive forward link. She's got great body control. She's still fast. She's still sharp from beginning to end. And if she starts to collapse, starts to lose posture, then we're done. Okay, then we have to make our modification for the next set. If there is an example. So with this routine, as a movement prep again, this is movement prep. This is just getting you ready for your workout warfare. About to run outside. This is a warm up that you can do to get you ready for however long you're going to run. So try this out. The core breathing to your plan. We know you'll feel better after you do it. So let us know how you like it. Thanks again for watching. Take care and be safe.
