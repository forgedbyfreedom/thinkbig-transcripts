You you you you you you welcome to the nsm cpt podcast and our facebook live webcast i want to say thank you for attending and also to let you know that we do this every week twice a week with Mondays and Fridays at 12 noon eastern time so if you'd like to continue to do this and you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you and you you and you you you and you you you you and you you you you and you and and he also has been a subject matter expert for nsm and developed chapters in our corrective sorry in our certified nutrition specialist course and I believe it was on protein so I want to before I continue I just want to shout out to Jordan turn it over to him have him introduce a little bit about himself what he's done what you've contributed to nsm and then we'll get right into the topic of supplements and keto thanks for having me yeah I've been working on supplement research protein research diet everything the science of body building since I was a bachelor student at university Tampa through my master's through my PhD working in supplement industry started 2014's my first year so I've been doing that for a while too I did my dissertation on ketogenic diet and how to adapt that diet for athletic performance so I know a lot there and for nsm I contributed to the CPT text the most recent one not sure if it's out yet it might be able to give some insight there and then the the FNS I believe the nutrition textbook oh man, excellent look thank you so much for for your contributions to the stuff that we do in nsm and in recent conversations that I've had on the podcast supplements come up but usually it will be somebody like a registered dietitian and and their focus that have been on here hasn't necessarily been about performance or they may focus on weight loss but they don't have any focus on supplementation and weight loss so if I ask a question about it they're good and listen hey pump the brakes and do time out to me at any point where you're like hey that's that's something my core competency or my area focus but that's what I want to get into right now and if you don't mind let's just go through if we can talk about supplementation in regard to high-perchrophy and regard weight loss and regard to sports performance I think those are three great content pieces that people would be interested in and then I'll let you pick which one you want to talk about and we'll bat it back and forth through each other. All right, well let's start with high-perch fee. Number one, always going to be oh yeah I can't say always but at least for right now your best bet's going to be creatine nothing new. It's lost as a luster a little bit but above all other ones that's going to be the one that's going to help the most Scott the most evidence aside from caffeine is the most researched ingredient out there definitely contributes and it'll mostly with increasing your workout volume and workout volume is going to be tied directly to the amount of muscle that you can build. All different kinds of performance too so obviously with workout volume as I just said strength as well maximal strength and even endurance as long as a lot of endurance athletes they get scared of the weight gain they think the weight gain is going to slow it down but it actually does help with endurance performance as well. Beyond that protein if you consider it a supplement obviously protein helps so if you want to dive down that I don't know I don't consider it a supplement even the the the wave powders or any kind of protein powder bars like in citerum a food and then the amino acids associated with those. Well can we go back to creatine just for a moment because I do want to talk about protein so let's keep that on the top shelf because we're going to move back to it but let's talk about creatine and what it means so that's been around since I was young and I remember that being something that had been researched quite a bit are there different types of creatine are different types of creatine whether that's you know different additives whatever I mean talk us through it and then you talk about volume and what it is that creatine does that allows for that extra rep or to to get accomplished. Right so yeah there's a lot of different kinds of creatine they have the industry that I know well is trying to keep it sexy and yeah the creatine model hydrate is your best bet there's that they mean maybe there's something worse better but we can't substantiate that based on the data uh creatine model hydrate is the most studied form of creatine there's a lot of others creatinethalester there's the creatine probably 10 different other kinds creatine model hydrate definitely above all else has the most data behind it and best absorbed and all that every every kind of factor and what creatine does once it gets inside is it contributes to what we call the phosphogen energy system which is your quick ATP whatever cellular energy you have available uh creatine contributes directly to that it doesn't have to go through some sort of energy process at ATP producing process like glycolysis or the crebsyco which take time it's just contributing directly to the available energy pool which is why it works best for increasing exercise volume and increasing strength because those are generally shorter periods of time within that first 30 seconds or so of of your set or of your whatever kind of about a performance you have. Yeah okay now now that's what I that's what you meant when you said early and you started off about increasing volume right so uh and there is a significant correlation between muscle hypertrophy and volume of exercise performed and I think the creatine and increasing monahydrate in particular would be something that allows for that one extra rep maybe two extra reps and over time that would create a a more significant synthesis of well a a training effect and hopefully then a synthesis of protein which is what we're going to talk about next and able to get those muscles to come in or those proteins to come in and help rebuild those muscles and build them up and this kind of anabolic state as we start to to go from working out and and breaking down muscle and then recovering and building that muscle back up so as there a correlation then can we make that that conversation about protein right now and what is the benefit of protein and and we've touched on it on the show before how much protein what's needed and what happens with those branch chain amino acids and do we need at a different amino acid supplement or protein supplement just talk us to that yeah protein uh there's a lot to talk about the protein and get down into the individual amino acids different compositions but to start on kind of a macro type level looking at like a top-down approach most important is going to be the amount of protein second most important the type of protein and that has to do with the amino acid composition of that protein and the source of that protein and then after that timing which we can get into as well protein in terms of what it does it does so many things in regards just throughout the body all different systems but specifically related muscle we know it most for helping to build muscle recover damage tissues but it does actually a lot even like with the immune system protecting against or helping to recover from even like upper respiratory tract infections we see with endurance type athletes but protein is supplying amino acids which are then after being broke down through digestion they're going into different synthetic processes maybe like muscle protein synthesis where there's taking those amino acids that are attained from the protein through digestion and reassembling them into different types of proteins that can then go and do other things in terms of like muscle proteins that are the myos in actin which are the contractile proteins that form the muscle tissue and in rebuilding those after some micro trauma from weightlifting theoretically we rebuild that larger and then you have a more muscle tissue that can then go onto your in the future and age your performance by having more contractile proteins available to exert a stronger force effect and is there what is the I've read recently and spoken with people there's there seems to be a key ingredient in one of those branch chain amino acids that can help to support the stimulation of protein synthesis called lucine is that true is there a kind of a that's not seen in fact okay so lucine is one of the amino acids that's in protein it is a branch chain amino acid and it can't do the job alone but it does provide a signal so there are different or probably thousands if not millions of signals in the body lucines one of those signals it is generally considered an anabolic signal when you're talking about muscle and it basically tells muscle protein synthesis to turn on now that will only translate into actually building muscle proteins if all of the other amino acids are available so lucine is just saying hey build protein but if there's no amino acid available to form that protein it won't happen that's why the total amount of protein is so important and would rank higher in that top-down than the individual types of amino acids are the protein source okay I got you and then can we address one more thing with muscle hypertrophy because I do want to make sure we we have time to hit everything else that we've got slated for today we talked about type of creating and can we talk about type of protein and can we discuss that for just in general what seems to be the the best and then for those who have dietary restrictions whether it's let's say vegan options what are good potential vegan options if they're not going to have the other options available thank you read my chapter so animal proteins are best because they contain more of those anabolic elucine than the other essential amino acids so breaking it down from protein to different categories of amino acids would be the next step you have essential and non-essential amino acids essential amino acids must be obtained in the diet and they're most abundant in animal sources of protein they can be used to form the non-essential amino acids through transamination which is just reconfiguring those amino acids structures into different amino acids to supply those non-essentials but all of them will be incorporated into muscle proteins most of which will be essential amino acids because we are like animals when they're mammals so we have we'll have similar amino acid profiles and our muscle tissue is same as a staker hamburger whatever happens to be so other sources other than animals if you're looking if you're trying to limit those in your diet some of the higher elucine proteins are plant proteins are soy which is pretty common I think pumpkin seed is pretty high pea is either pea or rice could tell you I'll talk my head one of those two is relatively high I think it's pea in elucine yeah I think that's right and I've read quite a bit about pea protein it seems to be pretty hot right now along with rice as well these things are really coming about so that's good to hear let's let's have a look real quick yeah a little bit the combination of those different types of proteins different sources like rice and beans you hear a lot for these complementary proteins because certain plant proteins are usually if an option say usually sometimes low in one particular essential amino acid you need to have a different source that has greater concentrations of a particular amino acids in order to get what we would call a complete protein that has all nine of those essential amino acids in a particular lehi quantity and an essential amino acid is an amino acid that you must get through the diet correct yeah can't form on the body can't make them from other substrates yeah okay all right so thanks for adding that now let's move into actually let's move into performance because I think hypertrophy and performance link pretty well to each other so what would be some if anything so we're now not discussing specifically about hypertrophy but you know we're not talking about bigger but we might be talking about faster stronger jump higher some type of endurance support what are some of the supplements that have evidence backing to support performance yep all right so we got to break it down a little bit so bigger faster stronger still gonna be creatine pretty highly ranked okay beta alanine will contribute to that but for in lactic acid so you can go a little bit longer at a higher intensity which is the mechanism for beta alanine things and then you're looking at things like endurance where you're going for longer periods of time very protractive periods things like caffeine and nitrates are really really good sometimes hey I'm sorry are the nitrates when you say that are those the same things found in hot dogs and delimates is that what I'm talking about? chemically yeah yeah usually you're getting it from a different source and when it comes to supplementation most often as B-group it actually like a lot of data on nitrates from B-rude and B-rude juice supplementation going back into energy systems contributes to having more ATP production so you have also a reduced oxygen cost of exercise if you want to talk about the nitty gritty self-science kind of interesting so you're on both ends you are both reducing the energy cost of exercise and helping to supply a little bit more energy so obviously benefits endurance when you look at it through that lens and then caffeine to go back to just to touch on endurance athletes that's sometimes think that's going to increase quiz if at rest caffeine might increase your heart rate but during exercise actually will help lower your heart rate or keep it from going a little bit higher than it would without caffeine if you to say most accurately that is interesting that I did not know thanks for that and all the sudden as as more of a giant fan than a jet fan you know it was easy for me to look at that that film of Mark Sanchez years ago eating that hot dog and go what now maybe he was trying to get the nitrates out of it so I'm going to stop judging I'm going to stop judging maybe he was just getting a supplementation there I think this is interesting the beta-aline buffering some of that that lactic acid caffeine which many people already use for just daily performance not necessarily sports performance but that has been highly researched and supported and there are a lot of different types of performance that are out there that need to be addressed because you could do supplementation but that you know what you would need as a sprinter I suppose might be a lot different in some cases than what a long distance runner would need yeah definitely for sure all right well what about weight loss then what is weight loss look like with supplementation weight loss is a little bit more complicated you've noticed like in like an infomercial any kind of supplementation type deal that they're trying to pitch somebody for weight loss is always with diet and exercise yeah that's still the case there's nothing that in terms of supplementation that's going to help you lose weight in and of itself completely on its own that being said things that will stimulate the metabolism to run at a higher rate or to shift your substrate utilization from carbohydrate over to fat which is how you're the two substrates you're going to use to generate ATP to make energy and to fuel your movement those types of things can help but again it's with diet and exercise so if just taking some of those things that'll help with that but increase increasing your total color can take you're not going to lose any weight you're probably going to gain weight so there's another higher archie to that as well and in terms of specifics caffeine again is obviously going to increase metabolic rate stimulants as a whole things like sinephrin or to need and other types of stimulants can work synergistically to help with that but again always with diet and exercise things like green tea as well there's a little bit of data that'll suggest that it can help but it's usually not particularly strong and again diet and exercise do you think that the green tea the evidence and the green tea is there because of the caffeine or is it in addition to or without consideration for the caffeine data's a little bit mixed on that so in some cases some studies will say that having caffeinated green tea will increase the effects of caffeine like by itself so taking like say you're getting a hundred milligrams of caffeine and it's coming from green tea or is coming from a caffeine and hydros who just pure chemical caffeine some studies will show that the green tea and caffeine will have a little bit greater effect on weight loss than the caffeine by itself. Interesting in those cases I usually say yeah it's probably doing something but it might not be that strong or it might only be in a certain needs case there might be something with the person or the environment or something some kind of unknown parameter that wasn't measured that could be contributing to the effect. Gotcha. I think it's valid and important to point out that you did say along with the diet and exercise and those two if we're talking about magic pills I think those are our one two punches and those are definitely hard pills to swallow for a lot of people so getting the diet down and getting the exercise and getting the support that people need to better adhere and comply with some dietary programming and some programming when it comes to exercise and you actually have done a lot of study on one particular dietary program and this is really where when we were initially talking I wanted to just speak on supplements and I thought my goodness having somebody who did some in-depth study on the keto diet it'd be a shame for me to pass this up because it's big. It is it is so common right now that I would love to have a conversation with you and regard to keto diet what that means for people what it means for performance what it means for hypertrophy and weight loss all the things that we've already talked about in regard to supplementation what does that mean in the keto diet and then if you have any data because I'm always interested in things that affect me personally as a type two diabetic I'm pretty interested in seeing if the you know what about the keto diet is supportive with that as well so without me talking too much more about it I'm just letting you do your thing man you did a dissertation on it and if you can do some of that stuff that they get to us let's go. Help me stay on track a little bit because there's a lot to cover so we'll tackle the performance side first. But first actually we have to talk about how to actually define the diet because there's a lot of different ideas about what it is and to me a ketogenic diet is one which causes the body to produce ketones okay so ketones are the little small chain carbons they're basically really small fatty acid molecules that are you the most common one is a but it's a few to rate so that's a four carbon molecule that's just like a fatty acid chain clipped and then it has a ketone group on it and to produce those you're basically going through series of beta oxidation which is to go back you're taking a fatty acid through the diet it's going through beta oxidation you're just clipping off carbon's two at a time and then those go through the crep cycle that made KTP. What happens to produce ketones is there's a lot more beta oxidation going on than there is crep cycle so those two carbon things are building up in the cell and then eventually when they reach a critical mass they're leaking out into the blood and then they can get into the urine and that's how people are measuring them through the urine strips and through the blood ketone meters and other tools through the breath that they might be using to indicate whether or not they're in or out of ketosis so a quick definition on that is the body's making more ketones than it would through a different style of eating and to put some numbers on it if you're looking at the blood ketone meter to usually use 0.3 if it's beta hydroxybutary or 0.5 if it's total ketones just because there are a few different kinds. Okay and I just ask what's the difference from ketones and what I hear in those commercials that say be aware of keto acid doses what's the difference between that? So there's going to be the same chemical just keto acid doses is a condition for diabetics which is where most people hear about that where ketones are produced as a result of the liver failing and you're reaching these super super high levels of ketones. It's not that the ketones are a problem. It's that the liver's failing and these are an indicator of that liver failing so they're the marker that's saying hey there's a problem here we need some attention and it's kicking out these ketones because it's trying to provide enough energy to stay alive once it's become so insulin resistant that glucose can't get in there. Oh okay all right less of a problem in and of itself it's just that that's the marker to go down a related rabbit hole that's kind of another theory behind cholesterol where it's responding to inflammation because the classic example is fire trucks show up to a fire fire trucks are not the problem but right. Yeah less problem blaming ketones for that problem when they're potentially solution and the body trying to preserve itself. Wow that is interesting. Yes go on go on because that that is a rabbit hole so let's let's move on I love it let's talk about the ketogenic bag. Right so now we know what my definition of a ketogenic diet would be. I like to we'll move on to these two different kinds of ketogenic diet we have kind of a modern and a classical example. So ketogenic diet's been around for about a hundred years maybe longer used to treat epilepsy and it's originally what called a therapeutic ketogenic diet that's one that's restricting carbohydrate to a great degree in order to elicit very high levels of ketones and to really reduce body's reliance on glucose as a substrate which seems to be therapeutic for people with epilepsy and more recently that same style of therapeutic ketogenic diet has been used research for obesity, diabetes and other clinical conditions. Still using therapeutic very low like 20 to 50 grams max total carbohydrate intake per day. Yes per day. That is very restricted. And that's a lot of the pushback on it is that it is so restrictive people can ever stick to it but if you're a healthy person you don't need to restrict it that much and that's kind of the more modern idea of a ketogenic diet where people are measuring and again to go back to that definition ketogenic diet is one which the body's anachitoogenic state where you're producing more ketones than you would otherwise and to that point before we move on too far having higher ketones doesn't mean necessarily you're doing a better job or your or it's not a direct relationship to how you are consuming that diet is not an indicator of your performance on ketogenic diet or how closely you're sticking to that. You just wanted to be elevated above a baseline and what people see when they start ketogenic dieting is in the first couple of weeks ketones will be pretty high they might get up single digits like one two three four instead of like the point three or point five that I mentioned earlier and then after those first few weeks they'll start to come down what's going on is the body's not adapted yet to using those ketones says they are a fuel substrate that goes through the crevicycle like I mentioned and what's still going on is it's kicking out a lot and you kick out a lot of ketones they're accumulating in the blood but you're not using them as fuel substrate yet because the body's not adapted to doing so yet. So what's happening in ketogenic you know when you're adapted which is a very important part of this modern approach that we get into for performance is you want to be able to use them you want to be adapted to the diet so studies that come out and they say well it's not working for this out of the other thing well most of the time it's because people aren't adapted yet they're looking at it very early on we're not giving them time to basically turn their metabolism upside down from what it has been for probably decades before they were being examined so new style is basically the one that I would consider ketogenic diet is just by that broad definition one which produces a ketogenic state so for normal people if that is 20 grams maybe that's 20 grams but in my case that can be 200 grams in a day and that's going to be directly proportional to my activity level and that's a tenfold increase right now I'm a little bit larger I'm like 220 pounds if I'm very active that day I can tolerate that level on a regular day I'm closer to 80 but I'll still be maintaining ketosis really yes so that's kind of this interesting part where we find this intersection between people without some kind of chronic health condition people who are healthy they are active if they can adapt their lives are basically unaffected except for a few small things in terms of their performance and you know other lifestyle factors that might be like what they pick at a restaurant but your performance will be pretty much intact because I've been doing this I think it was like 2012 2013 I started 2013 I think we want to start it so about seven years in that and I'm still performing at what I would say a pretty high level not like making amazing covers or anything but I can squat over 600 I can deadlift over 600 I can bench over 400 I competed 198 so that's all that's triple double triple bodyweight most people would think impossible I'm the endurance side there's Zack Bitter who's got the 100 mile I'm not sure it's world but I know it's at least an American record I like 12 hours and he's ketogenic athlete and in terms of like what I did for my dissertation was all about looking at active people and how to get them to adapt to the diet and looking at strategic carbohydrate consumption so timing carbohydrate near exercise under the theory that you're putting it into the system and then you're going to use it immediately as soon as exercise over you'll drift back into a ketogenic state if you would even ever leave that state because even during normal exercise ketones increase even if you're not consuming a ketogenic diet just through that previous mechanism where you're utilizing a lot of fat so ketones are increasing because your body's increasing the energy availability that it needs to go and perform exercise okay if my losing anybody at this point no well well we're gonna get into these questions in a moment and if we lose anybody we're second right back in because they're gonna participate but if you were to do a study and you could say well we need people who are not on a keto diet to practice a keto diet would you have them practice it for maybe a few weeks before testing performance let's say you're doing a pre-imposter that you're doing control group how would you set that study up? Yeah ideally so there's a complications when you're working at university so you basically have 12 weeks to do everything because that's about this semester is so if I were to design the perfect study I would want to measure people at the beginning before they do anything before they make any changes about a week or two after they start making those changes so I can have a deficit I want to know their deficit that they would have to make up to return to baseline we would call that like the negative effect of a short-term ketogenic diet or a carbohydrate deprivation period where they're not adapted how much they're performance declines and then go through the probably the three months at least ideally six months to give them a ton of time to adapt and get used to that and then measure them again have them switch back and see after one to two weeks again whatever that first increment of time was switch back to the diet same increment of time measure them again okay now that that makes it perfect or somewhat some of it. It's better than you know if you could do more than 12 weeks it's certainly better if you could make that happen you know I think that I can I can speak from at least some experience when it comes to to this is that before I was diagnosed with the diabetes when I would work out I'd go hypoglycemic really fast like I just I'd get you know we can shaky since I cut out many carbohydrates and I'll have them quite as often at all and I've still started training or I'll go and do Moetai at Hinto Gracies and we'll do some intense workouts and on no carbohydrates nothing in my system now before that would have sent me down this real shaky road but it seems that my body has started to adapt to that while either on an empty stomach or without any or little carbohydrates and I can I can perform in my output my energy expenditure is still elevated without these kind of adverse effects that I was previously having. Yeah so I mean in terms of the research that we've done did the first study about five years ago and that was just in weight training and we observed so the strength gains were the same body composition changed just to gain the same amount of muscle a ketogenic group lost a little bit more body fat and we did win gay tests which is a cycle sprint test without reintroducing carbohydrate performance on that so their power output declined a little bit okay but we gave them carbohydrate back for a week and once they got that carbohydrate back performance came back they made the same performance gains in that test as did the control group so our interpretation of that in that first go around was that they made the adaptation through that training period which was eight weeks at that time they made all those adaptations but they needed the carbohydrate to realize those adaptation so it took that bit and I carried it forward I used the same concept knowing what I had learned from that for the dissertation we did a repeated sprint test so we did six of them in series observed the same thing on the first one performance declined their power output was down but by the end the last two sets they are actually kicking but for the compared to their control group their performance actually up and if you think about the mechanisms behind that and the energy production processes that underlie what would go into that type of performance even though it's high intensity which would normally require carbohydrate the control group carbohydrate base they're using up all those carbohydrate in the first few sets so by time they get to the end they don't have anything left that they're accustomed to using and keep in mind that guys strategically using carbohydrate during their performance their exercise sessions through their training period before they got to the post testing so the ketogenic group still is maintaining at least their like glycolidic enzymes and all that their pathways that are using carbohydrate to produce energy so they're both carbohydrate and carbohydrate or carbohydrate adapted and fat adapted when they're going through that test so they're using carbohydrate just fine for their high intensity when it reaches that critical really high intensity point but even at the back end of those high intensity sprints they have enough fat in reserve to use as fuel to carry them through the end of that test and I relate that back to application unless you knock the guy out in the first 30 seconds you're going to have to play the three rounds so I think it's a little bit better to have that there in the tank yeah yeah I like that that is that's eye opening that interpretation and what what may be happening going on is that you know a few exhausts your carbohydrates stores and you haven't practiced gluconeo genesis and your body's not adapted to creating that and working off of that then you know the the person who's been through that experience has the gas in the tank so to speak to to go to war with thank you for that and here's what I want to do right now Jordan I know we're we're getting close on time if you've got time I want to open this up to Greg and have him asked some questions from our listeners and then I have one more really important question that I want to ask and I'll close out with that if somebody doesn't beat me to the punch so Greg what do you got there oh we've got plenty very active chat and enjoy the conversation Mary wants to know can women take creatine without water weight gain probably not you will gain a proportional amount of water weight with that predominantly is stored within the muscle itself and again it's just water so if you stop taking it it'll go away hi generally view the water weight concern as a trivial concern because it is transient it's definitely not anything that's permanent if you do use like a half dose of creatine that are limited water retention effects but it is going to be proportional to the amount consumed so like a two and a half or three grams serving you'll get some performance benefit but you'll just store half as much water as you would otherwise and can I then interpret that to mean that I still or women in this particular question can still build muscle and high perchrophy but once they stop taking the creatine they maintain that high perchrophy but they lose the water weight correct all right and then Sophia in the chat wants to know I hear that women should slightly modify keto genic diets due to our natural fluctuations of our hormones like give ourselves one day before menstruation to have higher carbohydrates to avoid symptoms or negative exercise that's for deformance is this true and why so I can't tell you why I have heard that a number of times and in terms but in terms of like the available data they're I don't as far as I know there's been no studies on comparing the sex differences for ketogenic diet or how to adapt it between sexes can't say in my study that I did from my dissertation I had both men and women in the study and I did hear that complaint and in just in through like everyday life just the people I know who have done it the women that have done it they have reported similar things and I can't say that having some carbohydrate does seem to alleviate some of the any kind of worse and defects during that week but as far as the why I can't tell you and there I can't give you a lot of guidance either on amounts or I can really tell you as in general yes having a little bit more does seem to be beneficial can I ask a question on that then so we're looking at a question that's really saying ketogenic diet is your diets so that is your your your lifestyle and what you eat there's there's nothing wrong I assume with having a ketogenic diet and then having days where people eat carbohydrates as well that that take you out of the toses yeah I don't view that as this like it's not to me it's not a problem at all I'm pretty liberal with carbohydrate consumption especially relative to probably the majority of people that you would talk to who do practice this type of diet or or anything related to that diet even with so like I said earlier sometimes I'll go up to 200 grams a day my normal life is basically I will time carbohydrate around exercise and then one day week or one day every other week I'll have a couple of meals two or three well I say one to three which are higher carbohydrate and that's both the targeted and the cyclical approach to use the terms that people might find in the browser around the internet targeted being carbohydrate consumption near exercise and then cyclical being once a week or just picking a day to go and have whatever you want and for me my in my goals aren't weight loss too so I'm preface with that um my not strength and muscle gain so it's not negative to me in any way to do that if you were trying to achieve weight loss I would limit it I'd pick one of those two strategies first of all and I'd keep it a little bit more rained in but there's still some benefit I think to having some intermittently uh again go you know even it's all encompassing creating an increase and working out volume carbohydrates do the same thing depending on the type of work you're doing so it all comes back most well a lot of it comes back like 90% to die to exercise so if you can increase your exercise output you're probably going to have better training effects. Well I'm with you on that because I uh I'm somebody who will have some carbohydrates and I know that if I'm going to plan carbohydrates more in my meals as a diabetic so I'll preffer let me let me put that out there um that I'm going to I'm going to plan my workout with that as well so I'm not just going to and that happened yesterday morning because I've been in Alabama with my folks my mom and dad and uh I had seen biscuits and gravy in years and living in New York City that's not just a thing that we do there so being back at home and that got pulled out for the second time I refused at the first time around and when it was pulled out a week later I went guess who's doing a run today so you know you can you can allow yourself some of those things but I I like that where you you know you can you can you can plan your carbohydrate intake also around the amount of exercise that you do I think that can that's very helpful for me in my situation and it might be a supportive statement for others Greg do we have other questions here we do I love reading these questions because it's like being an actor I get to go from being a woman asking a question like you did to being a 41 year old man in great shape this time so James is uh uh is asking I'm a 41 in great shape and just suffered from a heart attack from a clot and my right coronary artery doctor is concerned with a keto I was keto prior I LDL level was 124 heart is imperfect in it is imperfect condition it was just a clot should I be concerned with doing keto? I know I'm not a doctor of that variety so this is purely my personal opinion and not medical advice in any way but if it were me I would not be concerned. Good I think that's there also if um uh hey Greg what was his name? James I'm sorry James that's right so um if there's a way I'd like for James to have access to some materials that that can support him that he may be able to present to his doctor so James stay tuned it will will you can you can DM me on Instagram and uh I'll certainly have Jordan give his uh where where to find him and he'll have a lot more data than me so if you DM me all I'm going to do is go back to Jordan and say help me out so uh when you can reach out to Jordan stay tuned on this conversation at the end he'll give some contact information and hopefully be able to provide some information that you can present to your physician all right Greg next. That is everything from the chat it appears now unless we get another one that comes in here I'll let you know uh Jordan I just wanted to say hi I'm highly jealous of you beard I know it's not about that keto resemblance but highly jealous love that beard so I appreciate that. All right so here here's my question for you Jordan and I have it written out before we started in all caps then what do you eat because if we get that question all the time and keto what do you eat? Uh I eat a lot of meat and vegetable uh that's the majority of it um I'm on a round right now where I've been having birth benders waffles uh in the morning for breakfast uh that's been a departure from the usual bacon and eggs but predominantly it's it's meat and vegetables oil some dairy so yeah nothing crazy. Nothing crazy it seems what about um are there some of these things like the waffles are there certain flowers and stuff like that that seem to be a bit more keto friendly for people that it's a different it's a whole different kitchen experience so uh yeah I'm really good at adapting recipes and I think that it's actually a lot of fun to take something we'll call normal and then switch up a few of the ingredients to make it a low carb type of dish and still kind of achieve the same thing. Certain things are difficult but uh you know like pasta but I never really like pasta all that much anyway so I'm usually all right. Yeah for for us my family will still eat pasta but I get that uh those zucchini noodles usually and uh and I'm totally pleased with it so I'll take that um join look man we are lucky to have you as a subject matter expert at NASM and a contributor to uh what we do and our completions with our text and our programming and our coursework so thank you for that I think Muscle Sport is lucky to have you on their research and development team and leading that charge so uh look thanks for everything you're doing and just for people who are still on it where and how can they find you whether you're social media your email accounts website anything like that let them know.
