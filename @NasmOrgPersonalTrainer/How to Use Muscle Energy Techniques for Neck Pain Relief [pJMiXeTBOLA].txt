On today's episode of the NASM CPT podcast with me, Rick Richie, I explore which muscles of the neck might be strained if you've got a strained muscle in the neck. So we review joint actions of several neck muscles, the most commonly strained neck muscles when it comes to strains and we look at how the joint actions reflect the pain. And then we look at how simple supports like soft tissue approximation and self-administered muscle energy techniques may help your clients and you don't even have to put your hands on them. It's all within your scope of practice. You're just teaching them how to do it. Make sure you like. Follow subscribe and leave a five star review. Now here's the episode, pain in the neck, which muscle is it? You're listening to the NASM CPT podcast with Rick Richie, winner of the shared care Emmy Award for social storytelling and the official podcast of the National Academy of Sports Medicine. Hey y'all and welcome to the NASM CPT podcast. My name is Rick Richie and today I've got a special episode because it's about me and what I'm going through. I woke up and strained a muscle in the neck and it hurts and listen. It's not good to be a personal trainer with a strained muscle in the neck but also there becomes a problem is that you know now I don't want to help my clients by giving them the dumbbells and the weights or whatever but sometimes you get those boozey clients and they don't like it when you don't bring them their weights and what a great excuse just to be like sorry I can't help you. I'm just kidding I'm going to make everybody get their weights and sometimes I'm very, very nice it just depends on my mood but listen I got to figure out what muscle is strained as a trainer I want to know as a massage therapist I want to know and as an anatomy enthusiast I want to know so we got to look at the most common options here. But so you've got muscles that that can can hurt. We generally see things like the upper traps and the levator scapula so I immediately go to those first and I try to figure out is that the one. So let's look at these proximal and distal insertions just to see if it's even in the right place then we got to look at the joint actions and then see if me doing those joint actions facilitate pain well this will also be contingent on how bad of a strained it is what happened okay I know because my producer asked me this what do you do I woke up Now that's the end of the story I woke up I didn't wake up with a strained neck as I was sitting up my neck started to strain and I got the levator down real quick and and I turned my head kind of laterally flexed to the side to make the strain to make that cramping stop and it stopped and then I straight my head back up and then it immediately cramped again so I went back into that stretch and held it for a little bit longer just to get the stop but at that point the damage was done the neck is ailing a me but I'll be alright but I gotta know what is it and I think this is important I'm this is to think about you know I guess you could go through and just poke it and prod it and if you were massage therapist you'd be like where is this where it hurts and they could say you could just say yes that's it you found it right your fingers on it it doesn't mean that the therapist know which muscle it is and it takes zero skill to actually poke around and find out what hurts you so what is what's the skill that's coming in here well the skill that you want is to identify what the joint actions are of that muscle and then you can do things like a pin and stretch but you got a pin and stretch it the right way you want to do stripping on the muscle so following the line of the muscle how do you do that if you don't know where the muscle is and what the muscle line is so this is going to give you a better idea as a personal trainer and then we get to the end of this I'm going to give you some things that you can do not as a therapist as a personal trainer that you can do that might help them and you don't even have to put your hands on them and I'm not talking about just you know make your just give the clients their their weight so you don't have to you're not doing that you are giving them techniques that can help to minimize some of the pain that they may be having or at least give them some range of motion without even stretching the next so here's what I did I got to find out what what's going on my next the first one I go to is the upper traps it's a big muscle and it's very commonly strained so what happens this muscle is that the origin's base of the skull so that proximal attachment base of the skull external occipital protuberance that big boney notch on the base of the back of the skull and then it goes down into the posterior aspect the lateral third of the clavicle so it goes into the shoulder blade and so it runs from the base of the head the neck down into the shoulder blades now yeah it's kind of there the muscle that bothering me is kind of in it's in the neck area upper traps might be it if I elevate though when I shrug if I keep my head neutral and I shrug I don't feel it anymore and we know that the upper traps shrug or elevate the scapula well they also do this extension of the neck and they do contra lateral which means opposite side rotation and they can also lateral flex the neck to the same side well those all kind of makes sense but if I if I rotate towards the side that hurts I feel it a little more than when I rotate it away but it just kind of depends because of how tight my muscle is I'm not sure which one now here's what the general rule is it depends on how much pain is there because sometimes if a muscle is stretched or if you strengthen if you activate a muscle it hurts so bad that it's just as painful lengthening as it is shortening but if I shorten towards that side the strained muscle is is activating that tends to hurt a little bit more so I feel it on my left side and when I lateral flex to the left then it bothers me more than when I lateral flex to the right I still feel it when I lateral flex to the right but it bothers me more towards that side so I know that it is a muscle that does lateral flexion it bothers me an extension it bothers me in flexion so I got to figure out which one of it it bothers more in extension than it does in flexion but now we got to look at the rotation so I looked at the upper trap and the other thing it does so shrugging it doesn't bother me so it's probably not my upper trap of the traps do upper rotation as long as I don't move my neck and I go into upper rotation of my scapula also doesn't bother me so I'm going to take upper traps throw it out this is the process that you go through to try to identify which muscle is doing what what muscle is involved here so then I go to the next most common muscle the levator scapula and the levator scapula originates excuse me or one of its proximal attachments it's going to be on the posterior tubercle of the transverse process of cervical spine or a vertebrae 1 through 4 well 1 2 3 4 I feel like like I'm in the 1 through 4 process because it's a little bit higher up on my neck maybe not that high it's 3 or 4 3 and so that could be it the levator scapula goes into the medial and the the medial superior border of the scapula and it does this it elevates the scapula nothing it downwardly rotates this scapula so if I raise my arm up and then I pull down against a little bit of resistance it doesn't bother me doing that as long as I keep my neck still so I can go ahead and just take levator scapula probably throw it out it also does it's a lateral rotation so now I gotta say okay well does contra lateral rotation bother me as much as it's a lateral no so my same side rotation tends to bother me more than the opposite side rotation but they both hurt so it's hard to tell but one thing I know for sure if it's a scapular muscle it works at the scapula I do an exercise at my scapula it doesn't bother me take that muscle throw it out it's probably not the one strength all right this episode of NASM CPT podcast is brought to you by NASM1 the membership for trainers and coaches members enjoy unlimited access to

immediately I went so maybe it's my scaleings and here's why scaleings do not attach to the scapula so I gotta try to identify is it anterior scaleings, medial scaleings posterior, scaleings first things first and two your scaleings I'm gonna throw them out I don't think it's anterior scaleings because it's on the anterior side of the neck and I'm not bothered on the anterior side medial scaleings medial scaleings kind of go from that first rib same thing as the anterior first rib but they go into this the anterior two bristles of the transverse process the the front of the neck for the anterior medial go onto the transverse processes of C2 through seven doesn't bother me all the way down that low but now the scaleings posterior that one could be something here scaleings posterior lateral surface of the second rib and that goes up into C5 through C7 now that's just a little bit lower than I feel this muscle so I'm gonna look at that and be like I'm not really sure if that's the one now let's do this I'm gonna go posterior scaleings it can flex the neck and it can rotate the neck to the same side well that same side rotation bothers me again they both bother me which one doesn't bother me most well that one so is it posterior scaleings could be what I'm looking at but I'm gonna continue to look and now I'm gonna go to maybe some less common ones that we think about but tend to be commonly bothered and strain the muscle so I'm gonna go with the spleenous capitals spleenous capitals it's it's the lower half of the ligament to new chair which just runs along the the spine's processes of the C7 to T3 and C4 and C6 and where does it go into well it goes into the mastoid process and the occipital bone so what it does is it extends the head in cervical spine unilaterally it does lateral flexion to the same side and the same side of rotation okay alright well that that's potential that's a potential one that it could be but I feel like it's up higher than C4 through C6 and it's definitely not C7 to T3 it's not that low so I'm gonna look for one more muscle here and I would look at my spleenous services and that one is it starts at T3 and T6 and it runs up into the posterior tubercles of the transfers processes of C1, C2 and C3. alright I feel like it's now C1, C2, C3 that's a pretty high skip one skip one I get to like C3 and like man the C3 might be the spot and it's tricky because some of those muscles transfer they kind of C3 and C4 is where they differentiate it laterally flexes still hurt so laterally flex rotates the head neck to the same side it's a lateral and when it does when it acts unilaterally alright so I'm gonna say that it might be my spleenous services not might not be it might be my posterior scaleings well what does that mean for me well what do I do about it one is I'm gonna talk to you for a moment about what you can do as a personal trainer without actually putting your hands on somebody because putting your hands on people to sit by the way I'm pretty well educated in fitness and in massage therapy and I still don't like stretching people's necks so I'm gonna say don't put your hands on people's heads and necks and stretch them in case unless you are unless you are licensed to do so and unless you feel very very very comfortable doing that because for the most part I don't actually like stretching muscles in the neck when I certainly don't like stretching strained muscles so we're taking strained muscles take it off to take we're going to look at two other things excuse me we're going to look at muscle energy technique self-administered muscle energy technique and something called soft tissue approximation now the soft tissue approximation is the easiest one and it is by far the most boring one for your client and what does that mean that means the joint actions that the muscle does which is the one that is bothering you and we're identifying it we're going to say it's spleenous services or the posterior scaleings and they have very similar joint actions so I think either of these work I want to passively latterally flex which means I am not going to actively side-bind my neck I might lean over to a side and just let my neck fall that way and even hurts when it falls that way so I know something so and then we're going to allow it to rotate so if it does it's a lateral rotation then I'm going to let it side bend and I'm going to rotate and let my head just hang there not actively I'm very passively in that position a lot of times better to be lying down on a pillow and just lay there and the research says stay there for about three minutes and what it does is that muscle that's that short-tight overactive strain potentially strained it's just going to you're passively in that position so you don't really do anything you're just having them going to a position and do nothing for three minutes and then when it's time to get up slowly slowly get out of that position and see if it feels any better because your muscles are working really hard even while strained to protect your neck and once you strain them neurologically they're very active so if I can put them in a shortened position passively then I can generally get those muscles to calm down not by stretching them to get them to calm down but by passively shortening them and then there's another technique that you can do and it is a muscle energy technique self-administered muscle energy technique now my my neck hurts right around here so we're again we're saying that's spleenous services or posterior scaling and what I'm going to do is right hurts to sideband hurts to sideband and I did this with a musician who came into town a few years ago and one of my trainers was like he was he worked with that trainer he said I have a concert tonight I got to go on stage tonight do you have anybody that can help me with my neck and so she sent him to me and I worked on his neck and I did some muscle energy techniques and I've shown him how to do it himself before he went on stage and he was so incredibly grateful and so I'm going to teach you how to do that so that you can teach your clients a little bit here's the greatest thing it takes so little energy it's why it's called muscle energy technique and not muscle push really hard and as hard as you can technique it's not called that all you're going to do is that position that it hurts so it hurts for me to sideband to my left side so I'm going to take my left hand and I'm very very gently going to press it against my head and very gently pressing it against my head now what's happening when I press it against my my head the muscle that is bothering me is actually activating but when I let go of it the muscle is very happy and it's relaxing and now I can sideband much further and if I hold that position and I just stay in my sideband position I give a little muscle energy technique it is the lightest of pushing I'm telling you if there was a grape between my hand and my head as I push against it right now then I might not even pop the grape I might but it's that kind of tension maybe maybe not depends on how squishy or how firm your grapes are don't make that a use of them it's not intended to be and then I'm going to relax take my hand up and then I can sideband a little bit more and you can see now I already have much more range of motion doesn't mean I don't feel it it just doesn't hurt it's not stopping me it's not locking me down and I'm able to get more range of motion same thing in my rotation so if it's starting to bother me one side towards the other then I might say okay I'm going to counter-ladderly rotate to my right if that's bothering me and I give a little push little push no no popping grapes and then let go and I can get much more rotation and then go again give a little push if you're watching on YouTube this makes a lot more sense then if you're just listening to the podcast I've realized I'm doing these techniques and you're just listening I'm like and then you do this good and then this and now it's better and again it I did not unstrain mine that I didn't do any of these techniques prior to doing the show so I've been dealing with just so I could come online and show you what it looks like to actually implement these techniques and show you the range of motion that kind of occur by doing something like a self-administered muscle energy technique all right if you have no idea what I'm talking about then go check out YouTube if you are interested in learning more about what what it is that I did and I want to say thank you so much for listening thanks to our producer Eric Sourenson and please like subscribe share with your
