Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to NASM Optima Online. My name is Prentice Rhodes and I'm here with Dr. Kyle Stull and Rodney Corn from Alego. We're going to continue our discussion regarding corrective exercise and limbic weightlifting. In the first webinar, hopefully we were able to make the point that what corrective exercise is is really just coming up with a targeted flexibility and strength training program for your clients so that you can help them to their goals. Help them get to their goals more efficiently, which in this case is performance in Olympic weightlifting. Now what we're going to do today is go a little bit deeper and really show you how to come up with that corrective exercise program through a couple of case studies. So let's talk a little bit more about the agenda and then we'll dive right in. We go to next slide. What we're going to do is today talk about the CES assessment flow and talk about how you kind of walk through that with your client depending on what they're showing you at each level of assessment. We're going to give you two case studies and stay until the end we'll have another giveaway so you want to hang on to get those promotion codes and I am absolutely certain these two gentlemen will be willing to answer all of your questions about corrective exercise and Olympic weightlifting. So fire away. Now gentlemen, let's start with you Robby, how are you doing today and are you doing today? All is well. Okay. And Dr. Stull, the man who actually wrote the book on self-myofacial techniques, how are you today sir? I'm doing all right and I wrote a book based a lot on the chapter that Rodney wrote back in 2001. I just looked it up today at a publication date of that in a SM, Optimal Performance Training text. Correct. Awesome and just as a reminder you can save 15% today on a lake or a parallel and equipment and you'll also be able to save 35% on the the new CES. So let's end just hang on to the end so that you can get that promotion code. And let's go let's start off with the assessment flow. Kyle, can you review for us what we did in the last webinar? What this assessment flow is and how we use this to the benefit of our clients? Absolutely. So in the assessment flow or any time we're doing assessments we need to have some sort of a process, some sort of a systematic process we call it here an assessment flow and just the word there. I want you to think of this as we're going from A to B to C or 1 to 2 to 3 and we're always using the information from one assessment or one test to inform the next assessment and the next and what we're really trying to do here is we want to value the clients time. They're paying by the hour. We can break that down and by the minute and by the second. They're paying for every minute so we don't want to take them through a barrage of test or assessments is not actually going to inform our program. So that's the reason we have the flow here. So the first thing we're going to do is intake. We need to know about their medical history. We need to know their goals. I think a lot of times whenever we're thinking about corrective exercise we get we get lost thinking that well our goal is to improve movement quality but that's usually a secondary or in some cases it's even a tertiary goal in the eyes of the client. They have something else they want to accomplish. They need to take that information in so we can we can integrate it into our program if they want to lose weight. We're going to design our programs in a manner that's going to help enhance calorie-bearing potential. So we take the client intake and after that we're just going to take a quick look at it. Like the other day their posture is typically a representation of their habits. So we're just going to take a look at their static posture. However if they have core posture when they present statically it doesn't always mean that they're going to move poorly. So then we're going to take them into the transitional assessments or the the overhead squat assessment. And here's where we start to get a little bit more picky or a little bit more detailed if you will. If we see compensations in the overhead squat assessment we're then going to move to our two modifications which we'll discuss in here a little bit today. One modification is going to be elevating the heels the other modifications is going to be placing the hands on the hips and we're going to use that to direct our guide our focus so that will help us identify what a root cause may be to their movement impairment. If we get from that overhead squat assessment if we see the compensations and we get valuable information we can design a program that could be as far as we go with the assessment process. Some clients from there we could go right into designing a program or we could skip down to those mobility assessment which is going to help us confirm what we see in the movement and also give us a more subjective data. So we can take a look at how they're moving the range of motion and then we can come back and retest that. However if they do well in the overhead squat assessment then we're going to reduce the base of support and change some things up by taking them to a single x squat assessment or a split squat assessment. Again if we see the compensations here that may be all we need to design a wonderful program or if they do well then we can take them a step further we can get to the dynamic assessments. These are going to be a bit more complex. A lot of times we're looking at more eccentric control or reduced base of support with these or and we can do a loaded assessment which we'll talk a little bit about today as well. Then again there we use an information to come back to mobility assessments if we need it and then we're going to take all the information and design our corrective program. So thank you thank you for that and if I may I want to ask you a really quick question before we dive into our first case study oftentimes our I've heard feedback that our students have the challenge with getting everything or going through these assessments and then throw in the kitchen sink at their clients. How do we just go back and touch on it? I know you had done it just touch on how we use this flow to actually take things away from their programming their warm up and actually we're using this to make their program more targeted. Can you touch on that a little more please? Okay and so as far as taking stuff away or going back to the flow of the assessment here whenever we identify what we need to identify then we can move on to the program. We don't have to keep assessing we don't have to keep testing we don't have to keep taking them through that. Sometimes athletes need specific testing and maybe there's another level but whenever we're talking about whatever the general population is that movement could inform their program and then we move on. Whenever we talk about trying to streamline their actual program we'll use these to also look at or really what we're looking at as movement quality. So if somebody does really really well at a squat or at squat then we can probably know that we could program squats and they're going to succeed in that in their program. However if we see some big compensations in the squat then we may want to try to take some of that squatting pattern out of their program just temporarily until we improve that movement quality but there we could still work on a hinge pattern we could still work on things for the lower extremity. So that's one way we could use this to try to streamline the actual program. Again if we have a client or an athlete they can't get their arms overhead we probably wouldn't program a lot of stuff with arms overhead or if they have great shoulder mobility then we could get away with doing a little bit more upper body focused stuff perhaps. Not exactly sure if that was your question. That answers that question perfectly. Thank you for that explanation and before we move on to the next slide just so that we give every one and review Rodney we have all of those kinetic chain checkpoints listed on the other half of the slide. Can you tell us just go over really quickly why are we looking at this for the purposes of Olympic weightlifting what do people need to be what do people need to perform these techniques to perform these techniques? Well in essence when we're looking at from an in a sense standpoint when you look back and having a part of the onset of this hundred years ago this is all about no muscular efficiency is Cal talk to you looking at movements to see how well is this person going and when we look at we realize that we needed to have a quick and easy process to scan the body and people when we first started we didn't have to check points when this first came out in 2000 there weren't these checkpoints so these these are all because we realized that we needed to have a flow for people to actually look at the person so let's start a foot and work our way up was the easiest way I know people who go from top down so but from this particular standpoint what we want to do is want to make sure that we're looking at joints and looking at the movement up the joint relative to its its limbs or the you the bonus structure so that goes this is what we call arthur kinematics versus osteok kinematics and people have heard that term osteo's bone arthritis joints so we're looking at how things move so basically from that we're able to see what the alignment of that is relative to where it could or should be and what's the control so what's the normal circuit and trococability of the body when we're going through these particular movements so the body especially in total motions when you scan this you're able to quickly see hey this looks like it's in uh go to alignment it's maintaining its control while we go through the motion or there's a deviation that's occurring and when we get deviation oftentimes that's an indication that perhaps there's a dysfunction why that dysfunction is coming is what we want to investigate so this just lets us know here's where things are going to be working more optimal and this goes back to the length tension relationships that we talked about because we want to make sure that there's length tension relationships and there's the proper arthur kinematics of joint motions that are going to be sending from that. As I said simple process to specifically scan whether you're doing a squat whether you're doing a full clean whether you're doing a jerk whether you're doing a snatch or whether you're doing any particular motion you can still watch these patterns because it's going to indicate where there may be a breakdown in the the kinetic link in the Well okay and without further ado we're going to talk about James now and we have James here who is 38 years old he's had right children surgery two years ago but he's fully rehab so he's a candidate for a trainer fitness professional to work with him he doesn't have specific athletic goals but he's looking for strength and he's interested in Olympic weightlifting I've met a few people like James in my time so Kyle why don't you take us through how you would work with James as your client definitely sorry my computer is is bringing stuff up on the screen to where I can no longer see what's happening there we go so so here we are we have James and just like Brennan said he had right shoulder surgery he's fully rehab one of the reasons we put that in here is we're going to use that to kind of expand on a few of his assessments that he goes through in this process but just like we looked at with the assessment flow we're going to use this as our client intake all be it it is it is a bit brief and then if we can go to the next slide so the first thing we're going to do looking at the left and this is just following that flow we're going to take a look at his static posture if we look at the the static posture and I'm sure we could get we couldn't really pick you with some things that we see we're just looking at a lateral view here but if we were to look at his foot his ankle his knee his hips up into the shoulder all the way up into his cervical spine he looks relatively well aligned he looks like he may be a bit immediately rotated in in the hands in turn the rotate there with the in the glenofium role joint perhaps but I often tell people if you ever ever heard a half to write a letter home to his family is there anything that jumps out at you here that you really need to let them know about and looking at that static posture I think he actually looks pretty good some different views may may give us some different information about his feet and such forward to look at shift in the hip or shift in the shoulder or anything there but lateral view from that static posture with the exception of immediately rotate your hands I think it looks pretty good there we are going to take that into a movement pattern so we're going to look at that look at the squat and I don't think we've talked about it but I think I guess to me I feel like people maybe assume or know why we use the squat we use the squat because it's a total body movement we're looking at range motion of the ankle that knee the hip we're looking at the the neuromusketer's efficiency, the neuromusketer efficiency or the stability of the Wimbledon hip complex holding the arms overhead looks at several things we're looking at the the sacral plane motion of the glenofium role joint but also let's scap little thoracic joint and beyond that whenever we make somebody do this for few reps we're also looking at the scapular stability because we have a lot of muscles that have to maintain that that position of the scapula during the movement now looking at this here one of the things with the overhead squat assessment we use a dichotomous scoring system so it's a yes or a no and I often tell my students that I was a great note back at her I was working with more clients so I would usually use a little plus or minus or something to indicate whether something it was maybe a slight compensation or a peer to be a bit more severe so we could possibly use that here but really what we're looking at is does he compensate or does he not and it's one of those where we we can't really get lost in the details if you're sitting there having to figure out what I can't really tell exactly these lines of how everything looks then perhaps you're over thinking it and we just need to go back with these he's not compensating and keep in mind we have additional assessments that will come up and we will catch those compensations later if it is indeed an actual compensation so anyway looking at that overhead squat assessment what we could identify here would be a little bit of an excess afford lean but thinking back to kind of following a shoulder approach with this look at that great flexion he has there of the of an advantage you're real joint the it looks like he's getting the extension he needs for that movement and is thoracic spine so upper body there looks pretty good maybe just slight excessive forward lean which we we could test a little bit further forward to see what we identify moving on to that next one there really what we would say here is since he you can go back to the other slide actually since he's able to get his arms overhead and his squat looks pretty good we could potentially move forward with our programming there unless we were going to explore that excessive afford lean a little bit but he's he's demonstrating the the capacity to hold his arms in that flex position overhead for a series of a few reps so we wouldn't have to move to that additional shoulder those shoulder tests that we have up there if in this picture James if his arms were to fall forward into that that arms fall forward motion or if he was demonstrating an arch and his low back to get up there or if we were looking at this from an interior view if we saw a bend in the in the arm or perhaps some elevation of the shoulders then that would be our information to move forward with those additional shoulder mobility test so we see their shoulder flexion he's testing up against the just checking that range of motion we're looking for limitations compensation we're also looking for symmetry on his right left side that middle picture there of the shoulder test we're doing internal rotation internal rotation is incredibly important which Roni can probably touch on especially for weight lifting we need a good bit of internal rotation and a lot of times what we're testing here is really the the back part of the the capsule so we're looking at that capsule mobility there in that posterior aspect and then that other picture there we're looking at that little tumour roll external rotation looking for about 90 degrees there or getting close to touch on the back of the arm or the hand to the wall and again if we look at this from a weight lifting perspective those are very applicable to the movement he's going to have to perform so that would be a great series of tests to tell us a lot about how James upper body here is is functioning overall okay so let's take a look at let's take a look at the next slide so we're assuming now that everything you identified that everything looks pretty good with him there's nothing really to speak of regardless of shoulder mobility instability so now we want to move forward into the loaded assessment so what are we doing what are we doing here why did we choose these movements and how do we how do we take our client through this test let's ask you Rodney since well such an a look at the loaded we just want to see as Kyle went through when he's unloaded and when it's just his body weight and and open space he looks fairly good it looks like he's moving fairly good without giving forward in the piggy so now if that's okay if that's the case then let's see what happens when we just put a little bit of love because we wanted to do it's fine out under force whether to speed or load what's actually going to happen with that particular person is something going to change or something going up here and so here we obviously have a a fairly light load it's not real heavy but we just want to take a few a couple of motions now the high pull goes back to your internal rotation we talked about so when I do that and especially looking at shoulder can I see anything happen differently and we know that the error right shoulder situation can I say anything different between is right and left shoulder yes or no is there anything that's changing you know to see able to move that do I see a trap dominance so it was there be a difference in right trap dominance versus left trap dominance which may indicate that potentially the trap is overactive and there may be other components in this shoulder girdle that may not be working as effectively as need to be and just see if if they're not one from a range of motion standpoint what's the height and then also from compensation are there any compensations that are occurring and then we want to see is there fatigue factor going on so if we're going to do 10 to 12 repetitions does one side start with fatigue versus the other side because those will be indications at yes that directional or is good to go or know that directional or maybe a little bit more work so we want to be careful what we do going into kids program and so that would then specifically lead to what we want to be effective standpoint overhead press is just the same thing so we want to look at exactly what we were doing with the overhead squat only now he's he's loaded so as he goes up is there a symmetry between both sides yes you know is there any compensation again is there a type of trap compensation is our both arms fairly equal and relative to the head or we get into deviation ones moving outside and and or is not able to lock out on one side as you have to stay down or kind of been the elbow because that could be an indication that there is some type of neuromuscular inefficiency going on so that's the reason to put those on the load and the reason why we do that because a lot of weight that you will include overhead lifts and will include that high promotion in order to get into catch position. Okay great thank you for that and just one quick question can you explain to us again what what the rationale is for using a 5% body weight as the testing weight for these two just a lower percentage and just so it's relative to the person's body weight. Okay great thank you so let's take a look now at what we're doing from a from a corrective exercise perspective. Kyle can you please talk us through the continuum again and just let's review what we want to what we want accomplish at each phase of this corrective exercise process. Definitely and what we have to ask ourselves here with James is if he is actually a candidate for a corrective exercise approach. If he's done well and all the assessments all the mobility tests or the the transitional assessments to the mobility test to the loaded test if we put him in any anymore dynamic position to do some dynamic testing if he's done well and all of those then that is demonstrating that he he has the movement capacity and the ability to go right into a training program. Now whenever I say training program from from my perspective that means we go right into the the O.P. team model and then where he starts in the O.P. team model is going to be determined by you know his experience his his ability his goals all of that type of fun stuff and one of the things we'll look at Monday is the O.P. team model is not going to be quite as strategic or specific as the as the corrective as a corrective exercise approach but it still follows the same principles. We see that these same principles are pitted and both the the corrective model and the the regular O.P. team model but again it just may be I hate to use the term general but it may be slightly more general than what we're going to do here so if we see a compensation or an impairment or something with James then we would take him through the the more specific corrective model here. The first thing we're going to do is inhibit so that's going to be using a foam roller or whatever we have available there to do self-modal facial rolling techniques. A couple different things we're trying to do here but we want to identify the overactive muscles and reduce that that activity or down regulate so to speak but we're also going to use this to mobilize some stuff. So this is something that could be used whether there's a compensation or not really because we're going to use the roller to improve some blood flow mobile ice some tissues of being up or body stuff we're trying to get us some thoracic extensions we're going to start there identify a few muscles then we're going to take the muscles that we identified as being short and lengthen them so this is going to be static stretching or neuromuscular stretching then we typically look at the other side of the joint and then we're going to try to upregulate or activate certain muscles that's going to provide us more stability to the joint and then the last thing is integrating that in to a total bonding motor pattern or something that's more specific to James goal so that's going to be our four phase approach. Okay perfect so now let's go into specific techniques of why did we just talk us through these phone rolling techniques and why did we select the exercises that we did in these two images so the thoracic you want me to do that one? Yes please. Okay thank you. The thoracic spine that's one of those that it comes up a lot of you if you look at all the things we list out in our solutions table and our charts and most of our we're always talking about muscles specific muscles but here we're actually talking about the spine and what that means is we're trying to get movement to the thoracic spine so the muscles that lay over it the the spinal directors the rhomboids the you know parts of the traps or the traps they're not only short and overactive so a lot of times it's just there's people are just stuck in that chyphotic position so we're going to try to get motion to the thoracic spine this is great for a weight lifter this is great for somebody that sits at their desk all day this is great for a lot of different people so this would be one of those things if you're working with the client you don't know what to do have them rolled their thoracic spine they'll probably love you for it and they'll feel better afterwards so that's what we're choosing that thoracic spine rolling there getting some mobility get some movement we need thoracic extension to get our arms overhead we could do some different things with the position of our hands you can put on your head here so you can actually relax back into it and I relax the muscles on the anterior aspect of the thoracic or if you want to separate the shoulder blade you can also do like James is doing and you can give yourself a big hug it's the shoulder blades out of the way and you can get into some of the tissues there that next one he's rolling the the lats or at least a portion of the lats this would be something that we would want to roll if we see the arms fall forward or if somebody is unable to get their arms all the way over their head or if some of those overhead movements if they're demonstrating an arch can they're low back all of that could type that could be tied back to a mechanically short the tissimus and dorsai another thing we could roll here James could just roll over a little bit more and start to get into the anterior aspect of the shoulders specifically the pet minor which plays a big role in the position of the scapula as we try to do overhead movements okay right why don't you continue Kyle and let's talk about the the lengthening techniques that we've chosen here for this lifter so just a couple of simple techniques here to try to integrate into a program and going back to some stuff we've talked about we won't get into a lot of details but whenever we when we perform lengthening or whenever we perform stretching but he remember that we're not literally stretching out that muscle fiber we're just trying to influence the stretch tolerance so we want to take to the first point of tension hold that for a period of time rope peat that our regular basis and eventually your body will demonstrate increased extensibility of the muscles whatever we look at the picture of James and the chair there we're just trying to get the rassic extension one of the things we may want to watch here if you you if you see kind of mid torso it looks like his rib cage is popping out a little bit that little rib cage flare may mean that there's some lumbar extension so you may want to cue James here to just contract the abdominal complex to pull the ribs down and then I would do this going through reps to six to eight reps of extent holding for one to two seconds and then relaxing just trying to get that thoracic extension the picture on the right it's going to be just a basic latismist door size stretch there's a lot of different ways to do this I generally lean towards doing it in a kneeling position here if you're client can because that will help us get a little bit of a posterior pelvic tilt which will help increase the the lengthening or the the attempt of the lengthening the lat and in general we take to that first point of tension or when you first start to feel the tissue the tissue stretch and then we would just hold that one of the last things here this is an active process we want our clients engage maintaining neutral posture we want them thinking about what they're doing mindful in this approach not just hanging out laying there just hoping that the the tissues will lengthen over time so now let's as we're moving down the continuum we're going to get into some activation exercises and we have a couple of of different ones here Rodney can you talk to us about these activation exercises and what we're trying to accomplish with each of these movements you're activation exercises really just to start to rate a neurological connection and reconnecting so you just want to start to increase some activity and that's why they're performed for some holds oftentimes you'll be able to hold or there's more of a static one to make it in an in-range so to speak and in this one on the left hand side maybe a little bit more exaggerated than you people really what we would want to do with this is activate the straight center here because the straight center is a huge component of shoulder mobility is a part of you have a trap and little trap wrong points and lower to pieces if they have to be staring well that turns out shoulder girdle for us so what we could do is in the topic here probably could be a little bit more neutral but you're going into a pressing motion so it's really just pressing the shoulders forward and then letting the retract and that's just to get good scap and thoracic mobility just allow the slide but as you're pressing up you're actually pushing and creating a little bit of straight and center activation so your works in working specifically on that and then the other one is just here we're just kind of going into whatever you want to call it as almost like a Superman and your with your arms coming up like that obviously that's going to work del toy nor to pieces is going to be a huge component of that and those are all talking and it's really important stabilizing muscles in any timing to you your hands above pen and as we talk in the in the in a little bit weight lifts those are going to be important components and you need to have stability and activation and then coming back into the with cobra position which is obviously good for lower to pcs as well as even the wrong way complex especially when he's in this position we're able to come back lift his shoulders off like this doing so that's just the reason it's just really working around the shoulder girl as we do know that there was some type of shoulder you and again even though we didn't necessarily see something specific happening we have to remember that one he's new to weight lifting he's interested in doing it so we want to make sure that with that shoulder injury he's probably never done some of the things that we're doing so we want to make sure that we can have that stability going into the post sentence. Okay so we've gone through the first couple steps did you have something to add cop I do I do so remember too we talked about James being a little bit immediately rotated and notice who on his cobra how he's going through external glino humoral rotation whenever he does that so that's one of those oftentimes people perform this immediately rotated but definitely with James here we want to be sure we're getting an external rotation the thumbs rotated away from the body and maybe up to the sky to help offset some of that medial rotation we saw on me get us a little bit more rotator cuff activation out of this movement as well. Perfect and so now we've gone through the first couple of steps not just want to remind everyone that this this is important to do because when you're when you're clients are coming to you from off and before they they're bringing with them the stuff from there their their vibes which may be some stress maybe some car rides it may be doing the little cattle roping but you want to for a doctor stall there so you want to to help them take some of that that stress off and help them to create that range of motion to prepare them for work. Now we've worked through the first two steps of the process now or first three steps and we're going to do some new integration exercise well they're not new but in the context of correct exercise rotting can you take us through our integration exercises and tell us why you pick these and what's happening here. Yeah so this this has a couple of reasons so this is a modified kind of muscle clean and so mostly a lot of times it's almost when you're taking the legs out of so speaking you're just pulling the bar through the motion it can be done faster it can be done in this particular case can be done just a little bit slower so one is to create a more of a total body motion that's integrating all of the inhibitory and the lengthening and the activation factor sizes that we've just gone it's now applying it into an actual sequence so he's going to be going through that high pull the inter rotation to kind of an external rotation catch. So that's part of the part is that it's actually teaching him the movement that's going to be involved in a clean so he starts he's basically starting at the hip which is oftentimes called the power position he's going to go into a shrug and then he's going to go into a high pull and then he's going to bring me elbows through when he's going to get into that position so that's the position that he's going to go when he is going to do a plane and so we're it's a teaching exercise as well as it is a range of motion integrated movement exercise to actually put everything together for all right perfect so let's take a look at the second the second integration movement and we have the squat press to thruster why did we pick this one and what we want to accomplish with this particular integrated movement same thing this one now we're just bringing into the lower body so the first one was more of a more of a technique this one is more of a total body integration so where we're going overhead now so we're just going to simply use a squat so getting him used to doing a front squat which will be part of the clean and then getting him to go overhead with the bar so just putting the two together and again it's just in a nice control pace it's actually a great core exercise and so it'd be something that we're just prepared him for what's going to come down the road but getting him activated through his and it is correct to exercise program that we established so it's a way that we're just bringing in some of the movements that they're going to do but breaking them down to where they become integrated components of the correct direction size and how you can leave it to you together okay perfect and yes we're just being through these performed that would you these more of a moderate speed yeah that's a great question of how some more of a moderate speed so these aren't these aren't to be done at full speed because one remember where where he was interested in learning so he probably doesn't know how to do them or doesn't isn't super familiar with the clean in this particular case so just going through a moderate pace so we get the feel for what that's going to happen so a moderate tempo okay great now I just and I have another follow up question to that and then we will get to Lauren for parts of the lift that require I know we had talked back and forth as we were working through these webinars and you mentioned the the drive shrug as as one movement that we could use so for parts of the lift that require some type of some type of explosiveness that triple extension for example do we want to honor that part of the exercise and keep that I don't know how I'm asking this but close to how they would perform that and move slowly possibly through some of the other movements in the lift yes you know and I think at the end of the drive shrug is where they pop up and they're exploding right up into that shrug with elbows locked still so the answer is if the person has done that before then yeah have them pop that up if they're not get them used to go when into a shrug in triple extension at the same time remember when we say triple extension for her ability to get up onto the toes sure so one of the things that works really well is if you can get up onto the toes into triple extension you got your toes knees and hips locked out you basically in that triple extension period or a position and you're activated in that so you're active and engaged like kind of talk about it's not just going through the motion to hoping everything does what you want it to do and call it a day it's getting to that and then getting them used to shrug in at the same time that they're going through that position so it can be a little bit slower so it depends on the person's ability and where they're at okay perfect question yes thank you so now let's let's get to Lauren on our next slide now Lauren's 28 she doesn't have any she doesn't have a adverse medical history but she wants to set a new PR and I've read through this we've talked about this of Rodney this is someone you've worked with can you take us through take us through the process yes so I want to be Lauren Lauren is our education manager at the manager at a lake ocean she is she's personally a former competitive weight after and just an awesome all-around person now as we go through this I want to make it very clear that this is not specific to Lauren's Lauren is going to represent actual case studies that I've seen over the last couple of decades on multiple occasions so I've seen some that are almost identical to what you're going to see in more than than one or two cases it's probably close to half a dozen over the last 20 years so what I'm doing is I had Lauren take some pictures for me that replicated the case studies so we could use this process to specifically show you guys so I want to set that up right off the bat this is not Lauren she's not this jacked up by any means yes and I apologize for even insinuating that Lauren please forgive me but let's go let's go into the case let's say she's got plenty of issues she can run but this is not one of them okay let's take a look at her static posture and what's going on in her transitional assessments let's go Rocky folks you guys can see this static posture and we don't have to pick it apart I mean we can we can touch it with for all of all Lauren is a very good athlete so and and I'm going out from people that I work with I work with people who are very much like Lauren and they've been in the various same situation that's why she was kind of a perfect fit for this particular case study so when we do the overhead spot because she's used to doing the snack and what she wants to do remember her goal is she wants to increase her PR or personal best that she can do for this so what we want to do is I had her I had a lot of people a lot of times when they do it over it's got I'll have him use a dowel rod not that she has to and it's not not an necessity but it gets in something to hold on to so a lot of times you can see there's any discrepancy in the upper arm but when she went through this when might might people that I've seen have gone through this this is something that fold out so when you look it from behind you notice that there's a little bit of asymmetry in the legs so that left knee looks like it's coming in more so than the right knee and then when you look at the hip I brought up a close up because this is something that it almost looks like one of the glutes is dropped down or there's a shifting it's like it's almost like an inferior superior inferior change in the hip height and so it was really interesting so now with the CES flow the assessment flow would be have this is where it becomes very valuable for us so when you see something like this my immediate thought was okay well let's go and start with the first modification so on the next slide we look at the first modification the first modification on the next slide is let's lift the heels now we lifted on a little bit you can obviously lift the more you can lift them in your soul and and Kyle is there a standard that you you guys prefer to have no standard usually inch to an inch and a half is pretty good you know having like a two before something laying around the the gym is great because it's easy access but I don't get confused by the two by four because two by four it's not really two inches by four inches but it's just what goes so on this we just had them on basically a five pound plate so when you look at the left picture you can see that the knee's straightened out and the hips cleaned up a little bit so they're not quite as dramatic still has the hands over head so it looks fairly good so we can think and those of you that are way ahead of this may say and oh maybe this is what's happening well hold on to that because then we took her arms down you can see their hips went back to the way they were the knees stay okay but the hips went back to the way they were so this got really interesting and now again I've seen this happen at least three or four times maybe close to a half it doesn't in this is the same case it wasn't necessarily the left tip in this case but so now we're like okay wow we've got a straight a straighter stance but we still have this hip issue going on and we've modified both things so now I went to the next slide and now I'm just following the floor and I said well let me see what happens on a single leg so single leg or right legs basically muddy and now yes you can put your hands on your hips and there's all those things but when we look at using the same with both legs even though for hands around front the right leg is money that's what you want to see you want to see someone that the pelvis is basically parallel to the floor and their ankle hip and knee are pretty much stacked up the left side is jacked up so we've got an issue with that knee and even though it's not so much that the knee deviates it's actually a little bit of a hip shift and she started to pivot rotate and if you would look from the sighting but what we would see is there was all sitting around you know the low back so that there was basically she was going into a post-serier public tilt as she was going into this position and there's other thing guys have done the same thing but the two females that I had in mind when I'm talking about this so we can see okay there's really something going on with that left side so we noticed there was a little bit of cleanup when we left the heels and then when we took the hands down even with the heels lifted the hips got worse we see that there's something more specific to the left side so then we went one step further and this is what we went into the range of motion assessment so now if we go to the next slide going into the range of motion all I did was used what we would say is a lot of phytometrist test but instead of looking at the hip extension what I wanted to do or what I noticed first is what I should say because originally in the first person I was going through the modified Thomas test but what I noticed before they actually grabbed onto their legs to go onto the modified Thomas test as I noticed this that left hip couldn't come up past 90 degrees but the right hip could so I had them do that a few times and I realized that that left hip can't get up high enough but the right hip can so that led me to and then through goony metric measurements that I had that I had done on the first previous that led me to think there may be something going on with that left hip and it may not necessarily be an ankle situation that refotted in fact it wasn't because the ankle range of motion was great so there's something going on in that hip so I realized that okay there's a left hip situation and what was happening is there was a lack of hip flexion and we always look at and this is what I wanted to really bring up and while I use this particular case study a lot of times you guys and I know that people have made comments that there can be the similar issues with tight and weak muscles in everybody but in many cases that's not the case and that's why you need to have an assessment flow char that leaves you to specific things where you can start looking that left hip did not have the ability to flex as well as the right hip and that was what was happening is because when she would squat down your hip has to go into flexion which means there is an anterior tilt relative to the the femur and that's what's creating the hip flexion when she got the point where she could no longer flex on that left hip she would go into a post anterior tilt and so that means that that left hip would basically stop flexing and the right hip would continue to flex can have the ability to so left hip stops right hip keep going and that's why we saw the overhead squat but where it was and that's why we saw this this hip flexion assessment which is what it turned into this hip flexion range of motion the way it was so going to the next slide what to do the Davies test as a dynamic assessment didn't want to do dynamic with her because obviously that left side had some stuff going on and so there was a great dynamic assessment that you could do for someone who's a little bit looked at could be a squat jump so a squat jump is just going down into a like a quarter squat position and from there they have to jump up and see how high they can go that's giving you basically a concentric explosion how explosive can they get because going from that squat that quarter squat position upward is extremely important you could do a vertical jump you could want to but a lot of times vertical or counter movement using the each centric above before the the constant weight and that means more concentric explosion but because she still wants to do some she's going to be doing a lot of snatching each and one to increase her PR and snatching is taking the bar overhead in one motion just wanted to see how her shoulders stability and how her dynamic movement through the shoulder brutal was so we used a Davies test as well those just don't go with Davies test is it's in a push-up position like you see hands are about 36 inches apart and then your time going back and forth to see how many times you can touch the hands or how many times you can touch your hands in 15 seconds so based upon all that now we have to and you can go to the next slide very best one based upon all that we're going to run through the same process so taking all of this information which which we want to do is to make this corrective exercise very specific when when I've seen these took straight to the left tip so we're not going to go just the whole body and just kind of do everything we're going to go right to that hip and see if we can help clean things up so on the next slide what we did from the inhibitory using the self-bomb bachelor lease Greg on the next slide is went to their glutes and the ad drconplex and people saying well why would you do both sides because the hip wasn't moving and so without getting into all of the the groiny metric stuff what I wanted to do is get to the hip and and see if we could loosen up the the feiner and the ability for that feiner to move in that acetaline and be able to rotate and turn and go into flexion and extension and internal external rotation which you need to have for flexion and extension so we went to that glute and we worked on the backside and we went to the the ad dr. we were staying a little bit higher on the ad drs because don't forget all of your ad drs insert up into that pubis and that pubis is where that anterior capsule also sits for your your hip and all of that tissue to what Kyle was talking about earlier is just because something's not necessarily mechanically short or not necessarily overactive that you may or may not think it is it still could have an influence and that tissue can still have it still be a little bit brungy and so that can still affect how that joint will move besides just the muscular components to that so we rolled the ad drs rolled the hip and in the next slide what we did from a stretch is we just wanted to open up that hip a little bit so we just did kind of a kneeling out of just just opened up that hip a little bit and just had kind of a real subtle motion and and Kyle said it perfectly take it to the point of first tension and and let it do its thing and then we'd come back and we did that and that's all we did on that particular hip and then the next slide from the activation went back to the what you saw on the slide with the activation remember there's position why some metrics and then there's kind of the the isometric exercises so we did a position why symmetric on this particular tip and so on this one and how quickly if I'm wrong but is a so I symmetric is basically four repetitions the first one 25 and then the following 50 75 100 is that still the the process and process to understand it yet yeah so we use something very similar to that but what we wanted to do is hold that for about five seconds five to six seconds is what we held that for each one and then release and then have her bring it up as high as it can go and as you can see and and Lauren actually did a great job representing that that hip dramatically increased its ability to to go into flexion just by going through that position why symmetric process so we use this to help activate the tissue that wasn't able to actively pull her into that position so remember we weren't doing it and I successfully like a hamstring and says what does he can she actually get that hip up and she couldn't provide the one was and it was fatigue and it was almost like it was fatigue and on her so we just wanted to activate that then we used a side plank and we just integrated a hip flexion motion with the side plank and very simply with now this one's on the on the right hip but we were we did it on both sides because on the right hip she's getting that left hip flexion but remember when I'm in that that side plank position and I'm moving that left hip through flexion and then back down into a straight position extension then I drop down come back up and do repetitions of that I still have to hold that hip up and abduction as I'm going through flexion so I'm still getting the abductor's group media's TFL to still work because they're both flexures so you're you're anterior opponent I started a glutinous and then horses of beauty also flex to hip as well as the TFL so we're getting some abduction strength and the reason we're looking at that is because when she was on a single leg stance doing her single leg squat she was having a lot of trouble with that left side and the overhead squat we noticed that left leg cave in a little bit but left knee when she was on a single leg there was the knee looking like it was abducting and the hip was actually shifting out so therefore potentially could have been some weakness in that so that's why we chose those two particular exercises try to increase the activation of the hip flexion component and then be able to work on the abduction as well as some deflection in this particular pace refer and then it's going to integrate it exercise we did just a very simple movement that has to do for a snatch and that was just an open-heat squat so it's a great exercise just in and of itself and if you were to take that exercise that in the corrective exercise program that we just went through and did it on yourself you would immediately notice and if you just did it on one side not the other side you would immediately notice a difference in that side that you worked on and so that would be my challenge to is go through that as you'll see what she experienced and the people that I work with because what then happened is she was able to move much better in her overhead squat and so in this particular overhead squat all we did is we would go down and when she would get to the point where she could be comfortable and we'd have hold her hold it there for a couple of seconds just to get the tissues accramated to holding in that position and then have her stand up tall and then come back down and do that so that was the corrective exercise that we did in this particular case and that's how it was it was able to help this particular set of people I worked with regained proper movement and it was fairly quick and in two of the people's cases it was almost immediate where they had a pretty dramatic change in your ability to squat and get back to where they go needed to go that's it all right outstanding so when you're doing the overhead squat as an integration exercise you're still using the same volume 12 round 12 repetitions of that exercise yes so again that'll go back to what you want to do so if if the person can't do the 12 you either do a dowel rod or do a variety of things you can do a in between every repetition you could take one or two seconds of rest and then do it again or you could do three three repetitions rest for a second or two three repetitions rest for a second or two so if you're looking to get to that 12 rep then you would have to potentially break it up depending on how strong a person is and how much load you're using hopefully you're not using too much of a load to where they can't get to 12 so that's where the dowel rod can be extremely important because it's not about being under load as much as it is about performing the actual integrated motion but having the dowel rod keeps the hands and the position that you want to which will put tension to the whole system which is going to look before and it makes them have to squat in the position that they're going to need to when they're doing a snatch in one yeah and just wanted to pick up on that really quickly hand positions obviously different because we're training this in the context of Olympic weight lifting just tell us real quickly about how one would set up for a snatch grip yes so in a snatch grip one of the easiest ways is you just hold the bar and you're going to bring your hands out on that bar and tell the bar gets to about the crease of your hip and so all you have to do is if you're holding that bar if you were to lift one leg in flexure leg up you should be able to flex the leg without the bar being moved and that's one of the easiest ways to do it so you can lift up your legs and make sure that the grip is wide enough and so that's the easiest way to get the width that would be proper for you and your body position by the size relative to the bar okay thank you and that program that program that you laid out there just goes to show you that the you know the possibilities are endless and you really have to put your detective hat on and don't don't yourself in and thinking everything is a type hip flexor and we don't we never want to do anything activate those hip flexors because as you all can see there that was that was the solution to to getting this athlete to move optimally for the the snatch so we are at the end of the webinar today and yes doctor still you had a point one of the things I wanted to say is whenever we were talking about that assessment flow I had talked about how with you if you see a compensation here you can move on to your programming but I think what Ronny just went through there was a beautiful example of how you use the next test instead of jumping to the programming prematurely perhaps use that next test to get more information and it's important to see that Lauren had the physical ability to perform the test safely and it matched her goals so if that's your client continue and you have the time and everybody's on the same page you can continue using those assessments to dig deeper in or for on your wooden app you probably wouldn't have identified that specific specific cause if you will and also led to him being able to to put together a program to correct it very quickly so nice shot yes so thank you both that was that was very informative and I hope everyone out there listening at least took away several nuggets that you can implement immediately when you're training yourselves because you're your first client and also when you're out there working with your clients again right now it's time for a little bit of Q&A so if you have questions please type them in and before I ask these gentlemen to give us their main takeaways for you today you can say 35% on the new CES course using the code webinar 21 that is a phone only code and you'll have to call 88877318272 redeemed that discount and you can also say 50% on a lake or a parallel and equipment using the code capital N8SM lower code web 15 and go to strengthware.us to redeem that discount and while we're waiting for questions gentlemen do you have any takeaways what's up start with you yeah they printed you touched on one of the biggest takeaways is number one there is an assessment flow to allow you and all your methods all go through and gather information on someone's movement in a capability or you know the more you can do with that and I think that's really important and the need for continued to continue growth but don't ever think because most things look a certain way I hit flexor is the one that's everyone wants to stretch it and poke it and prod it and do it it sometimes it's not a set of what's actually going on so just have an open mind and don't be stuck in that because you can have you can make some great gains with people by exploring options using a process to allow you to go to two different areas and continue to get more education around how the body works and how and what the assessments are actually showing you. All right great thank you and before I get to you Kyle we have a question from Joel thank you for attending today Joel he wants to know with Lawrence case did you notice any specific trigger points that were active or troublesome so it's a great question so remember I've seen this a few times one of the areas that had the the most probably trigger point activity was in the boot area there was boot needus and that's an area that many people kind of your posterior boot medius and between the issue and the the greater trail canter there's usually a really hot spot there was that and there was also some in the pure formus region those were two really big hot spot so no so was in the ad dr complex while there wasn't a lot of trigger point activity after the full roll so personally what I'll do is I'll have someone do a full and do some type of boot again and do the fun walkers I want to see if one is helping more than the other because what we want to do is we want to go down to what exactly do I have to do what's the most important thing to do not just do everything out of and hope some work and while the trigger point activity was more helpful from the backs are more more apparent back it was actually rolling that front of the hip of the ad dr complex and loosen that up that actually freed that hip up to move and that's a whole other webinar in the self is to something in that area would do that but that's what it was from a trigger point standpoint posterior hip and tear forms and on the trigger points too you know and need to keep in mind that the body's very intelligent a lot of times it puts those trigger points there for a reason so we can't just just always think well if there's a trigger point we we got a release so we got a release it so I think like you know what Rodney saying they're going after the anterior aspect of the hip you do that enough and improve that that that illegal firm remote motion the trigger points may actually just go away the body doesn't need them anymore. You're on mute. You're on mute. No longer on mute can everyone hear me. Yes sir. All right perfect and we have a question from Arash and he wants to know and thank you for attending today Arash for otherwise healthy person who reps and steps for these correct effects or sizes if used for technique building prior to lifting I think this one's going to be for you Rodney and when lifting or when doing the Olympic weight lifting how many reps and sets should you go for? I'll defer to Kyle for the an SM kind of corrected exercise set and reps scheme for the perfect healthy person if that was the question from a corrected exercise standpoint and then I can talk to the Olympic weight. Sure. Yeah so we need to think of this from a a little bit of a endurance perspective but as well as a for lack of a better term a perfection perspective so in the text we we often encourage or suggest between 12 I'm sorry between 10 to 15 reps and then on some of the integrated exercises we may get into the phase one endurance where we talk about 12 to 20 reps but one of the most important things to keep in mind from a corrective standpoint is we need perfection in the movements so don't set a goal of your client of 12 reps and then they do whatever they need to do compensator not to get to 12 reps if they can only do six reps with great form and then they then they compensator sheet stop them at six reps and in the next set they try to get seven and they try to get a so we have them laid out in the text but but work with your client and make sure they're going through the movement for an emotion without cheating doing as many reps as they can. And I just want to tag on about that's a huge point that so many people they look at the set reps came sometime and they're oh I've got to get that if the client can't get it it doesn't matter. So what can they do and what can they do effectively? Frances, what was the question relative to the Olympic look? Yes you wanted to know when you're Olympic weight lifting how many reps and sets should you go for? Well that's going to be dependent obviously on the person's ability to level and what they have so it could be anywhere from two sets to six sets it could be eight sets it depends on how much other stuff they're doing and what specifically you're working on. Rep stand point usually because the skill component of the Olympic list the usually the reps are going to be a little bit lower more than not you don't need to really go over six repetitions because again it's going to go back to because it's a a more skilled movement you want to make sure that it's done correctly and not just done to or to 1,000 just talked about. So in relation to the two to six sets and up to six reps anywhere from one to six reps depending on what you're working on is a pretty safe ballpark. All right thank you and Kyle do you have any takeaways for our listeners today? I do so what I said earlier about the the assessments so so work with the individual that's in front of you and sometimes even though we provide the assessment flow to be some flistic and efficient and effective sometimes you need to dig a little bit deeper and then also to Rodney's point about and don't think of as only coming from a book or a course a lot of this education is the experience of working with clients the only way you'll be able to recognize some of these little nuances of movement that require additional testing is if you just start working with people it's not going to be perfect at first and that's okay you may miss a few people up hopefully not but it's not going to be perfect but you'll just reassess and redesign but just just start working with people. Yes practice you have practice experiences of really good teacher because you have to have a way to synthesize everything that you get from your mentors your books and the additional courses. That's all the time we have and I almost finished on time today so thank both I want to thank both of you for for hopping on and educating us and helping us learn how to implement the corrective exercise into Olympic weight lifting and we have I have one more one more daily gentleman and we're going to put it all together into a program. We're going to do a little program design on Monday taking you through all three levels of the OTT model and that should be fun that's one that you don't want to miss thank you rotting thank you Kyle and again course and thank you for everyone who hung up with us this afternoon everyone have a good afternoon and a safe weekend.
