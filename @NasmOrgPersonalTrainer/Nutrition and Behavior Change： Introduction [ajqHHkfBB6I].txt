Hello and welcome to How to Form Nutrition Habits. I'm registered dietitian Dr. Chris Moore and I'm behavior change expert Dr. Karam Moore. Together we work with clients to not only educate them about nutrition but we coach them on how to put practical nutrition strategies into practice until they become lifelong habits. As more of the reviewers and editors of the NASM Nutrition Certification, I knew this video series would be one that we will receive by trainers working so hard to help clients reach their goals. One is that work for them and with them without challenging their identity. Now what we'll explain with that means how do you work with someone to figure out their identity and how does that align with their goals? Too often when we're working with somebody we try to instill our own goals on them. Eat this, don't eat that or do this, don't do that. With just like every single person who will be training isn't immediately rushed over and put under a barbell to do a set of squats, not everyone walks into your gym will have the same outcome goals or strategies to get them there when it comes to nutrition. This video series will help identify some of the important steps within the process of creating habits. How do you build positive ones? How do you teach clients to unlearn the negative ones? The end, what is the power of teaching clients to address their own sense of identity so that they can make small changes that will ultimately add up to big results? We'll pair this information with specific nutrition tips, tools and strategies that we've used with our own clients to help them reach their goals. These short videos were created in order to build upon one another. Almost like habit stacking, a concept will discuss in a future video and also as a way to complement the information that's contained within both the nutrition and behavior change certification programs that NASM offers. Thanks for joining us and we'll see you in the next video.
