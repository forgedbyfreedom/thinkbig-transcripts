Alright, so with the series, we talked about practical strategies to best help your clients. What we use nutrition examples to highlight how some of these can be put into practice, the truth is these same strategies for building habits works for any habit you want to build. Or, it's all to the curve. What we do know is to keep any long-term success, whether that is run nutrition, exercise, or, well, anything is building slowly over time, progress over perfection. Consider this with your clients and even apply it to your own behaviors. Changing habits can feel really challenging, but with the right amount of awareness and support, we can craft the behaviors to help us achieve the goals and outcomes that we want to achieve and become who we'd like to become. Let us know how it's working for you and how we can help you along your journey. Thank you for watching.
