Hi, I'm Ken Lowe with the National Academy of Sports Medicine and I'm here with Kerming the right of the Syrian performance and we're at the training station here in California and this video is going to be about the movement preparation for a novice rider. I say novice rider not just a rider who is new to running but maybe a runner who is starting to implement a training conditioning or a fitness training plan to compliment their running outside. So when you start off with a little bit of old-roll and we're getting into a stretch going to a balance as well as a climactic and right here we have Kerming up already on a hyper-rice biber and she is getting the glute-meas, glute-max and mostly the pure formus is what we're trying to work on as far as getting those hip-rootators to relax a little bit with dependent emotions one of the things that tends to get tight are hip-rootators especially combined with prolonged sitting. That's an area that you do want to address so in that spot she's been on it for a little bit and she's going to be basically looking for a relaxation a decrease in tension so she's down the spot a tender area she wants to sit there until she's got about 50 to 60 percent of decrease in tension and then once that happens we can add in a little bit of mobility technique to it so while she's still on that same spot we'll see her that she's dying and he out and bringing it back in and that way we're kind of moving the tissue on top of the biber there and then once you get to a few reps of that then she can go and we will recall a little shrugging so she's just applying a little bit of cross friction onto the biber and just again more or less just trying to get that tissue to mobilize a little bit. So once we do that and as soon as we get that on the other it now it's time to get a static stretch so as the novice base or a beginner programmer the goal typically is going to be about stabilization up to my dim posture and posture endurance a lot of times we're trying to address postural imbalances or muscular balances so that he has to do time and get tight. So what we're going to do here for the piriformist stretch we're going to put her right angle on the left quad now keeping her low back flat on the ground she's just going to go ahead support the lower part of that knee and then she's going to pull it up and across so that right knee's going to come up towards that left shoulder. As far as she can as long she's feeling a little stretch across that back pocket now the one thing you want to be aware of is some people again they're tight in the front of the hip they might be inclined to feel a little bit of a pinch in the front so one if they can pull up in a cross as far as they can feel a little bit of tension a little tissue tension in that back pocket of that right hip and not go as far as she can without feeling that pinch but as she feels a long way before she feels a stretch we might need to do a little bit of corrective word to loosen up the front of it which might mean so my fast technique on the front a knee hip what's a stretch like I'm doing right now of that up and then she can go ahead and revisit this so from this position here she'll just apply stretch about 30 seconds hopefully there'll be a little bit of decrease the significant decrease and tension in that posterior hip perfect now we would go into a four-rich-list position but what we'll do a little fast-forward you to a balanced exercise so that's all ready to be active in the hips but about 12-15 reps really slow and then get her nice and burglals where an option will work on her balance so front here she's going to bounce on the leg and she's going to get a nice flex softly flex a minute hit nice athletic position you'll see here she drives at the up and then she's going to go ahead and bring it out nice and easy back in and then she's going to get that foot to the next two but not touch the ground and she's going to repeat up to the side little rotation back to center and then now what I'm doing is I'm watching how for a nice little spine nice legs and the knee from watching the front I'm looking for a hit in the toe line shoulders level of this level your shoulders pits all in line look at one more as that feeling alright and no surprise that you know on that balance later that's down the stance leg they might feel a little bit of activation in the glutes right because there's a lot going on as far as keeping everything nice and level of the course with that changing center gravity that blue on that stance leg has to be quite a bit now for a little bit of a plyometric work we're going to do a split squat jump with stabilization and kindness a split squat jump with the stabilization so we might have started her with a squat jump feet level or even and jumping up and holding but to add all the variation we're just going to split squat her and from here I can watch it in the toe stay in line and then I'm just going to have her jump good swing all two to three seconds and then she's going to go ahead and repeat up now stay the landing make whatever just you need to make the minute this is the first time doing it you might get a little wiggle in there good foot nice and flat landing on the ball of foot on that bad leg good angle little trunk and the shin perfect and relax alright so as far as incorporating a movement trap strategy we really want to consider what's happening with the lower body so this movement practice gives bias more towards that novice or that beginner client who's trying to implement stabilization strategies into the workout program so if you haven't worked with a movement trap strategy for running specifically give this a try or if you're already doing something but haven't hired this sequence just yet put this into a program in the world can let us know how you like it so we know you're going to feel a little bit different if you're trying this and you haven't been before we just because what it does for the hips as far as we're true men range of motion and all like and stuff so let us know how you like it thanks for watching we say
