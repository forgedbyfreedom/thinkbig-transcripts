The National Academy of Sports Medicine's OPPT model uses an integrated progressive training system. This includes all aspects of fitness, including balance. Balance is divided up into balanced stabilization, balance strength, and balance power. Many times after an injury, the proprioception in a joint is diminished. Therefore, balance training can help to re-establish and reinforce that proprioception in the joint. Balance stabilization is primarily used in phase 1. Here are our goal list to maintain perfect form. We want to be sure they can maintain control of the arch, keep the knee in alignment, and keep the proper position of the hips. This could include exercises as simple as a single leg balance, and maybe a single leg balance with the reach with the opposite leg. Again, the goal is maintaining proper form. Here we want to challenge the client's balance threshold. So what we would do is take them to a position where they can barely maintain proper form. Maybe you asked them to come down into a third or maybe a half of a squat, which challenges them a little bit more. As we progress to phases 2, 3, and 4, we're going to use balance strength. Here we're going to focus more on that dynamic aspect of balance. So again, we're going to be on one leg, maintaining proper form, but we're moving through a range emotion. These exercises could be a single leg squat, maybe a single leg box step up. As we progress to phase 5, we're going to move to balance power. Here our goal is to focus on controlling that desoloration for the body on one leg. Our exercise is maybe a single leg hot or maybe a single leg box jump, where we hold that landing for 3 to 5 seconds. That 3 to 5 second hold allows us to control our form to be sure that we're reinforcing proper form.
