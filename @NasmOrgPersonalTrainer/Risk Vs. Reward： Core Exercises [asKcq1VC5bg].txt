Good afternoon everyone and welcome to NAS and live. I'm Prentice and as always I'm here with Wendy and Marty and how are both of you doing this afternoon. Fantastic. And we have the man in the middle which is kind of foreshadowing our topic today. The man in the middle is Greg keeping everything running today and he salutes everybody and of course welcome to everyone who has decided to give up your time and join us today. So what we're going to talk about is the core. We're going to talk about core exercises. Risk versus reward. Now this isn't like a journey to the center of the earth but Wendy can you take us to the center of our bodies and tell us some of the most optimal ways we can we can train our core. Absolutely. So again thanks for for having us and last week we spoke a lot about the upper body resources for reward. Obviously today we're going to spend some time specifically on core exercises and then next week we're going to do some lower body for you guys to hopefully old tune in for those as well. But when we're really thinking about the core you know we want to think about basically first of all what is the core and so when you think about the core oftentimes people will think the core is just mainly the abs and as we know there's a lot more that goes into the core. So basically it's your cervical spine your lung bar spine your thoracic spine and basically if you remove your arms and your legs everything else would make up your core that's the easiest way to kind of visualize it. And so when we're thinking about and showing you and discussing some of these exercises today we want you to keep that in mind because there really is a purpose for different exercises that are going to some get into the really small exercises that protect the vertebrae and then there's other muscles that help move the entire spine and then some that add you know the movement as well as as a power component that's that's how the NASM OFT model is lined up and that's why we kind of put it in different stages because there really is a purpose. And as always you know we want to maintain the five-connected chain checkpoints with every exercise that we do. What that is again as a recap is that the feet are pointed straight ahead. Your feet positioning is about shoulder to hip with a part. Your knees are going to be in line with the second and third toe. Your hips are going to be a neutral. Shoulders are neutral and as well as your head. So you want to try to think when we show you and discuss some of these exercises look at the positioning of the individuals because everything that we discussed today we did provide a visual and so another key thing I want to point out before we really dive into this is that we're not saying you cannot do exercises. We are just especially on this one because we are providing very common exercises but we are showing you a lot of compensations or misinformation that is associated with some of these exercises and you know you think you may be working your abs but you're really working your hip flexors and stuff like that. So we want to kind of open it up for you to really think about the exercise what the prime mover is and hopefully if you have questions you'll join in and ask us along the way. So what that being said too we're going to discuss before we dive too deep and what is the difference between drawing in and bracing and going ahead and let you take that part. Sure so the great thing is there's been a lot of talk over the years about you know core activation what the right techniques are and what we just really want to do here from the very beginning of this webinar is kind of set the foundation it's try to maybe eliminate some confusion because there's a lot of people that would be in the drawing in camp or there's a lot of people that why brace so we want to kind of just get that out of the way and discuss it. So when he talks about the five kinetic chain checkpoint so first and foremost we have to be in a neutral pelvis neutral spinal position. You guys all know how to do that but just as a quick refresher if you're looking at your ASIS or those you know bony perturbrant on the front of your hip and then you have your PSIS at the same position in the back of your pelvis they need to be level. I always like to teach it that if I go into an anterior tilt the water is falling out of the front of the bowl if I was looking at my you know pelvis as a bowl of water post your tilt as I tilt backwards water would fall out of the back of the bowl neutral would be where I can maintain water in the bowl and that's a great teaching cue for your clients. So once we're in neutral then what do we do and do we draw and do we brace? Well again that's the beautiful thing of the OPT model a lot of this is taking care of four you but let's really dissect it. So when we're doing stabilization training we're trying to establish proper human movement we're trying to teach people how to maintain neutral spine why they do other activities pushes and pulls and squats and lunges in that neutral position but the load is not very heavy so that's where we teach neutral spine with that slight draw in. You only have to draw your belly button in a tiny little bit it's not you know howling out your stomach and really burning that diaphragm into it because that's now you're having your diaphragm stabilize your spine we're looking at just activating the transverse abdominis. That muscle it wraps around that portion of your core. So a small drawing in now the key thing is you should be able to breathe naturally as you're in a drawn in position then you know someone's doing it properly. So that's what we teach first in stabilization. Well guess what? Bracing there's a lot of research that it works and it's great. Well it is it's great in your strength phase. So you've got the intrinsic stabilizers that we're talking about in the stabilization training then you've got your global stabilizers that are the muscles that don't connect your spine. They will naturally contract as you lift to heavier load. You don't have to think about it. So yes as I'm picking up heavier loads in the strength and power phase yes I do need more than the deep intrinsic core stabilizers to safely guard my spine so I can handle what I'm doing. But the key point is if I have not taught someone to find neutral and draw in I would be then bracing on a spine that's not in a neutral position. So that's where they both have a purpose but let's just layer them appropriately and that's why we went in and every instructor will always go back to the model that you've got to earn the right to go to those other levels and that's what we're working on in that corrective exercise and or stabilization endurance so that way when you're ready you're drawn in you're in a neutral position and then you pick up those heavier loads your body will naturally brace in the right position. So as Marty you said a lot of important things there and I want to make sure that that everyone gets them and just for context for those of you who are listening out out there when we talk about what what the core is it is windy you said this very early on but the core is a combination of upward of 20 plus 20 plus muscles that all provide spine stability they age you with movement and and various and various other functions. Now let's go back to what you were talking about with the draw in and Marty can you just take us through the technique because you mentioned the diaphragm but I also see people too when they teach the draw in and we're doing very basic level of pelvic stability exercises or trinced stability exercises I see a lot of posterior pelvic tilt's using that that internal will leak to compensate so just talk us you said it please repeat it so everyone gets it. So we're looking at neutral spine again when you look at a skeleton this how I always visualize it a neutral spine doesn't mean I've been hated the curves in the spine it just means my pelvis is in a level position and again the terminology is that we're going to try to find neutral spine now I'm not trying to change that terminology just like we foam roll our IT band and we in a previous webinar talked about am I really foam rolling my IT band I know that I'm controlling my pelvis what happens to my spine inside my pelvis I don't have much control over in the sense right I can't move those vertebrae without my pelvis so really what I'm doing is rolling the pelvis so I'm not in an anterior tilt where my belly button would be pointing down I'm not in that anterior tilt where I'm tucked under I'm leveling the anterior in post you know so um anterior post here iliac spine so they're level so that way now of course your long bar spine is still going to have its natural or dot occur but it's not excessive and I think one of the things friends should you might be talking about too is we've heard people get into a flat back position where whether they're on the floor or they're against the wall they post their tilt and eliminate that arch and they think that is sometimes neutral that's not that is a pose to your tilt then from there if you draw in yes you're still activating your transverse abdomus but you haven't done it in that neutral spinal position so we're looking for the proper firing the transverse abdominis when you are in a neutral position which is that leveling of the pelvis so I hope I answered that a little bit more no you you answered it perfectly now and another important thing that you talked about that I whenever you want to get before we move on is that it's way in which you use these techniques whether it's drawing in or bracing it happens along the continuum and if we're having to a bracing should be something once you're under load your your brain should do that for you automatically and to the extent that you can't do that that means maybe we missed a step in our stabilization training we're not doing anything with our bridges learning to contract the glutes we don't we don't realize there's a pelvic floor there that that needs to be that's the bottom the bottom of the floor the core uh Dr. Susan's gonna call me any minute now to do some rhymes for the book but just talk about what goes into that once we start to move along to the continuum what are some other core exercises that all wrap up into bracing? Well you know it's funny, premise of glad you brought this up so in prepping for today's webinar as it did generally this morning and you know I have my routine and I go through and I knew what I was supposed to do but I I want to things I'm like you know I hope this comes up in today's webinar and I'm glad you made me think of this every single exercise I do is a core stabilization exercise every single exercise as I go through my routine if I mentally engage and focus on the process I get myself set in the five kinetic change checkpoints make sure I'm neutral make sure I'm drawn in and then I mentally prepare for whatever exercise I'm gonna do whether it's a stability exercise the strength or a power so we really you know sometimes I've had clients pass go we didn't do core today I'm like it's all we did in the sense that if I'm pushing if I'm pulling if I'm squatting if I'm lunging if I'm doing everything I'm making everything a core exercise even today was more of a traditional strength day for me and I was doing pressing the first thing I did was ensure that my core and my five kinetic change checkpoints were in order before I even do a traditional pressing motion so you know I just want to reiterate that every exercise should be a core stabilization exercise regardless of what else you're doing in the model okay and I'll have a question on that a little bit later and that that revolves around direct core work so but we want to keep moving so tell us about those those tricky lower abs can you tell me where they are when well yeah I mean so again you know you tell me I mean you know yeah and so that's one of the reasons we want to talk about this too because oftentimes you know people are like oh I want to focus on my lower abs and you know and I hate it to say this but they're looking to reduce the pooch and so you know and we talked about this in our lower body you know you can't spot reduce and so you can crunch and you can do all these exercises all day long but you're really not you're going to strengthen some of the muscles under there for sure but if you're looking for a six pack doing a thousand crunch is not going to make that appear you have to actually look at your diet and look at your entire program when you're going to do doing this and you're doing a program together okay so you know Marty Marty was the one that I'm really wanted to talk a lot about the lower abs so I again I don't want to still a lot of his thunder so Marty you want to you want to enlighten us guys just to get you sometimes we joke and know it's so obvious but there's such such an under you know a misnomer I guess you'd say in people that come in and work you know want to work with us you know again they think they want to work their lower abs and again we just need to truly understand the anatomy and the phases of training and how to have a great progressive core workout that goes from stabilization to strength and power and multi-planar and getting people to understand how to truly work with their core and really why the core stabilization is such an important power of everything we do because they want to get right in their start doing again all those crunches in the things that they think are going to spot reduce and this kind of when you're going to slide forward leads us to that next point of the stronger ab you know prevents back pain and I know when you and you and I were talking about this and I worked in a country club where I had a lot of golfers that were in that senior population and you know they were tired of the back hurting so the only thing they thought that they knew how to do was why do 500 crunches a day and I do and I'm like oh that's not necessarily the way to prevent a back injury so you know I know when you've worked so much in therapy and with elite sports and I know you've probably seen the exact same thing with that misconception of how to get a stronger or healthier back exactly and you know when you when you say it that way I mean that that brings us back again to the assessment look at the assessment and look at you know look at how your client or yourself is moving and look at all of the compensations and then make note of that and then look at the muscles that are causing those compensations and allowing those compensations and even if it's in the lower you know lower extremities it really can affect what's happening at the lower back and so by strengthening you know and as Marty said doing a bunch of crunches you know if you're so as as overactive which attaches to all the lumbar spine and they have a huge interior pelvic tilt is that really an exercise they should be doing and in the answer to that in the very beginning is no and so again looking at the phases at the model they all serve a purpose because you'll again to notice there's little to no joint and spine motion in phase one and that's really to work on the inner vertebrate stability which as you mentioned Marty are the really small muscles that really help align the vertebrate and keep it in that perfect alignment before you start adding that movement you know and flexion and extension so so you know when we say that you know abs you really want to have strong abs but you want to have a strong core and as for suspension there's proxy 29 muscles that make up the core so if you get those to activate first and then you add movement you're actually going to decrease some ones back pain but you're also looking at it as an entire program by foam rolling and stretching yeah because there's our muscles that need to be stretched and foam rolling and then you're activating the other muscles to help realign your body back into again our first point of the five kinetic chain checkpoints for ideal motion and movement and then of course that also brings us to the last point which is what is the end goal and you know we've talked about this obviously last week and we'll talk about this again next week but you have to know the purpose of your program what you know when a client sits down and they tell you that they really want to look amazing you know or they want their torso to look amazing meaning they want to have the six pack abs and they want to have you know good good movement and feel better and look better you know really look at again the assessment and we keep going back to that but you need to know the purpose of why you're designing the program and then as we're going to discuss moving forward think about the purposes of the exercises that we're going to talk and and then let us help kind of guide you and think through some of these exercises when you know when should it be implemented into a program should it be completely taken out because of certain things we talk about today or you know should you include them in your program and maybe you haven't thought about about it so. Okay so let's talk about let's talk about the first movement this is everyone's gold standard this is the crunch and speaking of the core that I can see that we're training maybe in each of these variations we're training maybe a quarter of our core muscles so tell us what's happening here. Yes and again when we say this we're not saying that you cannot do crunches and we're not saying that they are a bad exercise so I really want to really pinpoint that one statement because that people are going to be like oh we heard this webinar and any of us says don't do crunches and any of us is not saying that I'm not saying that I'm not saying that and princess you're not agreeing with that what we're trying to get you to think about is what muscle are you targeting or supposed to be targeting when you perform a crunch and if you're doing a crunch correctly you should really be focusing on your rectus abdominis and so Marty do you want to kind of take us through these these positions? Yes the reason I want you to I selected these pictures is there's a little bit that we can look at in each one so let's just first focus on the rectus abdominis what it does it if you have max motion which you piece of process I'm going to people are limited in the you know extensibility of the rectus abdominis you have the ability to your spine from each direction 30 degrees so as soon as you pass 30 degrees there has to be a shift in the muscle you let sure that you're targeting to get into the rest of that flexion so as we talked about most people are in a flex position anyways so again you when you really want to target the rectus abdominis which is not a problem to do when it's appropriate keep it to that 30 degrees now if you want a stability ball yes you can get some extra range motion because you if they have the extensibility but even when you come past neutral you still only have 30 degrees so after that you're definitely getting engaged your hip flexors which again we've talked about it so many times most people don't need to target their hip flexors and again when you mentioned it those hip flexors attach on the transverse process of your last five lumbar vertebrae so they create a shear force so if we're trying to protect the back as a lot of people would do to choose these exercises you don't want those muscles activating and pulling and creating a shear force on your lumbar spine same thing goes for the cervical spine so the reason that when you and I chose the second picture of the female client here you can see that the form of technique looks pretty good in a core but you can already see her sternal clitoromastoid firing and the one rule I've always had when I first learn these techniques or when I bring in crunches when it's appropriate someone says I can't do crunches my next always saw that's a huge indicator or an assessment that they're using the wrong muscles right because the muscles in their course should be stable first so they can maintain their position in of their head so and then when you see the other two picture of the gentleman they're both going into different levels of flexion of the hip so again risk first reward now again I know parenthesis is probably gonna throw the curve all at when you end this one so I'll jump ahead if appropriate right and someone's nice and stable mix martial artists they need to be strong to come up off the ground they're willing to do these type of exercises against resistance because that's very important to their sport especially if it's not a standing striking only type of sport so gymnast jujitsu yes you need to be strong in this at all times but again remember we don't always play sports because they're good for a sorethopedically so you gotta balance that out but if you have somebody that that's not their goal you know maybe you have a senior person who want to be able to get up and off the ground so there will be a time to do these just dissect the exercise what am I trying to accomplish what is those muscle groups actually do and if I change that range of motion what am I allowing to now contribute to that motion and I'm glad that you brought that up about about jujitsu because I'm in a unique position in that I do teach teach jujitsu classes but I also take some of the athletes there and I do a little I help them with their programming and what I always do is move them out of the special depending on the game that you play in jujitsu you spend a lot of time already in spinal flexion your hip flexors are already firing so if we do any of those exercises they're used in the context of SAC exercise it's appropriate for the sport but when we do our exercise training outside of the outside of the dojo it's moving them out of that and making it stay true to what we kind of what we teach you absolutely what we teach here with the OPT model absolutely yeah and I would just go to throw into when we say alternative again we're not saying not to do any of the crunches but as Marty mentioned you know think of your range of motion before you start fire some of these other muscles that maybe weren't meant to be targeted in the actual exercise and you're basically your approach and so again we're not saying not to do a crunch it's just think about the importance of the five kinetic change at points and and then you know why why you're having someone do some of this stuff and one of my favorite alternatives is a standing crunch with the rope so my head can be in the right position and I have to control my long bar spine in a neutral position doesn't take a lot of weight but if I'm going to go into that flexion I like the fact that as the weight pulls back or my client I'm really focusing that lumbar stabilization so again just a different way to think about doing a crunch doesn't always have to be lying on the ground yeah I would go ahead Wendy I was just going to say and remember ideally you know we we kind of bring in the crunches starting in phase two so you know we would have spent you know anywhere from four to six weeks performing exercises again with little to no joint motion to make sure that we don't have the forward head and we don't have any of the compensations and so you know if you want to do the bicycle type type you know exercises or whatever to target your rectusodomas as well as the hip flexors because again if a muscles overactive it's still weak and so we're not saying that you're never going to have to train these muscles it's just again looking for ideal range of motion and making sure that your client is prepared for something like this maybe not to that extreme but prepared to do it correctly in order to to get the most out of it and right and since we have some kettlebell users here one thing that I like to do in place of that is the half-gett-up half-gett-up to the elbow which is a that that has a couple of different movement patterns and it's it's if you can get it it's a good alternative to just doing crunches it's good to add it to a box perfect well then it raises yeah to the the hanging leg raises and I love watching this at the gym and as you can see the picture of this gentleman performing a hanging leg raise you know his his lower back looks fantastic and this is a great exercise for your hip flexors however we were talking about the core so Marty do you want to talk a little bit on that before I go and back to why most people do this is due to the fact that they think they're working the lab which myself Wendy and Princess not located yet again it's just your rectus of the hominous so we can't spot reduce now again this could be done well so the limiting factors here are going to be too full you have the hanging leg raise or where people are in the you know the elevated position but now I see a lot of times the compressive forces because they don't have the civilization in their shoulders to maintain that position on their elbows so both can be inherently risky or hard for the person because they may not be strong enough to hang or support themselves in one of the other positions now could somebody do this right and work their rectus abdominis that 30 degrees that I talk about absolutely but again when your legs are further out extended from you think about leverage so now you've got the biggest muscle group in the most weight in your body in your legs and you're extending your legs which now means the folk room which is your lower back and lower person of your abdominals are really going to be under a lot of stress so if you can do it make sure that they're safe with either the hanging position of the suspended position and then also start with the knees bent because now you've eliminated all that extra strain and stress on a low back and if you can do it properly you should only see the long bar spine flex that 30 degrees but if you see their back straight and they're only going up and down into hip flexion how much rectus abdominis are you doing besides you know indirectly so again it can be done it's it's a great exercise if appropriate and if done with ideal form and technique the majority of people though are not executing it the way that we would like so let's play that's play a little already yes this person here this person here wants to do this exercise no matter what and if you don't let him do it he's going to move to a van down by the river how does he what what what is some things that you would do to regression sure not it's a great logic to that point so I was thinking about this too so we always have ways to progress to regress this is a more of an advanced form and technique and again I already said how when you're ready to do this you would start with an easement so if I was going all the way back after stabilization one you'd start on the ground now here's the way I like to do it I like if I can find a small stability ball to have them support their legs on and I actually have them dig their heels into a little bit to get a little the hamstring flex you know firing because then they're quad and hip flexor may not fire as much due to reciprocal inhibition and it also helps physically guide them into that arching motion it's a very you know it's not a heavy it's not a medicine ball if you need to regress it even from there you could use like a decline bench and use gravity to your assistance to help teach that queuing where gravity's helping then you can go flat then you could tip the bench and go against gravity so a lot of progressions and regressions that you can do and there may be even more than that those are just three simple ones that I like to do before I'd have somebody go to this but again I'd start with their knees bent for sure and then guys when we're talking about this exercise whether it's the flutter kicks or you know laying on your back doing leg raises we're still talking very similar concepts from the anatomical issues that we need to discuss we just chose the hanging leg raise and another thing I want to point out Marty is think this individual seems to be pretty dialed when it comes to his lat extensibility but again looking at your assessment if some of them's arms fall forward or I mean hopefully again you've you've cured them out of that and they do have a proper extensibility but if they are lacking range of motion or they are showing an anterior pelvic tilt those are two key indicators that this would be extremely challenging for someone to do correctly okay so why don't we why don't we move on to another favorite life oh no I lost I lost my place here but yeah let's go to the torso rotation yes so two different types of machines that are still targeting the same area and again you know we're we're looking at the oblique when someone's doing this particular exercise and when they're in the seated position so when you're looking at picture number one there you know obviously their legs are going to be under and held in so they're in a seated position when they're in this position there's a lot of compression in the lumbar spine on the discs and if they're limited in thoracic range of motion you know they could be getting way too much rotation from the lumbar spine which is going to increase pain and cause some some issues later down the road and then you know also think too looking at the picture to the right you know it's the same same things to think about you know obviously you want to think about what where they're rotating and Martial that you go in more detail about that but you know they're rotating and the stress that's in the lumbar spine but also with the knees bent you know if they're tight in their rectus promores this can put the client in an even more of an anterior pelvic tilt which is going to lead to even more compression and and Martial you want to dive deeper and there but those are just two just looking at these pictures hopefully you guys can start to pinpoint and see some of these common areas that you know are going to light up if people are already complaining about low back pain yeah and and to go into it even more with you know everything when he said was just so spot on but then first and foremost look at the weight stack there so what you'll see is a lot of people they're using their arms and momentum they're not really utilizing the muscles in their core so there's been times where I've played around these machines myself where I crisscross my arms and find a way not to use momentum and the weight drops to maybe 1520 pounds right because now you're not using your chest your back your biceps to go through that you're really looking at what my core can rotate you know also when you look at the rotation in each one of these you know we could talk about where the hip internal rotation would be you'd have to be pretty mobile and again that's why stabilization and all that correct it would come first before you got to the strength phase here but I can tell you there's been times with certain clients where I've utilized this machine and all I do is give them 15 degrees rotation each way because if you're looking at the true real deep internal pair spinal muscles that do connect to the vertebrae and they do that rotation they're only doing 15 degrees plus or minus when you get that was big rotational movements it's coming from the hips it's not coming from a locked position of one part of your spine and when you see that first machine when I lock my lumbar spine and rotate now the bottom might the rask spine up you're ringing out your discs with resistance your spine is really supposed to move in its entirety yes you can work these little inner pair spinal muscles segmentally weight is five pounds minimally so again when you really start to die sec what you can do with that machine and since we can't spot reduce we're going to encourage you to do all your rotation and a standing position potentially where you can clear the trailing hip so that way the whole spine is moving together and then we just know there's a lot less compressive forces on the spine and if I was doing anything such as golf or throwing a punch or a kick I don't want to be clearing that hip anyways so it just comes back down to what I'm going to be doing in real life if I had to do this so be careful segmenting it that way especially if you don't have the mobility and you're handling a pretty good amount of load there from a weight standpoint yeah and some good some good and alternative exercises to this obviously is like using cables you know let yourself rotate like your hips rotate with you or if you would try not to do that then use something like a you know a pow-off press you're still going to focus a lot without putting the twisting action so much on the on the actual vertebrae and in lumbar spine which is often custom why you hear people having bold and disc problems that later lead to pain where they can't even get out of a chair so no that is good and a cup and for those of you who train at home like I do yeah anchor band anchor bands to something you can do chops from there and I'm going to go back to an exercise that I mentioned a couple minutes ago and that's just just a half get up we're doing the doing very similar movements here so I think we covered that one quite well and just a reminder to everyone if you're listening and you have questions please ask please ask your question don't leave them don't go back and ask those questions you can't ask them on social media but ask them while we have these two live out let's talk about back extensions now yes so back extensions fans has sick exercise when they're performed correctly so again you know when we say risk versus reward if we want to tell you again great exercise but we're going to talk about as you can see in different pictures we're going to talk about what these people are doing so when you're doing a back extension you're hopefully targeting or if you're ideally trying to target the directors and you know if you look through this you'll see that the guy on the ball is going into hyper extensions and going too far and adding even more compression in the lower back and then when you look at these other two individuals and Marty I know you're going to go into more detail about this but if you don't have any any flexion and an extension of the spine and you're really bending more from the hip flexors then technically when you come up your prime mover is no longer going to be working your you're going to really be focusing more of the handstring as well as the glutes so that brings us back to the very first slide again of understanding what is it that you're trying to target what are your prime movers in the exercise selection that you have because again if you were trying to work your directors or the muscles in your back you're really not doing that on the other two other than it acting as a stabilizer versus a prime mover so Marty do you want to go into more detail yeah and we end great stuff and we pick these exercise for a couple of reasons first of all when you know I talked before we're not targeting we're not ever training muscles we're training movements so first of all you can see that on the stability ball he's not in triple extension so we need neutral spine when he's already shown you how he's going into hyper extension the knees you can see are slightly bent so that quasi not extended he should be probably pushing into a wall so he can get into that planar flexion because that's the movement that's eventually going to be running jumping squatting whatever that is so and then the one on the bottom you know people have always asked like you know how much is two range of motion or too much and do I just go all the way down so first you know at some point when you go too far now no muscles really engage so now there's going to be more stress on your spine so when you did a phenomenal job talking about how you've got to get your hip flexors loosened up because that's going to limit range of motion or you know how much you can do with these exercise and you can obviously see her position of her cervical spine is far from neutral as well so you know when you go into the you know the flex position you don't need to go as far as you'll see here because now in that over length and position we know muscles are going to be weaker about four and especially if someone's holding away they now are in a weakened position because they've gone too far range of motion they're going to have to compensate that and so that stress now can go to the wrong muscular church which means for any muscles to work as well as now there'll be some shift to the joint to take some of that out again make sure that your feet aren't actually rotated either see a low and wing so really make sure that person's drawn in make sure they're limiting their motion as they come up nice long control and really get them to focus on their glute being the prime mover because the low back and hamstring you're going to help but really get them to focus on the glutes is the prime mover and then stop them in just slight extension maybe five to 10 degrees not into that full hyper extension okay Wendy do you have anything else to add before we move to my favorite exercise in this deck no again you know when we have turnitives there again we're not saying not to perform these it's just I think you know think about what you're trying to target and if you are trying to work your vectors then just add spinal flexion and extension like flex it to go into the length and position and then slowly come out of it and just make sure that it's controlled again you know you need to put a lot of love into your spine and if you just throw up a lot of weight or you go into hyper extension the compression is really not worth it versus really taking the time to do it correctly and focus on your forms okay thank you for that look on to our next exercise in the deck so this one uh chiropractors and orthopedic surgeons all around the world have a love hate relationship uh with this exercise they they love it actually they have a love love relationship they love it because on some level their patients are they're demonstrating self efficacy they're getting out to the gym and training and they love it because this is an exercise done in properly it's going to keep them on the table so let's talk about the Russian twist and some things that we can do to actually get more out of this exercise or give safe alternatives. Certainly so again with the Russian twist you want to think about what is it you're trying to target and you know here we're trying to target their oblique and so um you know when you're doing it and exercise for that and you're actually adding this type of rotation you want the motion coming from the thoracic spine and as you can see and and again I'll have Marty going to a lot of detail she is in a flex position with her feet off of the ground so her hip flexors and her so as and everything is is having to work to maintain that position and then she's adding because she's in a seated position her rotation is really going to be coming more from a usually their arms if their torso stays straight because they're just moving their arms from side to side so that's a compensation that you'll see when people are performing this but then also that in this picture she's going to be getting the rotation mainly from her lumbar like her lumbar spine which as hopefully the last 45 minutes of you listening to this have I realized that that's ideally not where you want to get your motion so Marty doing take it away yeah I can just do this one and I've been forced to do this one in my dojo and it's every time it's like it doesn't feel good because I do my best to get all the hip extensibility I need it's just one of the things I'm constantly working on and there's just no way for me not to feel this exercise incorrectly and what I mean by that is you know my low back is like why are you doing this and it's one of the only exercises that I still would struggle with from not feeling good because I've worked on all my correctives and stabilization so I just totally stay away from this one at all costs for me and again it's for everything that Wendy just said is you know I'm trying to work my core and I've locked down my lumbar spow and some people rotate the legs as well and you're just really putting so much torque and torsion in the lumbar spine and let's again go by how the spine works. Lumbar spine is designed to be stable the rask spine designed to be mobile cervical spine designed to be stable now of of course stable joints still have to move but what you end up seeing is the complete opposite in this exercise you see people's head moving all over the place and then maybe they're moving from their lumbar spine and the thoracic the one that is really designed to be rotating can't and again with you know hit some limitation hip and torr rotation now that I've fired up my hip flexors now it's even harder for me to rotate it's just not comfortable for me at all so I have lost and often times you have the right places yeah and you'll see a lot of people when they do this because they they lift a really heavy load they go into spinal flexion then they're locked down in lumbar you know their lumbar spine is actually obviously locked down and then now they're adding this huge huge weight from side to side I mean it really does wreck havoc on the on the entire spine at the end of the day yep and like you said when you're just trying there's so a cop focused on how many reps or how much weight they're supposed to be told to move it's just you know again we're not going to say never to do it but again what it's really the end goal and can we find something that's more functional everyday life and you know give them even maybe better results by getting them standing up getting their hips involved maybe they can handle more load that way in a safe or manner and even burn more calories if that's the case it's just we want to preserve that spine absolutely yes and Marty I'm going to have to give you some tips on leveraging your black belt privileges you should be able to say I'm not doing that I'll do an alternative sense a speaks but the good news is he has allowed me to create some more the training program so we're getting away from those Russian twists yes yes I'm in the same boat and it's the boss yeah so if they're not so let's so let's move on let I think we covered we got a lot of great alternatives for core exercises we understand what the core is so windy let's give us a recap your takeaways and tell us how to log in touch with you absolutely so you know again when we went through this I just want to emphasize you know understand that if you choose to do any of these exercises hopefully Marty and I covered some resources reward or gave you some different alternatives to think about implementing into your program if these were some of your key exercises and and we're all learning so I remember when I first started out in my programming sometimes I would do exercises and then realize later after going to you know listen to a webinar are going to a workshop like oh no I've been doing that like I needed I need to stop so hopefully you're taking this in as as a learning experience and not that we're trying to pick on some of your favorite exercises the big takeaway would be just look at the assessment figure out you know what is appropriate for your client if if they have compensations obviously think about the exercises for your core that would involve little to no spinal motion so plank side plank sprig is things like that that will target the actual core musculature that's going to protect the spine and then when you're ready to add some of these movements of flexion and extension you know usually again we start this usually in phase two through four you know just just pick ones that your clients can perform safely effectively and efficiently without compensation and you know think about you know common compensations we discussed and how to cue them out of it and then at that point just have fun designing programs and coming up with your own uh your own exercises that are truly going to target the primers that you're trying to uh you're trying to hit when you're programming and then to contact me obviously you'll see it up there on the screen it's Wendy.batts at nsm.org and my Instagram is Wendy.batts 13. All right you for everything that you've done today Wendy and Marty Wendy you're such an amazing job sorry with the takeaway there so just to add on to that is you know just exactly she said what's the real purpose figure out what the best exercises are and then as I was hint at the beginning every exercise should be a core stabilization exercise and a minimum and then you can really start to target do you need to train the core specifically for strength and power which we absolutely recommend in a progressive manner so we're just so excited to discuss because there's so much great information out there so to get a hold of me you've got my email there.mordy.miller at nsm.org and then Instagram is dr.mordymiller 72 and then two other opportunities guys to jump in and have these type of conversations Friday morning 6am I do a coffee talk live where it's just all about answering your guys questions and I do the same thing on Tuesdays at 930 both Eastern Standard Time where we can kind of jump in and continue these type of conversations so hopefully guys can check in there. All right thank you a lot thanks thanks again to both of you for your contributions for your information and I hope everyone who's listening today found this found this useful thank you to everyone who hung out with us today and thank you Greg for keeping it going so we will see you next time everybody have a great be safe
