Hello and welcome to the NASM, CPT podcast. My name is Rick Richie and right now we are live with our Facebook live channel. So thank you so much if you are live and tuning in. Today is going to be a pretty interesting day and I know that that's a relatively common lead in but it is in particular of interest to me because this is something we are going to be talking about today that I have practiced and I have done often on intermittently. Some would say so that I can speak to it from a place of experience but I also have a lot of questions with what we are going to be talking about today and with the guest that we have today and I am excited to have him because not only has he compiled some research on the topic of intermittent fasting and time restricted feeding but he is also helped to contribute as a subject matter expert with some of the work that he has done with us at NASM. So let me introduce to you, have him introduce himself to you, Danny Lennon. Hey man, thank you so much for being on the show today. Thank you so much Rick, it is a absolute pleasure and I am really looking forward to this conversation. Awesome brother, can you tell us just a little bit about your background academically some of the stuff that you may have done with NASM and then I read an article that you had written. So I want to get into some of the content in that article and some of the discussion around time restricted feeding. Sure, so I think the overview for people, the interesting things they may want to know is just some context of my background is I did an undergraduate degree in biology and physics education and following that after teaching for a year of those subjects realized my main passion of nutritional science was something I wanted to get back into. So did a master's degree in nutritional sciences and off the back of that set up a company called Sigma Nutrition with the goal of putting out evidence-based educational content around nutrition science and then also related health science too. And that's been going for the past six and a half years approximately and in that time probably has become most well known for the podcast, Sigma Nutrition Radio as well as other things like seminars that I put out on other pieces of content including written format which is one of the articles you may have seen around this concept of Corona Nutrition which we met explore today. In relation to my work with NASM I was honored to be part of writing for the Nutrition course. So that was an amazing project to work on with the team there and I also spoke and gave two lectures at the NASM Optima Conference last year which was amazing, especially getting this year. I know that it was only afterwards there was so many great people that I could have seen and I don't even realize afterwards it was a I packed four days of seeing people as it was. So hopefully in the future when the world has some normality back that may be a future time that we can do so. And as of right now me as well as some my colleagues here at Sigma Nutrition were also working on the weight loss specialist product that NASM is working on which I'm really excited for us too. So that's a bit about me but I'm happy to get into any more details as you wish. I do wish so let's let's start just diving right in. I think one of the the things that you mentioned here when you were doing the lead in was Corona Nutrition. Now that's not it's not a name that that maybe just a a layperson would hear. Maybe even a typical trainer would hear Corona Nutrition. I think you break it down and kind of estimate and guess what that means but can you just talk us through what that is and what you guys have been doing around it. Absolutely and I think it's not a term that's being used all that often even in other spheres, including academia. It's more a more recent branch of research that's evolved really from the intersection I suppose two different fields. One would be I'm sure many of the trainers have heard of at least the concept about our circadian rhythms that there's these different processes within the body that have a pattern that runs over the course of the day. This 24 hour rhythm that we call a circadian rhythm. They probably will have heard about that in talked about in the context of light and dark exposure or our sleep for example and that's being one field and this area of Corona biology more broadly. Within all we've also looked at how nutrition impacts various metabolic processes. So this would be our calories, macro nutrients, etc. All the good stuff that we typically talk about. And now we have this intersection of those two fields where potentially where we place our food intake and the timing and also the proportion of those meals across the day may have an influence on our circadian rhythms and therefore our overall health. And so that's where this idea of Corona and nutrition came for. So it's most simple. It's looking at the impact of our nutrition to influence our circadian rhythms and therefore our health. But also how our circadian rhythms may influence when maybe a better or worse time to consume food. And that's a general idea behind that field. And then probably what people of being most exposed to is one of the ideas that has sprung from that field has been the concept of time-restricted eating. So eating your food within a certain feeding window and then having it prolonged fasting window. A lot of times people get exposed that from the fitness scene based around intermittent fasting and it's a way to easily restrict calories for example. But there's also time-restricted eating came from the concept around how we're trying to fit that into the biological day essentially. If we restrict our feeding window, is that better from a Corona nutrition perspective is a question that we could ask and has sprung a lot of this research around a restricted feeding window. And we can clarify that more as this comes on, but that's a general overview of what some of those terms may mean. I like it. And there's been a lot of research that's come out lately. Really wonderful research about sleep and thankfully so. And we understand the importance of sleep. We're understanding it from research perspective more and more. And this term circadian rhythm keeps popping up. And just the term circadian just means circular. And it's just the just thing about our circle around the sun. It's the rhythm of the day. But there are also we'll break things up in du weeks and we'll say, hey, you can work out so many times. You can get so many minutes of exercise in a week or there's a monthly cycle for half the population to the world. There is an annual cycle where things go on. So we see this idea of time and how it relates to rhythms or certain happenings that occur. I think for a very long time and I don't know if this is just culturally something that's developed, but we have breakfast lunch and dinner. And that's kind of your three meals, your three feedings. And then there might be some grazing or snacking throughout the day. And then suddenly it just started coming at us, Danny. Like from every angle, this is the way you should eat. This is a type of eating. This is a type of eat. This many meals don't eat that restrict this. Where are we going with this conversation? What's happening in this world? And what is the research actually feeding us when it comes to what may be something that'd been happening, obviously religiously for a very long time, which is fasting. And what does that look like in a day? But what does that look like beyond a day? And what do you have any research that addresses both of those things? So what does this kind of daily intermittent window that we see? And then what happens after a day or two days? And what do we have any research that's showing fasting for multiple days? Yeah. So I think this is a really important concept to clarify some terms on because often people think about this concept of intermittent fasting as if it's one thing. And really intermittent fasting is an umbrella term for many different types of protocols that someone may have with their nutrition. As you quite rightly outline, make it could be on a daily basis. We may choose to just restrict our feeding within a certain window as time restricted eating as we may later get to. But it could also be alternative fasting where every second day someone has a day of fasting. It could be once a week someone does a 24 hour, 36 hour fast, which are becoming quite popular. Or it could even be extended fast where people are fasting for multiple days. So there's all these different permutations of types of fasts that we just put under this umbrella of intermittent fasting. And that's usually why things important to the sting which between time restricted eating and this term intermittent fasting because time restricted eating allows us to be quite precise and that we're talking about over 24 hours. What does that eating window and that fasting window look like? For example, you're going to eat within these eight hours and fast for the rest of the day. Whereas intermittent fasting could mean that but it also could mean you choose to fast one day a week or you fast for three days every month or something as you've outlined. So there's a slight distinction there in terms. And both of those can be viewed quite differently. I think just from a broad level as an overview what I would say to people is to be wary of cases where you see someone claiming that they know what the optimal fasting is that solves all these myriad of problems. Because there's so many, when we think about there's different parts of that equation that say to put a fasting protocol, we could pick how long are we going to fast for? So how many hours or days is this fast going to last? Then how frequently are we going to repeat that fasting protocol? And then during that fast, is it going to be a complete fast? Like we only consume water? Or are we going to allow maybe a small certain amount of calories? Which you would see in something like alternate day fasting. We're on fasting days people usually consume about 400 calories for example. So these these three different variables. Now if we were to start coming up with different combinations of those three things, there's almost an endless number of types of fasting strategies. And to think that we would have tested them all with research now to know the one true answer doesn't really make any sense. But what we can do is try and approximate what generally do we see our beneficial things from from research that may be a good heristic that people could start trialing. And that's why I think the concept of time-restricted eating can be quite useful because even if we don't know precisely everything about it right now or is 12 hours better than 10 or how much better is in nine hour window than 11 like all these little nuanced questions we can still get a general idea that when someone restricts their feeding window we get these certain types of effects. And we can debate about why they are happening and that's kind of interesting. But I think for right now that's why there's lots of useful things that are emerging from the area of time restricted eating but I think are worth people being aware of at least. Well with that being said you kind of get an open a can of worms because I want to know then what is the stuff that people are making claims to for for this time restricted feeding that doesn't actually pan out in the research or at least currently where we are in the research or as you mentioned in the article what are the over-hyped claims for time restricted feeding? So there's probably plenty out there if people went looking that are just obviously nonsense but we can kind of generally skip over that when people have certain types of wacky protocols. The more interesting stuff is things that may be true but we just like don't know yet and people talking with a degree of certainty and using certain types of buzzwords that make it sound like they're talking science when they're not really and I think this is very common for us to get sucked into. One example would be someone saying oh you need to have your fast for this many hours because this is the time point where we maximize autophagy. Right this is the time point. Yes. Where do we hear all the time and fasting? And true with extended fasts that is one of the things that increases this process called autophagy and for people unfamiliar is essentially you can think of it as cleaning out certain damaged parts of the cell and that's a very over-simplocation but for the moment we can think of it that way and so in general it can have some beneficial impacts however that's not all the time and there are other things that are actually have a much more pronounced impact on autophagy for example exercise is then probably the most potent that we know of and then we also can't directly measure it in research settings. So to say as soon you must wait exactly 60 hours so you maximize the autophagy and if you go any less then you're not benefiting from it. For example is something where someone is talking in an absolute manner that may not actually be reflective of what we're seeing. Similarly if someone says the optimal way to implement a fasting strategy is this exact many hours for your feeding when it fluendo and this exact many hours for your fasting window and that is better than all others also doesn't really make much sense because there's all these different permutations we can come up with and trying to compare those is very difficult. So it's more the statements that are very absolutist that I would say are the ones to be wary of where is if someone is giving some degree of context or a bit of nuance to it is probably more likely to be accurate. I like it and I was just having a conversation on Friday with a dietitian based at a New York city or named Sphericon and I ask Ferris why so many people into these into fat diets and really it's the same way when people ask us a question about fitness they want to ask us a question and nobody wants to hear the words it depends they want to hear this is exactly what you do and and I think there are sometimes well-meaning researchers that understand that I can't give you the spectrum because you can't follow a spectrum it's very difficult but if I give you something exact to do then maybe you'll stick to it so I understand why it's being put out there but it's also very important for us within our NASM community our fitness community to know that we need to have an understanding of the spectrum we don't need to pick the diet and say this is right we have to have education around the concepts of all of it and that's really valuable it's really valuable for you to point out so thank you for for taking us down that road. Yeah no I think you actually touched on something really important for practitioners and that's understanding the difference between communicating ideas at a broad public level versus what you may talk to one individual client privately about so for example if you do decide hey this client might respond really well to his time restricted eating protocol I noticed they don't really get bothered about having breakfast in the morning so we can just push their breakfast back a bit and restrict their feeding window I think it might be good even from a behavioral standpoint then you could give that person a clear rule of you're going to have an eight hour feeding window I think that will something we're going to try and that might be really good for you so there you're giving an exact timing but what you're not doing is going publicly and saying everyone needs to use time restricted eating and everyone needs to do it in this precise way the same way you can have a certain type of dieting strategy with one individual client but you would never say all of my clients need to eat this way so I think there's just a difference there between who work communicating to and like you said why the practitioner needs to understand the nuance even if they're not going to communicate that to each individual all the time. Yeah I'm going to have to ask you this question Danny and I know that you get asking this happens every time I've heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and so now you're giving me a window to eat or to not eat should I have an AM window of feeding or should I skip breakfast and for those listening to podcasts there quotation marks there should I skip breakfast and then move on into my my noon to eight window can you just talk us through the breakfast question yeah this is actually one of the most interesting questions within the time restricted eating research right now essentially is it better to have an early feeding window versus a late feeding window or doesn't matter if we are quite time is essentially what we're asking here and for when we look at some of the mechanisms based on how this may be beneficial from a circadian perspective it would lead you to think yeah maybe having earlier or more of your calories earlier in the day can be beneficial and there's various different mechanisms we can talk through if you wish but for example we know there's a circadian rhythm to instant sensitivity that starts highest in start of the day and decreases throughout the day we also know if you compare the exact same meal so same foods same calories same acronyms and you either meal in the morning versus say at 2 a.m. there's a very different metabolic response so your blood glucose response is different even though you'd eat in the same meal based on time of the day so you could then hypothesize well maybe it's better to have at least slightly more of our calories earlier in the day now when we've tried to or when the research groups have looked at this question there's only really being one maybe two studies that I'm aware of that have directly compared a time restricted eating strategy within eight an early versus a late window in that study there was no real difference in most of the markers they looked at the only one that reached a statistical significance was a slight difference in mean glucose so in other words someone's blood sugar across the day when you add the up for the whole 24 hours was slightly higher in the group that was the late feeding window which might suggest there's some glycemic impact but it was quite a small difference so overall it seemed at least from that study there wasn't a big difference however many of the groups within the chrono nutrition research space would hypothesize it's probably better to at least proportionally have a bit more of your calories earlier in the day for a number of reasons and there's some studies that looked at that so that's one part of it that there does seem to be good rationale that not at least not having a large proportion of your calories right at the end of the day that actually probably is a relatively decent recommendation particularly for people who are trying to control their blood sugar now the other question then comes to breakfast and this is where it becomes a again a bit more of a gray area what I think is probably fair to conclude right now is that even if you're going to go with the idea of more calories slightly earlier in a day there's probably no need for someone to think they must eat breakfast as soon as they wake up so what it may mean is that it might be a good idea to have some food intake in the early part of the day and you probably don't want to save up all your calories for the very end just before you go to bed however you probably don't need to rush to eat breakfast immediately and again that's still a I would say an area that's probably inconclusive because we have quite a lot of the epidemiology suggests that eating breakfast is a good idea or at least skipping breakfast is associated with certain outcomes but what we then is interesting to think about especially as we've just talked about time restricted eating is that maybe it's just duration of someone's eating window that is the problem so people that are having let's say that typically skip breakfast it might not be the skipping of the breakfast that's a problem it could be that they're therefore going to eat later in the day so they're having a larger meal just before bed so is it that that's a problem or is it actual skipping of breakfast because when we see timer restricted eating windows strategies or timer restricted eating strategy where you delay someone's breakfast but you also pull up their final meal of the day so not eating right at the end of the day and you have the shortened window you don't see those negative impacts and in fact that's one of the most common strategies that we've seen in some of the human trials and what I like about something like that is a very easy recommendation to give so for example there was a paper that came out of the University of Surrey in the UK a pilot trial where they had people use a timer restricted eating strategy the only recommended or the only recommendation the asked people to follow is can you take your normal breakfast time and just delay it by an hour and a half and then you're final meal of the day can you just bring that forward by an hour and a half and that was the only information they were given they were in counsel about what foods to eat they were told to change anything they were made any recommendation about foods to consume or any other targets except for that change in those times and with that you saw reduced overall clock intake and therefore you see weight loss and improvements in blood glucose now that was just one pilot trial but the reason I like bringing that up is it shows that there could this could be a useful strategy at a practical level for many practitioners that particularly for clients who are maybe new to the nutrition stuff that you don't want to bombard them with lots of information and be telling them about macronutrients or getting really deep in the weeds or they just don't like getting into too much of that straight away but by giving a simple recommendation we know it's going to have a knock on impact on their overall intake so now we're going to be able to control intake without even mentioning the word calorie to them potentially for some people so I think that's the the punchline I would say around breakfast is where I would currently conclude things is that it's probably not necessary to immediately go and get a big breakfast as soon as you wake up and however the other side of it is some of the intermittent fasting strategies that are common in the fitness space of I'm not going to eat until the afternoon but save lots of my calories for this big mess of meal right before bed might not be the best for some people particularly those that are looking at this from a glycemic standpoint yeah I would be one of those people so I'm I'm talking too diabetic and this is another reason why I mentioned in practice this is something that I've put together so is there indeed increased insulin sensitivity that tends to happen when you restrict feeding like this? Yeah so there's first in most of the time I'm restricted eating trials one of the most reliable findings in human trials has been their impact on glycemic markers so overall glucose for the day as well as insulin now one of the things that people would probably quite rightly point out is as we've seen in most uncontrolled situations we tend to see a lot of people end up reducing their overall intake and actually losing weight quite effectively from some of these strategies even without being counseled about calories and so on and we know that with weight loss that tends to improve some glycemic markers a lot of the time as well so the question is in cases where there is no weight loss to be also seeing improvements in glycemic markers one study that was looked at this kind of last year was a lead author on was a sudden I think came out of Courtney Peterson's lab they looked that again that early time restricted feeding practice so in that particular study I think they ate from maybe seven or eight a.m. until three p.m. was their final meal so quite an extreme version of it to see what would happen and they set up their intakes that no one would lose weight so no one lost weight throughout that study but you saw improvements in instant sensitivity you saw improvements in blood pressure and I believe some markers like oxidative stress so that was one of the papers that suggests even without weight loss there are potential benefits here and the reason why that was significant is because mechanistically that kind of makes sense or that's what we might expect to see because we've seen in other trials a lot of them are in rodents but there are so many humans as well that when you partition more of the calories to earlier in the day you bet get better overall blood glucose control for that reason I said earlier you have a circadian rhythm to your instant sensitivity naturally that's highest in the morning and decreases throughout the day you will get also get the same thing with beta cell function and for people unfamiliar the beta cells are what are secreting insulin and so if you have better beta cell function and better insulin sensitivity in the earlier part of the day and more of your calorie intake is partitioned there versus towards the end of the day that may mean that you have to have less say instance accretion across the day or you're able to bring blood glucose back down within range more easily for example so that would give at least some mechanistic basis to why there may be better improvements in some of those markers with not only a time restricted eating model but certainly trying to think about your proportion of your food intake and not having a large amount of it left for nighttime feeding let's say I like that well I'm gonna ask another question that anybody would ask when the the idea of delaying breakfast comes up which is what about my coffee so this is a probably the most common question a lot of people get yeah what are talking about fasting and it usually goes does having a coffee break my fast or there might say does having a protein someone break my fast or does X for them the bank break my fast and there's kind of two sizes first technically if there's going to be some degree of color value to something and there's going to be nutrients there for your body to metabolize then technically we could say yes that is breaking your fast per se but the other question that is is that what we really care about so what is someone's goal of having a fasting window if they're having a fasting window where they're using that as a time to not consume food let's say and they're doing it for calorie restriction purposes then it virtually doesn't matter if they have an americano of that's 10 calories even if technically their body has to metabolize some of that caffeine for example so it's a relevant in most cases that if people are doing it from that perspective in relation to the kind of time restricted eating circadian viewpoint the technical answer seems to depend on who you talk to and which researcher would would give their view on this I think what we do know happens when we consume caffeine or let's say have a black coffee in the morning is that that nutrient ingestion does actually get detected by things related to the circadian system so it's actually acts as a stimulus to circadian system which is actually typically we could think of as a good thing now how much of an impact that has it's hard to say bring it to a practical level I would say if someone is doing a time restricted eating protocol and they say I'm not going to eat my first meal and say 10 30 11 I am whatever they pick but they have a just a black coffee with nothing else at 8 am is that going to be problematic no I would still think their eating window is from the time they have that first meal so I don't think it's problematic to do so particularly when we have to think about this pragmatically and from a behavior standpoint that there's this benefit to having this restricted eating window but now if we tell people to do this you're not allowed to have coffee in the morning you're dramatically impacting the likelihood of adherence to this protocol which is actually one of the most beneficial things about this like it's a relatively simple protocol for people to understand it may not be easy initially but it's not that daunting to make some slight changes to our timing so trying to go against that by giving people these rules of leaving out coffee may not be the best strategy from a practical viewpoint okay good because it didn't matter what you said the answer was I'm still going to have my coffee my question was do I have coffee and start my time restricted feeding window at that time or can I have coffee and start it later on in the day so it's probably more what my question was and and ultimately if you said hey it's you have coffee the switch flips then I go all right that's where I start my window and and that's what I would do but I do drink my coffee black I do not put anything into my coffee so I'm hoping that that my fast continues until I'm actually ready to break that fast I want to also mention something similar into the vein something you were talking about which is compliance and adherence and with that you know if we talk about a window and we say okay the best window hypothetically would be early in the morning and or the best window would be late at night we do that with fitness a lot of times we'll say hey one of the best work out say you can do is this can't stick to and you can't then it doesn't matter that you've been armed with the best information if you can't apply any of the information and we do that societally very often where we go all if I can't do it perfectly then I will do nothing at all if I can't get in 150 minutes of cardio every week then I will do a total of zero minutes because if I can't do it right then I won't do it at all like here what we're looking at is the option for windows and with that option being put out there Danny a common thing that we see is this eight hour feeding window is that kind of the the more common that hour of feeding in the 16 hour of fasting but like many things in circadian science and what people have been researching the most important thing with your sleep many researchers will look at and agree to is not necessarily that you get less sleep but you go to sleep at the exact same time and you wake up at the same time so here it is it is the timing so would they prefer that you sleep a full eight hours yes but if you cannot ideally they want to say hey if you go to bed at 10 and you get up at six that is better or if you can't get the full eight hours then let your window be from 11 to 5 and if those are the only hours that you get to sleep those six hours then the most important thing you can do is stick with 11 to 5 and keep your body in rhythm do we know anything about this kind of intermittent diet that we see this time restricted feeding that if you do a morning feeding should that be your thing or an evening feeding and that is your thing or is it kind of like fitness also which is can you vary it and still get good results for out of it yeah this is a really really good question and I think your absolutely right in relation to sleep that consistency of sleep and wake timings is very important for miscercating perspective and it seems to be similar with the feeding as well in that it seems quite clear that what in the research would be for to as erratic eating so wildly different meal times and even meal frequencies from day to day can have worse and depending on the metric we're looking at a lot of times that could be a glycimic marker or the metabolic marker that there tends to be better if you have consistent timings so one phenomenon that we see quite commonly where people see a shift in their meal timings is between the weekday and the weekend and in research they've actually started to refer to this as social jet lag in that we know that jet lag comes about when people travel time zones and that leads to certain degree of symptoms because their body clock or their circadian clocks have shifted by a certain number of hours and so trying to readjust then leads to these certain symptoms of jet lag the same thing can happen if we can shift our sleep and wake timing which happens from during the week to the weekend people typically sleep in at the weekend they also go to bed later on a Friday and Saturday presuming we're talking about the person that's working it let's say a Monday to Friday 9 to 5 type job then that will be a typical change we see with those changes we also see the same with their food intake that their first meal of the day typically will shift maybe by a couple of hours and they'll also probably have their final meal or larger meals later in the evening so rather than having their typical dinner maybe at 5 pm or 6 pm they may wait and have a meal out with friends at 10 or 11 pm right which is not necessarily problematic because we want people to enjoy life but done consistently what that leads is this change in sleep and wait time this change in feeding times for these two days and that creates a shift in a circadian phase shift we call that when Monday rolls around then now someone is waking up with an alarm clock and having a meal earlier and so now you have this mismatch between what their body has just has been shifted to over the weekend so this is the idea of social jet lag and what this speaks to is that we have this interaction between the circadian component or the circadian clocks and our body but we also have these different pathways that we call nutrient sensing pathways so this collection of receptors and enzymes and hormones are all orchestrated to notice when certain nutrients come in probably the best example is one that would be quite familiar to you if we're talking about blood sugar control is that we know that insulin gets released when blood sugar goes up right so blood sugar or blood glucose increases then we release insulin insulin comes out attaches to an insulin receptor and gives a signal that essentially say we want to get some of this sugar or glucose from the blood into a cell therefore bringing blood glucose back down to normal that's a process I think people may have been aware of so in order for us to have the insulin release our body first needs to sense that this nutrient glucose is around in higher amounts than usual so we have these ability to sense when nutrients have came into the body or not now what happens is we essentially can because of these things have an anticipatory effect built up that our body is designed to be able to anticipate when we're likely to eat so this is driven by habitual meal times let's say and when we match that up with when we're best able to handle meals again talking about the circadian rhythms then that can essentially be beneficial when there's a mismatch between those is when we can have problems a most obvious example of a mismatch between our feeding intake and our normal circadian rhythms would be someone who does shift work and then they're first going on shift work now they're having to eat during the middle of the night they're eating at a time when their body is not anticipating that that they've anticipated the earlier now our body is pretty good at adapting in some manner at least so when we sense this new intake that's why we have this circadian shift that I talked about that happens on the weekend and leads to the social jet lag so there's this interaction of both that circadian perspective as well as our bodies able to anticipate when we usually consume meals and so we're going back to your original question this is why having consistent meal timings can potentially be beneficial because we have this anticipation of this is when we're going to be consuming meals we can have those metabolic processes ready to run at those times again from from an over simplified perspective so if we're having a dramatic change in that from day to day it may be problematic and there's a couple of studies that suggest this where they had one group consumed the same meals so like three main meals and I think two or three stacks per day but I think exact same time every day for two weeks and the other group had anywhere between three to nine meals per day but changed every day over the course of the 14 days so it could be three, seven and four and eight and so on every day and at the end of that you two weeks you see differences in I believe fasting glucose and fasting insulin I could be really really exact measures but some of the glycemic markers just because of differences and that was matched for overall calories in both those conditions so we see that tends to happen and we know that this erratic eating can be relatively common in the same way that we know that typically in the population a lot of people eat with quite a large or a long feeding window so with that whilst we still need to work some more stuff out that would lend me to be conclude that it's probably a good idea to have some regular meal times from day today not that you have to set your stopwatch to it exactly but approximately that your meals are coming at around the same time day today so I do have a question because you know everything depends on oftentimes what your goal is so why do people actually do time restrictive feeding and many instances we're looking at insulin sensitivity maybe for somebody with diabetes or we're looking with an easier window where we can restrict calories but what if we're looking at fit populations where maybe I want to build muscle I want to high-perchemy or I want to you know I'm playing sports right so I want to have the performance level that I need to have how does this intermittent fasting deal with that and I know that you know we talk about this idea of multiple meals throughout the day particularly for high-perchemy based athletes is there a correlation is there anything where you're like oh in that case eat throughout the day or is there still an opportunity for this time restricted feeding to fit into performance based lifestyle yeah really really important question and it's one of the things that I'm acutely aware of when this topic comes up of trying to be clear in what applications we're talking about it and so most of our discussion so far has been from a general health perspective as well as maybe body weight regulation or even a fat loss perspective that someone's goal these could be useful tools in all of those areas and although they don't necessarily need to be used I think should be very clear on that there's several caveats that I tend to try and point out within this area one is like you say we first always need to take in the priority goal of any client so if a client's goal like you say is I just want to build the most amount of muscle masses I possibly can then again looking from nutrition literature we know that we probably want to have around four ish plus high protein meals spread evenly across the day and that if that person was to fast until say one p.m. before the first meal we've essentially missed out on at least one high protein feeding that would allow them to maximize that anabolic response that muscle protein synthesis wants that would be useful to their goal now for a lot of people it may not be that important for a bodybuilder trying to maximize everybody muscle they can then we're going against their main goal right so there's definitely cases like that there's other cases where we know some clients are struggling to eat enough food already you may be working with a collegiate athlete who's a swimmer and needs to have thousands and thousands of calories every day because there's spending hours and hours in the pool and now by us trying to shrink their feeding window and they're already struggling to eat enough calories we're just going to make things even harder so again it's going against their goal and it's also just not thinking about what this strategy is likely to do is it making it harder or not the same thing applies to many type of athletes for example of what quite a lot of mixed martial arts athletes who would have multiple training sessions per day and so again if they're training in the morning and the evening time it would make no sense for me to say oh everyone needs to have an eight hour feeding window when really we want to be able to fuel them before and after both of those workouts across the as well as get them enough fuel and so there's definitely those the other one from a more general fitness perspective is that there are people's training and exercise habits can actually offset some of the downsides that we see with say late night eating so I already mentioned that having those larger meals in the evening may be problematic because we're less instant sensitive so you may get a higher blood glucose response however what we know is that after exercise and resistance training is particularly good at this is it causes the movement of a glucose transporter to come to the edge of a muscle cell so all that means is there's these transporters that allow that sugar in our bloodstream that blood glucose to move into the cell that we mentioned earlier now the contractions that happen say in resistance training and other types of high-endency exercise can allow these transporters to move to the edge of a muscle cell what that means is now we're actually in a really good position to get glucose or sugar to move from the bloodstream into that muscle cell after that training session even without insulin it's called an insulin independent process so now even if we are technically a bit less insulin sensitive in the evenings or are a bit more insurcer resistant it won't matter here if we've done some exercise particularly some lifting that now we can have a meal with lots of carbohydrate and we actually can effectively dispose of that glucose so again depending on that population it matters a lot there's also the question we could probably it's fair to say that someone who is very healthy metabolic Lee is probably going to be able to or it may not have the same benefit that someone who isn't would glean right so there's a lot of benefits someone could have to getting better glycemic control in certain cases for others they may already have pretty good glycemic control already so the magnitude of the benefit they would get may be relatively small so there are a few caveats there so again any application we're looking at someone struggling to eat enough food already where that's athletes with high calorie demands whether it's maybe a female client who is pregnant right now and is trying to get enough food in maybe it's someone who already struggles with their appetite to get enough food into fuel what they're ever at their activity maybe it's someone with an athletic goal maybe it's someone this a bodybuilding goal or maybe for other people just their preference it doesn't work for right that they have their life and their work schedule self in certain away that by trying to fit into a certain feeding window it causes them not to be able to stick to the fundamentals around nutrition that we will try to have them doing so eating a generally good quality diet making sure overall intake of calories is suitable for whatever their goal is making sure they're eating us efficient amount of protein and so on if they're not able to do those things because it's they're finding it so difficult to stick to this feeding window it's probably not a strategy for that individual climb so there's always context and caveats and what the practitioner should be doing is being able to say this is a useful tool that may be able to use in some areas here's where I could use it or at least try let with someone but it's not going to be the answer all of the time or even maybe most of the time and then to an earlier point you made which is really good that to round this off was there's a range every see most of the human trials tend to be eight to 12 hours of that feeding window and there's nothing to say that you have to start with any one of those numbers and so someone could trial let's say a 12 hour feeding window for a new client if they really like that saw of thing then you can play around with changing it even lower if someone says look this is I don't like this at all then you know it's not going to get better by me trying to get them to eat within eight hours so always use your best judgment as a practitioner think pragmatically of what is going to allow this person to eat a line to those fundamentals that we always try and hit Danny what I think is so important that you've pointed out is the fact that you come across as more believable because you're not setting this up as a panacea it's not the answer for every single thing and you should just do this and we see that and so many things it doesn't matter like whether it's I'm a roar and it doesn't matter what your pathology is rowing will help you or or pilates will help you or this type of feeding will help you and it is so very much indeed different strokes for different folks in terms of as you mentioned adherence and compliance but also it is not perfect for everyone for every outcome and the fact that you point that out makes it so much more believable and to stay on theme easy to digest when you talk about what the benefits of it truly and to actually are so thank you for that and I just want to ask do you have time because we're going long because I love listening to you talk do you have time at all to maybe accept some questions from any of our live audience absolutely happy to take any questions people have so as long as they want to ask any questions let's do a well destiny and the chat wants to Greg I can't hear you I know you're asking questions I see there you go you know if you unmute your mic it helps I don't know if people can be able to hear you so destiny in the chat wants to know what book do you recommend to learn more about intermittent fasting and time restricted feeding if people are looking for a good like lay audience book that gets into some of the science but is also quite readable then one of the main researchers in this area satchin panda wrote a book called the circadian code which would give a good overview of things related to circadian rhythms but also how this ties into time restricted eating he's based at the salt institute and he's done a lot of the studies in this area and that would be a good entryway level into get a good overview of the area people looking for a lay book yeah and then Joanna wants to know what do you do with alternating shifts that require a person to change their eating schedule almost daily so one of the most challenging things is going to be any form of shift work and probably the most challenging is where the shift changes day to day there's no real easy answer apart from some things that can say that we've done what people on on shift work is that if someone is doing a night shift let's say someone is a nurse in a hospital and their shift starts at 8 p.m. and goes into 8 a.m. based on again theoretically what might be best from a circadian perspective it seems that the probably the worst time to have a large meal particularly that's high in carbohydrate and fat would be right in the middle of the night so like between let's say 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. let's say or 1 p.m. and 5 a.m. so trying to avoid large meals at that time may be beneficial so what they could do is trying to keep those main meals outside of that so either towards the start of the shift or even before they go into work or even then the time afterwards or if they're going to eat throughout their shift it may be beneficial to focus on high protein snacks that are relatively low in fat and carbohydrate for the reason that those detrimental impacts on metabolism of carbohydrate in fact we see doesn't seem to be the case with protein at least that we're seeing from some of the sports nutrition research that you get almost complete digestion of protein without any real problems during the night so it could be further meals during that that night time keeping those to high protein keeping their other intake either side of that but if the shift is changing massively day today it's going to be difficult to really line those up consistently which I think is what the question is more related to so all it's going to be as a matter of on that spectrum how close can you relatively keep them so how can we again on that night shift maybe squeeze more of them to before they go into work or the start of the shift for those first couple hours so it's kind of mimicking where they would still be normally awake on a day shift and then ideally maybe not consuming food for a number of hours during that night and then keeping it more until what a normal day is our morning on a day shift is and that's probably as much as you can do it's an area we do need more research but there is a couple of groups trying to do research in this area more and more but for now there are a few things that popped to mind and that's that's good because this entire conversation Danny all are been thinking about is my brother and law Tim and he is a he works at Trader Joe's and he'll go in early in the morning you know four or five a.m. a couple days a week and then who have a midday and then he'll close and I'm trying to balance out on his behalf what does this diet look like because I certainly know his sleep is thrown off if you can if you can stay online with one and you're still thrown off on the other does just creating at least a little bit of consistency with the diet help with everything else you think yeah I mean at this point it can only really be guess work but I think yeah if you can keep consistency both just from the routine of it and I think it probably may just keep on track with normal good food choices because you have this set structure and then yeah where possible even when on those later shifts avoiding eating like large meals particularly right in that that middle of the night time zone is probably a good idea but like I say some more answers we definitely need and strategies for that. I agree and one of those strategies would be I would like for work to provide more consistency schedules we do see that being an issue not not just in you know in food services which he works at Trader Joe's we you mentioned the medical industry and there's some crazy hours in the medical industry fire fighters so those challenges are out there and I'd like to see that being worked on just and just contextually anyway Greg where are we do we have a few more quick questions we can get out and still try to close this up within an hour and let Danny get on with this day. We're actually clear on question but a lot of people wanting to just thank both of you in the chat for for very entertaining and informative chat her talk so thank you. So thank you very much. I just want to point out some irony one of one of the irony isn't it all is you mentioned is probably one of the first things you talked about which is autophagy and one of the strangest things about autophagy or autophagy is that that just means eating and one of the seams to be an excellent way to get yourselves to eat things that are not good for you is by not feeding your body. I don't know there's something ironic about not eating in order to to eat the bad guys that are in there and wanted to point that out and say express my gratitude Danny for for you being on here and shut out to Brian Sutton for connecting us and I've always held Brian in such high regard I think the world of him he doesn't excellent job with NASM and the compiling research and connecting us with quality people so Danny thank you for being on it can you please just shout out social media handles websites things like that that people can find you and let them know where they can reach it connect with you follow you all that stuff. Absolutely first I'll say right back to you thank you so much Rick for the conversation and for Greg for everything you've been doing there and also to reiterate your words about Brian who's fantastic guy and nothing but but love for him and yeah Danny interaction I've had with NASM to this point as it's been overwhelmingly positive so this is only added to that further so thank you for the conversation um for people looking to find me they can go to the website sigmanutrition.com so it's SIGMA nutrition.com if they're into podcasts and the podcast is SIGMA nutrition radio on any podcast app or Spotify it's easy to find and then social media probably the best place to find me is Instagram Danny let an underscore sigma I'm also over on Twitter if people put in my name or the handle is nutrition Danny and any of those places I'm happy to take questions and yeah if either good or bad feedback I'm happy to take so hopefully it's all going to be good and the final thing I should mention is if people really want to nerd out on some of the details and the science in this area there is an article I wrote going in depth on this that's on the stronger by science website so i think it's a stronger by science.com slash chrono nutrition if people want to get deep into the weeds but apart from that any of those places hopefully yeah happy taking any questions. You're an awesome Danny thank you so much and everyone thank you for being on as always express who I want to express great gratitude and you taking time out of your day and yourself directed learning you deciding what you wanted to learn finding ways to solve problems and to educate yourself and to help out your clients by tuning in so I appreciate that and I look forward to continue to support you. If you have questions or you have a concept that you want me to address either on the Facebook Live or directly about a podcast then please reach out you can get me at Rick.richyr icagy at nasm.org or dma on instagram at dr.richy and I'm happy to follow up with you there and then deliver any other content that that you may have that you're interested in and with that said thanks for listening this is the nasm cpt podcast
