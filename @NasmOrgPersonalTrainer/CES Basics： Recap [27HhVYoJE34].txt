Good afternoon everyone and welcome again to NAS and live and today what we want to do wrap up CES so you have the undivided attention of my guest, master regional master instructors Wendy Bats and Marty Miller. How are you all doing today? Fantastic. Great. Okay. Now before we jump on today I had some connectivity issues so if I start to look all weird that is completely on purpose just focus on Wendy and Marty and they're going to wrap up CES for you and make the case as make the case for why you should be using this for your clients for yourself and for your clients and your training programs. So let's go ahead and get started. Marty why don't we want to talk us through an overview of inhibition and lengthening. Gotcha. So just like the early parts of the OBT model for that stabilization journey we're using the same techniques, we're inhibiting anything that we've identified as potentially overactive and then we're going to lengthen those same tissues because we want to calm them down, we want to restore them to their normal length tension relationship. So as we go into the second part of the continuum which Wendy will discuss that now we have muscles that are more of a relaxed state and now they're going to allow the other muscles on the opposing side of the body to do what they're normally supposed to do. So the evidence shows that this continuum is the best way to go through in restoring proper human movement. So we have to inhibit with our foam rolling techniques or you know all those other new tools that are out available to us now in the fitness industry such as the massage percussion guns, the vibrating foam rollers, the vibrating sphere spheres, etc. Use with the techniques that you feel the most comfortable with and most applicable for each client, then you go into your static stretching for the muscles again that you've identified from their assessments that are overactive or the way I like to describe it, the bad motion. They're pulling you into an excess affordly, they're pulling your client into feet turning out, knees caving in. So that's what you're going to attack with the inhibit and lengthen. Okay, thank you, thank you for that. So we know one of the definitions that we've started to use with the new CES is that it's simply a targeted flexibility training and strength training program that we can use that we can use as a standalone workout or we use it as a movement. We use it as a movement prep. Now where I was going with this and you're talking about the flexibility techniques. Can you go back and explain again why inhibition is important that that's something that we just can't we just can't blow off in the training session. Yep, no, no doubt. And it was I was doing my coffee talk this morning at 630 West Coast time and some of the same questions type of thing came up is like you said very targeted and we're trying to identify the muscles that are have a propensity overactive. So when we look at inhibiting what we're doing is we're just playing with the neuro science and the sense that we're putting some pressure into the muscle, an appropriate level on a scale of 1 to 10, maybe our 6 or 7, it's not about how much pain you can tolerate. If anything, the research shows that you're not going to get as good of a relaxation because most people tend to ice-imetry can track or tense up. So on a pain scale of about 6 or 7, that pressure into that muscle belly is going to stimulate the Golgi tendon organ to sense that there's pressure going on. It's going to protect itself by causing a relaxation in the muscle spindle. In essence, I always correlated when I was learning this was, well, if I was picking up a weight that was too heavy, thank goodness that the muscle can sense that there's too much tension just cause relaxation or apprentice. You and I would tear every single muscle in our body because we would keep lifting heavy weights until we thought that we could accomplish the lift. So there's that self-protective mechanism with the Golgi tendon organ that senses pressure and causes a relaxation. So that's all we're really doing is still kind of playing with that scientific phenomenon and getting that GTO to relax. To cause the override of the muscle spindle, I should say. Okay, awesome. And you mentioned the GTO. So what can you talk again? Can you talk again about because I think my connection was freezing up? What's going on at that muscle spindle now? We have two different fibers within the muscle spindle and they're they're they're stimulated or they respond to a couple different stimuli. Can you talk about that? So the Golgi tendon organ is going to sense the amount of tension and the rate of tension change within the muscle and again that's a self-protective mechanism and the muscle spindles are going to sense the rate of length change and the amount of length and a muscle belly. So I always again like, yeah, I'm a visual person. So I've viewed if I stuck my arm out as someone's running past me and my arm is rapidly stretched. I wouldn't have the time to think about, oh, I better contract these muscles to protect them from tearing. So those the GTO muscles spindle are sensing that in real time and they communicate with each other. So the GTO is it's rapidly increasing the pressure or too much pressure. Can you communicate the muscle spindle to relax and just calm itself down? So that way it's that self-protective mechanism and when you can use that to our advantage in part of that sequence to inhibit the right muscles. So then when you do your lengthening technique, you've got muscles that were already guarded or overactive to relax. So now you get better outcomes for step two, which is lengthening. Okay, and awesome. So for lengthening, we have a couple of examples in the text in which we've expanded. Normally we've used or in the past we've used static stretching, static stretching, act device-related or anandor, neurostretching, P&F type protocols. Can you explain to us the the case for using each within your, within your lengthening protocol for us. Yes. Sure. static stretch things phenomenal. I think for years it got a bad rap because it will decrease the activation of a muscle. But thank goodness because how could we ever correct somebody's movement in balance, impairments or muscle in balances if we didn't have a stretching technique that would calm muscle tissue down so we could then, as Wendy will get into strengthen the other muscles that are allowing that bad motion. So static stretching is a great tool in your toolbox because if you're teaching a bunch of people at once or if you haven't learned some more advanced techniques, it's very easy to teach people the static stretching. And all you're going to do is go through the right range of motion to feel the point of tension or first compensation back off just slightly so you're an ideal positioning and you're going to hold that for 30 seconds and you can hold it up to a minute if you have the time or the ability to tolerate it and that's going to get that muscle to relax. Same thing that we just talked about with the muscle spindle it'll sense that change in length cause a change and now you can go through the rest of the continuum. There's advanced techniques that you can learn where you're doing P&F where you're going to use that Golgi tendon organ to your advantage where you're going to apply a little pressure relax 30 seconds to apply a little pressure and get used the same type of philosophy that you use foam rolling to just get a better stretch and then active isolated again you're just contracting the antagonist to get the agonist to relax. So all of those are acceptable you're just figuring out what you feel most comfortable with what you've learned how you can teach it and do you have the ability to do maybe one-on-one where you could use an advanced technique or if you're training 20 people you might just stick with your static. Okay thank you those were those were great explanations and we're building the case that before you do anything with any intensity or you're trying to teach the body again to move well you need to start you need to start there so that you can have a full range of motion but as we understand once you do those first two steps it creates something that we we like to call a knife flexibility you have to teach that you have to teach a body to do something with that range of motion so windy what is it let's talk give us an overview give us an overview of activation and integration please. Oh absolutely so as Marty just said you're going to inhibit then you're going to link and then right after that you go into the activation techniques which refers to the stimulus or the reeducation of probable overactive muscles you can do isolated strengthening techniques or positional isometrics that will target a specific muscle so with isolated strengthening it's going to increase the intra muscular coordination of a specific muscle and is achieved through the combo of enhanced motor unit activation synchronization and firing rate so then you also have positional isometrics which incorporates the isometric contractions performed at the end range emotion of a joint so there's no active movement and this is used more with people who have adequate core strength and neuromusic or a control because it involves higher intensity contractions and the purpose of this is to increase the intra muscular coordination of specific muscles that is necessary excuse me to heighten the activation levels before integrating them back into movement patterns so so once we've activated the muscles that we have found to be underactive via the assessment then you're going to go from there into your integration techniques and this is going to involve the use of dynamic total body exercises and these exercises then reeducate the body back into functional movement patterns and enhances the functional capacity of the body by increasing the multi-planar neuromuscular control so basically we're working on the coordinated movement patterns and we know that the multi joint exercises and all planes from both bilateral or unilateral stances is going to help increase the inter muscular coordination and that's going to reeducate the neuromuscular system to maintain you know we're teaching it how to maintain the proper alignment during movement you know we're working on you know just basically getting the body to move the way that it was meant to move and the integration portion is going to involve as we talked about the low load there's very controlled movements obviously always in the five kinetic kinetic chain checkpoints this is all going to help ensure that the joint start and then remain in the proper alignment it's going to help muscles function in their proper length tension relationships is also going to help with the synergistic recruitment to make sure that the movement is optional or as optimal as possible and this section where you can also think of using the total body movements that will combine the upper body and the lower body you know and and and provide patterns which is also going to help increase stress to the entire core musculature and then after we do that then we can get into the resistance portion of the workout so I usually think of the CES is kind of like again this is kind of your your pre-warm up for your actual workout to really get the body dialed so it's ready to go into whatever workout you're going to do okay great thank you for that explanation now I promise promise as we've started doing these webinars that I will not really curve fall anymore but we know that that is never the case for us but I'm going to throw you I'm going to throw you since I'm a Chicago White Sox fan I'm going to throw you a split finger what we want to do what I've heard just getting out and listening to listening to presenters and how people categorize our CES process the way we've come to it is is one of the arguments is that I can't say that if a person has me cave in or valgas collapse that it's the glute medias but what I can say is that they need to learn how to do the squat pattern and I've heard that is recently as last year so can you explain again can you just talk us through that can you dispel that myth I guess and talk us through activation integration again within that context of the the squat and kneescaving in or valgas collapse okay you want to think about it again think about it more of a holistic approach I mean obviously we put somebody in the five-connected chain checkpoints when what they did their overhead squat assessment and we said this is ideally how we want you to stand now squat and then of course we see deviations because their body can't stay within that proper five-connected chain checkpoint alignment and that's why we see the compensations and that's how we know you know if your foot turns out this is you know probably overactive at the knees cave in or whatever the case may be so I think we need to kind of think of it all together so if I tried to continuously teach someone how to squat but I have an increased range of motion at the right joints to allow that proper movement pattern that I'm really not helping them move better and and be able to perform a squat the way it was intended to be performed so think about if you know to your to your point if you've got someone's knees caiving in then we're going to want to think about inhibiting the add doctor complex we're going to look at the shorthead of the bicep for Morris because we know that's going to be overactive we're going to think about the lateral the lateral lateral the VL can't even say it right now as well as the lateral gastroch because those are the muscles that we need to inhibit and to get some more length back you know and then you know because those muscles when they're overactive will pull the knee in and then we have to think about what's allowing it so that's when we get into the activation component so to your point the group needs going to be um underactive the the M.O. is going to be interactive the M.O. hamstrings going to be interactive and then the M.O. gas shock is going to be interactive as well so those are the muscles that we want to try to activate because if we get new found length on one side that because of those muscles that were overactive and now we can really activate those muscles that were shown to be underactive just because of that one compensation alone and then of course this is also we would want to think about what's happening at the foot ankle but if we're just talking about the knee then I'm going to get better activation when they go down and if I looked at them from a lateral view I would have a better chance of them having the parallel lines which would then give better joint distribution between the ankle the knee and the hip so therefore when they go down into the squat and we're probably going to have better alignment which will decrease the stress on the anterior portion of the knee and we would get better activation of the quad and glute which is the two prime movers of that actual squat so it's kind of a complicated way of thinking about it but basically we just that's why we want to look at all the assessments that would be appropriate and then really target the muscles I mean it may not just be one muscle it could be you know the complex is that that would you know again it's the glute meat and the max that are underactive so you want to think about what could we do to target meat in the max as well which could be something as simple as sideline leg lifts as well as glute bridges and then we could see did that help clean it up and maybe it did and maybe it didn't but you know it is a process so again you know we should start to see some some corrections as we go but it may take a few times working on the foam roller working on lengthening those muscles and then activating those muscles to start to really see a change in movement patterns that were we're hoping to see. Okay thank you and before we move on because both of you just said a lot and I can put myself in the place of a newly mentored fitness professional and just I can I'm sharing the sweat that they're going to the sweat that they're going through right now because that that's a lot of stuff and that can be overwhelming and quite simply both of you myself we've we've gotten the reps so how do you help how do you help someone like that prioritize with everything that both of you just said identifying overactive undirected muscles and taking a client through that program without without getting yourself fight. So that sounds when they go yeah jump in there again I think it's the assessments I mean it always boils down to the assessment and what did you see and then if you can identify something that's not moving properly by just putting a checkmark because did their feet turn out check it if you see it that it did you you mark it down you know did they have an anterior tilt did they have an excessive lean I mean I think if you're new the first thing is to really start practicing the assessments because if you can get the assessment pretty dialed and see where the compensation's lie then all you need to do is go to nasm.org and print out the solutions table and then and then start to compare it like because the solutions table will tell like tell you exactly what to do by looking at it it'll give you if the knees come in if the feet turn out these are the muscles that are overactive and these are the muscles that are underactive and so it we kind of help take the guess work out until you can start to rattle off some of these muscles and things that you're seeing and it just takes time and practice and the more you use that solutions table and you start to see the common muscles that are usually overactive then then it helps you learn it because you're constantly using that as as your guide the thing is we're not trying to make it complicated and again these are muscles that are typically overactive or typically underactive it may not be exact but again based on movements and how the bodies lined up these are usually what causes some of these compensations and that's why we made that list for you and you know that solutions table also gives you some examples of exactly some some strengthening exercises on the activation side as well so you know so don't overthink it just figure out what you see and then use that solutions table that you can put on your clipboard I mean it doesn't have to be anything that like people are looking at you like she doesn't know what she's doing maybe you have this on your clipboard you can easily refer to it and make your program designed based on that and then again the more use that the more you're just going to start to know this stuff it's practice really okay and pardon how do you that's absolutely it use the solutions don't don't reinvent the wheel and you have to practice so what's your what's your take on that Martin you only think because when you did such a great job covering it so that is my answer but I'll give another way the thinking of it is you know did you get into fitness to exercise people or did you get fitness to train people and the reason I say it the way this is kind of my own internal definition and actually we are doing a webinar not a shameless plug it just jumped in my head the 27th on the difference between exercise and training because I see a lot of people that take a certification they get they passed the test and then they go right back to just volumizing people and it's like well exercises in my definition is just a bunch of activity to burn calories yes that's great and unfortunately there are a lot of people who have great genetics and a bad exercise program can still give them some fitness results at their thrilled with it could be their body mass it could be how lean they get but when do you and you practice we're going to look at they're moving now even worse than they did before and this model was based on elite athletes athletes train they angelate their program they go through it so really everything when he said was spot on the only thing I'll add is make commitment to be a fitness professional that's training people not just exercising so if you're focused on training you're going to create your programs ahead of time you're going to continually assess you're going to look at all those little details and the more you do that right back to Wendy's point is now you start to own the material because you're following a philosophy so that's the only other you know different way to look at the same thing Wendy said it's just make a commitment to put people into specific training programs that they're capable of and that you know how to take them to the next level based on their assessment their wants their needs and what phase of training they're in and should be moving towards and yet that's absolutely it now add one more thing do everything well number one do everything that both you just said you know could answer understand the assessments understand the assessments practice train people train people when there's a there's a skill that goes with that but also I understand that people we're we're in the entertainment business as well and you can always leave time in your training session if your clients have earned it to let them do something they like if they want to hit a hit boxing focus mitts or you know labor memorial days coming up if they need to once work once everybody's out free in their communities if you want big guns you can do that too just provide it that you that you've earned that in your training so one more question for the both of you and I've had this this come up before and this focus this center is on how do you how do you use how do you specifically use CES and let me give you a little context the question was is we've been talking about this whole process for these last few weeks but you guys never talked about CES after after rehab after going through rehab protocol and like I don't you know and that was if that was a very honest question so I don't want to make quite about that question is very sincere but in my mind and like I kind of thought we did because that we're not we're not dealing with with rehabilitation that's that's not our scope but so can you talk both of you what start with use and you just finished up Marty just just talk about the uses of CES sure so I'll talk about it my personal life how I use it is as much as I know this material I'm not perfectly efficient in my movement at all times so I am a very routine guy and I do a lot of traveling when I'm normally back on the road full-time with technology and but I wake up now at the same time I do 25 to 30 minutes of a CES continuum that's specific to me so I'll phone roll I'll do my ankle series my hip mobility series my thoracic spine then I go through you know my static stretching and then I do a couple activation techniques and to me that doesn't even count as exercise that's just how I start out my day best I can then from there oh I'm still good yep can you hear me perfect yeah okay so from there if I'm not going to exercise immediately I'll repeat a few of those steps right before my workout session and then when I'm watching TV later tonight and you know my wife is very patient with me I have stuff littered around the house I have different phone rollers and when I'm watching the news tonight I'll be phone rollin again I got a yoga mat and a living room I'll roll out and I'll do some more static stretching because and I you know I just bought a steak desk I try to sprinkle in what I call accidental exercise all day and I still don't move 100% efficiently and now with my clients I do everything at Wendy's set I assess them I give them their homework and the one thing I can tell you if they showed up late and we're ready to jump right in the workout I would not allow them to I'd make them at least go phone roll one or two things from a principal standpoint because if I didn't force that into their program I'm almost saying it's not important anymore and then I would encourage them to be active seven days a week doesn't mean you have to exercise seven days a week but just be aware of your posture all day long and give them some simple solutions that fit their schedule and that is manageable and to whatever commitment level they'll tell they'll give me and it's all the same you may say like you know what that seven minutes every morning wasn't bad I'll take it to 10 or you don't I can add because they start to feel better and if people feel better right you know they'll do more whatever you're asking them to do so yes sometimes it can be a stand alone full session if someone's deconditioned or coming out of a situation or I'll just try to throw it in coming throughout the day thank you thank you and Wendy how are you using it thinking about our question yeah I mean again you know I don't usually deal with people right now that are out of rehab I mean right now I'm I'm very fortunate because I am working more with athletes that are at a higher level and truly the CES model is the foundation for everything that I do I mean I start everyone with it so you know I can perform hands-on and ambition and lengthening well because of my my license so you know but I do that and then and then I activate the muscles that are that are interactive or that I've noticed maybe typically more interactive based on their sport or based on how they come in that day and so you know this helps like reassure that they're prepped for whatever resistance portion of the workout that they're going to be doing that day you know because as Marty just said if if I know that my clients are prepped and ready to go they're going to move better they're going to perform better they're going to feel better and then the better the workout is is going to really lead to better results of course and that makes me personally look better as a trainer because then they're hitting their goals and then they're talking about it with their friends and family or whatever and that actually increases my business so so I think you know it's kind of all inclusive that I feel that the CES I mean for a long time I was known as the corrective the corrective trainer you know like oh you've got a problem you need to go see this this trainer because she can it work specifically with that and it wasn't that I was doing anything different except for I was following the protocol in the model and and again it is a systematic approach I mean it is based on research we we notice these muscles are overactive let's loosen them up we know that these are interactive let's just get them do in their job and then let's do the workout that's going to benefit that client to their goal so I think when we when we think about it like don't look at it as two separate things look at it is just a different way to prep the body no matter what um what area in the model or what phase of the model of training they're in because if you get things to activate and wake up and you get things to to loosen up and you can integrate that back they're going to end up being able to lift more too so so again no matter what phase they're they're in it's beneficial for all perfect so we talk a lot about we've just talked a lot about how CES the the four step process can be used sand alone and through each each level of the OBT model depending on the persons goals but Marty why wasn't separated initially well initially that was uh Dr. Mike Clark's you know what he was working on with his clients or his athletes at University North Carolina and when he put it out it was to him there was no separation because as Wendy said it's just this all inclusive model as the fitness industry changed in the early 2000s and the accreditation came out that was part of it and Mike also developed even more content for the CES and our final phase the PES so when the accreditation came out you know the goal was what information does a beginning fitness professional use over 80% of their time so that's where the middle five phases if you want to call it which is now the OBT models most people know it made the most sense there's a starting point with stabilization in parents and there's a nice progression through power but it's not maybe the elite power you would take a high level recreational athlete amateur athlete professional athlete through so because you should have those additional skillsets if you're working with that type of client and the same thing in reverse if you're really focusing in on someone that potentially if you have an athletic training background like myself or massage like Wendy and Kirepatch are like you if you're adding corrective you should also have that foundation or if you're bringing it into fitness you should know how to bring somebody after maybe we send them out of rehab prior to a traditional fitness it was kind of that bridge or as Wendy said perfectly here's a foundation that everyone should do some of as they move through the entire model so that's why the CES was separated in the PES and their advanced credentials and then our certification is the certified personal trainer which is stabilization endurance through our first level of power training okay and we answered the answer a lot of the questions already from our group but Wendy I know that you just talked about it but let's talk about it again how are we using CES for someone who's doing power training or someone who's also has also earned the right to be doing some of the stuff up in PES. Sure so again you know it's very individualized and I mean I use it as an extended warm-up so I have all my clients began with some sort of rolling or again you know I may do some of the hands-on stuff due to my license and then I go into the activation and activation when you think about you know just the OBT model is basically the core and the balance exercises that we're doing you know we would technically turn that as activating because that's what we're trying to do and then once those are complete I can perform the integration or the total body exercise portion and the resistance portion of the workout you know you can do the CES again before any workout it just has to make sense of you know of the program that you have designed and make sure that it fits within the overall you know the overall program that you have for the day as well overall goal for the client. So so again depending on who comes in I mean I definitely go through and and activate certain muscles and then you know I do some kind of total body and then I usually do the workout but you can you can you can play around with with the components as well it's just you want to make sure that the body's prepped for whatever's ahead especially if you're going to do a FES5 power because you want everything to work the way that it's meant to work before you have them going 100% out you know and doing one to five reps and then superset it with with some kind of you know tosses throws slams or whatever the case may be. Yeah awesome and that was something that we covered in our webinar with the lake on the swell just using this using a targeted warmup that reacted to have to get prepped for those movements and then that integration activation is exactly what you said to and some basic core balance exercises and integration actually turned into some of the derivatives of Olympic weightlifting so it fits there and I'm going to to give you a really elaborate over thought metaphor and that's like if we think about OTT is a pyramid CES is kind of that mortar that keeps the bricks together keeps everything together so the pyramid doesn't fall apart and you can think about that right down the stabilization phase creating the phase all the way up to the apex of power performance so um Marty you already answered can the CES be a workout via itself but go back to something that you said way in the beginning why do we follow all four steps of this process and do you have to in a perfect world you'd follow because that's what the research shows that your best results are when you inhibit first because then we know how that has a better effect when you're trying to lengthen overactive tissue and then when you can take those two parts we know that you get a better activation and then we know when the right muscles are activated when you can now bring those together to teach human movement movements patterns you're going to re-educate as Wendy said the proper human movement patterns where all these muscles are starting to talk to each other that enter muscular coordination instead of intramuscular coordination now there are going to be a few occasions where maybe you cannot follow them but what I would say is always start with step one step two step three step four don't go step four step one step three step two if you you can't bring in foam rolling because you know someone has some type of issue where they only need a license massage therapist or you don't have the ability to teach it to them at that point because maybe they can't get on the ground you only have one type of foam roll and it's too dense yes if you have to go to the lengthening that's still going to give you better results than not lengthening before you activate but the best is when you go in that order now what I would encourage you to do though there's so many new tools on the market where Wendy and I started this and practice for you is you had one or two type of foam rollers and that was it now there's a lot of different tools you can do is with the spear you know the different size spheres different densities the handheld massage guns the sticks so you should be able to give everybody you work with the ability to find a way to do some soft tissue work on their own and then we really encourage you to have someone like Wendy or a manual therapist massage therapist that if they truly really need that level of care at least you can refer it and say hey I know you can't do this every single workout but I would love for you on occasion to get some manual therapy due to the reasons why you can't foam roll you know and then same thing just always learn new skills different versions of the static stretching not everyone can count on the ground so you got to have that wide diversity of tools in your toolbox but the toolbox doesn't change of length inhibit length and activate integrate try to follow it best you can because that's again what the research shows is our best scenario thanks and I want to follow up because you mentioned foam rollers what do you recommend what what density do you recommend do you recommend even standard foam rollers or vibration vibration rollers like you just mentioned and RB outcomes are the mechanisms by which they work the same I recommend pretty much every foam roll you can get your hands on and then with the reason I say that is because you have different size people you have different you know muscular densities you have different pain tolerances so you're going to need an arsenal back in the day when we first started this we had a foam roll it was that white one and you know once you got past you know the first couple times where it would cause some discomfort it got mostly you need brand new foam rollers almost every time because they're just the technology wasn't there yet so I honestly I bet you I have at least eight different foam rolling apparatus including a softball across ball and I'm the guy down the airplane I have the trigger point ball that I'm sitting with I'm foam rolling then because you know depending on what muscle I'm trying to hit and you know maybe if I travel and I'm sore that day I have to go down on a different density so just like any other exercise we have progressions and regressions you need the same thing with your foam rolling apparatus and even when you look at the vibrating guns a lot of them now give you different heads the choose from as well because of the density they have different speeds and different hurts they go at as well as you know how much pressure you're trying to listen into a certain muscle so definitely it's it's I highly recommend having an arsenal of things for yourself or your clients and then vibration is phenomenal you know the research is still coming out on the reasons why we can't say exactly the why we know that there's that neuro modulation of pain so you'll probably be able to tolerate more pressure due to that vibrating vibration causing the term we would use is neuro modulation of pain so it's phenomenal for that we're going to continue when I say we meaning the industry we'll continue to research on the why but right now we know it works and it works better than just standard foam rolling they're starting to narrow in on the focus but at least we can say due to that neuro modulation of pain that's at least one proof reason the vibration works there are some other theories still to be proven but I would definitely add the vibration to your arsenal for sure. Can you touch on that and can you touch on one of the the mechanical hypotheses and that is just when when the fascia and you can take this I'm going to set you up and you can take this but when the fascia doesn't move it does increase in its viscosity so how does the how does the vibrating roller and health affect sure so one of the things in Wendy can definitely touch on this as well as we know hydration is great for tissue health so let's assume someone has done a lot of workouts maybe they're dehydrated as well we know that the fascia and the tissue is not going to be as pliable so the vibration one you're going to tolerate more pressure so that means you're going to be able to activate your GTO to a higher level which means you hopefully and should be able to let it a better response but also that vibration is going to move the fluid and bring more fluid to that specific area then if you were just using a form roller that didn't vibrate so you've got you know the definitely the theory behind it is that increase in the local fluid viscosity as well as the decrease in pain will let it better responses Wendy do you have anything to add to that? Well that was actually pretty good I mean the abelaging I would the excellent Marty I mean I think you know to the vibration sometimes will decrease the pain threshold so some some people actually prefer the vibration because they're able to sit on it longer and instead of having to roll back and forth and find it they can they can literally sit marinate on it for the the amount of time to really get the benefits of what we're looking for so I mean I my my clients love it I mean again when you're using like the Viper or something you know you want to think about the floor that you're on because we have wood floors in my house and the whole house seems to vibrate or it bounces around you know so but you know people they can't get on the floor they can actually put the the foam roller on their quads and and do it themselves that way too so I mean there's a lot of great benefits if if you don't want to have like to Marty's point if you can't afford it or you don't have access to a bunch of different tools sometimes just having one of the vibration can benefit because you get the the roller with or without it turned on as well as if you want to kind of give yourself a massage you just turn it on and hold it in different spots there's a lot of benefits for for both thanks for that explanation and for those of you listening for one of you little experiment that you can do it's totally safe I went to the science college so I'm not going to give you anything that's going to blow up your house but if you want to check out you want to bring to like what they're talking about decreasing the the viscosity in your tissues by hydrating it with the vibrating roller take toothpaste put it in a dixie cup put a little water in it take your sonic toothbrush you turn it on and you'll see how that how the toothpaste then blends with the water and changes it's disgusting that's not exactly but something close to what's happening in your fashion I know that one of guys not like it I'm not sure myself if you'll put it on Instagram okay that's cool so back to you when the Marty talked about why you should do all four steps in the in the CES continuum now do you have to perform at a single assessment because we have a few and you have to perform everyone and let's talk about the two different two different cases you have someone who you've trained a while and you just reassessing them any session and see how your your training outcomes are and then compare that to someone who is just going to use that scientific term jacked up come and straight off the couch right into your studio or doing a zoom meeting if you know how you tell me your assessment process for each of those two cases okay well so when we think about the assessments remember there's multiple factors that can influence you know which assessments that you should perform so think of the clients goals first and foremost their current level of activity the capabilities and their limitations obviously super important as well as you know what you began to uncover once you start the assessment process so if you're still not sure um and asm again we're really good with with providing information but they provided a recommended assessment flow chart that you know that kind of guide you from one step to the next and then it recommends additional assessments that you can you know that you can do with your clients depending on your findings you know and as you learn more about your client and their capability to move then when you reassess you may do different assessments so with that being said you know the first time somebody comes in I usually start with obviously the the transitional type assessment so the overhead squat if they looked like they were completely a mess and and and and I mean that with love but I mean if there was a ton of compensations there feet were out knees were in huge interior tell assessively and arms are forward you know and I saw a ton of knee bogus it's not safe for me to do the overhead squat at that point so then I wouldn't do it right yeah right so but again we want to think of safety first so I I got a third a ton of information from that one assessment alone now we also have the mobility assessments that are new remember we we we we still I mean again and brace using the go knees and the M. M. T. the the manual muscle testing and stuff but because that was so difficult for people without extensive education the mobility assessments in the new CES are fantastic because literally it's still subjective meaning that you've got someone doing you know they're in different types of positions that you put them in and do they go to this this kind of degree or are they limited here and you're just kind of looking at how they move it's safe you're not putting you know it's usually you're not putting anyone in a compromise position that's going to harm them but again you're getting more information that's a little more specific because it may help pinpoint certain muscles that maybe you are unsure about based on your overhead squat so if they were quite jacked up that's what you could do on a safety standpoint now again if you have a professional athlete that comes in and they did show some compensation on the overhead squat but you still felt that they were capable and it was still safe I would do a single like squat assessment with them and then I may perform the mobility assessments because again I I still use a go any personally but again I use it every single day so I'm very comfortable with with with with that type of information but if you're not then the most mobility assessments can still fall into something you could do with that individual and then I would maybe do some of the dynamic ones because it would it would really help me on their program design because again they're very high and athletes that are already doing stuff at high speeds very powerful movements and stuff so I want to see how do they move under you know different environments so the Davies test the depth jump like those are some some other assessments you could do so again you know I wouldn't have someone that had a really a ton of compensations in an overhead squat do a dent jump it would not it would make sense or if someone's arms fell forward and they had a forward head elevated shoulders and I noticed all this a Davies may not be appropriate for for those individuals as well so so again you just want to be very cautious in and what you're doing but you just need to get the information that's going to help you design the best program possible because in four to six weeks when you reassess them you should see a ton of cleanup and every assessment that you do and you know you should see the move better they should have less compensations and I'd say they're all going to be gone but you should see a ton of them being cleaned up if not it's a programming issue and a compliance issue as well but usually it's a programming issue from the trainer that there's some stuff that you need to reconsider when you're designing their program to best you know help them with with those assessment results okay there are good so basically what you're saying is it depends on what you have in front of you exactly exactly is that what we uh that's what we got to but yeah yeah you'll you'll definitely make the decision based on what that person is showing you if you understand what you're looking for in the assessment you'll know when to stop or when to add more test based on their abilities and what they need to do so finally we're close to the end and uh this question is for both of you and before I give before I give that to you I want to ask everyone out there if you have questions this is our wrap up of CES I would like you to please send your questions to these two fine people while we have time so that they can give you uh give some answers uh and and finally what I want to ask is how has the CES helped your career let's start with you uh Marty not much you know different than the an answer that I gave on another webinar when we talked about the CPD is you know this the ability to find this earlier my career and have a system that I could reference learn and get better at his really just made my career you know it just gave me every opportunity I've had because you know I could go in and market myself differently I had some great people around me that helped me grow as well as my clients got amazing results and from that a lot of people asked me well how did you get these results so it gave me opportunities to write articles or gave me opportunities to teach and but really at the end of the day what was most impactful is my clients just noticed the difference going back to what Wendy and I talked about she gave that awesome answer on you know why you'd use it and then I just threw in there you know are you gonna make a commitment to train people or exercise people and you know let's be clear all of this stuff we're just talking science you know Wendy and I are going to do some stuff on program design the fun part can be in any program see my as we'll stick to the science you know the fun part is do you have a personality can you make it engaging but we don't have to throw the science out with it so I'm the less that I found this man almost 18 years ago you know and I've really been able to just continually use it all the time and then for me it's made me move a ton better because coming into fitness I get was into the power lifting stuff so thank God that I was able to change the way I moved earlier still not perfect but working towards because you know I was more focused on how much weight I lifted not how well did I lift the weight so personally it helped me out tremendously with my career and my own personal experiences as well that's great and Wendy what about you how is CES tell us again tell us again how is CES help your career I mean I think I kind of answered this earlier I mean because again it is and I've said this so many times but it is the foundation for everything that I do and because and it actually differentiates me from some of the other trainers that I'm around when they're doing their workouts because again I'm very specific I'm very pinpoint I'm very hands on but because I am more specific I'm my clients are moving better and they feel better so they're going to perform better and so if I can maximize their their movement patterns and you know we can get to their results faster because we're actually following a system I mean again I'm not I'm not doing anything different than what other people doing except for I do follow the acute variables I do follow you know the you know inhibition length and activate integrate with everyone and so so it's just you know it kind of separates me from the pack because I I'm very specific that way I don't I don't even know how to describe it but I think because of that people keep coming to me it's word of mouth I don't advertise myself on social media I don't do any of that you know people call me like how did you get this guy running a faster 40 and and again I didn't do any other than just correct his movement and so so I think you know the outcomes that the the clients end up getting kind of speak volumes to my training and and I owe a lot of it to the CS and and the entire OPPT model as as a whole because again the progression and the process of and being able to plug and play just makes me look better and I and I wasn't even the one that came up with the idea I'm just following the system you know so so I mean yeah I I love it I use it and it's it's helped me out and it helped me kind of separate myself from others okay thank you thank you for sharing your experience so we don't have any questions today so Wendy I want you to keep going on your line of on on that line of thought that you had there and tell us what your big takeaways are for this entire process we've spent a few weeks talking about CES what are your big takeaways and tell us how we can find you on social media since we just found out you don't you're not using it I use it I don't market myself on it I use it more for fun and play so so I think my big takeaways are you know just don't over complicate it when a client comes in get all the information you can possibly get from them on a subjective standpoint you know build your rapport interact with them look at the overall assessments that you think would be beneficial to that client and perform them and again you may later think I should have done this one but that's okay when you reassess add that new one in or maybe if they come in you can have them do a single like squat assessment but you're just having them do a single like squat exercise and then you're getting the other information that you want if you are new to this again print out these solutions table use it it will help you you don't have to know every single muscle from the start in order to be able to successfully use the CES continuum and then I think that the biggest thing for you know for me to that I can't express enough the CES shouldn't be separated from anything else in the OBT it is literally just a beginning part of a work out and then do the resistance portion so I think we need to like look at it that it should be integrated into your program design no matter what phase because you really will see positive outcomes if you do this and and it does you know and it doesn't mean that if I did static stretching I can't do some other type of stretching to prepare them for like a higher level phase you know meaning I could I can still do the activation or the static stretching and then go into active you know the active isolated or just active stretching that we're calling it now and then going into dynamic so so it's not rigid either this is not a rigid model it's just to Marty's point think about the science link them with the reactive activate what's weak and then do your workout and you will find you'll have a ton of success if you utilize it and just follow the system to find me it's uh windy dot bats at nsm dot org is my email and then my instagram is windy dot bats 13 and twitter's just windy bats 13 okay thank you very much windy it has been a pleasure over these uh over these past few weeks chatting about cds so thank you for all of your input your contributions and all of the phone calls we've had uh thank you for everything set up so now uh Dr Miller what are your takeaways and how can people find you after this is all done so I would reiterate everything when did you said so that plus I'll just say make a commitment you know make a commitment that you're going to use the model that you're going to learn to master the model because that's what the science shows and people are hiring you to get them better yes they want to burn a ton of calories potentially do some other things that they think is fitness but put them on very specific training programs and again you could still have as much fun as you need using the models you would not using the model so you might as well use it because all your answers are there for you and then from there you know just be committed to you kind of get better at it each and every day and you'll see amazing results that I promise you and then to get a hold of me my Instagram is Miller dot Marty 72 and then emails Marty dot Miller at nsm dot oarji right thank and thank you as well for all of your contributions the past few weeks it has been incredibly enjoyable and I want to thank both of you collectively for being here today and sharing your insight and hopefully everyone listening can finally start to see how C.S. can work for them and their training programs and additionally I want to thank all of you who've been with us over the past a few weeks listening and hopefully learning something and we will see you next time
