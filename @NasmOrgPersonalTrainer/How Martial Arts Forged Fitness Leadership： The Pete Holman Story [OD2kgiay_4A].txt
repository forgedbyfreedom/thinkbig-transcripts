On today's episode of the NESM CPT podcast with me Rick Richie, I explore with the help of a special guest. How to go from being a service provider as a personal trainer to being an entrepreneur. That special guest is the Ivia 22 Leadership Award recipient and my colleague and friend, Pete Holman. So in this episode, Pete talks about his inspirations including martial arts, authors that he reads and the thinkers. And he also takes on a journey from martial arts to fitness to becoming a physical therapist to creating prototypes for fitness equipment that helps solve problems in his gym and in his practice. Then he discusses all types of motivation so that intrinsic versus extrinsic. And those external drivers like money and maybe prestige are nice but the internal drivers like mastery, purpose, connection, developing ideas that solve problems, the links to things that you're passionate about. Those are the ones that are going to take. Make sure that you like, follow, subscribe and leave a five star review. Now here's the episode from service provider to entrepreneur with my friend Pete Holman. You're listening to the NESM CPT podcast with Rick Richie, winner of the shared care Emmy Award for social storytelling and the official podcast of the National Academy of Sports Medicine. Hey all and welcome to the NSM CPT podcast. My name is Rick Richie and today this is one of my favorite things about doing this podcast and the job that I have and the work that I do with an SNM is I get a chance to go to conferences and share my knowledge with other people but my favorite thing outside of sharing my knowledge with people who are there to absorb is to also learn and when I go to these conferences we have some of the best speakers, some of the most interesting educators and the people that are in this industry really inspire me. And I've had the opportunity to sit in this guy's session and sit at the feet of one of the masters who does such a great job educating and passing along information but that is far from I don't know the the smallest of titles that this gentleman has the fact that I've gone to him and listened to him speaking of conference and throughout the years we've become friends and I gotta say this this is an inspiring person because there are a lot of people out there that want to do things and they're in the fitness industry and they get these great ideas like I can't wait I've got this great idea I'm going to do this thing and I'm going to create this product and I'm going to open this facility and we have all these ideas and we don't really know what to do with them so we start out as a personal trainer and we get very excited we these big ideas and we don't know what to do with them and so we stay a personal trainer and after we provide these services for so long it's either you love it or it's time to move on because we don't know how to move on within the fitness industry people fall out of the fitness industry well this guy's figured it out and I don't know how I'm here to learn to you all so I'm super happy to introduce my guest today Pete Holman what's going on Pete? Hey what's going on Doc? Hey can I just say for those of you who are on the podcast you cannot see this but the background of Pete's place right now I mean the the the the metals he's got the the Muhammad Ali picture standing over stunning list and signed by Muhammad Ali or sunny list and I don't know which signature is that is either one's good I got to be honest it's all yeah yeah okay we have that common right are are futuristic up ratings of martial arts and and that's a great way to forge character oh absolutely you got that right I mean to go along with that I have just told you before we got on I just bought a signed ever last shorts by Muhammad Ali I've got a Tyson signed glove kind of a Gregor signed glove and then other sports that I just enjoy throughout the years with a Willie May's baseball Carmelo Anthony basketball you know like I'm and I live in this tiny apartment in New York City and I just dream of the day that I get that house outside of the city but I can put my stuff up in this comment's worth it's coming brother hey Pete I love you to death man and I absolutely respect you and what you've done in this industry and I just want you to to share a little bit about you who you are some of the things that you've done so that the people have an idea of who I'm having a conversation with. Yeah so I clinically trained on the physical therapist I've got a master's of science and physical therapy from Colorado University and I graduated 97 so that was a minute ago I'm also a certified strength and conditioning specialist that's with the NSEA and but I really got involved in this industry through martial arts of all things I was working in a health club back in the early 90s and there was a take-won dough class and I would mop the courty was in a rack about court right we had like eight racking of sports this was back in the day when everybody did rack-a-ball and squash it's now they're all hit training centers which is fine but right so I'm mopping this court across from the take-won dough guys as they trained it was like a Chinese Kung Fu movie and finally one day after this went on we got their week the instructor opened the door he said why don't you put down the mop and come train with us no way and that moment changed my life forever he he didn't just figure typically open up the door to a new type of sport that I had never been introduced to but he literally opened up the door and said get your butt in here let's go and I was actually a really good athlete I played baseball soccer football basketball across I grew up in Colorado I wanted to be a professional ski racer an extreme ski racer and just nothing really clicked and I developed very late my graduated early from high school and I just was bummed out that I never really found my sport and it wasn't until I was 20 years old I get exposed to martial arts and because I'd played soccer and I was a really good soccer player I was really good with my feet and so the coach would show me something and I'd kind of replicate a front snap kick or a side kick or a turning kick and he was just his jaws on the floor and he's like how are you doing these kicks most people will take some six nine months to learn this kick and I said well when you're used to kicking a soccer ball running down the field at full speed and you know you got a pass a crumming across the center it's really challenging and I was good at that so anyhow I just grabbed hit it towards martial arts and two years later would you believe it I would test it for my black belt and a year later I was on the US National Tech One Do Team and I was crazy to me I have years later I was the team captain at the World Championships and same peers for Russia and it just to this day I've to pinch my feet and I'm like what is happening so but the point about martial arts is this is that because I wanted to be the best on the mat or in the ring at any given day I figured out I had to learn about my body I had to learn how to train that strength out of condition how to get better agility and mobility and speed and power and effective mass and so that's what got me interested in personal training and studying my first certification was from ace I was an ace or a professional trainer and I learned about plyometrics and and all this stuff that helped me on the mat now the downside of martial arts and competing at a high level as you know Rick is your constantly injured kick to the ribs so I started trying to understand physical therapy and rehab medicine and at one point I had a pre-series knee injury I went to a physical therapist and she was so amazing and she understood anatomy and and biomechanics at a level that I just blew my mind and I said oh I'm pretty deficient and understanding how the body moves and and that physiology the body I need to take my training to the next level and that's what inspired me to become a physical therapist so really my whole career I owed to martial arts and and that one foundational moment when the guys said hey put them up down and come train with us that's really I got I'm very similar man like I don't think I would be in the fitness industry at all if I had not started martial arts and the fact is my martial arts teacher was an ace certified personal trainer and and so he would teach us martial arts but while he was doing it he would teach anatomy he would say okay this is this muscle this is that muscle and so for me I started when I was 14 which is still kind of a late start for people who are competing these days I mean you started 14 you're behind the curve you started at 20 so that is that's a prodigy into itself probably I know I know I a lot of people don't know that it's just really hard to start late because it's not in your blood it's not in brain you know a lot of these athletes now they grow in a gym yeah with their parents you know or whatever training and my daughter's playing volleyball now at the division in one level and she started club very late and it's very interesting because there's all this debate about early specialization and during my coil talks a lot about this and I know John Macdonald talks about this but early especially specialization is theoretically not that great however you can start to dabble in something and develop some skill and acquire the intelligence not just that criticism but understanding the game so volleyball very technical game a boxing kickboxing MMA very technical and precise and you have to have some reps at that or you're not going to get good so early on I think it's good at least dabble in it and then certainly play other sports but I didn't have that luxury so I did the best I could but hey better late than never now you know that's right I also want to say this and this is fun for the the people who are listening the first textbook that I ever read for personal training was from the American Council on exercise I've got an ace book because the trainer at the gym was like oh here I got this one you can read the textbook and I read it cover to cover and I was getting ready to sign up to take my ace certification and then the gym said hey we got this discount for NASN and I was like I don't know what that is but it would like it would save me like $30 over the the ace certification and I was broke and I was like for $30 I'll read a whole another textbook and you know fast forward from 2002 when I got my certification to now 2025 still NASN certified been working with NASN I'm I'm I'm in my 20th year so or yes well I'll I'll hit my 20 years of working with NASN and I don't know six months or so wow congratulations and what a wonderful culture that you and your team have built you know and that's one of the things there's multiple businesses I know you have competitors out there but it's about the culture and and I'm speaking to your you know Victorian guard up there all the NASN certified trainers and specialists you guys are doing amazing things in the industry and we owe a huge debt of gratitude to you because you guys are the future like I'm getting to be a dinosaur here so I'm gonna pass it on right and get these people upskilled here yeah man no doubt no doubt listen you and I had a little conversation I don't know if you remember as a years ago so I had just come back from a trip to Japan and and this is what made me think of it just my coffee mug that I have right now is beautiful and it's from from Japan from Kyoto and and I think I remember talking to you about it and you had said it's my favorite thing about Japan I probably ever heard and I use it all the time now you said going to Japan is like taking a masterclass in graciousness and I don't know if you remember that but it was like such a special thing because I felt that from my my soul because I just gotten back from there when I had received the 2022 personal trainer of the year award from my idea and you are on the stage that same day receiving the idea 2022 leadership award so that was a big that was a big moment for both of us yeah and you know that's I mean unfortunately that's something we've lost to some extent and our culture and in our society is just that that graciousness I think this is not to heart and back to martial arts but when you start at least in the Orthodox school I started in the tech window and that's very orthodox so it's yes sir no man you're respectful of everybody not just your senior elders but even if there's a kid that's 10 years old but they're a higher belt than you kind of relish in that and you say and it's just there's a huge baseline foundation layer of respect and gratitude and servitude that you don't necessarily see in this day and day so you know hopefully we can all kind of get back to that at some point because we're all here to learn we're here to grow we're here to help others and to be honest one of your goals and I'm saying you me anybody's goal in life should be actualizing their human potential so bringing the best out yourself but so that you can help positively impact other people and help them act wise they're human potential and boy does that raise the whole thing up I feel that very much rising tight right rising tight let's raise all ships with that being said I want to I want to shout you out not just for you know the the amazing things and the accelerated path through martial arts into some some glory that you received there as a competitive martial artist and on into physical therapy but you you provided service right so you were a service provider just like personal trainers are we provide services and I think it's it's very important because what I see and what we talked about just a moment before we jumped on the the air here is you mentioned you personal trainers providing service but they don't see themselves a lot of times it's entrepreneurs or they don't see themselves as a business person or developing a personal brand around who they are and what they do and and I always said about U.P. is that you know jealousy is not the right word I think I'm more in awe of the direction that you've gone in in the industry where it's like hey I've got an idea and I'm going to paten it and find a manufacturer and I'm going to create something and I'm going to open my own business and I'm going to now take that and say okay I've done it once I bet I can do it again and again and again I'm like dang it stop being so successful P. Yeah let's somebody else do it tell us a little bit about your your journey and then share with us kind of this conversation that we had about going from that service provider into building a brand of being an entrepreneur. Yeah well let me start backwards because you had mentioned Connor McGregor and one of my favorite quotes of all the time as Connor McGregor is sitting down as golf stream airplane right and there's somebody that could be a really bad quote latest in job. This is Connor McGregor. No this is the G-rated version okay okay. Camera pants on and he says you're such a great businessman and he says I'm not a businessman I'm a businessman and there you go it's a James. Are you talking baby? If me goose bumps yes it's how you frame it up. One person is there to serve and provide and and petal products the other the other is creating a personal brand out of yourself to create a global business. Now you might think I can be a global business. Well if you develop an app you can touch people all over the world. That's right. If you write a book even if it's an ebook you can touch people on all seven continents. If you develop a product that that products in South Africa and Ireland in South Palo Brazil you can have products all over even if you open up your own gym or a boaty training studio or a planning studio or a yoga studio people come in from out of town and they use your services and you've now impacted somebody from across the globe. So I think the framework is you can't think of yourself as a business man or business woman you have to think of yourself as a personal brand and business. So that's the spring more now it's easy to say after 30 years and I can reflect on that. But when I was starting out you're kind of like man I'm just trying to get day to day pay my bills maybe move out of my shitty apartment excuse my French in Aspen Colorado is subtraining apartment with 200 square feet and I'm trying to move into a better apartment and then maybe one day I'm trying to buy a little condo or tunnel and then maybe one day I'm trying to buy a house and when you're in it it's hard to think five years down the road 10 years down the road but I'm telling you as a personal trainer what happens is you get old fast and I mean I'm just saying like those 5 AM clients that I used to have in my 20s and 30s that were like this is fun this is exciting you get your coffee you're like let's go it's time to rock the music's turned up now that long goes off at 445 or something and you're in your 40s and your 50s it's a different story and so you have to have something to fall back on too and and thankfully I found thankfully I get frustrated easily and when I get frustrated I want to create a solution to my frustration because that seems logical to me and said it just continually getting frustrated right that's the definition of insanity just keep doing the same thing so I started getting frustrated with certain things in the fitness industry like I'd go into my physical therapy clinic and Aspen Colorado and there was stuff strewn all over the place I could never find a phone roller or the Vosu ball or my elastic resistance cords or the medicine balls or the tilt boards so I created something that was my first product ever you probably don't even know about this Rick it was called a functional training rack and it was like a medicine ball rack on steroids so I had a medicine ball rack but it was tilted at a pretty severe angle and underneath you could store tilt boards and then on the top of the rack there were little antennas that had jay hooks you could hang elastic resistance cords on there and then there was little cans that came out the side you could put phone rollers in there and then I even had these little round hoops that came off the side and you could put stability balls so it was kind of like one organization rack for all your functional training gear that every physical therapy clinic had and every you know small boutique training studio has all this stuff and it was brilliant the problem was I launched it in like 2008 and for for you young bucks in 2008 2009 we had a little dip in the economy we certainly did in other words like the earth man has well been struck by a large meteor I mean oil prices went up gas prices went up we came five and a half six bucks a gallon for gas and Aspen steel prices went up China was building arenas for the Olympics and they they imported all the steel it was just a nightmare once or a short I walked away I gave all my product to perform better which is a distribution catalog and online distributor of fitness gear and I just walked away with my tail between my legs but I learned some valuable lessons and it was kind of the school of hard knocks I felt like I had an MBA from Stanford in two years of doing a business that literally failed and granted I lost you know a lot a lot of money at that time for me but I gained the tremendous amount of knowledge and then the next product I had was an asymmetrical bar training device which has just keeps iterating itself and you if you guys have ever used a T-Rex rip trainer or a golf rubber swing trainer or a rip core effects or a core 10 trainer that was my invention that was my attempt at bringing rotational training to personal trainers and sports performance experts and athletes and asymmetrical bar training was born and that was back in 2010 and I had to play since my original product T-Rex and then after that kind of ran it's course I then licensed my product and we kind of iterated on it and now it's being used by golf forever which is a brand a big golf brand endorsed by Scotty Sheffler at one of the the best golfers in the world so it's that's the product just keeps kind of giving and reinventing itself and but the point is at some point in your fitness journey you got to start thinking outside the box and what do I want to do next and maybe it's in that maybe it's a book maybe it's your own studio maybe it's a franchise maybe it's a product but you want to have these conversations with your friends or families your coworkers with yourself and start to you know start to write some stuff down some goals you know it's interesting there was some psychologists back in the day lock late them in lock I believe they're names were and they did work on productivity and they said in their findings you're 11% to 25% more productive when you write your goals down now you guys have heard this eight billion times but I'm telling you there's research right here so this is eight billion and one time the guys you know it's your goals count start to you know draft this stuff out on paper and start to actualize your potential but if you know Emmett Smith used to say this a dream is just a dream until you're right at down once you're right it down there's some tangible thing there and there's famous athletes from the Olympics that have written their goals down every single day the numbers they want to reach the I'm actually doing this right now I'm about to compete in a couple months in a right no well no just if for my age group for concept two has these annual ski or challenge oh yeah yeah but there's rankings there's worldwide rankings I mean people from Germany from Iceland from Norway from you know all over the world do these challenges and so you can see how you how you fare against like aged people all over the world so I'm preparing for this my point is I'm writing down my times I'm writing down okay what's my goal for next week what's my goal for three weeks and then by the time I get six weeks out this is sometime in mid november that the challenges I will be in a position to actually you know execute on these on these goals and and make them a reality so you know that's a mouthful but you got to start thinking beyond your personal training career and what's next I will say that there is a lot of value when it comes to failing at things and I think there are a lot of people who are afraid to do something because they are afraid to fail and you know let's not dilute ourselves in any way fail your cost money so but but I think one of the important things that you said is you know the school of hard knocks master's degree and two years for what it is that you did you learn a lot the education that you got from the failure of this first venture turned into I've navigated it already I've explored it did not do it successfully but I have a better idea better concept in a more comfortable environment than certainly 2008 2009 and it's to me make sense you've probably dabbled a little bit came up with the ideas and had people try some iteration of it in your own clinic and your own practice and you're like there's no doubt this is this is a winner this is a plus it's gonna happen and then said okay let me go let me reach back out to my manufacturer my prototype or and all of that stuff so that you can get the ball rolling and do your best to put your own money and your own concepts out there to do round two ding ding ding and let's see if we can get up off the mat well two things you touched on that I want to double down on number one you you mentioned failing and maybe we can reframe that Rick so what if instead of saying failing like you said later just the school of hard knocks when you do something hard you're putting yourself in a position to have a level of success there's a there's a famous flow state expert name Stephen Coler and he talks about flow state and he says when you do hard things over and over again and then you have some let up of success there's hormones that are released in your body this is this is actual physiology dopamine serotonin oxytocin and door fins the all this all this stuff it's literally like taking a drug you don't get it unless you attempt something hard and then have a little bit of success and you know I'm learning the guitar right now that's my big soky you know I don't know if you guys know Jesse it's slur he talks about every year it's very challenging or hard or scary or audacious and and learning a new skill or you know sticking your neck out there and so this year I'm trying to learn how to play lead guitar I've kind of dabbled in guitar for years now and I just I've never I'm not that good I've never really you know it's like 15 minutes here 10 minutes there and this year I'm like you know what I'm learning to play guitar and I wrote down the goal and I wrote I want to play live which I just did I want to play me anymore I want to learn certain air, clap and soul is all this stuff and so you know that's that's the big thing but I fail a little riff 10 times 20 times 30 times the 31st time I do it I'm like wait wait a minute wait a minute I think I got it or that was real close and you can feel it it's like a rush of adrenaline and it's addictive and the problem is most people they'll play that riff 25 times and then they give they say I'm never going to get it this isn't for me this is too hard this is too challenging so the key is this repetitive you know not failing but doing hard work and getting the reward and if you think back to any time this goes for anybody listening close your eyes for a second think back to any time in your life maybe it's getting through school maybe it's studying for your nasum test and taking it maybe it's going through a relationship breakup but there's light on the other side maybe it's changing jobs or careers or studios that you work at maybe it's learning a martial art or a musical instrument everything that is worthwhile is worth challenging yourself to overcome the adversity on and every time I think back to my martial arts testing for my black belt I think to graduating from a master's program in physical therapy not the sharpest shed and you know tool in the shed but I did it somehow by the way I was training and competing on the US team while I was in graduate school I mean I'd come back from a tournament the Pan Am Games in Canada with with 20 scar 20 stitches over my eyebrow and I learned the show I've been class with on Monday I'd have a neuro test and I looked white and yellow and I was trying to take my neurology test and the teacher actually had you know grace on me to say why don't you come back to tomorrow I'm just giving it a day or two I got you but everything I've done getting married having a child training for these little you know events that that put me out my comfort zone everything that I've ever achieved in my life that's been meaningful has come out of cost and that's what it's all about so you can't it's like the universal paradox you can't have success you can't have enjoyment you can't have that feeling of a steam and accomplishment without going through the grip that's a 100% all right ladies and gentlemen this episode of the

All right I'm here with my friend Pete Holman and I don't know if you've picked up on the energy but there's a lot that's emanating out right now and I am here for it and I'm so happy to be able to talk to him about what he's been through what those successes look like and what are those things that let's say failure so the thing the learning curve that it takes to get to some of those successes the grit that it takes to go through and Pete mentioned Jesse Itzler and he's to train at a gym that Jesse trained out of and he and his cousin would come in and they would work like monsters they were they I mean it was a residential gym and then you know everybody's kind of easy going to residential gym and all the sudden it was like a CrossFit studio in there where they were box jump in and they were burpying across the thing and then David Goggins shows up and then you thought there was crazy at first now it's crazy or there's a lot of or a lot of crazy or at the end of that it got wild and then I even had a chance to do a session with Jesse and taking through a workout so it was probably nap time after having gone through a month with David Goggins training but we got through it we did it together and much respect to him because the mindset that that guy has is so delightful if you guys don't follow Jesse Itzler J. E. S. S. E. E. E. E. E. Itzler on on his social media platforms you should check him out because he is he is a lot inspiring and one thing that I may like to do one day is do his Everest challenge and I don't know I peat you look like you know what it is so for those of you who don't know what Jesse Itzler's Everest challenge is he's got a home I think and Connecticut that he and his wife have and their bazillion kids and what he does is he said you know I I don't have the time to go climb Everest and they he could certainly make that time he was like but what I do is I practice for it by going up and down the hill in my backyard and what you go up it a hundred odd times then that equals how many times you would go up Everest and then he started inviting people to it and they do an Everest climb where you climb to the top of Everest on his hill at his house in Connecticut and from what I've heard since then he's going to start doing an iteration of that in different places throughout the country and I think that would be pretty dope thing to take part in. Yeah that's great and you mentioned his mindset I think it's valuable for anybody he was you don't know who he is he's kind of this white Jewish guy who was a rapper. Yep and I mean come on like you can't make the stuff up he thinks he's going to be a professional rapper and get success and somehow I want to say he licensed the song to the York Nix baby. York Nix and New York and and the song kind of took off and all the sudden this kid was on the map he's you know I don't know 18 years older 19 years old and the next thing you know he's doing business deals he's flying around he has some interest in flying in his jets because he's doing stuff and he hands up starting a company called Markey Jet which is a private jet service for people that want to fly kind of like one step above first class and and then he just kept iterating himself he's just a tremendous businessman but his mindset is that of I will not be denied I will succeed I am the man and you look at him most of us can't do this when you look in the mirror a lot there's a lot of negative chatter right even for myself sometimes I look at the mirror oh my gosh another great here oh I hope you would today gosh is that a wrinkle you know man I feel tired today like that's not the dialogue you want to have repeating your head what you want to have and your head is like hey man today is a great day to achieve the impossible yeah I feel exquisite today some bigs can happen today I can't put my finger on it but I feel the energy I feel the vibrational sources swirling around me today is my day it is my time let's have a go like that you have if you if you believe in yourself people who else is gonna believe in you I mean maybe you've got a coach or you pay somebody to train that that is that cheerleader but after that hour goes you you're back home right you're on your own and you're on your own so you have to be your home best cheerleader in your own amp or pump up guy hype guy and Jesse does this better than anybody and that's one of his messages he constantly talks about that stuff so you know let's go you know what I love about him too as he says you know I only have so many summers left to visit my kids I only have so many weekends to do this I only have so many quarters of a year to get something done and he and he's not there's no illusions about you know how long life is right and as we get older that becomes more and more clear and he at an early age was like I know that we have limits on what it is that we can accomplish in life and so he you know has got this big calendar that he works with so you can see what are your goals what are you going to reach what are you going to accomplish what are you going to do that's pretty epic that it doesn't even have to cost money but you need to go do something epic once a year and anyway this mindset is I'm so appreciated and you know I'm I'm over here and I'm hustling in my way and I'm trying to to do work in the conferences and train clients and you know build the businesses with the gyms and you know I get caught up in that and forget to take a break sometimes forget to take time away and and do things and take the family somewhere and experience life outside of that and that's that's not the type of parent I want to be and same thing with taking time out to go see my folks while I still have them and that's an important thing we do over the holidays every year and a couple years ago is like that can't be a once a year thing you know for me for me that's I've got to to take another opportunity just even if it's a long weekend or something like that to go fly down the Alabama and see my folks well and you've touched on something really interesting that I think might be valuable to people out there there's this illusion that and a constant talking point that it's all about balance life is about balance it's all about and yes but guess what it's really not life isn't balanced you know it's facing so I like to reframe balance and defyzes and so what what you can't always do is have this perfect balance now you'll hear entrepreneurs talk about this and they say oh yeah you got to be perfect balance well they're multi-caselline errors yeah free homes yeah oh you could be balanced when you got a housekeeper and you got a kid you know daycare and you got this and that and you got everything handed to you they're not handed to you but at your disposal yes after you're just having it's going near young and you're hungry and you're starting a family you're starting a business you're starting a practice you've got personal goals you got family you've got all these responsibilities it feels like a 500 pound gorilla on your back and it doesn't feel balanced but you do as you look at your life and phases and you say you know what for the next three weeks here are my goals I am going to crush it by the way people write down tons of goals I'm a rule of three's guide I all I can think about is three things like hey what are the next three big buckets I've got a new business it's called the glute slide it's a new product I'm very excited about the glute slide I don't know if you've been on one yet Rick but it's a great you know training modality for personal training gym sports performance centers at home and anyhow there's tons of stuff I want to do but what happens is it gets lost in the memory and so I just pull out three buckets and I say if I can accomplish these three things and the next three weeks hey I'm on track and then after three weeks depending on what I accomplish I have another three goals but maybe it's this for three weeks I'm going to crush my business I'm going to start I'm going to write down my goals I'm going to double down on customer service and focus on work and then the last week I'm going to make a special effort to pour into my family so maybe it's two or three day nights instead of one day night with your with your significant maybe it's instead of taking your kids out to the park on Sunday three times that week again roll three times that week I'm going to go we're going to go ice cream on Tuesday we're going to go to the to the zoo on Thursday and in Sunday we're doing some special we're going to hike up in the mountain and so you focus on family and now all of a sudden it's still not balanced it's three weeks to one week but the kids in your your family feels like wow he's really pouring into me and they could hold on to that memory and that experience for a few weeks and then hopefully at some point you do get to the point where you're flying in your marquee jet and you're like yeah I have for my family so yeah that's hilarious I love that so much let's let's dig a little bit deeper for these personal trainers that are listening before we sign off if I'm a personal trainer and I've been providing services and I want to figure out what's my what's next what are what are your suggestions to them as they're like I see what you do I see what what Rick's done and I I want more out of my training business what's my what's next what do you have and in kind of teet up where you can say well this is where you are as a service provider this is how you move into entrepreneurship yeah and there's no textbook on this right now I go back to my my flow state expert I'm reading this book part of the impossible by Stephen Colour and honestly like the first three chapters I just keep reading those over and over again they're so money and he talks about intrinsic drivers so what most people do is they start with extrinsic drivers so I want to do car I want to house I want to cash I want to I want to be in the spotlight I want to speak at these top conferences like Rick Richie and Pete home in and I want to I want to start a new bit and I there's external drivers what you want to do is focus on intrinsic drivers so curiosity what are you curious about what get you excited what makes you think and ponder what what's a problem in the industry that you want to solve like curiosity passion again what are you what do you wake up with a burning desire to do so maybe you're training right now and you're doing general fitness and you're doing you know general populations but maybe you train somebody that is rehabbing from an ACL and there's six months out and they've been cleared and you see this is really interesting I'm talking to their personal their physical therapists I've been talking to their doctor I've been communicating I've been reading up on ACL recovery I want to maybe specialize and I want to take a little tangent well guess what when you specialize in something you're now an expert in that you charge more money well you can start to grow a business in organic ways that you're not trying that hard but you're passionate about it and who knows maybe at some point now you have an app on how to recover from an ACL injury curiosity passion and then purpose what gives you what gives you value in your life again if you're not if there's not a value to you and your system you know I could go I could probably sell washers and dryers you know because I'm a pretty decent salesman but that doesn't give me purpose that doesn't to me and bella shandy but it's like you got clean clothes but it doesn't really when I sell a glued slide to a small training studio and and nor for Virginia and they they come back to me on social media and say oh my gosh all my clients whether they've had a hip replacement or there are high level high school athlete they're all using this they're loving it they're they're getting better my trainers love it it's a new modality it's made the gym brighter place it's easier to do my job and run the gym I can attract more members that makes me feel my heart full right it gives me you got it you got to have purpose and then obviously autonomy you you want to you don't want somebody be telling you what to do and a lot of times we'll get that because you know somebody will ask you hey doctor Rick what should I be doing and then you know you're trying your best so you tell them what to do well that's what you think they should do not what they want to do they there's gotta be autonomy so they have to choose or maybe their spouse is pushing them into well you you open up one gym you really need to open up another gym and the person's saying you know what I'm really into an app right now I feel like I could could kind of spread my wings a little bit more than app and have some creativity and I can reach more people you gotta be autonomous and then here's the one the kicker so we got curiosity passion purpose autonomy these are all keys to flow state everybody wants to get in flow whether you're an athlete or your business person flow state is is the key it's like the Bruce Lee not just the unconscious right you're just reacting you're responding you're so good at what you do everything seems the door seemed to open for you the last of these intrinsic drivers is mastery self mastery and this is what people don't want to do so they want to open up a gym a private studio because they've been training in another studio and they're giving half of their earnings to somebody else which is fine because that's where you start and it will your clients and boy did that business owner give you a sheltered place with all this cool equipment and good music to train it but now you've been doing that for five years so maybe you want to open up your own gym and now you've been watching and you've got your own model well mastery means I got to now do a profit lost statement I got a right a business plan I got a research all the equipment and literally right down how much is it going to cost for each piece of equipment I've got to figure out what's my brand going to be what's my logo going to be what's my mission and my vision how what's the model going to be what's systems that I'm going to employ in this nobody wants to do all the hard work they just want to have this vision of oh wouldn't be cool to have a gym I just need to go to the university we give me a quarter million dollars and I'm up and running it doesn't work like that you've got to master your environment and this is why I think most people fail us because they write down a great concept on a napkin which is where all minds start and you mentioned earlier how does your process work it starts on an napkin I just saw the problem but then you've got to prototype you have to build now an opening a gym maybe the prototype is a 3D rendering or a graphic design or maybe it's a business deck a business plan that's 20 pages of and depth how the gyms can look and feel and operate and everything that's going to be in there you've done this Ricky you know it's easy you think oh it's easy no it's not and then you start crunching numbers and you got to figure out how much do I need to make what is my base membership how much do I need to train the charts the trainers etc etc all this work is the self mastery and if you look at anybody that's had success you know this is in Malcolm Gladwell's tipping point he studied the beatles from 1960 to 1964 played thousands of gigs at this bar in hamper Germany and everybody thought the Beatles were this amazing type band and they were all prodigies no they played like seven hours a night seven yeah remember that people for four year straight and then all said they had a mast over ten thousand hours of practice time now granted the first few hundred hours you think it was awesome and they they probably had some moments and then it probably had some string spray and you know off key tones and oh I played the wrong chord and the timing was off but boy you start to get that seven eight nine ten thousand hour mark all said man they're tight they mastered their crap and in order to have flow in order to launch a business in order to be a high level athlete in order to be successful at anything you've got to have these intrinsic drivers and you got to the final one is self mastery and that's the hard stuff that nobody wants to do but I believe in you you can do it I love it I feel like there was a lot of like a Ryan and DJ self determination theory built into that some Daniel Pink who talks about this and mastery and relatedness and competency and autonomy and purpose these are incredibly valuable concepts and I have so much gratitude for you for taking time out of your day to share with me and the audience
