Good afternoon everyone and welcome to NASM Live. My name is Prentice and I am here again with Wendy Bats and Marty Miller and our producer in the background Greg who I so rudely forgot the last time so I apologize for that and today we are going to you learned about the science of what goes into the OBT model. Now we're going to teach you the art of how to build a program using that science and we're going to start off today with a level one phase one stable as an endurance trend so I will let these two capable experts take it away when the tell us what we're trying to accomplish during the stabilization level. Yes I mean Prentice exactly what you said I mean based you know Marty and I have gone through the last few weeks and talked truly about the science behind the program or the OBT model why you know we do certain certain people through different phases why some of the phases are optional and then how do you know what phase is best for an individual based on the assessment results so we wanted to do another webinar and actually go through some of the different phases on how would you design a program based on you know what you receive from your assessments and so that's why we're here today. So if we go to the next slide I want to actually use a real-life client of mine. I know I spoke with or about him and previous previous webinars and I changed the name of course but and if they did you know some of these subjective information you want to get. For example you want to know their name and their age and then of course they're occupation so in this case that we're going to talk about Alex is a dentist. Some of his history is that he's played soccer in high school and he did that for the first two years of college and he stopped playing sports unfortunately due to sustaining an ACL injury that did require surgery you know and he hasn't really exercise since college and he wanted to get back into the gym he does play recreational sports or wants to get back into playing recreational sports. I'm currently he has no no issues with his knees but he does complain of lower back pain and neck pain and this is basically because as a dentist you want to think about some of the positions that this individual has to be and stay in for multiple hours throughout his day. He does not take any medication he has a clean bill of health. He did get a physical about three months ago so that's how we know that and you know we did talk about obviously the medication component like was he taking any supplements is there anything that I need to know about and of course that came back as a negative and then his current goals I mean he wants to lose 25 pounds and again when you're getting this information from your client you want to see is there a specific time frame that they want to to lose this amount of weight because again if he said he wanted to lose 25 pounds in a month you know that would be something that I wouldn't deemed realistic so luckily he said he just wants to lose 25 pounds and he wants to do it the safest and easiest way which could be over time which was fantastic but he does have that nagging pain that he wants to get rid of and he would like to join a soccer league within the next six months. So again you know the more information you can get up front by just speaking with your client that's how you start to also build your rapport which I think is super super important. So then you know Marty I don't know before we move on I mean is there anything you want to add on the subjective information side? No I think it just you're really trying to use that first session to build rapport and really find out why they came in you know sometimes you'll as you ask questions you'll find out that maybe it is the weight loss maybe it's not the weight loss just always asking those open-ended questions and being a fabulous listener and eventually you'll start to really hear what's important to them and then the wise they're there and then we use that to hold them accountable to their workouts and their training regimen because we now have the information on why they came in and what their goals are so in this current situation you know if Alex is not doing his homework that we might assign him or not coming in we can talk about that 25 pounds we can talk about that nagging pain in a positive way to just show him that hey we know we understand why you came in let's hold you accountable and get you to those goals. Now Wendy the and all of us are at some point have been health care professionals so that red flag went off in my to my a chiropractor alter ego so can you talk about the the quality character of your of your client's pain and why you said yeah we can this is something that that we can still work with in a in a training session. Well exactly I mean you know again that's why this information is so important because he said it's nagging and he often has this pain but it does go away so it's not something that you know he's he's constantly you know having to deal with it's just you know when he has a really long day at work or he's saying multiple multiple clients or even had a surgery that he might have had to go into he's in you know compromise positions because you have to think about you know when you're a dentist how you've got to move your head around and your body in different positions to get into someone's mouth the right way to do whatever it is that he's doing that particular day with that particular patient. All right awesome so let's continue let's talk about his assessment now we ready for assessment by the way Wendy. Absolutely I mean you know again we we have we've gotten the information when we're just talking to him again you know digging in the family history digging in you know because again you also want to kind of continue to talk about are you sure there's no you know other you know surgeries that you had because it never fails or like oh yeah when I was six I broke my ankle you know so again you want to try to keep digging a little bit but when you feel like you've got a good foundation a good starting point subjectively just by talking and interacting with your client then you can move into what we call more of the objective assessments which is now where we're getting the the details based on movement and the assessment results so therefore this is what we've turned as measurable results that every four to six weeks we want to go back and re you know redo these assessments to to make sure that he is moving along nicely before we we up his phase of training so for example this when this client did his overhead squat again make sure you always remove your shoes you know or have the client remove their shoes because again we don't want the shoes to be a factor and that seems to be when you look even online of how do you perform an overhead squat there's multiple pictures and multiple videos where the client is performing this particular squat with their shoes on and you definitely don't want to do that because some people wear our thoughtix and some people you know have shoes that have a heel on it you know like the Nike airs for example sometimes it puts you in a planner flex position so so you want to take it out the shoes off so therefore it's not a factor and you can truly see what's happening at the foot and ankle complex so once you have the shoes off you're going to put them in the five kinetic chain checkpoints so again toes are pointed forward the knees are in line with the second third toe hips are a neutral shoulders are back and head is back and so you may have to demo exactly what what you or how you want them to line up because if you just tell someone to point their feet forward they may point them forward even though they're slightly externally rotated so so again line them up correctly and then what I would tell you and strongly suggest is you want to demo the squat as well because some people don't understand the squat pattern or they they say that they know how to squat and they but but again you're not telling them what to do you're just going to say okay now for example try to do this and you can demo it and when you're talking about how deep to go just just kind of give them a visual of thinking just like you're going to sit in a chair so it's not you know trying to get you know but to the floor it's literally just go down in a comfortable position always keeping it pain free fully stand up and then I'm going to have you continue to do that for reps until I tell you to stop so so again if someone's more active you may want them to do more than five reps per view what I personally do is I stand in front of the client so on the anterior view I have them begin the squats I mark you know what I see on the the anterior side and then I personally keep them squatting if they're capable of doing that and they don't need a break I just walk to the side and look at them from a lateral view and then again you can peek around on the posterior view to see if there's an asymmetrical shift or their feet or really pronating you know you get a good view of it there and then I revisit the anterior side again just to see now that they they're kind of getting tired was there something else that I might have seen once I came back around that I didn't notice the first time so with this particular individual his overhead squat results he had bilateral foot external rotation so both feet turned out his left knee only cave then he did have an anterior pelvic tilt or slight arch in the low back and an excessive forward lean so he was leaning forward and then his his arms fell forward and again thinking about what he does with his job this does not seem unrealistic to me and this was kind of if you think think about like again his positioning these are pretty common compensation you would see with someone that does that type of or has that type of profession so so so basically you know again that was his results that I got from the overhead squat so you know because his left knee only cave then he did have slight external foot rotation I did feel comfortable because again he did play sports he seemed somewhat active and I wanted to kind of dig a little bit deeper so I felt it was safe for Alex to go ahead then to perform a single leg squat and so I put him again into the five kinetic chain checkpoints with his shoes off we put both hands on the hips and then from there I had him do five single leg squats again going to a depth that he was comfortable but again you know for the client to think about you know chair chair level and when we did that both left and right he had foot turning out and both knees at this time caving in so the big key here is if you see the results from the overhead squat it was only his left knee but now that we did the single leg squat it was both so because there were some mixed results there I'm actually going to use the results from the single leg squat assessment instead of the overhead squat assessment because that's more probably realistic and it does you know taken to consideration you know the base of support as well as how he does from one side to the other okay that is that's a great overview of what you did with this assessment can I throw you a curve ball? Absolutely so when we're when we're talking about assessments and you've done everything as you've outlined it here when Alex is ready to get back onto the field in place for it. Do you ever check him out do you have an additional the additional assessment in your toolbox to test him with his shoes on because sometimes you know shoes to quote to quote our fictional character Mars Blackman everyone who's been watching the last dance knows who that is you know when everything else is working and you're constantly coming in hurt it's got to be the shoes so do you ever take a look at that and see see they're moving around in their shoes to see if that drives any of those impairments. I do and that's that's actually a great point I mean when I'm doing the single leg and in the overhead squat assessments I do remove the shoes because again I want to see what's happening truly at the foot ankle however if I was going to do some more dynamic type assessments such as like the depth jump or even this the shark skill tests or if I was going to you know you know even if they were doing the Davies I know it's more upper body but they could have shoes on for those. I definitely perform perform those those assessments with shoes on and you know another big thing is even if they weren't ready for dynamic assessments you can look at their shoes especially if they've been wearing them over a certain amount of time to see the wear pattern because you can see you know is the inside of the soul worn out or is it the outside is it you know what's happening you know towards the toes and everything because it will really kind of give you some more insight on their gate and and then how they they actually walk and you know when they're in their shoes so it's a lot of really valuable information but but yes okay and I have nothing else so we're ready to see what you did what you did to train this gentleman so let's go to the template and go through the program. Well I said it's showing the template what Martin and I thought we would do is if we go back to the slide that on I mean just so you can kind of see one last time the assessment results we're going to actually show you how to build a workout utilizing this information and we're going to kind of talk you through how we came up with some of the exercise selections that we thought would benefit Alex especially the first time that he was going to begin a program with us I'm going to go ahead and and have have you have your board show up. Perfect. Okay excellent. Okay so so it's like this needs possible. Hi so Marty why don't you walk through. I'm sorry when they're lost in walk through. So yeah why don't you why don't we start with the warm up. Go through the the assessment we said that we're going to utilize the single leg squat results and we saw we noted bilateral foot external rotation and bilateral kneecaving in. So let's start up there at the warm up part of the template and let's identify what you're going to do what you're going to do self-myofash rolling on and then static stretching. Yep so it looks like Wendy is back as well I think you can hear us now want me right. I can I can and before Marty you get started and what apprentice just said I mean when we say that we're taking the the single leg squat results we are not forgetting about his anterior pelvic tilt his excessive forward lean as well as the bilateral arms falling forward. So we're just taking the results for the lower body and replacing it with the bilateral foot and the left knee on the waving end. So Marty take us through as some are what you think we should why do we do it and what do you think would be beneficial for Alex? Okay so so while we're getting Marty back we're going to think about a self-myofash rolling and again you want to think of timing because your client usually only have 60 minutes to perform you know from the time they walk into the door to the sleep so we want to be very cognitive of timing and so when you're thinking about self-myofash rolling what we're trying to do is inhibit those muscles that we have found based on the overhead results to be overactive and so that being said we because he did have foot external rotation. Struck of his calves are going to be overactive and so because it was on both sides then that would be you know an area that we would want to focus on for sure. Again this is knees both knees caved in we want to think about what causes the knees to cave in so in this all right you're about to do it again when we think about the jumping out as I was about to be able to get out of the gastroint in the knee hanging and one of the main causes that pulled in for what would be the act or complex so because of it being on both knees then we would do bilateral adjuncts of rolling or sorry roll that the act occurs bilateral and then the last one would be you know thinking about what really connects the upper body to the lower body would be the lats and so so then we want to think you know we don't want to just only pinpoint the lower body but because of where the lats insert both in the lower back is in the front of the arm it can actually cause an anterior pelvic tilt if it's overactive and the arms to fall forward which in this case with all i had both so that would be a really beneficial area to to roll as well. So when the okay jump which what uh as the marries did you assign bilateral calves? Yeah. Lateral gastrochlor more specifically and then the adductor complex as well as the lats. Perfect. Thank you. Okay so again you know when you're you're you're you're foam rolling you want to hold the tender areas for approximately 30 seconds or until you feel that the pain is reduced and you know again due to time we're just going to do approximately three because you know again that would be them doing sick because we're doing among both sides so you want to think on a timing standpoint this could go ahead and already take anywhere for three to four minutes of just rolling alone. So once the client has rolled we want to go back and now think about the proper stretches. Some already do you want to talk about which stretches um would be beneficial for one and why? Yeah absolutely so we're going to do static strategies when you're saying so in static strategy it's very easy to know what to move into that next bucket of static strategy. If you foam rolled it you should be lengthening it you identified it as overactive so both again the calf complex adductor complex and lats biolaterally because that's what you identified as the muscles you need to inhibit so we'll just drop those right back down into static and that will be the techniques that we use to get Alex ready for the next section of the workout. I know the one you could really am considering as well would be the hip flexors again as a dentist you want to think about him being in a seated position for multiple hours of the day. So tomorrow he's point you know again think about what's in the best interest after you foam roll if you go into to statically stretching muscles that would be very beneficial but if there are others that you feel that they you know you could foam roll some in static stretch so they don't always have to be the same. However you do get better results oftentimes if you do if you do what you inhibit it if you go right into stretching those as well. Okay and is there one hip flexor that you would stress over another on this case or would you would you target all of the all of the muscles in that complex. I'm thinking specifically of looking at the compensations of the knees caving in in addition to the pelvic tilt would you choose the TFL over the rectus for example. Yes I mean like I personally like the kneeling hip flexor one and because the reason being is if if I put them in a 90 90 so where they're in you know they're on one knee and they have them go and and bend the back foot up so their toe is touching the ground they're going to get a really good stretch in their quad. And then the second thing is is you when they go into a posterior pelvic tilt and they draw in and then squeeze the glute on the side of let's say that their left knee is down if they squeeze the left glute then what they're doing too is what that posterior pelvic tilt and the squeeze they're also going to really get a lot of the so as and there as well. And if you think about what the so as does it it actually connects to all the lumbar spine which we know obviously with an anterior tilt would be in a shortened position. So so that's my preference Marty I don't have anything to add or if you choose something different but no I would go by the assessment and the more you you know go through your functional ad and you'll learn these little nuances that when you're talking about you know we do show some advanced techniques in our corrective exercise how to identify you know with a modified Thomas test which one is really showing to be overactive but you know when he described it perfectly so you know he's going to be an acidic position a lot all day so definitely as long as we're addressing something in the hip flexors you know you're moving in the right direction as you get better with your techniques you might be able to find you know another assessment or two that can really differentiate if one or two of the three hip flexors really need to be targeted. Perfect. All right so once we've gone through I mean that is you know basically what we're trying to do again is to inhibit and lengthen the muscles that we found to be overactive based on on the compensations that we see so now we want to kind of flip over to the other side you know and what I mean by that is you want to think about what needs to be activated and so if you look at the OBT template under activation we have core and balance and so for Alex we want to think okay what would be again this is his first session so we don't have to make it too fancy we really want to start to activate muscles that we found to be overactive and number one is his glutes because again the anterior pelvic tilt that's a big red flag and then you can also see too when you think about some of the other things that were noted he's in a seated position all day and so we know that those those poor glutes need to be walking up a little bit so Marty what do you think would be a good activation exercise for his glutes? I love starting out with some type of bridging technique you know there's a lot of different ways to do it depends on the person's ability and what you're finding is you give them so I'll start simple you know so I I always have them do some type of glute bridge and I see can they control neutral spine can they activate their glutes and not get that cramping in their hamstring or low back and then from there as they do a couple reps I can see well this is easy form I know my progressions but I'll always start with some level of a glute bridge. Perfect I agree with that so so again in this case we could just do something simple like a floor glute bridge and again when we think about core and phase one we want little to no joint motion of the spine because again we're trying to really target and try to target those little muscles that protect the spine also what we've term inner retables stability that's actually what we're focusing on in this in this area so you know again the glutes would be a primary exercise that would be very beneficial for this client and then another one that I you know that I like you know and to try to also kind of get him out of just moving in the sagittal plane another one that that I think would be great would be something like a side plank and again instead of holding 30 to 60 seconds try to do them more as reps because oftentimes people don't know how to really draw in squeeze a glutes and maintain proper alignment for a long long period of time and then they're really using more shoulder and like foot trying to keep themselves in a in a position that quote looks good even though they're really not activating the correct muscles so coming up holding that for anywhere from three to five seconds dropping down and then repeating you know and if you think about it you could do anywhere from you know 12 12 each side even you know you could do 10 each side so you kind of need to find out what is best for the client and and truly look at their form so you never want to compromise their form for a number so you want to think often what would be great for that individual. Absolutely. Okay so now that we've activated some some muscles that we have found to be underactive then we want to think about going into balance and again you know we we have notice that his foot goes out his knees cave in and we really want to try to strengthen the muscles underneath the arch of his foot and then really work on proper alignment of the newfound length if you will so again we we phone rolls in in lengthened areas we've activated other areas and now we want to retrain the brain on how to maintain proper alignment of the joints and so for you know for this particular client what we could do is just something as simple as a single leg balance and if they if they are really really good with that then you could throw in frontal plane as well as sadgital plane reaches so if you if you notice that you know when they're going into the frontal plane that they start caving in or they can't maintain or they don't have any stability there because you need to work on that you could just do sadgital only you could do a mix of both or again because it's his first session you could just do a single leg balance and see how they do for time but if you're going to add the reaches I would suggest anywhere for about eight eight repetitions per leg per side and then oh yeah go ahead Wendy can you highlight why you're just why you're just balancing why there's no movement while when we're doing a phase one balance exercise sure and you know again you want to think that what is the purpose of phase one and again we're just training muscles to start working together quote nicely if you well and so we want little to know join or little to know motion of the stance leg and again just to reiterate what we've said before in previous webinars we don't want you know you don't want any in a motion of that and and on on the stance leg because we don't we don't worry about actually doing something like a single leg squat until we get to the resistance portion so here it's really just little to no joint motion of the stance leg we're really trying to maintain proper joint alignment and then can they maintain proper positioning within the five-connected chain checkpoints on one leg and maintain proper balance throughout okay great so what's we've done that then we usually go into some sort of play-o and again you know play-o is optional for clients in phase one and the reason being is if we notice that you know the clients they just came out of rehab they've never you know they've never really moved at a high and I say high speed doing some kind of like plyometric exercise the knee mat they may not feel comfortable on fate you know the first day of phase one doing a play-o so again you want to learn a little bit about your client this particular client is very active and wants to become active again and you know he would be a good candidate to go ahead and try to see how does he do and something as simple as a squat jump with a stabilization hold because again in plyo in phase one we're focusing on the landing mechanics and so what we've talked about you know in in previous webinars again is thinking about where you should land on the reactive portion of the foot and so just to reiterate where that is it's behind the ball of the foot but in front of the arch so if you were to bend your shoe again where that really small area is in the bend if you're shoe that's where you want that that client to learn how to land and if you notice that the feet go out or the knees move in then that's the time in the 3 to 5 second hold to re-align yourself into proper positioning and then you have them repeat it and then re-align themselves and repeat it and re-align themselves but if for some reason the client does not focus comfortable leaving the ground or you personally just want to work on the technique then you can actually have them get into a squat position like they're going to jump and they fully come up into triple extension meaning their feet do not leave the ground but they're up on their tiptoes and then you have them own the landing on the way down and so so again you're holding that 3 to 5 seconds even without leaving the ground all together okay thanks and I have one question about about the jump and you explained to us very perfectly about how one should land but what about the set up position when I when I get out into gyms give you a little context sometimes I see people when jumping they're very quad dominant not not loaded to take advantage of their their glutes at all so their glutes are kind of their rear ends are kind of pointing straight down instead of slightly back so can you talk a little bit more about that set up that may actually jump mechanics in it except the landing you already covered the landing but talk a little bit more about those jump mechanics yeah Martin you want to take this I feel like I'm just still in the show so I'm not worried so really what you're describing is where people are kind of knee dominant where their knees go forward yes so we think about this in a live workshop during this conversation I have everyone stand up ask them okay stand up tighten up your quad keep your legs as straight as possible and jump to the ceiling and they can't move and I'm like well I actually go up where do you want to go and they're like why I want to go down first so that's why we have to get more into that triple flexion position because as we go down we're stretching the glutes and the quads and they work together to propel so since I'm here and I can draw such amazing stick figures I'll erase this here in a second but what we're looking for is that perfect squat pattern to where there's that little bit of a lean forward not an excessive forward lean forward but it matches the forward shift in the lower leg with tibia fibia and now you've put primarily the glute in the stretch you can use that energy now to propel yourself into triple extension so that's why we go from triple flexion to triple extension and then as you land you want to land just like when you set on the ball you're right behind the ball your foot but you also want to land in this position because now the muscles are absorbed in the energy not the joints so you have to make sure people don't land with their legs locked and then drop into this position they need the land already in that triple flexion position and then they lower themselves down a few degrees and then they would propel those cells back up all right outstanding so now let's talk about how they're going to get let's talk about resistance training what did you pick and why did you pick it yes so just to reiterate the warm-up itself was the foam rolling the stretching and then I say the extended warm-up is the core balance reactive because we should have prepared the body now for the resistance portion of this particular phase so once they've done anywhere from two to three sets of the exercises prior they would do all core balance and reactive and then they would repeat core balance and reactive or you can do all core all balance all all reactive or or apply out depending on how you want to turn it but once they've completed that then when we go into the resistance exercises we want to think about what's ideal for phase one so again you want to think about your rep range our rep ranges are anywhere from 12 to 20 repetitions our tempo is very slow so we're actually focusing on the eccentric so decelerating so our our tempo count or our cadence would be anywhere from a four to right around a four to one and again you're just counting down these to give yourself kind of an idea on tempo because you don't always want to be like down for two you know four three two one hold one two you know so don't so don't count that out loud maybe the first time so the client starts to understand you know how fast you want them to move but then once you kind of said a really good tempo then you continuously work with them to slow things down or speed them up our rest for this particular ambit individual is zero and the reason we did zero was because we want him to minimize his rest because we want him to burn more calories and he is you know pretty active and so again because he came in with a background of activity and he wants to start to get himself ready for an a soccer league in six months we want to start kind of building that you know that kind of movement throughout so we are going to do what we're calling a vertical load so he will do one exercise then go to another then another then another and then repeat so the first exercise Marti and I chose that we thought would be beneficial for this client was a cable squat to row and Marti do you want to tell him why we chose that? Absolutely so almost exactly you know with the image I just drew is that triple flexion triple extension when you have the weight out in front of you it's an easy way for someone to learn how to squat properly clean them up now we want to help them learn how to squat properly so it helps let them sit back a little because the weights out in front of them and helps force the core to be activated and then it helps get them into that extension with retraction position or ideal posture at the top so when you and I use this that's a go to for us all the time have to be able to do a squat to row and then and then again after we do that we want to think about still challenging their course still working on you know something that would be beneficial and in somewhat unstable to this individual based on his overhead squat we actually chose to do a floor pushup and Marti you want to tell him why we did that sure so to me the pushup is nothing more than a moving plank so we're going to talk about clients choice here in a minute but you know males especially there want to do some of those chest we're going to have gone through all of the proper warmup and you know techniques to get them ready for that but now I'm sneaking in a lot more core stabilization because they're not going to be doing this pushup unless they can keep their body in that perfectly position plank and that pushup is just a transition low plank to a high plank so it's phenomenal to you know to give them what they think they want but really sneak in a lot more of that core integration and with this being you know a dentist as well I mean think about how he's got a forward head throughout the day because of his positioning so it really does help when you're having to teach him how to retract his chin and squeezing his glutes the entire time and making sure that his heels don't touch and that's something that a lot of times we forget when we're looking at the five-connected chain checkpoints or so involved in what's happening at the upper body be sure to check to make sure the heels don't touch because in order to get really good glutes squeeze a lot of times people will put their feet together and they're actually activating more of their the posterior fibers of their ad dr magnus versus their glutes which which is primarily what we want them to activate which is you know again is the glutes and drawing in so after they've done their pushup then another exercise that morning I really liked is something as simple as a single leg cobra and I say simple it's not necessarily simple for the client but there's a distinct difference between simple and easy I just want to be aware of that so Marty when it's on why we chose that yeah so especially I will after I do some type of pushing I want to get back into a polling or attraction based exercise so that even gets into how we sequence these but they're cobra of one single leg again is going to get that all those little muscles in the foot and ankle and you know the whole so we're sneaking in more that a lot of glute activation and now they're going to even again have to activate their core a lot but the simple motion of shoulder retraction depression is going to be very important for Alex because he's going to be in that position of that forward head elevated shoulders the complete opposite of a cobra all day long when he's working on his patient so this is so important for him all of us need it but especially for what he's doing for a living so that's why we put it in there and right after the pushup as well so we get back into getting our neutral position. Okay so when you're performing when you're performing this the single leg cobra and all of your other single leg exercises what's what's your preference or what do you recommend for the trainers do you recommend switching the stance leg halfway through the set or maintaining the stance leg for the duration of one set what do you do? I can answer because I was about a second sorry Wendy is it depends on how the client can control it so if they can't control it I might have them do you know that tiptoe in the back leg because it's still that's been both feet on the ground I would like them to do the one full set on the leg because I want that time under tension generally if I have three sets what all there's I might split the third set or I might put them on the leg that may need more work because I'm not afraid to work one side of the body more necessarily if that's what they're showing me so I do try to get them the complete set on one leg if possible unless they're performing techniques not good that's an assessment showing me any to progress to maybe a tiptoe type of stance. Okay great Wendy what do you since I think we lost Marty's camera so tell us about your preferences of how you manage single leg exercises. Well that's exactly that's exactly what what I do as well so I usually perform and in this case we were talking about doing 12 repetitions I would do all 12 repetitions first set and then again I would switch legs on the second set and then to Marty's point if I decided to do a third one I would look at the overhead squat and I would either do a split or if I did notice that he struggled more sometimes working on for instance you know he had a leg left knee cave in on two legs I may go back to just the left leg and work that alone as well so it kind of depends but again we're working we're looking at what can he you know how can he hold his five-can-it-change checkpoints and as long as is there's nothing compromised then we can kind of play it by ear and and do it you can do it anyway you want. Okay thank you and then one of the last exercises and again we say last because think about timing and this is the first time so we have decided that we were going to do two sets of everything and two sets of 12 at a 4-2-1 tempo you want to think about the time it takes to go through transitions teaching and everything so the last exercise we wanted to do was it was again more of a combo to get more exercises in but we both liked this step up to scapcion. I'm already do you want to tell him why we liked that? Yeah so a step up is the next logical progression from a two-legged exercise like a squat it's a transition before we get to lunches so that step up again we can control the depth from two inches four inches six inches it's what they can control we're not going to go over 90 degrees but now we're starting to teach them that triple flexion to triple extension on one leg so more time of attention and then the scapion to get is the safest position for the shoulders to be in we know the last or tight so we're not going to want to do an overhead press yet at this point so scapcion's great to activate the rotator cuff adds it a little complexity to the step up so there's a little more balance and coordination and obviously the weight that their holdings adds a little more work on the leg as well. And then again you know we would vertical load that so as soon as we got done with the step up description we would repeat and go right back into the cable squat to row and then Marty do you want to kind of take us home on the cooldown? Yes so the cooldown in this in all phase of training is going to be the same as our warm-up in this phase which is the SMR and static generally speaking so we would go right back through look at you know what muscles tend to be overactive in general what muscles did we attack we did a whole body so we'd have to look at that and then what muscles did we really need to adjust for Alex in the warm-up so at this point I recommend completing the exact same thing we did the warm-up the calf complex the addoctor complex the lats if you wanted to throw the TFL in there because that's one hip flexor that you can get with the foam roller you could do that and then same thing with the static stretching I would hit this exact same muscles that we foam roll calf complex addoctor complex the lats and hip flexors and so if you want to look at a filled out template besides Marty's board too we can go ahead and you know we can provide you with that and you can be creative but again you want to think about the purpose of it but if we went to I'd you can see the the final this is something that you're welcome to to print okay so we have this nice new space down there that nice nice new block in our clip called clients choice what do we want to do what do in that section it's right in the title but what would you have your what would you have your client to do in this space for example clients choices you can always ask them is there a certain area that you really like to to work and you know again it depends on the client you know some some females want to do more abs and some some males want to do the guns and and so at this point you know you kind of find out like in the subjective part of your assessment you know hey is there exercises that you really enjoy and then maybe at point you can add them in here so so for example with Alex Alex really likes to work his buys and tries so we could do a set of biceps and then the second set we could do a set of triceps or we could do two and two depending on our timing but it really is the client's choice is just that they want to do something that is not they're not ready for and it's not safe then just say okay that's great and we can move that on to to future workouts but right now is there anything else that you that you you know that you want to work on so you have to really be strategic on how you ask and make sure to that you let them know that you're not going to forget to do it in the future if it's something that they're not ready for right now and then to add what I do is I give them the choice put in the back of my mind I'm still going to dictate what happens meaning that if in if I'm there in phase one they want to do bicep triceps okay let's do single like bicep curls slower time under tension you're going to do your reps on your right leg the first set left leg the second set they got their biceps in but they're still following the phase and then if they want to triceps they might do a stability ball skull crusher so that way they have to have that time under tension keeping neutral spine keeping their you know glutes activated instead of just putting them on a bench or tricep rope so I'll still get creative but giving them the choice so that way I still know that my temple a temple is going to be followed okay outstanding now I'm looking at the template that you all have filled out and there's to me there's a lot this is a pretty this is a pretty tough session but we have trained in maybe the past few years and a little bit now where there's this perception of needing to be beat down in the training someone would look at this as you've written it down and say well that doesn't that doesn't look hard enough for me how do you and this is for both of you will start with you Wendy how do you as as a coach how do you manage something like that well again I don't think anyone should judge it till they do it and what I may buy that is you know you can look at any of any workout that you see in the textbook or anything that you see online but if you really do the time under tension as Marty said and you follow the acute variables this is very very challenging and this is something that you could do for our professional athlete that came in if they had some assessment results like you saw with Alex because their body were were really targeting areas and muscles that are are underactive and we know that they are based on the assessment results so just because it may look easy it's really really challenging for someone especially when you try to think about doing planks for reps or a 421 count push-up or truly doing a step up you know step up to caption and it could be a step up to balance description so it probably should have balance in there but it's it's very challenging when you're slowing everything down and trying to get the right muscles higher. I like to pause money in the back you don't follow on your first deposit you have to wait for the dividends to training is very much similar to that so Marty what are your thoughts how do you how do you talk man or maybe even wants to this not being as easy as a neighbor from paper. I think to everybody said so then just to add to that is you know you didn't hire me to destroy you you hired me to do a specific approach to it. I completely understand where maybe in the past you had different workouts or outcomes but that's why you're working with me now because I have the the best science behind with experience and a path to get you where you want to be. We're not trying to you know make it harder we're trying to make it you know systematic and obtainable and the research shows us over training is but this again with that time under tension there's a lot of volume there let's just give it a world and watch what happens in a couple of weeks and and everywhere everyone's like I feel so much better and I'm getting great results. Okay we have a question from Sergio and thank you for listening today viewing today Sergio and he wants to know how long this so we don't have to do some math now I apologize but how long would you say this workout is? This can get done in an hour and without that. Okay and if we needed to change it to 45 minutes after the first session you know we might have only done one set because it's safe that they're we're learning how to communicate to this individual they're learning how we teach and what certain terms mean so we could have spent a little more time only done one set explaining that that hey next time you know the process and you have 45 minutes or so this can be assigned to them before you guys just start the other and then this part can easily be 45 minutes yeah and I think that's that's a good point 45 minutes to an hour is it's about how long I remember Arnold saying in an interview many years ago unless you unless you have access to a pharmacy 45 minutes to an hour is plenty of time to to get very decent training session in and this one just appears to be designed right within that right within that time limit yep so does anyone else out there listening to this have questions about why they picked a why windy and mardie picked the warm up they did why they chose the resistance exercises the rationale behind building this this template at all please we want to leave today with all of your questions answered and as we're waiting for these questions to come in windy what are you take away from today and I know for a fact that you wrote you've actually documented how they can contact you after webinar but can you tell us anyway certainly and me and again the big takeaway is to look at the assessments be you know be very specific in the information that you gather to make sure that the assessments that you do make sense to you know what the clients goals are and their outcomes but then also the level of where they're starting I think you know with the exercises that we chose we are following the phase one you know kind of quote protocol to build the specific adaptation that we're looking for so we're working on stabilization endurance and you know have fun with your exercise selections try it in different planes of motion but this is just a simple one that and I say simple the exercises are challenging but it's just an easy exercise template to follow and then you can kind of plug and play your own exercises that that seem safe for your client as well and then you can see my contact information I forgot to put my Instagram on there but my Instagram sorry is a windy bat or windy dot bat 13 is my Instagram and then windy bats or windy dot bats at nsm.org okay and Marty what are your takeaways don't don't we're complicated let the time and retention the you know the work to rest ratio do the work for you or your client and when you look at the you know an addition when you're using these muscles for the first time because you've corrected some imbalances and you're moving properly that adds a whole mother layer of intensity as well because you're teaching muscle to fire that aren't used to contributing during exercise more than likely if they especially the exercise and they weren't moving well so everything is there to make it intense enough appropriately for that phase of training so don't overcomplicate it keep it simple follow the acute variables follow the form of technique and we'll take care of itself for you and then my humans are right there so Marty dot Miller at nsm and Miller dot Marty 7 2 for Instagram okay and that is a wrap today I want to thank everyone who who's a webinar today I hope that you learned something I hope that this demystifies program design a little bit I want to thank Wendy and Marty and Greg there in the background thanks everybody for for hopping on and joining us today and have a great afternoon thanks everybody
