He told me that one of the things that he always had in his head getting ready for the Olympia because he would always be training through like July and August in September in that gym right. Yeah. And he said the hotter it got in August and the worse it got because it got up to like 120 in August and they're just training in that gym. And he said that every time it got worse like it would inch up a degree, you know, you're getting into the hottest days of summer, he would just sink good, good, good. No one else is doing this. Yeah. I want the conditions of this to be as horrible as possible. I want these workouts to be as as difficult and unmanageable as they can possibly be and then that will make me ready. And it was just a mental thing. Like you just wanted it to be so brutal and hard and that when he got on stage, he knew and had done more work, right? Yeah. And so that was just like as a man, he did that over and over and over again, you know. So did Ronnie. Hey everybody, it's just bodybuilding reacts. That's the handshack. Scumming now in myself, figure out a part of it. Remember, like share, subscribe, comment and I am mutant.com, born hardcore, get your 20% off. Dusty 20, big Ron 20, get your all in, get your ISO surge and everyone should get on the gear. Scott, what is up for reacts today? What classic video are we watching? We have the entire, we're not going to watch the whole thing, but we've got the entire branch, we're an unchained DVD from 2006. We're going to skip through some of this. What do you guys want to see Branch train today and we'll fast forward to that? Oh, Dusty can pick. I don't know. I think Branch, you got to see like Chester shoulders because he's just his shoulder. Check. Okay. Like his chest is, literally, I think of stakes on his packs. All right. Let's go into Chester way. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I mean something years old. Still exactly. Yeah, we're going into Chester. Oh, perfect. I'll just bring this up a little bit. I can't get well then. So in 2006, when he shot this video, he had one a couple of smaller pro shows and he'd been eighth and 12th at the Olympia. But he hadn't won the Arnold yet. So this was pre- Arnold wins. Wouldn't even be a pre-count. What year? He won 1112. Let me ask you off. Well, pre- Arnold. Yeah. And his first, his second was in 09. So this is a few years before he goes to the O and gets that famous second to J. Yeah. So this was still, this was still kind of up and coming Branch. Branch wasn't the top five guy yet. He was still a J back in the day. Yeah, chills trainer with J. Yeah. Look at that same more, right? Yep. That's what I'm like. Wait. Wait. Wait. Everyone said it. Oh, everybody said it. Guys, you're still saying it down at that gym. Lightweight all the time. That's also a three-plate warm-up for anybody who's playing. He's just right to that. I don't know if we missed him. He's getting, but also, most people including me, like just can barely touch a chess with a bar on the incline and Branch is like sinks it into his past three inches. Yeah. He was actually getting that. The full stretch of a hit your spine, I think. Yeah. One thing I got to say about Branch, because Branch and Johnny, well, I can't, I can't say for sure, but I know Johnny's like this, but I think that Metro Flex guys are kind of like this, that style of training. Training partners have to be able to lift the same amount of weight. Oh, because they're right. Right. They don't have to bar. Yeah, like, like, if you say, you want to train chess, they're like, you can't train chess with me. I use these dumbbells. Like, really? Like, it's sort of that mentality. Like, you gotta be able to keep up on the weights to not just the intensity and stuff. Like, you know how, like, I mean, I've trained with Nadi guys at Wade 170, they were great partners, because it was all about the effort and spotting me and probably me being selfish as a competitor there, there for me and all that stuff. But that Texas at old school, like, it's that old school, you know, 100 degree heat, just Texas attitude. It's like, there's three plates on the bar and they don't come off. So, like, if you can't do this with this, you go from three to four, by the way. Yeah. There's nothing between three and four for those keeping score. Yeah, right. No. There's no conversation. But there's no prep set of, like, four reps, you know, that's in fashion right now. Yeah. Yeah. Everything's 10. 10 on everything. I like this. That belt. I always liked that red, white and blue belt that he had. I thought that was just really cool. And yeah, of course. Okay, turn the volume up. Very America. See, we got here. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want to say that at crunch next week. Do it. Oh, Dave. There we go. Hi, I'm back. What I love about watching this is it still blows my mind that people can't just say, don't worry about how branch trains look at the results. He never tore anything in the gym ever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a funny part. So it's like, I don't care what it looks like. He was missing nothing. So the only thing it, you know, the only good news for me was I knew if I were to do that, some of my joints would end up in the corners of the gym. But other than that, that was the only reason I never tried it. I just couldn't do it that way. I mean, oh, that guy heavy really quick, too. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but even though he can't do his main reps, he's not allowed to do less weight. Right. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Played off. Right. These plates only go on. Well, that's you. They really do because you don't take them back off. You walk away. See? I forget his training partner. I forget his name. I, I seen interviews with him before. Do you guys know who that is? Yeah, it's J more, isn't it? J more. Okay. I couldn't remember. Is that his last name? Yeah, that's it. This is where the plates go by the way. Just smashing into the ground. Which are they're throwing them down on purpose. Yeah. I don't agree. Yeah. We're going to flat now. Yeah. And Brian Dabson, he's all for this run. What if I came to your gym and I started throwing plates around. Let's just take a check them on the floor. What you do on your last workout at John Iran's gym? Yeah. That's about business. Yeah, what you do is to prepare his up to you. You probably have a very polite front desk staff member come over to you and go, we're going to have to ask you not to do that. And yeah. But then the second time you did it. Look, he put it to me. He can't reach that. No way. I can already tell. He's going to need an assist in the problem. He's going to be pissed. I knew he was going to be pissed. I knew he was going to be pissed. Fuck dude. Yeah. This is just a warm up. This is just a warm up. I'll put it back down. I'll do it. Yeah, he's going to adjust the lights too. It doesn't mean I'm sick too. I don't know. Is he going to leave there? No, I see. Look at me. Oh, no. He's going to leave there. Now, see. Look at me. Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was bothering me. That was a nice guy. Yeah. He was going to do that. I knew him. I was like, oh, wait. That's too high. You don't see his arms. Kill him. I forgot how intense this was to watch him train. Also look at the time between sets. Oh, yeah. Like you guys said, it's like a hundred degrees in there. Oh, worse. And that gem. Plus you're breathing through dirt. Yeah. Everything is bad. It's like mad max. There was a gem. Imagine the gem in the mad max world. You look over there's like a guy with a gas mask doing curls and then there's a guy over in the corner welding something. And there's a chance. Well, there's nothing. Yeah. Yeah. There's branch with chains around his neck. You know. Yeah, chains around his neck. Yeah. Chains are like part of the like they're part of like the fashion. Yeah. People just have chains. Like just draped on them. I do love the pace of this workout. There's a warlord executing people in the parking lot. And branches just tricking away and you ask him, what do you think of the warlord Outsuddy's like, ah, I paid attention. Yeah. He wouldn't see their locker in the house. Yeah, it was a nice spot. Yeah. I remember branch telling me when he was up here last year when they did that gasping at our gem and we like hung out for a couple days. Yeah. And we were riding around in the gaspan. The nice fan they toured in. We went up to Grouse. Grouse Mountain. We took him up to the top of Grouse Mountain and showed him around. It was really fun. But I got to like chat with branch quite a bit. And he told me that one of the things that always had in his head getting ready for the Olympia because he would always be training through like July and August and September in that gem, right? Yeah. And he said the hotter it got in August and the worse it got because it got up to like 120 in August and they're just training in that gem. And he said that every time it got worse like it would inch up a degree, you know, you're getting into the hottest days of summer, he would just sink good, good, good. No one else is doing this. Yeah. I want to. I want the conditions of this to be as horrible as possible. I want these workouts to be as as difficult and unmanageable as a compulsory and possibly be and then that will make me ready. And he was just a mental thing. Like he just wanted it to be so brutal and hard and that when he got on stage, you knew no one had done more work, right? Yeah. And so that was just like, I was like, man, he did that over and over and over again. You know, so did Ronnie, so did Johnny. So it's fine because they're also training the moment of the day like, yeah, when it's doing training the most like the coolest point because I really not. This is all I do for work. I'm like, all right, so mid nights when I train cool. Yeah. Dusty brothers own fan again. That's weird. So he did for played in clients and now he did some for played flat bench. Long enough to stop long enough to drink some water through the bottle at my ground before this, don't pick that bottle back up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's never going to get big if he keeps going to that level of failure. It's not going to happen. Don't mind about the RIR. We're going to vote for RIR. We're going to vote for RIR. It's not going to happen. Don't mind about the RIR. We're going to vote for RRI. I like that. Is that on a shirt or something because it should be that should is it is now. I like that one. Everyone's in a while. I'm happy with something I've done. I'm like, I'm like leaking my sweat all over him. I got four reps as my goal. There we go. One, two, two. I was like, oh, there we go. Oh, that is shit. You nailed it though, Ron. I would have never guessed that. I'd have been like, hey, I can't really do this. Can I go down to a three to quarter? Yeah. No. No changing plates. My hand sounds in my hand. Someone's calling somebody. I'm getting some sort of call here, I guess. But we're not answering him. I was like, what are we here? Maybe it's branch. I'm not quite sure what that was. Yeah. That's just a room. Yeah. He just had to move that. That's definitely one of those moments. So even in that gym, I would have to be like, yeah, I'd have that out because my train partners were here. Yeah. That would, you know, it would have been cleaned out for me. Unless I hated the guy. Right. Brian's like, can you guys not throw shit on your videos? Not actually throw. Brian actually probably loved it. Yeah. See the rack. See how the rack has no dumbbells actually on it. Oh, yeah. I'll just on the ground. Let's convenient. Yeah. That's just like normal. That's just totally normal. And then branches like, oh, these are right where I put them. There. Well, that's what happens when you only use the 190. So, right. So now I think there's a bit of a range allowed on the dumbbells when you train with these guys, but not a lot. We'll see if J uses the same dumbbells. Okay. We don't have to. Because you don't have to like, tell you thing off. Grab different ones. Right. But there's still that philosophical rule, you know. K, use the same dumbbells. We're training together. Man, just keep doing this. The way he presses it, she's just so freaking angry in that movement. Yeah. It's like so aggressive. I still looking at that bar that's laying on the ground half up on a bench. Oh, yeah. Crazy. That was absolutely true. I'm going to put it on it. A tripping hazard. This is a classic 2006 move after you get the, you know, pump going. Then you peel off the pump cover, right? Yeah. You got to get the pump going. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. Same dumbbells. Oh. Boom. Dumbbells were made of something different back then, because they will play. It's not as wondering. Yeah. Especially because that's like, that's like a quarter inch mat on a cement floor. Like there's no dumbbell floor there. Like you get it, you know, and Jim's got his. Oh, he got that nice dumbbell. Power. You know, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're as if you threw them. They would literally bounce into the mirror if you did that. Yeah. Oh, look at these big boys. That's what I have those, those horse stall mats in my gym. I like them here. It's for the basement. There it is. Horse mats are great. They're heavy as shit though. Oh, they are. That's the one thing. Yeah. Realized. What costs so much money in the gym is the flooring. Yeah. Those are 200. They're 200. I feel like it's like, that's the, that's the thing with like branches training. That's how complicated it is. It's like, well, we did four, play it in climb. So then you got to do four, play it flat. And then you got to do 400 pound dumbbells. Oh, 200 pound dumbbells. You got to do 400 pounds on everything. You know, let's see if we can call cemetery. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So that's eight. Oh, 170, maybe 165. Plus, there's looks like there's maybe something smaller on the end. So plus things. Oh, yeah. There's a couple things. There are like 190s in or something. Yeah, eight. And it looks like a five on there. So maybe those are like 180s with the handle. Yeah, I bet that's what it is. Two, three. And we've got these good wraps too. Yeah, touching the chest. I always like the way he, the style he pressed. Yeah. The angle of his elbows. There you go. What was he going to do for this? One for trauma. Yeah. What's that dust? Yeah, I don't know what time he was. What was he getting ready for? I mean, he's obviously in pretty good shape here. Oh. Was that his heaviest set? You think or he's going to go up? Oh, shit. Is he going to go up? Let's see. I'm going to just roll it forward a little bit here. Oh, one. It's going to the round three, four, five, six, seven, eight, same dumbbell. So he did a couple sets with them. I mean, look, a line he is now too for pushing this hard in that heat. He probably lost like three pounds of water so far. Since he got to the gym. There we go. There we go. Oh, drops that time. Oh, there you go. One tens. Yeah. And they look small back in pairs and you know what I mean? When the one tens will look small. I'll just leave those right by the other ones. Yeah, they already put away. There they go. They landed right where they go. That's amazing. Oh, then we get into the classic here. Oh, yeah. There we go. The necklace sets. Now, you know, I think I think per Bernal told me a story about the chains on the neck. Really? And how that picture like just unexpected. I think per Bernal's a guy that first took a picture of branch with the chain around his neck or something like that. I can't remember the story. All right. But anyways, it just went. He remember him saying like it. I can't believe that's one of my most viewed photos of all time or something like that. Just how crazy those pictures went that he had. Because they were in like a flex magazine or something branch dipping with chains. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, because that it became a thing like for people at local gyms. They would, but it was like that time. A little one. Yeah, it's like five pound chain. What's like Donna's choke color. I remember I was at a gym that had big chains like that. And we were training chest and the guy was training chest with. He was like, hey, it's easy. So he puts two of around his neck and then he's just staying. They're going, ow, ow, ow, take it off. Take it off. Now I start pulling the chain off because he's like a panic. He goes, take it off. Take it off. Take it off. I start taking off. He had these huge pinches on his neck. Like the chain like it is neck real hard between the links. Like it was kind of loose when I set it on him. And then when it it pulled down it like. And then I want it like pinched his neck. He had these big purple stripes on his neck. He's like, jesus fuck that hurt. That's that. He's like pussy. And then he's guys just putting them on their bare skin. Because I would ever, you know. It's probably all kinds of dead skin trapped in that chain. No one cares. Oh, very clean. I got all over them. So every night. Who that range? It's even my chain. It's even my chain. You can't go less chains. Yeah. You can't go less chains. But look at him. It's apparently working. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's why that's always my argument with everyone. Like are you going to say that branch would have had a better career if he trained differently? Yeah. And I mean look at J2 training with you. Yeah. He's getting a third of the reps. Yeah. But they're just as far. Just as many reps in reserve. So we're good. Yeah. It's negative. Exactly. I can't remember. I mean, this is still in the days where everybody was doing like one body part per day kind of thing. I can't remember if Branch would train just once a week per body part type thing. I think he just went chess back legs arm shoulders. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like what everybody did wasn't that back then. If you got real crazy, you might do like a ham day in a quad day. Yeah. Real crazy. I feel like shoulder day is kind of a non workout day. You know what I mean? Right. It's not like a lot. There's really only, you know, if you're going to do it. You know, you're good pressing movement. That's like the only compound. Yeah. And then the rest of the day got like side laterals because of cable rear delts. Yeah. You know. Other than full. Oh, I love the crossovers. Let's check the form on these. All right. That sure is so soaked. So I like those crossovers. I like the most muscular crossovers. So it's feel good. Oh, crunch crunch. You just lots of tension. And you got your body weight. You know, so you can, you can brace with your body weight because you're pushing downward. Yeah. You know, you don't lose anything out the back and I was just hated getting the weight down. Oh, God. These branch get fancy some functional training. I'm taking some course stability with this exercise. Look at these fundamentals, boys and girls basically cross foot. Base arm ross. Pretty much. They're just in jumping jacks after this for the tricep. Calestetics. Um. You know you're just going to failure at this point. Class. Just burning the house down. See, I like that. I'd a client do push up to the other day for chest finish chest. Yeah. It's good. I felt like I was like a drill sergeant suddenly. I mean, okay. Like your time traveling. Time traveling. Yeah. Everyone in the gym staring at us. What are they doing? It's a thing you've got. It's client doing. It looks like he feels down to the other side. Yeah. There we go. So after this, he does the one arm sideways hammer machine stuff. I think. That's off camera. That's off camera. Yeah. So what are the exercises dusty? What were the fancy exercises for chest? We had incline barbell. Flat bar. Flat dumbbell. And then she brought over. Dipped. Chain gifts. And then most muscular. It would cross overs. Yeah. This basically deposing class. This is like deposing after the workout. Yeah. Just a pump. Oh, super set still. Oh, God. And the gap between that super set was really short. You know, it's a good. It is a fast workout when they literally. There's no editing in this video. Yeah. It's almost like a higher workout. Yeah. Yeah. Real time. Is it only a 40 minutes of battery? That'd be enough. Yeah. I think it was eight extra minutes. All right. Let's go. Oh, he's so thick. It's incredible to see what he was able to do with this physique. I mean, he looked great as a kid. You know, like he had a different physique when he was young. But to think how much muscle he put on. Some people were like, man, you were just physique, you know. I don't see that at all. He became literally branch worn. I love that. I mean, he ruined his physique and he won multiple Arnold's right. I can't even limp yet. Right. Okay. I still remember, man, that 2009 Olympia, he came out first on the finals. The posing routines. He came out first. And oh, no, sorry, prejudging. He came out first. And I was just like, oh, man. And I just remember every single person after him. I was like, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. And it just went, no, no, no, no, no. And then J came out and I was like, oh, yeah, okay. That's a problem. And then every other person, nope, nope. I'm sure a shit, second place. You know, any happened to run into the quad stop, J. You know? The best. Yeah, yeah. Do you just run into J, you're into the DJ? I also love when people say he doesn't have good shape. Yeah, look at that. That's him as a junior. Yeah. Also check what the hairline is a junior too. Yeah. He's like, already. He's like, he's like, done already. Yeah. He's like dusty. He's like dusty. Exactly. Immediately. I still love the story about J doing the junior, USA, as or whatever. And he went one heavy weight, but he didn't win the overall. And he called Chris after the show. And he's like, hey, I, I won the heavy weight, but I didn't win the overall. And Chris goes, oh, Jesus will be. And he goes, oh, this, this middleweight named Branch Warren. And he goes, oh, well, you must set the best legs in the show. And he goes, no. No, I did. Branch. Branch Warren did. So yeah. There you go. I love that. Look at that. Damn. Yeah. We, I found that video by the way. We'll have to watch. Find it. We'll work that in one day. The, the branch versus J video from when they were kids. Yeah. Awesome. Just a noble shit guy, noble shit training. Just, it was such a fun era that whole, you know, there was always like branch and Johnny. We're like always just over here in the corner doing their thing. And everyone's like, either you can do that or you can't do that. You know what I mean? Yeah. It was always the feeling like it was like a certain way of doing things. Or like, oh, that he does the branch, the branch. More, oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it was like, yeah, the attitude to everything. But great guy. Fund to watch that old segment. And who knows, maybe he'll see this and he can, you know, come on the show and give us more insight into, you know, those different areas of his career that would be great to have. That would be cool. That'd be really cool. Yeah. Okay. Well, it's just bodybuilding reacts. We even enjoyed ourselves. Once again, Dusty Han Chau's coming.
