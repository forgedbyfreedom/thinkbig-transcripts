more vigorous intensity exercise, higher intensity exercise can potentiator lead to greater improvements in in V02 max or eliminate what's known as non-response. So some people engage in training and it's very frustrating because their V02 max doesn't change at all. And there's various reasons for that when you talk about, but for example some evidence has shown that moderate intensity continuous exercise even for six months or so doing guideline-based evidence roughly 40% of people don't see a measurable improvement in their V02 max. Now some of that non-response was eliminated in a group that was doing the same total amount of exercise but engaging in a more vigorous manner. So that would seem to argue against zone two somewhat, but I think you know there's all all-road's lead to Rome. You know there's many different strategies that you can engage in successfully and I think a big thing is what do you like? Do you like an enjoy vigorous intermittent type exercise then maybe it's for you. If you prefer continuous lower intensity moderate exercise training and that's just what you like and you absolutely hate intervals, that's okay too. Hi everyone, I'm sitting here with Dr. Martin Gabala who is an exercise physiologist and professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. I'm pretty excited to be sitting here with Marty. Perhaps he's most well known for his research on pioneering research on high intensity interval training. He wrote a very popular book called The One Minute Workout. As you know Marty I'm very excited to have you here because I feel like there's a lot of health benefits that can be achieved in a short amount of time if the right intention is there. If you are pushing hard you are doing a intense workout and for me it's very appealing as a full-time mother, full-time you know I work full-time. Time is the limiting factor for me. So maybe we could just jump right in this high intensity interval training and start with defining some of these terms or differentiating between high intensity training, HIT and high intensity interval training, HIT both short hit, right? So yeah so thanks for the opportunity. Lots of different ways to define things. I think there can be general agreement then when we say high intensity we're talking a relative heart rate of about 80% of your maximum. But there's no universal definition for high intensity training or high intensity interval training. But that would be a typical or average threshold. So about 80% of max, you're working pretty hard but it's not an all-out sprint. Again the other eye in there is just intermittent so this idea of going relatively hard backing off and repeating that pattern a couple of times. An interval training it's this thing that we seem to rediscover every decade or so. You know athletes have used it since the turn of the century but it's certainly become popular last decade or so or renewed popularity because many people cite time as a major barrier some more legitimate than others of course if it's a real-time press issue or not. Is interval training like when you say interval training because you said high intensity you're going like 80% of your max heart rate. If you're doing is interval training also that as well as just kind of interchange or is it like do you go a little bit less than that? Yeah I increasingly I like the term interval training as a more general catch-all term and again that's just relatively harder effort and backing off but it provides I think more a broader way of doing that. So if you're just starting out getting into exercise maybe just want to start out by walking fast for a few light posts and then backing it off. That's a form of interval training. Don't worry at all about whether you're at 80%. So I think of hit high intensity interval training as one type or one facet of interval training as opposed to being the be all in end all. Got it. So with high intensity interval training hit there's I've heard you talk about and you've published research you've written about it in a popular book the health benefits of high intensity interval training on VO2 max which I'm sure you're going to talk all about but recently there's been a very another form that's become very popular of training for improving VO2 max which is zone two training as defined by a lower intensity sort of lactate threshold training. However that type of training does require a pretty big time commitment I mean anywhere between three to six hours a week. So can someone achieve similar improvements or really good improvements in VO2 max? From doing let's say 20 to 25 minutes of high intensity interval training three to four times a week and if so you know what are we leaving anything on the table if you know we're not doing that long duration sort of zone two type of training. Yeah so in short I think you can do more vigorous or high intensity exercise for shorter periods of time and at least see similar improvements in VO2 max. So for the individual who is time pressed I don't think there's a need to do three to four hours of what I understand to be zone two training weekly in order to maximize improvements in VO2 max. In fact there's evidence that would suggest that more vigorous intensity exercise higher intensity exercise can a potentiator lead to greater improvements in in VO2 max or eliminate what's known as non-response. So some people engage in training and it's very frustrating because their VO2 max doesn't change at all and there's various reasons for that when you talk about but for example some evidence has shown that moderate intensity continuous exercise even for six months or so doing guideline-based evidence roughly 40% of people don't see a measurable improvement in their VO2 max. Now some of non-response was eliminated in a group that was doing the same total amount of exercise but engaging in a more vigorous manner. So that would seem to argue against zone two somewhat but I think there's all all roadside to roam you know there's many different strategies that you can engage in successfully and I think a big thing is what do you like right do you like and enjoy vigorous intermittent type exercise then maybe it's for you. If you prefer continuous lower intensity moderate exercise training and that's just what you like and you absolutely hate intervals that's okay too. Can you talk about what VO2 max is we hear a lot about it and why it's important for health longevity and maybe why athletes would be interested in it as well. Sure so VO2 max is the maximum rate of oxygen uptake by the body it's typically measured during an incremental exercise test so you get up to very high work rates and that's where you'll see your highest rate of oxygen uptake. It's determined by many physiological factors and processes but it reflects the peak integrated capacity of the cardiovascular the respiratory the blood the skeletal muscle system to take up and utilize oxygen. It's clearly important for athletes it sort of sets the ceiling you know in a challenge for athletes and many events is how close to the ceiling can you work for a fine period of time and so you know the higher the oxygen uptake the better it's also the the clinical correlate of VO2 max is cardiovascular spyratory fitness so VO2 max is the best objective measure of cardiovascular spyratory fitness and why fitness is so important epidemiological studies show having a higher cardiovascular spyratory fitness is associated with a reduction in all cause mortality dying from all causes as well as developing many different chronic diseases cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes so bottom line is having a higher fitness is better it protects you it reduces your risk of dying in developed diseases and the best way to measure that is through VO2 max test so you mentioned these these epidemiological studies these observational studies that are looking at the correlation between higher VO2 max and let's say all cause mortality there's a really I think important paper that was published in jama in 2018 that show there was an inverse relationship between VO2 max and all cause mortality with no apparent upper limit and the elite performing athletes or the elite performers had a 80% reduction in all cause mortality compared to the lowest performers with VO2 max so my question for you is do you think someone who is doing let's say you know again doing the high intensity animal training mostly and 20 25 minutes 3 or 4 times a week do you think they can be one of those elite is that like what you would think would be an elite performer in terms of their VO2 max or do you have to be an athlete how can someone do we need to do extra you know types of training on top of the the hit to really get to that level at 80% yeah and so there's there's lots of things there and I think to be clear the way that an individual may choose to engage in physical activity or exercise for their general health is completely different from a way that an elite endurance athlete might might train and that has to do with lots of things including what's the total volume of training so if you're a serious or an elite or very high level endurance athlete you're engaged in 15 20 sessions of training per week you're training 25 30 hours a week of training and the best evidence you know gleaned that's there's some scientific evidence largely you know opinion from high level coaches and athletes is about an 80 20 split there is sort of the ideal mix or ratio to optimize endurance performance so about 80% load a moderate intensity type training and 20% high intensity training much of an including interval training again that's the way the elite athlete might train who's putting in 25 30 hours a week I think that ratio can change if we're talking about someone who's engaging in one to two or three to four hours a week of physical activity and they're looking to optimize how to structure that type of training fit within the regular lives and I think there that ratio can change fairly substantially and you can incorporate I would submit that engaging in more vigorous intensity type exercise if you're only doing one two three hours a week may potentiate or give you a further boost in fit this so even even potentially one one hour one half hour hours a week because that's that's also something I mean you mentioned the 80 20 split and that's I mean I've heard about a lot and I think about it because I am not an athlete I am you know far from an athlete I am a committed you know exerciseer I guess you would call it I mean and I you know I have also very interested in longevity and improving my video two max and I want to talk about measuring that at me you know in a minute but so it's you know it's not like finding if you know is there a minimum effective dose where we can get 80% of the you know improvements in B2 max that an athlete would get I mean that you know because if I if I can get like 80 80% you know I'm I'm like that that's a good amount because there's just there's no way I will be in athlete like that's not my life I can't do that you know but I want to get those improvements in B2 max correct no and you know I would consider myself very similar I'm I'm a committed exercise you know it's in my calendar up to you're much like yours as I'm trying it but you know you're busy trying to think what's the best way to structure that but you know so a couple things I think whatever reason you're active or exercising for what what's the goal is it performance is it general health is it trying to optimize that time and I think for a lot of people it does seem to be this is how much time I have you know maybe it's one hour or week maybe it's two hours a week what's the best way that I can utilize that time to promote my my overall health and for those individuals again I would submit that there is good evidence that engaging in more vigorous intensity exercise may potentiate the gains that's not to say it's the prescription for everyone and the other thing I think we need to remember about B2 max is the greatest gains are with the smaller changes in fitness right so we totally we look at you know people who are have low moderate and high physical activity levels or low moderate and high view to max levels the greatest bang for your buck is just getting out of that low range right and then there you continue to gain benefits but you get diminishing returns and the extreme would be the elite athlete who's pretty much doing everything right to maximize their physiology and now they're really just plan on that up or margin you know what what can I possibly do to eco a little bit more gain that the way that way of thinking and training is not necessarily the way that average every day people even serious committed exercises who are primary interested in health need to think right like Stu L.E. Stu's analogy of like squeezing the wet towel on like getting the last drops out you know you know that that's something that you know maybe if I was more of an elite athlete that I would be interested in doing but right now I'm like how can I get to that you know you know where I'm at least 80 80% I'm getting that B2 max you know maybe maybe getting all of it that could like I do going going hard and getting it but you do get going hard you mentioned intensity high intensity and infiltrating 80% max heart rate there's you know calculators for maximum heart rate you know I guess it's I would say there's an equation that must be put used to 20 minus your age but that's doesn't consider fitness levels I mean there's is that would you say that's still kind of the the best way for someone who is not going to go out or should they like go doing all that sprang or something and measure their max heart rate so I and there you know 220 minus your age is still probably the most common there's a number of other formulas that have been proposed and looked at scientifically I think the key thing to remember is there's variability around that and so if we had a thousand of your listeners and they were all 40 years old we could be reasonably confident that the average maximum heart rate of those thousand listeners is 180 220 minus 40 but there's going to be tremendous inter individual variability there and what we call it the standard deviation it's around 10 beats per minute but what that means is about two thirds of your listeners would fall somewhere between 170 and 190 95% of listeners would fall somewhere between 160 and 200 and there'd be 5% on either tail to an average average average where their maximum heart rate is actually below 160 or above 200 so there's a huge range there and so when you just pick so for an individual listener now they're going to work at 220 minus their age it might be dramatically underestimating intensity or dramatically overestimating intensity so 220 minus your age it's fine I think a better way to do it is just trying measure it on yourself and there's different ways to do that the classic would be to go out to a local high school or running track and run a 400 meter or 400 yard loop one one time around as hard as you can you're going to pretty much get to your maximum heart rate by the end or if you're on a bike you know a stationary thermometer just ride at higher and higher intensity so you're increasing the watt every one minute you're putting it up 10 or 20 watts until you can't go anymore you're going to be able to measure your individual maximum heart rate whether you palpate that whether you're using the hand or whether you have a chest strap or or your monoron so bottom line is measuring it directly on yourself is always going to be better well that's those are some good suggestions that I'm going to do myself for sure because I have not done the actual test that some is a call the stress test too that some people do you stress your body to the limit exactly you know it's and so definitely you know we have people come into our lab and get tested all the time on a view to max test and we'll be able to give them their maximum heart rate measured very very accurately but it's also something you do on your own very cheaply right as as long as you're measuring it with a reasonably accurate device so it's sort of the the simple way of of getting it yeah for the VO2 max like measuring the maximum amount of oxygen you're taking in during I guess maximum exercise um there's you mentioned to me most people are very interested in that and they're not going to get that measured directly they're not going to allow like yours or to their you know physician doing it but they want to know should I do it or is there a estimator I can do that's good enough or how do I decide if I should or shouldn't like what you know like athletes probably maybe they should but you know so this count on my calculator the world fitness level you mentioned maybe you could talk just briefly about the science behind that and sure so so you know I'm not associated with this at all but world world fitness calculator is it's a valid calculator for estimating VO2 max and so what I mean by that is it's based largely on a lot of research that's been conducted in Norway in particular Norwegian technological university that they've been real pioneers in a lot of interval training research and so the bottom line is they have a lot of data on measuring things and seeing how they correlate or are related to or can predict VO2 max and so of all of the calculators that are out there I think this is the one that people could trust the most in terms of answering a few questions about their age, their sex, their typical activity levels and it will give them a reasonable estimate of their VO2 max but it's still just an estimate because it's saying you're that typical 40 year old it's not going to be able to dial in any better individually but at least it's going to give you a marker in the sand or reasonable marker and even if it's not precisely accurate you can rest assured that it's going to allow you to track changes over time so you plug your answers into the online calculator it spits out of value and says your VO2 max is 38 or 45 and then you engage in some sort of training program for three or six months and then you do it again and that if you see a directional change up or down hopefully up you can be reasonably confident that you know your training program has been effective at increasing your VO2 max even if the precise number is not 100% accurate. Yeah that makes sense you know I there's a few few factors in there that were a little more on the personalized level like your resting heart rate and your max heart rate and the MI and waste waste a hypershow and our waste a come friends I think it was so it's you know there are definitely some some features aside from your age and everything like that but also the estimation of how intense are you going with your exercise you know that's that's a net that there's a subjective component to it where I was like like a hard you know like so you know again I it's kind of good to know that you can use that that online calculator people are interested in probably doing that but for the average person do you think measuring it directly is really the other way is an in between if you will is there's submaximal exercise test and there's a number of validated tests that are out there we could drop those in the show notes but where you basically are performing a couple of levels of submaximal exercise measuring your heart rate and then essentially plugging in to an equation that's going to extrapolate and said okay with this is your rate of increase in heart rate when she get up to your maximum this is what your view to max value would be or there's you know I don't know if you have these here but the shuttle run test or a beep test where basically you're running back and forth between a set measure distance and after a point you're not able to keep up but it's called a shuttle run test or a beep test and it basically the more power you're able to exert or the more that you can keep up with as you have to get faster and faster to run between these two markers that also correlates with your view to max so bottom line is all of these are submaximal exercise tests they're better than just an online questionnaire even that validated one that I mentioned because at least it's providing some data about you you know so you can't just say um engaging in vigorous activity it's going to actually measure your heart rate a little bit so that would sort of be an in between but yeah the gold standard is having a a view to max done in an accredited laboratory and that's going to give you your view to max value directly and it's also going to give you a lot of data on your power outputs your heart rate to even your lactate in order to try and look at training zones for example with respect to other cardiovascular adaptations I mean the a two max being you know the the big one here right there's stroke volume increases cardiac output how does high intensity interval training affect this what are those how does high intensity interval training affect them maybe compared to you know moderate intensity continuous exercise yeah sure so you know what determines view to max and and as I alluded to earlier it's it's you know many physiological things but the primary there'd be general consensus scientific consensus that the primary factor that separates individuals in terms of their view to max is their cardiac output so that's what is the maximum amount of blood and in turn oxygen or the maximum rate of blood and oxygen it's being pumped out of your heart every minute and so a typical untrained individual would have a resting cardiac output of about five liters per minute so if you would measure how much blood comes out of your heart in a minute it's about five liters and maximum cardiac outputs are somewhere around 15 to 20 in you know an untrained and moderately trained individual elite athletes have maximum cardiac outputs of 40 liters per minute tremendous and so again if you could pick one variable that's going to best predict differences between individuals it would be maximum cardiac output and that's determined by how often is your heart beating every minute what's your maximum heart rate times what you alluded to your stroke volume and so that's just how much blood with each beat is squeezed out of the heart the other primary determinant would be how well your muscles mainly extract or utilize that oxygen so your your heart's pumping it out your circulation is distributing it through the body and then your muscles and your mitochondria ultimately have to use that oxygen and so for a long time there is tensioner debate around is it really the delivery side or the utilization side in terms of oxygen that limits view to max and certainly you can put people in situations where one or the other is more important but generally speaking it's the delivery side and that's primarily determined by your heart and probably why view too much view to max is such a good measure of things like or predictor of things like alcohol cause mortality cardiovascular disease mortality because probably you know a failing heart or problems with your heart is a major contributor in a lot of those diseases yeah and high intensity interval training I know it affects cardiac output right and so that another way of improving cardiac output and it is and so so you know now we're talking scientifically view to max is easy to measure you know basically any exercise physiology laboratory at any university or private clinics or medical centers they get all measure view to max well because it's a relatively non-invasive measure right you put it to when you're mouth and you measure the amount of oxygen and gas that gets expired so it's it's easy to measure all these other things that we're talking about certainly cardiac output even just think about what you would have to do to measure the maximum amount of blood that's being pumped out of your heart every minute and there are ways to do that but they're they're highly specialized they're very invasive you know requiring significant catheterization of your blood vessels so the point is there's not a lot of direct measures of of cardiac output or or stroke volume but there have been and there's also ways to reasonable ways we've used in our laboratory to non-invasively assess cardiac output and so some of those studies have looked at the effective interval versus continuous training on on cardiac output and and they've shown that more vigorous or more high intensity exercise maybe associated with greater improvements in stroke volume and cardiac output as opposed to the same dose or same total amount of continuous moderate intensity training so maybe if the dose was higher of the continuous moderate training again this sort of trade-off between duration versus intensity no absolutely and you know the other so many points to consider and you know I'm sure your audience is getting the sense you know there's a lot of nuance to all of this which is very frustrating for people because they just want to hear tell me what to do what does science say and science is always really great right it's it's not as clear as as as we would like often but you know when it comes even to exercise training studies most of my relatively short term right a three-month training study is is it a long time to measure some of these variables and so we don't necessarily know what the maximum potentially is for view two max in most individuals right and so if they engaged in longer periods of continuous moderate training would what they all get to the same level you know and maybe hit in these short-term studies just get you there the rate of improvement is a little faster than with continuous you know or are you leaving something off the table by not engaging in the more vigorous effort you know we don't conclude or we could get into a reasonable debate put it that way of of the answer saw those questions yeah you mentioned the mitochondrial component you know the the blood getting the oxygen you being delivered at the muscle and you know mitochondria using that oxygen to produce energy so maybe we can talk a little bit about some of the skeletal muscle adaptations from high intensity and little training maybe comparing contrast when we can to continuous exercise but mitochondria are very I mean it's probably one of the most important organelles inside all of most of ourselves particularly in muscle skeletal muscle and I recall quite a few studies from your lab and others showing that high intensity interval training was a very potent stimulus for mitochondrial biogenesis or the generation of new mitochondria so can you talk a little bit about I mean how hit effects mitochondrial biogenesis maybe the the difference between more continuous exercise why that's important mitochondrial biogenesis sure so you're absolutely right you know and I think even if people took high scope allergy you tend to think of mitochondria these sort of bean shaped things in your in your body but we now know mitochondria are this amazing particular network so it's a bit like if you can imagine all of your capillaries that go through your your skeletal muscle fibers the best evidence now would suggest that mitochondria sort of work the same way it's this network of organelles that that goes through muscle and and they can change right the the size of the organelle but you can have increases or decreases in in mitochondrial capacity surprisingly quickly so you can increase mitochondrial content very very rapidly certainly within a few days or or weeks of training and it seems to go the other direction pretty quick as well so when you detrain you can lose mitochondrial capacity quite quickly as as well you know so what is exercise do any type of exercise if you can imagine exercise as a stress and so all of these stress compounds are indices of stress change inside your muscles so you immediately have this large increase in demand for ATP calcium levels go up reactive oxygen species lactate hydrinians change and many of those you can think of those as fuel gauges so the sort of or fuel monitors right they're saying oh my goodness we have an energy crisis our ATP is going down this is going to signal that we need more energy and so many of those compounds those acute changes have been linked to cellular molecular signaling pathways that are associated with the growth of new mitochondria so this is the idea of mitochondrial biogenesis genesis or growth of new mitochondria and those pathways are really really well mapped out now a lot of it based on on animal research and you know very sophisticated work but largely what scene in humans is it sort of seems to work the same way so in acute boat of exercise causes increase in those signaling compounds and as I mentioned within a few days or weeks you can see measurable increases in mitochondria measured with microscopy or Western blotting there's lots of methods to to assess that now how does hit and continuous compare again we we definitely have studies on this but all of these require muscle biopsies so needle biopsie a small sample of muscle needs to be taken often by a physician or at least a highly trained individual under the supervision of a physician so they're invasive procedures and what we get a snapshot in time we don't have real time changes of how you might a country a change over days and weeks we have these little snapshots but certainly you know my laboratory a lot of other laboratories that have compared continuous and interval training there is some evidence that higher intensity more vigorous exercise when the total dose is matched can lead to at least a more rapid or larger increase in mitochondrial content again at least over the short term so is it just getting you somewhere faster and if you do enough of it over time it starts to plateau we don't really have a great answer for that right now if you are generating more mitochondria then you know this kind of goes into the fat oxidation mitochondria are the primary place where you're oxidizing fat you're using fat to to produce energy what do you think of this this concept of you know you have to be the substrate you're burning during exercise is so you have to be burning more fat while you're exercising to have adaptations for better fat oxidation after you're done with exercise just you know it's steady state at rest so in other words like you know you have to be more neurobic type of state to have those adaptations so you know mitochondria consume lots of fuels right you know the primary ones of course carbohydrate and fat so whatever you feed it feed the mitochondria as long as the capacity has a sufficient capacity for that it will burn either of those fuels but but you're right you know mitochondrial content largely limits or determines fat oxidation uh buying individual muscle or or fat oxidation during exercise is largely determined by mitochondrial content and in particular very specific enzyme your mitochondria called carnitine palmitial transferase or CPT that's sort of the gatekeeper that gets fatty acids into the mitochondria once they're inside the mitochondria they can be oxidized but there's good data to show that that's the critical enzyme and so with training you want to increase CPT levels you know people there's various supplements that are supported to increase CPT activity you know one of the reasons reasons what carnitine is a popular supplement and is it's supported to increase your your oxidation of fatty acids the date on that's you know not great but we could talk about we could talk about that as well um but yeah you know lots of debate around what's the best way to increase mitochondrial content because that in turn is going to set the upper limit for fat oxidation capacity and athletes in particular want to have a very high rate of fatty oxidization because even in very lean individuals there's lots there's ample fat on board and carbohydrate tends to be a very precious and limited fuel so ideally we'd like to preserve carbohydrate you know until we really need it like when we're we're racing and we need a very high rate of carbohydrate oxidation as well so if you're going if you're doing a high intensity you know in a well training session and you're going above 80% max heart rate you're now you know going to this lactate threshold where you're you're basically producing more lactate quicker than you can consume it potentially your anaerobic maybe I mean so you know this this idea is like that you're not going to be burning fat during that part of the exercise but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're not going to be able to burn more fat after because it does as you just mentioned increase mitochondrial biogenesis so you're actually increasing you know the capacity to oxidize fat later on I mean no absolutely so to me it's it's what's important is the increase in mitochondrial content the the overall increase in mitochondria and you know I think generally mitochondria have hundreds more than a thousand different proteins that are all necessary to build the mitochondria and they probably generally all sort of increase in decrease in in parallel right so there's not necessarily a specific way to really only boost that CPT enzyme that I talked about so I think that the most important adaptation or a critical adaptation in muscle is increasing mitochondrial content which then will allow a greater fat oxidation capacity as well as a greater carbohydrate oxidation capacity and you don't have to only work at a high rate of fatty acid oxidation in order to get that boost in mitochondria so there's there's many different ways to stimulate that including short intensive types what do you just as this sort of side note I was reading about the effect of like epinephrine nor epinephrine which are increased when you're doing more of a higher intensity type of exercise correct and that also sort of has some that I mean I was at lipoluses maybe it does so the catacolymes nor epinephrine epinephrine they're they're involved and so nor epinephrine is an important hormone that will signal at a post tissue to start to break down triglyceride and release those fatty acids into the bloodstream so you know much like we were talking about we use the analogy of oxygen or we're talking about oxygen it's delivery of oxygen and it's uptake of oxygen when it comes to fatty acid use it's delivery of the fatty acids and it's the uptake in oxidation of those fatty acids and you can definitely give people supplements that are going to increase lipoluses it's going to make more fatty acids available it's going to increase the breakdown of triglycerides but it's not necessarily going to increase oxidation so there I think there's quite good evidence that that has established that the limit for fat oxidation resides inside the muscle and it's at that level of the CPT which is that gatekeeper to get the fatty acids into the mitochondria where they can then be burned or oxidized yeah that's great and then mitochondrial biogenesis is increasing that CPT I mean if you're looking at least at a per cell you know level right you're more more mitochondria within that skeletal muscle cell sort of we were talking about this a little bit earlier off camera about you know the so talking about mitochondrial biogenesis the other sort of important factor with mitochondrial health would be my topology or mytofei g which would be the clearance of actual like sort of old damage mitochondria as you know there's definitely not a lot of evidence there's animal evidence but how much that can translate to humans is sort of unclear with respect to exercise and particularly high intensity exercise doing that but what I did when I touch on was atophygie which I think we have a little bit it's easily a little bit we've got more markers to measure it and it has been measured at least in human skeletal muscle with with respect to response to exercise and I'm just curious what your thoughts are because it has been shown that high intensity exercise is more potent for stimulating autophagy and skeletal muscle than just an overnight fast fast itself and you don't even have to be in a fasted state when you're doing the high intensity exercise which to me was like you know so what is the significance do you think for skeletal muscle health and are you guys looking at that? We don't study that in our laboratory I think the bottom line there is exercise is good for the routine maintenance or turnover of many of these cellular processes including mitochondria so it supports mitochondrial health it sort of promotes the sort of breakdown and the the building of new mitochondria so it's it's important to maintain mitochondrial health if you will the overall health or capacity of these mitochondria you know clearly I'm a proponent of vigorous intensity exercise there's some other studies out there that have shown that really vigorous exercise can temporarily impair mitochondrial capacity so if you measured a immediately post exercise or in the short term after you can engage in two vigorous in effort you basically really hammer yourselves and they sort of have a decline in function before they start to come back and so there's some criticism of interval training out there based on those studies especially very intensive wingate style all out type exercise that can transiently reduce mitochondrial capacity we're talking about different things there you know autophagy in the various processes but you know I think this is the idea that exercises a stress it temporarily disrupts or damages things and then it's all about the recovery that makes the cellular process better and we continually do that in over time things get better but certainly can we acutely over train or acutely over cause some disruption or it takes a prolonged period of time before it recovers sure it's but like you know concentric in eccentric weightlifting exercise we know that eccentric weightlifting exercise is more damaging to tissues yet more sore and so you tend to take a little bit more time to recover so not as simple as just high intensity good continuous nod or less good there's a lot of nuance there depending on the process yeah I'd love to to type dive into that a little bit more when I kind of recover some some like protocols cause that's really interesting in the windgate you know also just kind of like that's is that like an all outspread it is you can it's it's so if you've never windgate done a windgate test it's the longest 30 seconds of your life the the way to so the windgate tests are done on a specialized um rometer specialized bike that allows for very invariable intensity efforts but the the best way to think of it is if you have a stationary bike is basically getting on it setting it the highest workload possible so it's even hard to get it going and after five seconds you feel yourself starting to slow down because it's so challenging the workload is so high and so you just hang on as long as as you can what these specialized bikes do they sort of push back with just the right amount of a resistance and so it's will optimize that curve over the 30 seconds but it's an extremely demanding test and so some of our work early work was using that as a stimulus as sort of the one of the most intensive types of short hard exercise that you can do and having people do repeated uh windgate uh test very very challenging especially late in exercise you have lots of pH disturbance lots of lack to gas a production it hurts it's uncomfortable it's it's not a fun way to train yeah um I've never done one of those when we have to drive on uh the the other scale of tumultal adaptations that I think I you know there's some interest um particularly like there's so this capillary density you mentioned in my to conjugal network being sort of like that hit effect capillary density what is that yeah it does you know as a muscle physiology I think you know the two primary uh responses in muscle that are critical especially from an aerobic conditioning standpoint is the increase in mitochondria and and the increase in capillaryization so you need more the blood vessels in order to supply uh the the increase in in mitochondria within skeletal uh muscle and then of course there's other adaptations we see an increase in muscle glycogen content so you store more fuel on board that you can then uh break down you increase the transport for for many things including glucose transporters and so one of the reasons why exercise is therapeutic in the treatment of high blood blood blood sugar or diabetes you know there's lots of reasons but one of the reasons is you increase glucose transport capacity on the cell membrane and so what that means is it allows more glucose to be moved into the muscle maybe then stored as muscle glycogen and that helps to lower the blood sugar levels especially if they're chronically high and so individuals who start and engage in an exercise program one of the things that they'll find if they are diabetic because they have to reduce their diabetic medication because what's happening is the muscles more fit and rather needing the drug to try and clear the glucose your muscles doing it more naturally if you will or it's grown these new glucose transporters that helps to clear the glucose the elevated glucose from the bloodstream what how does the difference in increasing the glucose transporters or quit for transporters and muscle differ when you're doing that high intensity exercise versus more moderate yeah so for again I think for a lot of these responses that we might talk about in in muscle that there is evidence to so show that certainly high intensity exercise can cause changes in these group for transporters we've shown that including in people with type two diabetes but there's just not the body of evidence that we would like to see to definitively say one is better than the other you know we've done a number of studies showing that at least over the short term more vigorous exercise can elicit superior improvements in some of these markers but again the valid criticism is these are relatively short term studies they're not always appropriately powered many of these especially our early studies where what we like to think of is proof of concept or pilot studies you know do these things work and you know writ large we really need these randomized clinical trials to properly investigate all of these these questions what about insulin sensitivity is that also I mean so there's like you you get this glucose transport I mean that's another I mean that's one way of glucose regulation and certainly repeated I mean acute balance of exercise or probably I mean you're talking even throughout the day that would be so beneficial but also like people are you know insulin resistant to how does how does hit effect yes so there's there's various ways to measure insulin sensitivity but you know generally exercise increases insulin sensitivity there are some systematic reviews and meta analyses that have suggested that maybe more high intensity vigorous effort can lead to some greater improvements in markers of insulin sensitivity but again even though you know we think of oh systematic reviews meta analyses those are really definitive evidence but many of the underlying studies tend to be relatively small tend to be relatively low numbers of participants all of the potential bias you know not the researchers are purposely trying to bias their results but they don't always include all of the proper controls from a research design standpoint that you might like to see so sometimes the underlying evidence is is limited as well which limits the the the veracity of of the systematic reviews and meta analyses but certainly there is some evidence to suggest that bigger intensity more intense exercise may lead to some some superior benefits there you know just I assure we might hit on it later but this idea of multiple about through the day one of the things that we and some others are looking at right now or what we termed exercise snacks so these brief bouts of vigorous intensity exercise that are spread throughout the day and we're running right now to randomized controlled studies that you know our lab and the University of British Columbia my colleague professor John Littell and one of the main outcomes is measures of insulin sensitivity or like glucose control in groups that are doing these very short one minute bursts of vigorous effort spread throughout the day to try and get it exactly this question how many times a day so we're encouraging people to do at least four or five times a day of those snacks so you know we define an exercise snack as lesson or equal to one minute of vigorous intensity exercise that could be jumping on a stationary bike it could be a series of air squats or bodyweight style exercise and we're delivering in the intervention we've partnered with a company that's delivering prompts on people's cellphones and so they basically get a prompt that says hey it's time for your exercise snack that links to a little youtube video that shows the individual what they should do and we're encouraging them to do that four or five times a day more is better and we're following them for for three months 12 week intervention and we're comparing it to a movement snacks control group so a group that's getting a very similar intervention but they're not engaging in vigorous intensity exercise so it's more stretching mobility exercise and so the key variable that's changing there is the intensity of the movements and we're seeing you know how to people adhere to that like will people even do that and if they do it is it enough to move the needle in terms of things like cardiovascular spirit toy fitness blood markers of fat immune function glucose and measures of insulin sensitivity as well one of the studies that we're doing is going to be using a continuous glucose individuals with type 2 diabetes fantastic so they're going to be wearing they're wearing accelerometers as well yes yes so we're trying to track movement throughout the day and they're going to be wearing continuous glucose monitors before and after the intervention as well so this this kind of reminds me of some of the vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity studies Vylpa as you have called it that you've been a part of so this is this is though are those studies also considered exercise snacks or no so you're right Vylpa is vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity and very much led by my colleague professor Emmanuel Stamotakis out of the University of Sydney so I've been fortunate to be part of a really an international group that is looking at Vylpa in various ways but to be clear we're talking not structured exercise so you could think of Vylpa in in some ways is the non exercise equivalent of an exercise snack and so we're talking activities of daily living that you would be doing anyway and so I'll very give you a very specific example so to get to recording studio today I left my hotel I had to get here right somehow I had to get here I took a ride sharing service for for most of it but leaving my hotel room I had a choice of taking the stairs or taking the elevator I could have taken the stairs there or to get to my ride share service to walk a block I could have walked a leisurely pace or I could have picked up the pace right and said I'm I'm going to engage in a vigorous manner here arrive at the location again it's another minute to get from the ride share service to the front door I could do that in a vigorous pace or to pedestrian pace or I could carry my backpack right and engage in that and so the question there with Vylpa is in these activities of daily living that are already part of our lives if you embed vigorous effort in those you know another class could example would be you take a five hour flight get off the plane you have the choice the escalators there or you have the stairs you know many people are taking the escalator but you got some heavy backpacks you could vigorously climb up the stairs or 30 seconds to a minute that would be a dose of Vylpa right there and so again you got to move from one level to the other that's not planned and structured exercise that's just activities of daily living and the question that's being asked in that research is if people choose to do that in a vigorous manner is that meaningful and there's there's some evidence for that including a large study that was published in in December that was it mined the UK biobank data and and so what that allowed the investigators to do was look at over 25,000 individuals who engaged in Vylpa like efforts they were accelerometers to try and capture this and they were followed over almost seven years and the outcomes included all cosmortality cardiovascular disease mortality cancer mortality and that work showed revealed that people who engaged in even three to four minutes total a day of Vylpa like activity had substantial reductions in all cosmortality risks were talking 25, 30 percent so that would suggest that even brief non-exercise vigorous intermittent physical activity can move the needle in terms of health outcomes and of course we would suspect that maybe it has to do with some of these cardiovascular metabolic changes that we know are associated with health so that's not cause and effect evidence it's you know observational evidence over time but it was very robustly done the way the work was was conducted and it's quite compelling I think I agree because after you share those studies with me I read them and I think even on the higher end so you mentioned kind of the conservative you know three to four minutes a day when they were getting up to like more like nine I mean you're talking it was like 50 percent reduction in cardiovascular rate mortality 40 percent reduction in cancer related mortality I mean that's really incredible at these people are just doing this you know choosing to do these short bursts of you know vigorous intensity exercise and then having substantial benefits on you know on one you know longevity and health band basically the other if I can add the other key thing from that study I think is that all of these people were self-identified non-exerciseers and so the point is there are even people who self-identify non-exerciseers seemingly are still engaging in vigorous activity through the day and now part of that might be their their physical capacity is quite low and so what it takes to get them into a vigorous intensity ranges is not very much and actually as part of that study it was repeated in individuals who also identified as exercises and the same phenomenon were were apparent so even in exercises engaging in a VILPA like activity was still protective so again lots of work to follow up on you know what actually counts as a VILPA about you know will people do this you know but you can imagine again getting back to this idea of prompts you know building in VILPA like activities in a smartwatch or an app on a phone and encouraging you to accumulate three or four or five or ten minutes of VILPA day but you know three or four minutes of VILPA is you know about 30 minutes of vigorous activity a week and larger doxious in risk and that is very doable that is very I mean to say you can do 30 minutes a week is I mean you're really just saying I don't want to be healthy and you know the other it's interesting I don't want to go on too much of a tangent here but like you know how you wonder how much also of this of these VILPA studies and these even exercise snacks has to do it's just not being sedentary also because that's like an independent risk factor for I mean independent of exercise right so like I said I I don't consider myself a sedentary person because I engage in physical activity almost every day pretty much so I'm doing something I'm either doing my palaton and to hit workout I'm doing resistance training but I also sit at my desk for a good five hours sitting there sitting and that is when I am sedentary so I'm actually trying now to incorporate VILPA stuff I guess you know in I guess it's more structured so when it would be more of an extra snack in that case but I'm doing you know the the the burpees or the high knees or something where I mean I believe me like one minute of that I'm like this is the longest minute of my life you know I mean it's like hard so I can empathize and that I'm very similar I'm a committed exercise or pretty much I do something every day but you know as a university professor you sit at a computer a lot and so trying to build them into my day as as well but yeah I think the key there is you're right there may be a double benefit if you will you know all of us should be meeting physical activity guidelines of course you know add these in sprinkle them in but there may be a double benefit to a VILPA like approach or an exercise snack approach in that it simultaneously breaks up prolonged periods of sedentary behavior because I you know I'm sure like you I don't like to see that evidence and read those studies it suggests even if you're a committed exercise or prolonged sedentary is increasing your risk right you know we like to think of exercises this panacea and it's not it's not a vaccine against ill health outcomes in reducing sedentary behavior is really important as well as is proper sleep um so I kind of wanted to circle back just for a moment to the muscle biology aspect because um well one you're you're in expert in that arena and um we didn't touch on the how high intensity interval training affects the recruitment of muscle fiber so type one fibers type two fibers what does that mean how much does individual variation play in that equation so so you know big picture generally speaking there's two main types of muscle fibers they can be quantified different ways histically different there's different ways to measure them but uh there's slow twitch and fast twitch muscle fibers those definitions are based on basically how quickly the muscle fibers can shorten or contract and so the fast twitch or sort of fast explosive very uh very quick so we think of those associated with very fast explosive powerful movements where the the slow twitch they don't generate as much force but they don't fatigue very quickly as as well um sometimes all zero also known as type one two uh and those are generally looking at there's there's ways to measure basically the oxidative capacity how aerobic each of the muscle fibers are so there's different ways to categorize them but generally speaking two types and they differ in their characteristics the there's definitely something to the idea that we first recruit and this is known as the size principle in part based on the diameter of the muscle fibers so these slower twitch fibers these type one fibers tend to have narrower uh diameters and they tend to be recruited first so if I was to get up from the chair right here we were going to go for a walk around outside the studio um very low intensity those muscle fibers that we were to recruit to do that work are generally these slow twitch or type one muscle fibers they're good for low to moderate levels of force and they last for a long time without fatiguing then uh we need to uh get back quickly the studio or we need to run away from a a scare that's outside we suddenly have to engage in very fast movement we're going to now recruit or call in these fast twitch muscle fibers because we need more powerful muscle contractions in order to go faster we would be able to sprint away from the danger for very long because we'd eventually fatigue because these muscle these fast twitch or type two muscle fibers are uh that's one of the limitations uh of them and so that idea of progressive uh recruitment of of muscle fibers is well established what's not it's not is clean to just be able to say when we do low to moderate exercise we only recruit slow twitch or type one when we do high intensity uh we certainly don't only recruit type two we've already called on our slow twitch and then we start to recruit the fast twitch uh as well and the other point is like a lot of things it's really hard to study so you know you take a muscle biopsy sample that's hard enough right it's invasive people have to volunteer sometimes it's a little painful uh but you get your biopsy out now you have to separate these muscle fibers so you literally have to individually identify whether muscle fibers are fast or slow and then you separate them into pools and you analyze the type ones and the type two's very intricate uh time consuming work and so there's not a lot of data out there there you know a lot of animal studies that were done previously uh in rodents for example they have much more clearly defined muscles so they will have fibers muscles that are almost entirely fast twitch or muscles that are almost entirely slow twitch and so in those you can just take samples of specific muscles from a rat-hine limb for example and know that you're pretty much looking at fiber type differences human muscle is much more variable heterogeneous and so elite endurance athletes tend to have a much higher proponderance of slow twitch muscle fibers 70 80 percent uh elite strength athletes power lifters tend to have much higher proponderance of fast twitch muscle fibers but the vast majority of us are walking around somewhere around 50 50 40 60 and again that that complicates interpretation when we talk about fiber type differences to different types of exercise are we are are people more prone to losing one type over the other with age? Yes so and and so definitely there's evidence to suggest that there's progressive loss of these fast twitch muscle fibers maybe mainly or sorry maybe mainly due to the inherent aging process but again you know we could have a long discussion around whether aging is more a physical inactivity per se problem or aging per se but bottom line is we tend to lose fast twitch muscle fibers which is probably why especially as we age strength training is important in order to maintain the viability of these fast twitch muscle fibers. Does that correlate also with an increased risk in like falls and you know I think all of this aligns or certainly the theories would be that yes right and so you know we need to maintain flexibility balance all of that but certainly maintaining fast twitch muscle fibers through strength training is going to be important in order to help prevent falls and other others. With respect to the metabolism aspect of high intense interval training you know we talk we talked about the insulin sensitivity that glucose transport increasing I mean all these things are good for both people that are in the disease state like maybe type 2 diabetes or you know high glucose you know dysregulation metabolics and whatever also for people wanting to prevent also getting type 2 diabetes right I mean so there's two populations here right yeah absolutely again if you know back to the elite athlete they want to optimize all of those processes as much as they can right and the the individual who's very sedentary they really just need to do something to try and raise the bar so you know we're just talking about a massive spectrum there from very inactive very sedentary very high risk behavior to the elite athlete who as maximized almost all of these processes and is just looking for ways to further optimize that or just to get back to student allergy ring out the sponge a little bit more and of course most of us fall somewhere in this this broad range in between what about body composition weight loss obviously diet is an important component in those equations but can people use high intensity level training to help you know lose fat also even help you know there's there increase the muscle also you know is there is there is there is there role for high intensity interval training in so you're right in that you know when I tell my students that this is hardly novel that you know we control body mass mainly through nutrition but we control fitness through exercise and physical activity and so clearly exercise generally and high intensity exercise can play a role a support of role in terms of weight management body composition changes we've shown in some of our 6 and 12 week studies you can change you can have measurable changes in body composition such that there's a a slight loss of fat mass fat percentage or a slight increase in lean mass with high intensity interval training but it tends to be relatively subtle and how it compares with continuous exercise again I think the biggest thing is there's probably a time saving aspect there and so you can do less total exercise or certainly have a lower time commitment with more vigorous intensity exercise and burn the same number of calories there is something to the idea of personal trainers talk about the afterburn effect this idea of a heightened rate of metabolism in recovery we've measured it you know you look on the internet you'll see these massive differences in afterburn right where hit is way up here and moderate it's way down here it it's certainly nothing to that magnitude and but there is a difference but it tends to be relatively small and it dissipates relatively quickly but those small differences can add up over time and so you know people will say well how can high intensity be effective or how can certainly sprint type training be effective at this because you don't burn more many calories during the efforts will you do burn a greater rate of calories in in recovery and those two things can can play off but again I I think right now the best data is like a lot of things we've talked about you might get away with some time savings or a smaller total dose of exercise and still get to the same place with more vigorous activity well and contrast to that getting to the same place in my mind in my opinion one of the reasons I am so drawn in addition to the time efficiency aspect of high intensity double training is the brain effects and there's no doubt that exercise in general has global effects on the brain I mean there are improvements you do any type of exercise you look at any observational study exerciseers non exerciseers definitely you know brain benefits lower risk of you know age related diseases neurodegenerative diseases excuse me so you know not that there's not you know a role for any type of just getting your blood flow higher however I'm increasingly convinced when it comes to intensity of exercise there may be very unique benefits on the brain and that is where I think you know high intensity interval training or any type of high intensity training has a special role some of that has to do with actually wanting to increase your lactate levels so instead of this lactate threshold training that we were talking about the zone two sort of going you know right below the lactate threshold which I guess is defined various you know ways depending on who you're what you're reading or who is doing it but the lactate shuttle theory George Brooks proposed this you know it's not a theory anymore so it kind of the name kind of it's a lot of date but um can you talk just kind of briefly about the lactate shuttle theory and maybe like where the brain comes in sure so you know the lactate shuttle theory or lactate you know many of us if you look back at your textbooks you're learned that lactate was this metabolic waste product end product and it's just a metabolite like like anything else and it can be an extremely valuable fuel and we know that and there's elegant studies including from Dr. Brooks and others to show that you know first of all uh skeletal muscle can produce lactate under fully aerobic conditions so there's always some lactate production happening and certainly during more intensive exercise where we produce lactate inside the muscles it can be released from active skeletal muscle it can circulate to other places like the heart like the liver like the brain but certainly in heart can be a big consumer of lactate so it takes up that lactate can convert it back to glucose and then utilize it during exercise and so this is the idea of cell to cell or interorgan lactate exchange and I think that's very well established now I like you and you would be far ahead of me but I'm I'm following this area with with immense interest I have some colleagues at McMaster who are you know both from a cognitive psychology standpoint and also more a hardcore uh you know neurophysiology standpoint we're engaged in some collaborative research with them but generally looking at this question of physical activity and brain and probing the role of intensity there so you know my uh my understanding is mainly based on talking to my colleagues trying to read reviews of some of this research and my my sense is uh you know very well established potential mechanisms now from some of the animal studies and and the human data is certainly intriguing but you know that link between lactate, beat in F absolutely there appears to be a role for intensity there in terms of higher intensities the better in terms of you know potential beat in F bathing the brain some of these outcomes associated with neurogenesis yeah I it's the lactate and we can talk about measuring it but it's interesting because I do measure mine I do the finger prick and my workouts I'm like trying to go higher from my lactate you know and I've read a lot of study for me I'm very interested in neurogenesis um there's but on both sides of my family Alzheimer's and Parkinson's so to me I'm like I need to really focus on brain health and um so looking at the studies on lactate and um you know even if using lactate into humans it increases be the enough just confusing it and I'm like oh I get these levels from my really all out hard workouts like this is this is great um but also I feel really good so I start my day with and go into today um most most days you know at least five days a week I'm doing a and well I want to talk about protocols but I'm doing like a 10 minute you know to bodda so so I'm doing two-backed to back to bodda's actually it's two-backed to bodda's and then I have there's some you know minute minute warm up and a minute cool down I actually don't I use them more for I'm actually still going hard like half the time and then I like cool down after that minute so I like at the end I go and all out man it after my two-backed to bodda's and then I'm like I've done I cool down but um you know I do this for my brain I feel amazing and there's actually science showing that executive function is improved and it's totally correlates and this is in humans with lactate after high intensity exercise and it doesn't correlate with anything else you know glucose like nothing it's it's specific to the lactate and like you said it's a growing area of of research I am particularly interested in it like I for sure notice a difference in in terms of like if I go hard like I feel better I feel smarter I'm like more on task you know so for me it's a very important part of my protocol and I do think there's a lot of benefits for the brain so I'll have to be in touch with some of your your colleagues at McMaster because I love sharing studies and stuff that I find and learning what you know what other people are doing as well so the and maybe there's data out there on this but you know the the scientist to me is an atleast curious around things like I you know maybe now there's really really good dose response stuff in terms of exercise dose and beating F increase and some of these other measures but you know so for example is short sharp large changes in lactate better than prolonged moderate levels of lactate right and I'll I'll tell you something it's not lactate that I that I've looked into but I've looked into blood flow and sheer force and I think this is a very I think it's an emerging field looking at the effects of sheer force and and that is where I mean we're talking about a flash flood coming through if you're talking about high intensity versus just you know a little trickling and the sheer force itself at least at the blood brain barrier and this kind of when you're talking about muscle capillary I was thinking about the sheer force it in and of itself in a dose dependent manner is responsible for increasing veg F and BDNF at the blood brain barrier again dose dependent all on the sheer force effects. Mechano you know these mechanical receptors that are on cell surfaces and stuff like these are all sensing things and it's also very important so I think it's another so there's the lactate part of it where you're increasing the lactate and it's a quick sort of and it is like I've measured my my lactate spikes up you know I I don't get up to the levels that my husband I'm I'm more like a seven eight millimolar and he gets up to like 14 but it's it after 20 minutes I mean I'm back down one millimolar to my baseline basically so you know is it is there something with that you know lactate you know going intensely up it also the sheer force I think there's another interesting component to that that I think needs to be calculated into this equation because I'm seeing increasing data on that not just with respect to brain health but also people that have cancer so there's a lot of work from Justin Brown he's at I think it's too lame in New Orleans but the the sheer force and how it's affecting the circulating tumor cells so basically people that have been diagnosed with cancer you'll have a tumor cell that escapes the primary tumor site goes in circulation and that's how that's the potential to metastasize right so then ghost you know is able to travel to another organ and take up camp there or whatever so there's there's evidence that exercise in general exercise is involved in basically anything that gets your blood flow up basically those cancer cells die because they're so like disrupted and sensitive to the mechanical forces whereas normal cells are fine but it seems to also again be a dose dependent effect or the more intense the exercise the more blood flow that's going quicker the more intense the effect and also blood flow to the brain too right I mean just getting that that sheer force as well so I think there is a lot of interest there with the brain it to me is a differentiating factor from more continuous moderate exercise even longer duration obviously there's a lot of compensation probably that can happen metabolically when you're going for a longer duration you know period of time but I do see I do see something unique and I'm you know looking I'm reading the literature I'm trying to follow it as much and you know I mean it's emerging right I mean we don't really know the you know just on the topic of interval training there's now 700 papers a year coming out it makes it very challenging to stand top the literature you know and that's just in my main area so absolutely you know on the point about uh vascular stress we collaborate with some cardiovascular colleagues who are looking at this more endothelial function, flow-medated dilation not in the brain more in terms of muscle or large arteries leading to to muscle so parallels there I think in terms of some of the things you're talking about and sheer stress is in factors that are released you know to promote capillary growth there the other I want to mention around lactate levels though it's a bit like heart rate in that you know some people just have low maximal heart rates some people just have low maximal lactate values we know it's definitely related to fiber composition more fast which muscle fibers have greater potential to drive up lactate it's related to your enzymatic capacity to produce lactate so the point I just want to make maybe you're working as hard as your husband but you just don't have some of the biological traits that are going to allow you to get the very very high lactate levels you know what is your peak lactate level maybe you're already added or very close to it so don't be yourself up too much there do you think wearing a continuous lactate monitor when those exist will help me maybe right and and so I you know I'm sure we're going to get into zone two more and lactate and how we measure things in that but you know I think a challenge with lactate monitoring right now is it relies on occasional finger prick sampling there's variability in the monitors and that when we look at something like continuous glucose monitors and the evolution of that you know now we have continuous glucose monitors are combined with insulin pumps amazing right so eventually you have real time monitoring of blood glucose levels and as they change up or down the insulin can be potentiated or adjusted to get to and I I'm sure and I know people are working on this you know technically getting to the point where an athlete would use a continuous lactate monitor for training and racing I could see where that could have tremendous value whether everyone needs that I don't know you know whether you can use heart rate and some other metrics to at least get you reasonably into some zones but I can see why there would be tremendous interest in among athletes to to monitor that and really dial it in to get an idea of their metabolic stress no for sure I'm not an athlete but I'll tell you my interest would also be because before I was doing continuous glucose monitoring I wore one for around three years or so I was doing finger prick and you know I noticed before my workout you know my blood glucose levels were a certain number and then you know usually sometimes I would do it like three times because of the variation as you mentioned but after I would go higher up and I'm supposed to be like transporting more glucose into my muscles like this is ridiculous and it wasn't until I had a continuous glucose monitor on that I saw the change going way down during the exercise and then gluconeogenesis whatever's kicking in you know that it spike back up but I wouldn't have known that without that continuous you know data and I wonder with the lactate because during exercise the brain consumes it more than glucose so it actually you know you have both of them there it'll go for the lactate over the glucose and I wonder it's like oh well what's happening while I'm is it going really high is my brain consuming more of it or is it it might do not produce anymore but like you were saying like what what a continuous lactate monitor would give me some sort of peek into that because at least maybe it is going higher and I just don't see that because I'm not it's a snapshot that I'm getting after my workout right no it's a it's a it's a great point right even you know just monitoring venous levels it's not telling you anything about rates of production and utilization and so you know if some it's a really good test question in my senior class I will ask my students is a high blood lactate a good or bad thing from an exercise capacity standpoint and we tend to think well high blood lactates are bad because you know it's a so it's it's a signal that your pH is out of whack and everything like that but you could also make the case well actually transporting for a given amount of lactate production getting more out of the muscle into the blood might be a good thing because the disturbance to your muscle pH is not going to be as pronounced now you've moved the lactate to where you want it into the blood is sort of protect the muscle again it's just that it's a good thinking question I asked it to them to challenge or thought process around all of the things that control lactate but it maybe it's not all about just measuring it in the blood either is it yeah let's let's dive into that for a minute you brought up some really good points I think a couple one being you know this misconception of you know lactate or lactate acid and you know how what's actually responsible for you know the changes in osmolarity and you know that that fatiguing feeling I guess in muscle versus basically scientists in the animal training whether or not it can help I guess improve muscle fatigue through changes you know regulating the osmolarity better yeah so certainly there you can certainly you can change lactate transporters with exercise and and high intensity training and probably you know go back to athletes that were engaged in high intensity exercise to engage in high intensity type events a major adaptation there is an increase in monitor a couple of oxlate transporters MCT transporters to help get the lactate out of the muscle and you're right you know lactate acid is produced at physiological pH it rapidly dissociates into the lactate ion and the the proton the hydrogen ion and it's the changes in pH associated with the changes in protons that we know can interfere with contractile processes and enzymes and things like that so yeah complicated physiology but I think the bottom line is lactate is still a valuable measure and certainly why whether zone two training or others the notion about it's you know whether it directly can cause this fatigue probably not but it's still a really good surrogate marker or index of a lot of other things that are going on so whether it relates to osmolarity or potassium fluxes or calcium fluxes you know I think the people that really study muscle fatigue would say it it's not about lactate and pH all the time but lactate is still something that can be relatively easily monitored and it's a good proxy for you know a global look at what might be going on medibolically and I think that's where my understanding is where it's role in zone two training comes into play that makes sense so we talked about some other performance enhancements you know that that high intensity animal training complain release muscle glycogen like the storage capacity tracking about the muscle fatigue but and then we talked about the ot max which would be aerobic capacity there's also the anaerobic is it the anaerobic output is that anaerobic capacity correct and this gets back to this idea of you know if if you're event is multiple short sprints so you you play a team sport and your role on the team is to you know receive a pass or receive a ball sprint as hard as you can and then you have at least a few minutes in between plays to recover or you can then recover on on the field those individuals require very high power outputs that they can achieve repeatedly but with some affair bit of time in between and so those when we talk about anaerobic capacity the best measure or the most commonly accepted measure of anaerobic capacity is a win-gate test and that's because when we do and all out 30 second effort a large majority not all of it but a large majority of the energy is derived from anaerobic or non-oxidative metabolism and so we can quantify power output in terms of wattage on the bike and a large proportion of that power is derived from anaerobic and so for example you can measure let's say your view to max test at the end of that test you had 300 watts so your peak power output on a view to max test was 300 watts well you can do a 30 second win-gate and achieve 900, 1000 watts elite athletes elite power athletes 1500 watts on the bike so when we talk about someone who is exercising at 300% of view to max pace that's could people will max his max how can we exercise above view to max normally you're talking about it's power outputs above the view to max power output and when you're engaging these short-hard efforts they can be multiples of view to max power so this kind of reminds me of I've heard you talk about this the sprint from danger sort of pace or intensity and how I mean you know that that's that could be basically the cornerstone of a highly efficient work at now what is that can you talk about that and then maybe compare it to the windgate or maybe even this sprint interval training differences no for sure so again you know people think view to max will and max is max how can you be above max but when we talk about view to max that's max i'm a aerobic capacity and then we could have metrics to that so peak power work peak at view to max but sprint from danger pace is just that so if you had to flee a burning building the pace you might run at to save your child from an oncoming car it's well above view to max but you might only have to do it for five seconds so it would equate to top running speed and all out sprint over five or ten seconds you know even a windgate test is not true max power output the highest power output string a windgate usually occur within the first few seconds so we're talking five to 10 second efforts what's the highest work rate that you could put out what's the highest amount of ATP that you could generate much of it non-oxidatively over a five a 10 second effort at most that sprint from danger pace and you know if you're an athlete you know we hear these five zone training six zone training for many of us three zones are enough but when we talk about five and six zone what that often is referring to is discriminating work rates or power outputs above view to max and if you're the athlete looking to optimize performance you know whether you're working at 150% of view to max which you might be able to do for a minute or two or you're working at 250 300% of view to max for five or ten seconds those might be important in terms of discriminating fine changes that could further support your performance or it's for most of us it doesn't really matter we don't need to get that level of sensitivity in terms of how we structure our training at these very very high intensities or work rates so do you think there would that mean like could there be a benefit for sort of changing around our training protocol to incorporate some of that sprint I mean the O2 max benefit or you know so I do and and again this is not scientific but it makes sense to me at least and it's the old investing analogy right and so you can hit a home run with a hot stock tip but for most people they're better off to you know spread it around put your eggs in different baskets and so I think when it comes to exercise training for many individuals there's there's an analogy and and that's it maybe do different types of training and and that's so whether you're someone who really responds to sprint training or really responds to moderate we can't necessarily predict that and so varying up your training just like we spread out our risk when we invest might be the the best approach you know so should individuals engage in some short sharp hard efforts I think you know ideally speaking yes they should there's even some recent evidence I think there's renewed interest in the potential for elite endurance athletes to incorporate sprinting in their training and there's a series of studies that's that's come out Ronnastad Karsten Loonbees work showing that when truly world-class level cyclists we throw these terms around highly trained elite these are cyclists with starting view to max values 72 73 mills per kilogram per minute and they randomize them to do either traditional hit four five minute repeats or effort matched 30 seconds sprints and they sort of effort matched so whichever group you were assigned to you were working at the highest effort you could and they were worked matched and what they found was the group that incorporated the sprints had a further boost to their performance 20 minute time trial performance and they actually had a small but significant improvement in view to max and so it would suggest that maybe there might be a place for athletes to incorporate what you know some call RSTs repeated sprint training as a as a ways to further augment their performance now you know still relatively small three-week interventions but to go back to your question I think there is a place for incorporating very vigorous effort sometimes if you know it again there's some people who shouldn't do sprinting right especially if you're starting out but all things being equal yeah I think varying it up your approach is is going to be the best for general fitness I want to talk I let's let's dive in it's in protocols and this is this is very like I'm sitting here getting very very intrigued because of my training which mostly like I mentioned it's mostly on a Palaton stationary bike and it's you know again I do a lot of the 20 second on 10 second off you know back to back and I'm thinking like maybe I should also incorporate some you know I could go outside and do a hill sprint hate them hate them hate them but I mean you know if I can get if I if I can do it quick it's still convenient I just go outside and you know do this isn't like going around a track or anything which is something that I can conveniently do but also maybe potentially get even greater improvements in VO2 Max that's of interest to me I'm not an athlete but so are you so do you think that I'm so so I'm you know far would be it for me to tell you how to train but you know from what I've listened to in my awareness of the type of training that that you're doing actually think you know maybe you should do some longer intervals at a little bit lower intensity you know maybe you should be incorporating some three four five minute intervals as hard as you can go during those rather than almost exclusively doing Tabata style type training because arguably you're already doing a ton of sprint training Tabata is basically sprint training so I want to be careful here you know we could talk let's at least for now keep it modality specific so how you would train on a bike before we start talking about different modes in that because that introduces some other wrinkles but again from what I understand and what you just said earlier in our interview most of your training are these for you all out 20 seconds sprints 10 second recovery efforts I'd suggest you know and and I think Dr. Attila recently suggested you might want to do the same thing in those 10 second recovery periods almost completely stop or at least go down to very low intensity cycling because part of thing with Tabata is you go really hard but those 10 second breaks you've earned the break take it so don't maintain the intensity too high in the 10 second valleys before you go hard again but again it sounds like much of your interval training right now is already sprint type training given your Tabata's we know there's data suggests that all things being equal three to five minute repeats at the highest sustainable intensity are probably the best way to maximize gains in view to max it's pretty loaded statement but I think you probably want to incorporate some of these longer intervals two three four five minutes again highest workload you can and do for those right now that's probably going to take you at 20 minute commitment some warnings but I would say all right would encourage you to at least think about incorporating some of that style of interval training yeah absolutely how many times a week do you think yeah so again my understanding is you're doing something almost every day and I think you sort of you know you go back and forth between some resistant stuff and well the resistance is on the I and we'll talk about it as well but it's on the same days it's just later in the evening but like so that so we mentioned Tabata and then you're saying this this like like longer duration interval and it's funny because I had a question about that was like what if you let's say you know time let's say the interval where you're going all out is or at least high intensity so 80 percent is matched but instead of doing the you know shorter interval repeated repeated you do longer ones and it sounds to be like the longer one there is a difference in doing a longer interval even if you're like you know let's say six minutes total going all out for Tabata style versus what you're talking about which would be there is you know metabolically the challenge is different you know so this is where all interval training is not created equal right and and again there's lots of variables there total volume in particular is important but I think challenging your metabolic system in different ways is a good strategy now again for you that if you're only doing 10 minutes in the morning some of these days are going to be 20 minutes but maybe some days are you know three five minute intervals with a little bit of warm-up cooldown recovery in between that could still be a 20 minute workout but you've gotten in there 15 minutes of relatively intense training again pushes hard as you can go so they power up puts it you're working out are going to be different than when you're doing Tabata's and maybe some days do a minute on minute off repeated 10 times even five times right there's because that was a protocol that we've used a lot in our studies minute on minute off repeated 10 times took about 25 minutes for individuals but now there's studies that have looked at five by one showing that much of the improvement certainly in view to max is almost as good so again when we're doing 10 by one we're ringing out to sponge a little bit more but you get a lot of water out of five by one so I would say very up your intervals and recovery periods ideally in order to change up the physiological stress on the body now again your someone who says I only have 10 minutes in the morning and I absolutely love Tabata's okay like you're so far ahead of the game compared to many but I think if you're looking to optimize or maybe that's going to give a different lactate profile to your brain that maybe at least different I can't guarantee you it's better but I suspect for improvements in your cardiovascular fitness and that the different challenge may maybe a little better. This is great Marty because I think I am look if I have 10 minutes I have 20 and there's certainly some days I definitely have 20 others maybe 10 you know like today it was like 10 minutes I got Marty's coming I got I mean I got to do something but you know I think a lot of people are interested in that because there are different goals as you mentioned you know what are your goals? Are you an athlete okay then 80 20 like there's lots I mean you're you're putting in the time no matter what but but there's also people time like anything so there's those people it's like I can't think about you know doing you know maximizing what I can out of the V02 max and squeezing the cloth and getting every last drop I just got to like I got 10 minutes or you know and I can only do that X many times like you know four or five times a week or maybe some people like 20 minutes I can do three times a week but then you know I am interested in I am optimizing for V02 max as much as I can while still being time efficient you know and and and that I do think there's a there's a large audience it's very that's in that camp where it's like I want to be time efficient I want to still really optimize for V02 max and there are really I would say pretty strong data Coralian and V02 max also with brain health of course Cardi vascus systems are very related related to the brain vascus are health right so um that is really good we talked about to about we talked about 10 by one or five by one and you even talked about some of these longer ones which were like three to five minutes and then you're one minute so you're was your one minute workout based on the so we're the we're the title of the book came from was so our initial studies you know fast forward 15 20 years of research our initial studies in this area we were using the windgate test there's a long reasons for that but we were doing these 30 second windgates again these are uncomfortable people hate them you need four or five minutes recovery at least before we can coach you to do another one but the point is four or five windgates still takes 25 or 30 minutes and so it's still a significant time commitment and so people were saying well you know some of the critics rightly pointing out if it's taking 30 minutes and you're doing three times a week you're already getting up there so really how time efficient is it and so we wanted to devise protocol where no one would argue that it was time efficient and so that's and the other is it's the last 10 seconds arguably the last 15 seconds of the windgate that hurt the most so you know basically after about 15 seconds of the windgate you shut off glycogen utilization you've just produced so much lactate and your pH changes so much so if a lot of these responses are impart related to the reduction in glycogen maybe only need 15 or 20 seconds to trigger some of these responses so all that to say we came up with a protocol that was three 20 second intervals five minute total warm up and cool down and some recovery in between the intervals so start to finish the protocol took 10 minutes and within that there was one minute of very vigorous exercise that was the one minute workout I think we we've at least talked about it before the notion of re-hit at the same time as we were sort of coming up with the one minute workout UK researchers met calf, volard they've done a lot of this work they termed what they called reduced exertion high intensity training on a very similar theme where they were using a 10 minute start to finish workout but their protocol involves 10 to 20 only one to two 10 to 20 seconds efforts so all of this variations on a theme where we're talking no more than one minute of very intense exercise in a 10 minute time course and you know that we've we've done a number of studies now looking at that that workout and and showing that certainly it can prove you too many of the things we've talked about it can improve it to at least very similar extent as more traditional modern intensity continuous training that takes five times longer five times the total exercise while you that's that's a really big interest I mean I think into a lot of people so I mean that's for me and I mean people that I know I'm a lot of busy people that I know I mean it's like you know so I guess the the the the moral of the story here is I think I've the work to rest ratios in a way do matter to some respect because and that was kind of a big question for me was the what I'm doing every day was a very specific work to rest ratio but going going a little bit harder and that really does make sense and I knew it like I threw something in me that was like I just need to hear Marty tell me so thank you you mentioned some of the other protocols like the re hit what how does that you know how would you say that really differs from high intensity normal training I mean with respect to you maybe some of these endpoints we're talking about like VO to that so again like you know first of all it's all interval training whether it's hit depends on your definition a little bit and so that's why again you know I really like this idea this this notion or this terminology of interval training because it covers all the basis it's just alternating more intense less intense periods of of work high intensity for many is 80% or higher heart rate as a metric and you know and we've done this but to try and because our first work we called everything hit right which is much of the field at the time everything was hit but you know five minutes at 80% of VO to max is a very different stress as we just talked about from a 20 second to battle workout so at least to try and distinguish the interval training a little bit more there is this move to try and distinguish hit which is intense but sub maximal efforts from sit or sprint type training which is much closer to the sprint from danger pace type efforts so you know I would say re hit is absolutely interval training it's probably closer to sprint type training than traditional hit which just because of the power outputs you know you're working 10 20 seconds but these are very very high power outputs that you're generating and much higher than VO to max pace oh so I was completely confused about that because reduced exertion to me I was going oh this is less than 80% so the reduced exertion it was 10 or 20 seconds it feels a lot easier than a 30 second wind gate and it was because you know these investigators know 30 second wind gates hurt and all of the lack the gas it in the pain and the discomfort and even the nausea and dizziness sometimes it can go along with 30 seconds if you're doing 15 or 10 seconds much of that is is attenuated so the exertion comes down from the metabolic feelings and it's not the exertion level in terms of the power outputs on on the bike you know just to take that one step further Dr. Ed Coil at the University of Texas at Austin big name in the field of exercise physiology Dr Coil's recent work is looking at four second all-out efforts but doing a fair number of them and it's really just a variation on a theme and Dr Coil's point would be you can work very very hard even fairly deconditioned people can put out extremely high power outputs for four seconds then you give my think it's 12 seconds recovery and they do it again and so the point there is these very short very hard efforts aren't associated with the feeling the perceptions of discomfort when we initially think of wingate tests sprint from danger pace and you know I there's a lot of critics certainly on the behavioral side of things who are saying interval training is doomed to failures of public health priority because we know that anything above lactate threshold it hurts it makes people uncomfortable they're less likely to do it but there's a whole another group in the exercise behavior field they're going like wait a minute continuous high intensity efforts even continuous sprint efforts are very different from intermittent high intensity efforts and so there's a lot of certain a lot of arguing right now and a lot of Twitter pull-mix but I think still a lot of good work to be done looking at these perceptual responses to different types of interval training it's it's too simplistic to just go well sprint type training no one's going to do that because it hurts because now there's evidence to show that well actually it doesn't when people rate this they don't find it as unpleasant as uncomfortable as some make it out to claim that it is so the reduced exertion interval training the re-hit reduce exertion high intensity of training is you still it's they're messing around with more the work to rest ratios and you are still going you're still going very hard but your perceived exertion isn't as high as it would be if you were doing a wing gate or sprint for an interval training and so at the end of the day it really goes to say that perceived exertion isn't necessarily the best way to gauge how hard you're going because if you're still going hard on your four or five seconds you're you're you're you're doing good and then you know it's just I this is great I think this is very clear to me because you know the the the the that must be why I'm so drawn to debot to debot as well because I'm going hard for 20 seconds versus three minutes I mean one minute is hard like it's definitely going to be different and it is it is is you know these behavioral psychologists or whatever Twitter polimics that you're talking about they don't they might not know about David Goggins and the whole movement of you have to suffer to get to get the gains and you know so there are people that are willing to put in that effort there are people that do want to suffer and they will there's some days where you just don't right there's just some days where you're not going to do that but there are days where some people are very motivated and um no and you know to be clear these are these are these are very good scientists on both sides we're very careful uh methodological people you know they so I I respect the the the scientists on both sides of the issue but yeah to your point I my sense is when it comes to higher intensity especially short duration work the traditional way of thinking when we think of perceived effort it's just it doesn't fit as well right like classic board RPE scales are you know based on six to 20 because that generally correlated with uh you know young fit individuals who had arresting heart rate of 60 and a maximum heart rate of 200 that's where that rating scale comes in and so you know the more intense especially if it's continuous exercise the higher the heart rate the higher the perceived effort but we just see such a disconnect between ratings of perceived effort and heart rate I'll give you a very specific example we've done a study looking at that 10 by one protocol so these are 10 one minute efforts at objectively measured maximum heart rates of 85 to 90 percent of maximum in older individuals 63 years on average obese with type 2 diabetes on a 10 point rating scale they started out as a 5 they eventually got to about an 8 and so the average RPE was about a 7 out of 10 even though these people were doing very high power outputs at very high percentages of their maximum heart rate so it's just a striking example in our initial sprint studies the one minute sprint studies three 20 second efforts our first ones we were saying goal is hard as you can sprint from danger pace and we and in those we were using a 20 point scale they'd come back 14 15 out of 20 because now if we ask them to continue that sprint pace for a minute I'm sure we got to 20 but since they're so short so yeah to your point it's exactly right perceived effort I don't want to say it goes out the window but it maybe needs a rethink when we're referring to these very short very hard intermittent type efforts so what do you think let's say someone new to hit where like what a good place to start be more of these like shorter like and it's a really good question and this is where you know we haven't really talked health risk and all that I'm sure we'll get into it but like a standard thing that will just help people is get out of your comfort zone so wherever your starting point is your own perceived starting point make yourself a little bit more uncomfortable than usual for a short period and then back off and so I use this analogy all the time if you're only exercise is walking around the block and you want to get into intervals it's literally for the next two light posts I'm going to pick up the pace a little bit and then I'm going to back off so I I feel a little bit more out of breath I can feel I'm breathing a little bit more I can't talk to my partner like I generally can on our moderate walks it can be as simple as that just get it out of your comfort zone if you're someone who's already dialed in on the bike and you got a smart watch and all of that it's like hey get your heart rate longer or go longer and try and keep your heart rate there you know or rather than 20 seconds you're going to go for three minutes as hard as you can you're not going to be like me I know and the next time you're going to do that but it's going to be a very different challenge for you right and this is where I think that the more empowering term interval training it's okay because it doesn't matter if you're magically getting to some 80% lavalor whatever the experts tell you you should be at it's just start with the alternating pattern and then build from there start to dial it in maybe a little bit more and get more discerning but as a starting point just get out of your comfort zone and back off and repeat that a few times this kind of reminds me of the was it the interval walkers versus the walkers allutely yes you know excellent data and these are you know relatively small but well controlled randomized controlled trials looking at interval walking versus continuous steady state walking including an individuals with type 2 diabetes three four month interventions were individuals were randomly assigned to an interval walking group continuous walking or a control group the interval and continuous walkers matched for total exercise volume total exercise intensity so you can imagine the the continuous walkers I think their average heart rate was around 65% of maximum the interval walkers got that up to 70 and then down to 60 so we're just talking gentle hills and valleys after four months the interval walkers greater improvement and cardiovascular tri-fitness greater reduction in for greater change in body composition greater loss of fat and most importantly individuals type 2 diabetes greater reduction in 24 hour blood sugar measured using continuous glucose monitor so it's not to say that continuous walking is bad I think it's just a little bit of evidence that adding some intervals or varying the pace even slightly we're not talking sprint training may provide some greater benefit and this kind of relates to something I was going to ask you about which is you know interval training for maybe elderly and maybe informed so people that are more sick you know like how they can incorporate interval training into their lifestyle and also then like contraindicated on contraindication like so you mentioned like maybe some people you know is there some people that high intensity interval training is not good for and how would you know sort of all of those yeah so in this you know this I always make the point here I'm a PhD scientist I read the literature I'm not a medical doctor I'm not a cardiologist I I I I read work like that I try and stay informed on it and certainly for my book I interviewed people like Dr Paul Thompson right noted cardiologist who writes many of the guidelines around this very very issue but first point I was make is that interval training as we've talked about a lot comes in many different flavors so second point is that many more people than we initially think can perform and benefit from interval training and there's just now there's hundreds and hundreds of studies that have looked at interval training in individuals with cardiometabolic disease cardiovascular disease heart disease type 2 diabetes older individuals people with metabolic syndrome and and a lot of this is not new you can you can find studies going back to the 70s and 80s some of the pioneering work looking at interval training and individuals with heart disease so the notion that people could you know individuals with cardiometabolic diseases could engage in benefit from interval training is is certainly not new but there remains immense debate and I think it's we're all reading the same science and some people again I'm talking about the field broadly someone to see the science get to a certain level before they recommend changes and where that level is is different so for example high intensity interval training my read is is much more ingrained in Europe and certainly in Scandinavian countries it's you know much of the pioneering work around high intensity interval training and cardiovascular disease was was done in Norway and the work of Ulrich Whistloff and that goes back to the calculator that we talked about earlier but there I think it's much more generally accepted and integrated into cardiac rehab training right I think in North America it's it's not right and and so that's not necessarily good or bad I think it's the experts the cardiologist the people who write the guidelines looking at the evidence and saying you know some are more like I say with there's different viewpoints on that in terms of risk and again I'm not an MD or a cardiologist but in there's no doubt that more vigorous intensity exercise can transely increase risk of an event during the exercise about itself I think there's there's fairly strong evidence for that and you know in preparing for our interview I was reading some of the latest guidelines expert guidelines around that making that point you know and especially in more deconditioned individuals people might already have some silent underlying risk factors and so we can't ignore that or downplay it or say that everyone can do interval training is fine but the absolute risk still remains low when you look at events per hours engage in actual exercise you know both moderate and vigorous type effort whether it's continuous or intermittent the absolute rates remain relatively low but statistically there's definitely an increase in in risk that's higher with vigorous exercise during the event itself now of course after the event relative risk is much lower than individuals who would remain sedentary so you know I I think the old adage of the greatest risk to your health is just remain sedentary is absolutely true right and so when I was striking phrase that Dr Thompson used when we interviewed him for the book was you know if your choice is between doing hit and doing nothing do hit if the choice is between hit and moderate and you're 60 and you're been pretty inactive you might have some underlying factors and time is not a worry do moderate or at least engage in some moderate at some preconditioning before you start with the the more intense stuff and then on the you know who is absolutely concentrated atrial fibrillation there are some very clearly defined no-goes that if you have certain conditions that you shouldn't be engaging vigorous intensity exercise unstable and gyna would be another example yeah sounds like a lot of the I mean things that you would talk to your cardiologist about you would already have a cardiologist if you would know that you had that sort of disorder so the last point I was making is you know in talking to many physicians and cardiologists you know we think in exercise stress tests sort of gives you that green light or red light to engage in exercise and in certainly in our studies we're individuals head elevated risk people with type to diabetes and that everyone does the 12 lead ECG stress test before they recruited into the study but you know I naively thought okay the person doing the stress test the cardiologist reading it it's going to come back and it's say green light good to go in your study red light unable what we found was a lot of yellow lights maybe you know this person might be contraindicated or there's a change here that might elevate risk and so of course we defer to safety and so even those yellow lights generally those individuals were not then recruited into the study which is no doubt influencing outcomes but I always wonder I'm like sort of these people just going to sit around then and continue doing nothing and is that in itself raising their their risk so it's you know it even you know the standard you know recommendation see your doctor get clearance before you change your engage in in exercise it's not always 100% guarantee one where the other in terms of you may deal with a sudden adverse event we might see it in a 20 year old in my lab tomorrow you can't absolutely look these things I think also mentioning the the walkers the interval walkers versus continuous walkers was really good because you know it also kind of highlights the fact that you don't have to go to your 80% max heart rate for interval training and perhaps people that are older people that might have some underlying conditions people that are untrained and are starting later in life great you know it's never too late to start they can they can start by you know by doing you know intervals that are not necessarily all out or even sub-maximal right I mean just just going a little bit above what your you know steady state being able to talk normally sort of conversation is and you know I don't think that you know my sense is that many of your listeners are already aware of this but I think still for a lot of people or certainly the general public they hear the word hit for interval training and they think oh my goodness it's this as hard you can go all out breakneck pace and that's not for me and I think that's a disservice and again hopefully this more encompassing term of interval training it's just this idea of hills and valleys right and and the other point to that is um you know I talk to I'm not name dropping here but just you know many people have thought about this for a long time I also interviewed for the book Carl Foster who has done a lot of work around this and when he first heard you know as a scientist in the 80s that there was a group in Germany that was doing interval training in cardiac patients he saw one of the scientists at a conference and he said oh how many people you killed this week with that crazy stuff and he was relaying that story to a cardiac nurse when he got back to his institution and the he said sort of tapped him on the cheek and said oh Carl you're so silly and she said look at this patient in the parking lot who's coming for his cardiac rehab setting or session they already engage in interval training because they can't they have such low exercise capacity they can't get to a continuous moderate pace so what they do is they innate the interval train they get out of their car they take a few steps they take a break they take a few more steps they take a break it's bit like climbers on Everest right and so again that's a more empowering message I think you're just starting out that's okay you can you can train like elite athletes have trained we just have to set if they work out at a proximate level that's suitable for you rather than you know oh my goodness people are destined to be a failure because very few can engage in continuous moderate exercise for a period of even 20 or 30 minutes because their capacities are so low so it's a bit of you know behavioral colleagues talk about message framing I think there's a lot of that we can do with interval training so for those individuals who just think it's this all out crazy stuff I'd never do it it's it's it's a reframing of it for them yeah and also again the modifying the work to restoration is too is another sort of way I think but it's like oh I have to go all out for a minute or two minutes or three minutes but oh what about 10 seconds you know what about 10 seconds so it is a lot of there's a lot of ways to sort of modify the you know the hit program in general what about this the the is it high the high intensity resistance training or resistance intensity training which way it goes different ways you know some people call functional training but certainly there's high intensity resistance training you know I think can still count you know for a lot of resistance training just because the intensities are so high you know we're talking about now very high four suffered that last less than a second sometimes by a definition it's interval training we just never really think about that but so I think certainly bodyweight style type interval training or what used to be traditional calisthenics and that that can play a role here so I think again using this generic term interval training I think we can have more aerobic style interval training or resistance style interval training and again bodyweight style interval training would sort of be the classic one to me that is interval resistance training and I think it can have tremendous benefit you know it's often a sort of a middle ground you're you're not going to see the gains in strength that you would see with traditional heavy weight lifting exercise and you're not necessarily going to see the gains in fitness that you would have with a traditional well structured aerobic training program but you can get a lot of both right in the middle you know especially if you know we're talking air squats burpees at push-ups where you also keep recovery periods relatively short you know you engage in that for 10 to 20 minutes you can keep your max your heart rate up to about 80% of maximum but you've done a lot of resistance style training that's increasing functional strength as well I think it's a tremendous way to for people to train it sounds like a lot of crossfit kind of um I think it's yeah absolutely you know now maybe not necessarily as intense as some of these programs that you see but absolutely that style of functional training whatever you want to call it or label it can be extremely beneficial I think and in a time efficient way you get strength gains and some aerobic conditioning as well can you get any muscle muscle mass mass gains even strength veins from high intensity interval training let's let's say if you're want a my positionary bike and you're cranking the resistance out yeah so it it that one really depends where you're starting level is right and and so if you're already relatively fit and healthy then the the general belief is that you're not going to see massive changes in muscle protein synthesis or changes in fiber size or anything like that even with fairly intensive sprinting now if you're someone just starting out you think of a very deconditioned elderly individual who is going to get on the bike and do some moderate pushes there you know we're so we're not tucking all out sprint training they could see some improvements in protein synthesis you know and again are we talking mitochondrial mild fervilir but I think traditional muscle protein synthesis we're seeing an increase in fiber size in that if your baseline is very very low then I think even aerobic style interval training can be beneficial there but otherwise you know once you get to a certain level it's not a high-perch or vistimulus generally speaking yeah okay because I crank my resistance up really high I'm like a ton and I'm standing and doing it you know like I'm like this test be something on my my pods and well you know you you look at you know look at two-referon cyclists right like I mean they're amazingly muscle now they're very very lean as well right how much of that is that was covered in layer of fat how much muscle would there be there but you know I I think there it's not nothing but you know you can get much greater gain in protein synthesis was some more traditional squad exercise and things like that with a lot lot less volume of work can you just lift I mean like can you you know like let's say you're doing a more of a resistance training like higher intensity resistance training circuit or like you're talking about um I mean there's can you just get by what's doing that I mean yeah again right compared to what but you know so like like I don't like only doing heavy resistance training as traditionally practiced I think you're you're definitely leaving something on the table in terms of cardiovascular spirit or fitness and health benefits and all of that I think it's a really good question of you know again if it's that person like we talked about the classic individual you know type a limited time still engaged in real life with rust responsibilities family job things like that and they have an hour a week to train if they only did high intensity functional training calisthenic style bodyweight style exercise I could see a lot of value in that right in terms of aerobic conditioning and gains in in strength you know coming back to what we talked about earlier you know if it's if it's four sessions a week they can do maybe two of those are high intensity functional training or bodyweight style training and two or more interval training for aerobic conditioning on a bike on elliptical things like that you know you only have three woo I'm not sure how it did be those up but still getting some variation in ideally but yeah I have a lot of time for high intensity functional training yeah what about the combination of aerobic training with resistance training this chronic interference effect like you've heard about where if I do my aerobic exercise right you know in conjunction with my my lifting I'm gonna blunt my gains I mean at least that's what I interpreted some of that yeah so you know the I think where the evidence is and if you look at the latest systematic reviews and meta analyses what they're gonna say is maybe there's a slight interference effect maybe it's there to a greater extent with high intensity interval training and certainly if you do it within the same session maybe there's some blending but if you look at the work right now it there's some evidence to say cycling is okay but running is not there's some evidence to say actually running is okay but cycling's not so there's no clear answer I think the bottom line is there might be a slight interference effect in some people especially when they do it very very close together or in as part of the same session but it's probably relatively small it's probably relatively negligible in the big picture but if you're someone who's really looking to eat out maximal gains you're probably want to leave a few hours in between your training sessions yeah I was the the interest had kind of sparked because well one because you hear about it but also from I think it was stew's recent study where they're combining aerobic exercise with resistance training and it was like actually it was there a little bit of a beneficial effect in summer regard to blood flow or something like that so it was you know certainly I think you know it's like a lot of things with interval training you can pick your study to argue one side of the other but you know I I think that and of course meta analyses are based on all these studies some good some less good but I think that's the sort of the state of the field is it's probably not a big deal for most people including if look I got half an hour today I can do both I can't split this up because I can't train tomorrow one and do both right but again if you want to eat out every bit of the drop then ideally separate it by a little bit of time a couple hours at least okay all right um the the if the guidelines that are set you kind of we touched on it a little bit and this is a this is a big question that people ask all the time you know there's these guidelines that are set by a variety of committees it seems like there's a lot of consensus in terms of the guidelines for moderate intensity aerobic exercise anywhere between 150 to 300 minutes a week or vigorous intensity exercise and that's 75 to 150 minutes a week I think something like that um where where do you think in your opinion does high intensity interval training fit into that equation is there a new time frame and let's say for people that are optimizing for general health or also for people wanting to also get that you know back to the drama study you know I do want to be closer to that elite sort of performer level using hit um so for for those kind of people there a guideline in your opinion or what what's your opinion on so so there's a ton there so so first thing you know let's remember these are physical activity guidelines or not exercise guidelines so we're talking about physical activity guidelines you're right there is general international consensus that hasn't changed that much if anything it's just increased the number a little bit in the latest guidelines US guidelines for Americans the the WHO World Health Organization guidelines are consistent and they're exactly what you just said 150 to 300 minutes of moderate or half if you're doing it vigorous and how is that defined well moderate is defined in an absolute sense of about of not about its three to five point nine mats three to five point nine metabolic equivalents or five to six on a 10 point rating scale and what that means subjectively is you can talk but you can't sing so you're exercising with a partner you could carry on a conversation at a moderate effort but you couldn't sing vigorous effort is above six mats seven or eight on a 10 point scale and you could only say a couple of words so you couldn't carry on a conversation say a couple of words short phrases so that's sort of the subjective and objective measurements of moderate and vigorous and those are fairly consistent now you know American College of Sports Medicine would have some different numbers there at least in terms of percentages of heart rate and things like that but that's generally where we are moderate to to vigorous and those are for what are deemed substantial health benefits not saying that's the best way to increase your view to max it's saying there's really good data from a wide variety of sources that if you engage in this level of weekly physical activity you can expect substantial health benefits brain muscle you know lots of lots of things um it's not saying it's ideal either that's not necessarily optimal because there's always a caveat that more is better so you can ring a little bit more out of sponge if you're going to engage in more and there's not um you know there's the only other recent change was really that there used to be this guideline that said you have to accumulate these in boats lasting at least 10 minutes and that was removed because it was never really supported scientifically and so at least that change I think has opened up a little window on this notion of all activity counts and it was partly I think some recognition of there's some studies out there showing that very short efforts can be associated with some improvements in some of these um health markers so the guidelines are just that there you know suggestions or recommended amounts to derive health benefits when we're talking physical activity they're not saying this is the way that elite athletes should train in order to optimize their performance so I think we really need to recognize what the guidelines are and the last point of this my understanding based on talking of these experts is they tend to be conservative because ideally they would like metrics like doing this amount we know is associated with a lower risk for all cause mortality or is a lower risk for developing cardiovascular disease and many these other chronic ailments and so we just don't have anywhere close to that body of evidence when it comes to interval training you know we may eventually so where does hit fit in the big picture I think and again I spoke to people for my book people like I'm in Lee at Harvard Dr. I'm in Lee who's engaged with some of these committees and the point was well hit already fits within the guidelines and I said well is it only the hit efforts or the recovery intervals as well so if you do a 20 minute hit session but half of that is resting and half of that is the exercise her point would be no you count both right or another example of interval training is so many team sports right I like to play ice hockey my wife is a soccer player and so in those for parts of the game you're active and exercising very vigorously and for the parts you're not moderate or low intensity effort so with those if you engage in a one hour of pickup ice hockey but you're only playing every other shift you can probably count the hour within that so I think interval training and hit already falls within the guidelines and certainly it would fall within the guidelines of vigorous activity will we ever see the guidelines say 150 minute 150 to 300 of moderate 75 to 150 of vigorous or 30 to 60 of very vigorous exercise and you know a new breakpoint maybe but I think the people that write the guidelines will want to see a lot more evidence until we're going to get to that point or you know will there be some acknowledgement of these types of VILPA you know or at least engage in VILPA like efforts for five minutes a day you know 30 minutes of VILPA like efforts have also been shown to be associated with this you know the UK guidelines explicitly refer to hit the WHO and and the US guidelines really do not at least in terms of incorporating it so it's going to continue to evolve but I know that's probably a long wind in the answer but that's probably the best perspective that I could offer on that right now. Yeah I think that's good and I do think that the alluding to the VILPA studies I mean again like you said I mean you're talking about you know to some I mean it's a pretty minimum of effective dose to get 30 to 40% reduction in all cause mortality and cancer mortality right I mean it's not the 80% of the you know at least the elite performing people that had the highest VILPA to max but and and for that you know you may you may you need to do need probably need to do more but for for some people that are just generally wanting to get you know 50% reduction or something like maybe you know doing doing 60-75 minutes a week would and that you know because you're I get this question a lot and you alluded to it earlier whether we like it or not a lot of people still want that answer is how little can I get away with and the guidelines don't really address that right or they at least there's no grudging acknowledgement for saying look we know most of you probably aren't going to do this so at the very least do this right they there's been no movement on on that if anything we're just encouraging people to do more so it is it is maybe a gap or at least we should confront that reality that there's a big disconnect there for a lot of people. Another sort of I think research gap is the sex differences and it's it's definitely of interest to many many women of all stages of life so acknowledging the research gaps I'm still going to ask you some opinions to see if there are any I know there's also I think some misconceptions in the general audience with the general population also so it'd be nice to kind of even touch on some of those one being you know postmenopausal women like is hit good or bad for postmenopausal women like on the bad side some women are worried about raising cortisol to high do many thoughts on doing hit for a postmenopausal women so specifically on the cortisol level and again I think the latest systematic reviews meta and allysies you know the studies vary a little bit but by and large I don't think individuals need to worry about chronic increases in cortisol levels systemically that are going to cause them damage clearly cortisol levels can go up just like catacolymes go up acutely during exercise but I think there's some evidence now that was suggested actually in individuals that practice interval training basal cortisol levels actually stay lower than prior to to baseline so I don't think it needs to be a major concern especially given a lot of the other benefits that we can see with this type of approach so that's that's on the the the cortisol issue specifically yeah and that I mean given all the benefits we've talked about the cardiovascular respiratory muscle you know skeletal muscle you know the brain I mean there's just it's it's it's it's pretty clear to me that I mean it'd be hard it'd be a hard cell to say oh no it's not beneficial for both menopause I know you know very different is you know individuals with PCOS poly system or you can it is there's ongoing work as some really good work out of Norway looking specifically at hit in individuals with back conditions so showing some some real benefits there on the sex-based differences you know writ large are there sex-based differences in some outcomes yes I I think they're subtle at least the evidence to this point would suggest there are some differences there probably subtle differences but we knew we do need to know a lot more you know are there massive differences between for example phases of the menstrual cycle or or a contraceptive users versus naturally cycling females again maybe some but probably pretty subtle so that doesn't mean they're not important but I think the differences are are likely small and in most outcomes but absolutely we just you know need more research we need more research on diversity of responsiveness writ large not necessarily even just biological males and females you know and you've talked about this on other episodes you know it's an active area of research and it's a frustrating area of research sometimes so I'll give you a very specific example some of our research right now is looking at the mechanisms for the increase in VO2 max with very short sprint type interval training right and so we know that that increases VO2 max but we're not sure why and actually some of the work would suggest maybe it's more the muscle adaptations than we thought about or at least the cardiac output changes take a while so I have a PhD student immersed in this area and his first study we show that VO2 max goes up stroke volume was up cardiac output was up after 12 weeks of training and it looked like there were some differences between the males and female participants in the study so we did a secondary analysis wasn't appropriately powered and we thought yeah actually it doesn't look like the women are responding very much or the females and the males are so then we repeat the whole study using more best practice procedures properly controlling for menstrual cycle phase and properly expressing fitness per fat free mass and we were basically unable to replicate original findings and we certainly didn't see any evidence of a sex-based difference which tells me something we've handwave around a little bit around our conversation at this point there's tremendous inter-individual variation in responsiveness and so at least right now to my mind in terms of potential differences in responsiveness to specifically sprint type training it might be less about a male or female biology issue and it might just be there's tremendous variability between individuals and in the almost 40 participants in the combined two studies it happened to be men people identified as males that responded to a greater extent but it might not have anything to do with biological sex and I think that's where a lot many areas are right now not all of them some there's very clear differences but I think that's where the exercise field is writ large and the vast majority of studies have not incorporated these best practices for making systematic comparisons between sexes right yeah and also I think differences in like at least for me it's like there's environmental like how much sleep I got like things that will also affect you know my ability to perform and you know things like that so yeah I mean there's a lot of gaps in the field and you know with respect to women and menstrual cycle it's also a question I get a lot and I you know the I think the reality of it is that you know 20 to 30% of menstruating women are you know during their menstruation are iron deficient and they just don't even know about it they don't even know about it they're not thinking about it they're not increasing their dietary and take a fire and they're not supplementing with iron during that period and maybe that alone also would affect some I mean iron's important for him right and that's no the others and if you talk to these female athletes are like even if there is I don't get to pick one my race date is I know I have to peak for this day in four months time you know in this location maybe you can structure your training around the menstrual cycle a little bit but I think the reality that that's just the reality obviously for women who compete in in sport and so yes we need to know if there's some differences there but in the big picture it doesn't really matter it's just one more thing that potentially contributes to variability in responsiveness on the day and you try and control all the other things as well as you can you know to to peak as best you can on the day or your event or your key event does high-end entity interval training effect bone nasser bone density you know this is where you know go like to this point you know I've encouraged us to think about mode specific when we're making some of these comparisons I think that's where it depends right and so we know that more higher impact events or activities certainly when we're young tend to you know lay down more more bone and so you know for talking high intensity cycling versus high intensity running those things are very different right are you running on concrete are you running outside in beautiful trails all of those things matter you know the flip side to that is if we talk about injury risk people say like I can't do high intensity train I'm the increase my risk for injury well you know I'm someone with classic left knee osteoarthritis I just tore my niscissin my right knee playing hockey so I'm gonna have a osteoarthritis and that knee soon I can engage in very vigorous interval training on the bike I can't and I don't run anymore so you know hit training on the bike no problem any sort of running outside is excruciating for me so joint problems in general um people people can do think people can engage in in cycling I do yes and you know we know certainly and again like I'm not an expert in this area but you know talking to experts and just trying to read and stay abreast of the literature you know we know that people who have joint injuries certainly meniscal injuries are osteoarthritis one of the best things that you can do is remain active and it's obviously frustrating advice for many people because they're like I want to be active but it hurts when I'm active and so moving towards less weight bearing activities that allow you to be active around the joint and maybe you know help with the the tissues around the joint but aren't impactful forces so cycling is a fantastic exercise for individuals with osteoarthritis because you can still engage in fairly vigorous activity without hurting or damaging you know specifically your knees in this case yeah that's great I know there's there's quite a few people that are under the misconception that they cannot do any type of high intensity interval training because they have joint issues so yeah they don't want to do box jumps right but yeah I mean jumping rope which may actually be good great for the bones I mean it's impactful and you can do certainly do high intensity intervals with jumping rope as well what about so there's we talk about like some of this you know we're talking about some of these like misconceptions I guess and you kind of touched on this a little bit when we're talking about maybe you know people that are shouldn't engage in high intensity interval training like the people with a fib or in giant a peck that heart problem the the the fact that doing high intensity interval training could cause a fib or coronary calcification or just even like elite athletes in general like you at the high level you can see they have a higher tendency for a fib and coronary calcification but on the same in the same breath they also have a lower risk of you know cardiovascular related mortality is there a way to reconcile those things so again not expert but my read of this including you know there's some really good reviews that have come out recently and again we could drop those in the show notes to direct people to reading on this but the you know the old Latin phrase the the poison is in the dose right there there's definitely evidence that individuals who over a lifetime engage in very high intensity very high volume exercise may be a greater risk for some of these issues that you just referred to heart heart issues um the to my read in my understanding while there's theories out there the definitive cause and effect or mechanistic basis hasn't been definitively established and the other is it's been pointed out that those date like while clearly that risk is there and you see examples of this it doesn't fit or doesn't line up with the longevity data which is still that you know lifetime runners will still have you know a few more years of life compared to others so I think it's a it's an issue that still really needs to be resolved and probably the safest advice would be you know extreme exercise may carry some some consequences right whether it's a U shape or the the J shape curve there is something to that and if you're on you know this is for the vast majority of people this isn't an issue but you know if you are that extreme uh exercise or you just need to be mindful of fact that that may carry some increased cardiovascular risk yeah um so I one more odd ball question before my last one which is um what are your thoughts on this like hypoxic training like have you heard like the mouth taping during like a hit or so my sense would I yes yes I've definitely heard of it you know clearly when you move to more intensive exercise the vast majority of revendulation is through your mouth so it's it's really hard to engage in vigorous exercise when you're restricting either nasal breathing or mouth breathing you're you're gonna compromise your performance it may feel really hard you know uh because you're inducing this added stress whether it's beneficial I'm not convinced uh of that you know I think the data around blood flow restricted training is much more interesting and there's some really uh really interesting work coming out of out of that you know you can make the case that maybe you're gonna see some changes in respiratory or diaphragm muscular or that but getting back to the idea of what limits view to max it's generally not a pulmonary limitation it's a heart limitation and so strategies that are really trying to additionally stress the pulmonary system so you know if you if people want to try it find I don't think there's tremendous evidence that that's gonna um potentially a training uh responses what's the uh interesting thing about blood flow restrictions? Well just you know like I think death you know as as a therapist so I um I'm aware of some ongoing work I guess that's about and you know this is an artwork but I'm aware of some work looking at blood flow restriction exercise and training in very very high level uh endurance athletes uh showing some interesting changes in performance related metrics or or some measures um and yeah so I like I say that work is ongoing um the hard thing with these is it's you can't truly blind someone to blood flow restricted training right like many of these interventions that we've talked about it's tough to have a true control who's completely blinded to the intervention that can influence some some things but you know the the idea of blood flow restricted training allowing individuals getting back to joint issues maybe working at a lower absolute force or workload but still seeing the metabolic stresses induce with blood flow restricted training. You know there's some there's some interesting work there I think so and well patience where do you see this is this is my last question for you where do you see the future of well specifically high intensity interval training research and um you know like the training methodologies where's where's it going like how we can find really you know how we can define good studies to optimize for VO2 max to optimize for like mitochondrial biogenesis and these these these important measures of longevity and health and performance for the athletes too but um where do you see the field going yeah so a whole bunch of levels there and I think it you know what's the most it's like how do we spend our tax dollars right what's the most important education health all of that but I think given the pervasiveness of physically inactivity writ large there's a lot of behavioral work that needs to be done there around is it a viable public health strategy what are the best strategies to encourage people to engage in any physical activity behavior but could brief vigorous physical activity intermittent physical activity non exercise physical activity could we have interventions that behavioral interventions that will finally encourage people to to do that so that I think that's a massive area that that needs to get looked at number two is you know clear them up proponent for interval training but I fully recognize that we haven't done or just they're not out there these large scale randomized clinical trials making very good comparisons between traditional endurance exercise and interval type training with proper what we call non-inferiori to designs which is like what's the margin of if there is a difference it doesn't matter right so maybe that's half a met or point two of a met whatever your metric is and design your studies so it's like if we show that margin of non-inferiori then it's good enough we can basically call these things the same because a lot of the comparison studies to date are relatively small and so there might be real biological or health related differences there but the sample size is just aren't large enough to be able to detect that and so certainly in my own work you know as I progress into what's the probably the final phase of my career is I think we've we've asked a lot of interesting questions in our work we've mainly done relatively small scale proof of concept studies but in our own work we're thinking a lot more about rigorous research design and I think the field of exercise science generally is wrestling with this issue of moving towards proper sample size estimates proper power calculations registering trials so we don't have systemic bias creeping into results p hacking things like that so I think that's a very big area of maybe we need fewer smaller studies that generally look the same and a lot more groups collaborating larger multi-center trials you know being engaged in some of this work right now easier said than done but I think that's where we need to to go to to get to the level of evidence that the people that write the physical activity guidelines might say okay now this issue is more informed right to to make some decisions there you know probably less important for the general public but the whole area of elite training for athletes right which is you know invariably almost all of these athletes are experiments of one so you know if kipchogi trained slightly differently with the marathon record be slightly lower you know probably not you know whom I had a question kipchogi's training but I think we continue to wrestle with this like we don't really know all these experiments event of one and elite coaching is that blend of art and science but we don't have these large you know interventional studies and athletes saying exactly what's the best way to train we have some of them we touched on them but they're really really hard to do but if you're interested in elite performance and then maybe the I'm sure I'm missing lots but probably the final one would be technological advancements right there's just been huge advancements obviously around sleep research activity tracking things like that you know continuous lactate monitoring and athletes will that really move the needle or you know revolutionize training using some of these markers maybe you and also data and activity tracking for every day people as well you know the ubiquity of smart phones and watches and things like that getting back to the behavior you know can we encourage people with activity prompts and things like that like is that a viable strategy is that it's never really going to work in the real world so these sort of translational studies that continue to move research out of the laboratory into real world settings so that we can truly move towards effectiveness studies as opposed to efficacy studies I think is where the field needs to go awesome well Marty thank you so much for taking quite a bit of time to have this discussion with me today I mean I learned quite a bit and I know people are going to really enjoy learning this you know everything that we talked about today I know so we talked about your book the one minute workout people can find that Amazon I mean anywhere right do you ebook form hard copy yeah it's available everywhere and then you also have a website Martin Martin Martin Martin good ballad calm Martin kabala dot calm and then a twitter twittle handle is at give ballum good ball m so g i b a l m some of certain in first-in-nish okay awesome so people can go to those places to learn more about kind to see interval training your website your book and also follow one twitter if they want to yeah absolutely you know really I started the website just so is a one stop shop in terms of you can learn about our research you can learn I put up podcast interviews like this links to the book links to Dr. Philips and I have a free online course that people can take called hacking exercise for for health you know let me just add one last thing is opportunities like this to engage in knowledge translation science communication it it's huge right and in writing the book one of the things that had to get comfortable with you know in science we want to control everything and if you move you know when you're writing research papers you get a little controversial or you move outside a little bit and you just get whacked right whereas I think when you're boiling down or trying to boil down information for the general public or other knowledge users and we don't have all the answers we just have to sort of give our best guesses not move outside the lanes too much but say this is the best evidence right now it's it's not perfect and so the way you do a podcast interview or write a book for the general public it's very different from you write how you write a scientific article and that's okay right there's some people who will only write scientific articles never move outside their area let's find well do what you're comfortable with but you know that also has limitations right because that many of these things are still behind pay walls people can't get to them and so science communication knowledge translation is is really really important so thanks for this opportunity and and the work that you do on on on this podcast I think it's tremendously important thank you so much and it's it's nice to to know that other scientists will be listening and there are collaborations that can also happen out of
