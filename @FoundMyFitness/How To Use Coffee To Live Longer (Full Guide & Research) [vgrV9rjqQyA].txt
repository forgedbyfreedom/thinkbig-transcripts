Dr. Rhonda Patrick here, today we're going to go deep on coffee. We've spent the last month or so reading through all of the latest research on coffee and in this episode, I'm going to tell you everything you need to know about how to get the maximum health and longevity benefits while minimizing the negative side effects. The good news is that coffee can slow down your epigenetic aging clock, drop cardiovascular risk and sharpen cognition. But how you source your coffee, how you brew it and how you time it makes a big difference. And if done the wrong way, coffee can raise LDL, disrupt sleep, and you'll miss out on some of the benefits I just mentioned. So in this episode, we'll answer questions like how coffee actually slows down aging and how to maximize those benefits, which beans and roast levels are healthiest, why a paper filter matters for cholesterol and cancer risk. The best way to source and store your beans to avoid mold in your coffee. The exact caffeine dose for endurance, strength, and mental focus, which supplement you can take to reduce some of the side effects of coffee, such as the jitters, whether cream can blunt some of the positive benefits of coffee and much more. By the end of this episode, you'll know how to turn coffee into a precise, science-backed protocol for longer life, better metabolism, and peak brain performance. So let's get started. Science increasingly demonstrates that coffee actively slows biological aging. It protects cells from damage and helps the body adapt to stress, effectively slowing down aging at the cellular level. Biological aging is not just counting the chronological age. It's the actual rate at which your cells and tissues deteriorate. Your DNA accumulates damage and your body becomes more vulnerable to disease. One powerful way scientists measure this biological aging is through something called epigenetic age. How genes turn on and off as we age, reflecting the functional state of cells or tissues relative to chronological age. The faster your epigenetic clock runs, the quicker you age and the sooner diseases of aging appear. Here's the fascinating part, drinking coffee appears to actively slow this biological aging process. In fact, multiple large-scale studies show that regular coffee drinkers have significantly younger epigenetic age signatures compared to non-drinkers, meaning their DNA isn't just healthier, it literally behaves as if it's younger. For example, a recent analysis of nearly 16,000 people identified consistent changes in DNA methylation. These are the chemical marks controlling gene activity. At 11 distinct sites closely tied to inflammation, metabolism, the aging process itself. In another comprehensive US health survey, researchers found that each additional cup of coffee corresponded to about 0.12 years younger biological age. Even more strikingly, people who consumed three or more cups per day had a 34 to 41 percent lower chance of accelerated biological aging compared to non-drinkers. In a separate multi-ethnic study using advanced epigenetic clocks, further supported this. So regular coffee intake correlated with roughly 0.7 to a full year reduction in epigenetic age for each daily cup consumed. This effect appeared consistently across multiple robust measures of biological aging. Now, it's important to mention. These are observational studies, which means they can't prove direct causation yet. But the consistency across numerous rigorous analyses strongly suggests that coffee's bioactive components, things like the chlorogenic acids, caffeine, an antioxidant's form during roasting, are actively reshaping our epigenome. In other words, coffee may be literally rewiring our genetic expression to slow down aging at the cellular level, potentially extending health span, and consistent robust scientific evidence does show regular coffee drinkers do actually live longer, and not only that, they also experience lower rates of the deadliest chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and even certain cancers. We now know coffee impacts nearly every major biological mechanism underlying aging and chronic disease. First of all, coffee drinkers consistently have up to a 27 percent lower risk of dying from any cause than non-coffee drinkers. This translates to almost two extra years of life, and even de-caf coffee delivers a similar benefit. So this really suggests that compounds beyond caffeine like polyphenols and the chlorogenic acids do act as powerful anti-aging agents. For decades, coffee was actually thought to be bad for the heart. Turns out, that was wrong. Coffee significantly reduces cardiovascular disease risk by about 10 to 15 percent. Coffee consumption protects against heart attacks, stroke, and cardiovascular-related death. In here's where it gets even crazier. Contrary to expectations since coffee is generally contraindicated for aridmias, caffeine uniquely appears to reduce the risk of developing aridmias. And this was in a dose-dependent manner with two to three cups of daily coffee linked to 12 percent lower aridmiar risk and four to five cups associated with a 17 percent lower risk. Decaf doesn't offer this aridmiar protection, which really highlights caffeine's unique role in somehow stabilizing heart rhythms. Most people reach for the cup of coffee in the morning. When you drink your coffee actually matters, recent large-scale studies tell us something pretty fascinating. People who consume their coffee exclusively in the morning show significant longevity benefits compared to those who spread caffeine throughout the day. Specifically, morning coffee drinkers experience a 12 percent lower risk of death from all causes, and an impressive 31 percent lower risk of cardiovascular-related death compared to non-coffee drinkers. Spreading your coffee throughout the day, so in the morning afternoon and evening, didn't show the same health benefits. The protective effects seems unique to starting your day with coffee rather than drinking it continuously throughout the day. So why the morning? It really comes down largely to circadian biology. The internal clock governing our sleep wake cycles, hormone release, metabolism. So caffeine consumed late in the day, powerfully disrupts this clock. There's controlled laboratory studies that show that caffeine taken within about three hours of natural bedtime shifts the internal clock later by roughly 45 minutes to an hour. So this is like giving yourself a mini dose of jet lag every day. The result delayed melatonin release, disrupted sleep patterns, reduced deep sleep quality, and ultimately compromised health. But caffeine consumed early in the day actually works with your natural circadian rhythm. It supports alertness. It reinforces stable cortisol timing, and it may help anchor your internal clock optimizing your metabolism and cardiovascular health. So there seems to be a clear takeaway protocol for coffee timing. Consuming caffeine early, so aiming to stop caffeine at least 8 to 10 hours before your natural bedtime. For most people, that means cutting off caffeine around noon or the early afternoon. You also want to keep it moderate. So two to three cups of coffee in the morning is ideal. This range provides maximum protective benefits without negative circadian disruption. You can also drink de-caf coffee after noon. So if you love the taste of coffee, there's a little bit of a placebo effect as well. You get these benefits from the polyphenols if you drink the coffee later in the day. So you can actually choose de-caf to avoid interfering with your sleep quality. So in short, early caffeine intake seems to really align well with biological rhythms. It enhances cognitive performance during the day, protects against cardiovascular disease, and it maximizes coffee's powerful longevity benefits. But you don't want to continuously keep drinking it all throughout the day. Coffee also has powerful effects on metabolism, particularly the body's ability to regulate glucose and fat utilization. Regular coffee drinking, especially around two to three cups per day, consistently reduces the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. In fact, studies show that drinking two to three cups of coffee daily can cut diabetes risk by as much as 60%. But why does coffee have such a profound metabolic benefit? One reason appears to be its ability to activate AMP kinase or AMP K for short. This is a central metabolic regulator inside of ourselves. It's activated when we're in a fasted stay in a caloric deficit after intense exercise or metabolic stress. Compounds in coffee like caffeine and the chlorogenic acids can actually flip that AMP K switch on, and that controls how ourselves process energy, how it manages glucose levels, and how our cells handle fats. When AMP kinase turns on, it tells the cell to burn fat, take up glucose, shut down growth pathways like M-tore. So by boosting AMP kinase activity, coffee actually helps the body become more efficient at using energy and maintaining healthier blood sugar levels. Chronic mild AMP K activation is a leading explanation, but it's not the only one. Improved gut microbiome composition reduced inflammation, enhanced fat oxidation, also play roles as well. There's a bit of a twist here because coffee can acutely raise fasting blood glucose in some individuals and may slightly decrease insulin sensitivity in the short term. Largely via acutic activation, but the overall long term effect is protective. It improves glucose tolerance, reduces triglyceride levels, and lowers long-term diabetes risk. So coffee seems to make our metabolic machinery healthier and more responsive and better able to protect itself against age-related metabolic disease. Believe it or not, coffee used to be labeled a potential carcinogen from the 1990s to about 2016. That was wrong. The label rested on weak confounded evidence, but a crillamide was really at the heart of it. A crillamide is a chemical form naturally when coffee beans are roasted as well as during the cooking of starchy foods at high temperatures. Although a crillamide has caused cancer and lab animals at very high doses, the levels typically found in coffee pose a minimal risk to humans. One standard bootcup delivers roughly 2-5 micrograms of a crillamide. You need to drink 25-50 cups a day to hit the conservative reference level, which is around 2 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day. What we now know is that coffee does not increase your cancer risk. In fact, it probably reduces it, particularly for certain major cancers, including liver cancer andometrial cancer and skin cancer. The evidence here is compelling. Each daily cup of coffee you drink is associated with roughly a 15-20% reduction in liver cancer risk and about a 10% lower risk of endometrial cancer, with maximum benefit seen around 4-5 cups per day. Even the international agency for research on cancer recently acknowledged coffee's protective role, officially removing coffee from their list of possible carcinogens. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and it is the leading cause of death in Canada, Japan, and many Western European Union states. So it is important to pay attention to. Why does coffee have these powerful anti-cancer effects? Well, coffee doesn't just have anti-oxidant properties. It actively reduces DNA damage. This is one of the fundamental triggers of cancer. A compelling randomized controlled trial demonstrated that people drinking dark-roast coffee daily had a 23% reduction in their DNA double-stranded brakes compared to water alone. Now, DNA double-stranded brakes are among the most severe forms of genetic damage. To give you context, this is the type of damage you typically see from ionizing radiation, the kind that directly threatens your genetic code and your chromosomes, the structures that house your DNA. And this is not just the DNA integrity at stake. Chromosomal damage directly accelerates the shortening of telomeres, these are the tiny caps that protect our chromosomes from damage or DNA that's packaged in our chromosomes. And telomeres naturally shortened with age, but damage accelerates this process dramatically. And once the telomeres become critically short, our cells then enter a state known as senescence. This is kind of a cellular aging that not only drives the aging process itself, but also greatly increases our risk for chronic diseases including cancer. By actively reducing DNA double-stranded brakes, coffeemen at only protect against cancer directly, but also may help maintain telomere length thereby potentially slowing cellular aging and preserving genomics stability. And in fact, studies have found that regular coffee drinkers do have longer telomeres compared to non-copy drinkers. Mechanistically, coffee triggers are cells to activate something called NRF2. This is a master cellular switch that ramps up our body's own antioxidant defenses, including glutathione. This is enhancing our natural capacity for DNA repair. But coffee's protective effects go even broader. It also influences liver metabolism, hormone regulation, and inflammation, all critical on preventing cancers that thrive on metabolic dysfunction or hormone imbalance. Interestingly, decaffinated coffee consistently shows similar protective effects, which strongly suggests that beneficial compounds beyond caffeine, such as polyphenols and the melanoidins, are primarily driving these anti-cancer benefits. Coffee's health effects may actually start in the gut. Each cup of coffee delivers up to two grams of soluble fiber, plus a pharmacy of polyphenols, chlorogenic acids, melanoidins, diterpines, and trigoneline. In a 23,000-person natural microbiology data set, coffee was the single strongest dietary factor shaping the microbiome, enriching 115 bacterial species. One loss in Ibackter species shows up almost exclusively in habitual coffee drinkers, essentially acting as a microbial coffee fingerprint. What this bacterial species actually does is firmens coffee, fiber, and polyphenols into bioactive compounds, such as quinnic acid conjugate and short chain fatty acids. Short chain fatty acids tighten gut barrier integrity, dampen inflammation, and improve insulin sensitivity, and the quinnic acid metabolites flip on the NRF2 switch for anti-oxininactivity, and in animal models, even lower PCSK9, which is a regulator of LDL cholesterol clearance. This is early data, but intriguing for heart health. Sur randomized controlled trials actually back this up. Three cups of filtered coffee per day for eight weeks increased bifidobacterium and fecalibacterium abundance. These are both major, short chain fatty acid producers, and it did this without harming gut microbial diversity. So parallel rodent work shows that coffee melidoidens actually thicken the mucus layer, and it suppresses opportunistic pathogens from taking hold in the gut. And coffee dose does matter. The sweet spot appears to be two to four cups a day. That range reliably enriches short chain fatty acid producing bacteria while keeping the pro and flammatory strains in check. Go much higher in the data gets noisy and diversity shifts our study dependent. So I think the key takeaway here is that coffee, caffeinated or decaffinated acts as a prebiotic matrix. It has fibers, melanoidins, and polyphenols that feed the gut ecosystem that in turn generate metabolites linked to lower inflammation, that'll better cholesterol handling, and neuroprotection. So the next time you're having your coffee, remember you're not just stimulating your brain, you're actually feeding an entire microbial network in your gut that may be central to coffee's longevity signal. There is an important nuance when it comes to coffee's health benefits such as the cancer protective effects. Brewing method does matter. Most studies show clear cancer protection involved filtered coffee. Boyle or unfiltered methods like the French press or espresso allow oily compounds called dieterpeens to enter our cup of coffee. At higher consumption levels, these dieterpeens have an associated with slightly elevated risk of certain cancers such as pancreatic cancer and respiratory tract cancers. So why does brewing method have such a profound impact on health outcomes? It comes down to two key groups of coffee compounds. On the one hand, coffee is rich in polyphenols. These are powerful anti-oxidins that can lower dementia risk by as much as 50% and reduce DNA damage. This is a critical precursor to cancer by around 23%. On the other hand, coffee also contains these fat soluble dieterpeens. If not filtered out, the dieterpeens can significantly raise LDL cholesterol. By as much as 30 milligrams per deciliter within just a few weeks, this elevates cardiovascular risk. Regardless of one's perspective on LDL's role in cardiovascular disease, there is no reason coffee should be raising your LDL by this much. So this is best avoided if possible. To fully optimize coffee's health benefits, we need to understand how different brewing methods dramatically change its chemical makeup, and ultimately it's impact on our health. Coffee contains two critical types of compounds we're going to focus on. First, dieterpeens specifically calf stall and kaiwial. These are fat soluble molecules that naturally are found in coffee beans. The problem with these dieterpeens is that they significantly raise LDL cholesterol. In fact, studies have found that people who regularly drink unfiltered coffee like from French press, espresso, or boiled coffee, it can raise their LDL levels by roughly 10 to 30 milligrams per deciliter within just a few weeks, and that does increase cardiovascular disease risk. There's also links between higher dieterpeen exposure from unfiltered coffee with slightly elevated risk of certain cancers. Second and more beneficially, coffee beans are rich in polyphenols, primarily the chlorogenic acids. Polyphenols are powerful antioxidants that reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, protect us from chronic diseases, unlike dieterpeens, polyphenols are water soluble so they dissolve in water and easily pass through paper filters. Here's why this chemical difference matters. Brewing methods dictate how much these compounds end up in our coffee. Unfiltered methods like espresso, French press, boiled coffee, or stove top percolators, retain the oily dieterpeens. For perspective, espresso contains around 1100 milligrams of calfstall per liter. Turkish boiled coffee contains around 900 milligrams per liter, while French press and mocha pots contain 70 to 90 milligrams per liter. Practically, that means one espresso shot has about 30 milligrams of calfstall and a typical cup of coffee from other unfiltered methods have between 10 and 200 milligrams. In contrast, filtered coffees like traditional paper drip, instant cold brew, trap these dieterpeens in the filter essentially eliminating their negative effects while still preserving beneficial polyphenols. Recent studies have shown that even work place coffee machines would usually lack proper filtration, deliver significantly higher dieterpeen concentrations between 140 to 170 milligrams per liter. Compared to filtered coffee prepared which often shows undetectable levels. As a side note, I do want to mention that many traditional paper drip coffee machines do run hot water through plastic. In other words, hot water going to plastic will accelerate the release of microplastics into your beverage as well as their plastic associated chemicals. So if you are going to do filtered coffee, pour over is probably your best bet doing something into a glass container and not having the hot water touch plastic. On a similar note, if you're drinking espresso, those espresso pods are also plastic and so having hot water go through those pods is also releasing microplastics and their associated chemicals into your beverage as well. Just something to keep in mind. Now, what about the anti-oxidants which significantly contribute to the health benefits of coffee? The story shifts here a little bit as espresso actually tops the chart in anti-oxyactivity per volume. This is because it has a very intense extraction. Cold brew also ranks very highly because it's extended brewing duration, French press and percolators provide moderate antioxidant levels while filtered drip and instant coffee, though slightly lower still offer substantial antioxidant benefits. But antioxidants don't depend solely on brewing methods. They're also influenced by being type, roast level, how the beans are grown and brewing temperature. First, let's consider the two major coffee species, Arabaca and Robusta. Arabaca beans are generally preferred for flavor. They contain less caffeine, so about half as much and there's somewhat fewer chlorogenic acids. Those are the key antioxidant than Robusta beans. Robusta beans are higher in caffeine, higher in the chlorogenic acids and they deliver more potent antioxidant effects and stronger mental stimulation. But they also tend to taste more bitter and earthy. But origin matters too, where and how coffee is grown, also influences its biochemical makeup in important ways. So altitude does matter. Beans grown at higher altitude elevations, like those from Columbia's high altitude regions, mature slowly leading to a sweeter brighter flavor and less caffeine and antioxidant density, compared to beans grown at lower altitudes. Sun exposure and latitude matter, so coffee beans from regions near the equator, like Ethiopia or Kenya typically develop higher concentrations of antioxidants like the chlorogenic acids, as protection against intense sunlight and environmental stress. So it's an adaptation. It's kind of a stress response at the coffee bean plant. It's producing more of these antioxidants. Soil type matter, so mineral rich volcanic soils found in regions like Guatemala and Colombia, influence coffee bean composition. It enhances the sweetness and complex flavors due to the elevated sucrose and lipicontent and processing techniques washed versus natural also matter. So how beans are processed after harvesting can affect their fermentation and amino acid levels and how antioxidants form during the roasting process. This directly influences their final biochemical composition and also their health potential. So practically speaking, I think the best way to choose a coffee bean. If your goal is higher antioxidants, cognitive enhancement, maximum caffeine kick, you might want to lean towards robust abeans or as a second best-being grown closer to the equator, like a coffee from Ethiopia or Kenya. If you prefer milder simulation, a sweeter taste, slightly lower caffeine than a higher altitude orabaca like those from Colombia or Ethiopia would be ideal. Remember that roasting and brewing methods can also dramatically influence the final antioxidant content in coffee. It generally peaks around medium roast. A darker roast reduces antioxidant levels regardless of species and brewing methods like paper filtered coffee will remove most of the cholesterol-raising dieterpeans and the leave most of the polyphenols there no matter where your beans are from. Finally, brewing temperature also does play a role. Really hot brewing methods like espresso or drip brewing quickly extract antioxidants due to the higher temperatures and shorter brew times, cold brewing while lower and temperature can reach comparable antioxidant levels if it's steeped long enough so this is typically 12 to 24 hours, but hot methods generally yield higher concentrations per serving. So here's how to translate all this science into a smarter coffee shopping decision. You want to focus on three variables, species, origin and roast. First, if you want maximum antioxidant, a robust adominent blend is your highest yield option. Robusted beans contain about 60% more chlorogenic acids than arabica. If you prefer the flavor of arabica, choose lots grown near the equator at high elevation, think altitude, Ethiopia, Kenya, because equatorial sunlight and slow maturation will boost the polyphenol density well above lower latitude arabica from say Colombia or Peru. And finally, keep the roast in the light to medium range that window preserves the greatest fraction of chlorogenic acids, whereas dark roast burn off a significant portion of those antioxidants. So given everything we've discussed so far, it might not surprise you that the brewing method you choose can dramatically influence coffee's health impact, but what's truly fascinating and maybe surprising is just how distinct these outcomes can be depending on how you prepare your coffee. Filtered coffee consistently stands out as the best choice for longevity and overall health. A major cohort study found that regularly drinking filtered coffee was linked to about a 15% lower all-cosmortality compared to drinking no coffee at all. Similarly, regular consumption of filtered coffee around 2 to 5 cups per day is strongly associated with a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular related mortality compared to drinking no coffee at all. Neither of these protective associations were observed with unfiltered coffee methods like French press likely due to their cholesterol-raising deterpines. And when it comes to cognitive health, the data is even more striking. Consistently drinking filtered coffee can lower your dementia risk by as much as 50% compared to not drinking coffee, but these benefits diminish sharply or even reverse when using unfiltered brewing methods, particularly when consuming extreme quantities of coffee. For instance, heavy consumption of boiled coffee like Turkish coffee, we're talking extreme around 8 cups or more per day is linked to a nearly double risk of dementia compared to moderate drinkers likely due to those deterpines which I mentioned earlier. They're raising LDL cholesterol. High intake of boiled coffee also shows potential association with increased risk for specific cancers as mentioned earlier. Pancreatic cancer respiratory tract cancers as well. So it really highlights the need for moderation and caution when you're drinking boiled coffee. Don't want to go to that extreme level of drinking 8 cups per day. I would say given the otherwise strong evidence for coffee's anti-dementia effects at more normal doses, either excessive intake itself or specifically boiled coffee is likely the culprit here with respect to increased dementia risk because as I mentioned earlier, filtered coffee is associated with as much as a 50% lower dementia risk compared to not drinking coffee. Now, espresso is somewhat of a special case, while espresso does still contain those cholesterol-raising dieterpines, moderate espresso consumption like two to three servings daily remains strongly associated with a lower overall mortality likely due to his exceptionally high antioxidant density per ounce. Espresso's robust polyphenol continent might actually balance out some of the dieterping-related downsides, providing that you're maintaining a moderate consumption of espresso. Instant coffee, which is often overlooked, actually holds up remarkably well against filtered coffee. Studies consistently find that instant coffee drinkers also benefit from a lower all-caused mortality as well as a significant protection against diabetes and cognitive decline. That's probably because instant coffee also has high antioxidant levels similar to traditionally brewed coffee. So to sum it up, filtered coffee really emerges as the best way to brew coffee. It offers the strongest, most consistent health benefits across cardiovascular metabolic cognitive and longevity outcomes. Espresso and instant coffee also provides substantial protective effects that moderate consumption levels. Unfiltered methods, especially boiled coffee, or very heavy-french press consumption require greater caution due to their cholesterol-raising dieterpines and at very, very extreme high levels, eight cups or more a day, potential cognitive risks, even though moderate intake probably still offers beneficial polyphenols and antioxidants. Before we continue, I just want to mention something important. If you're finding these episodes valuable, please consider subscribing to the channel and clicking the notification bell. It's the only way to ensure you'll be notified when a new episode goes live. Many people assume they'll be alerted automatically, but unless the bell is clicked, they won't be. Now, back to the episode. And coffee's health benefits extend far beyond just its caffeine content, and that really challenges a major assumption that many people hold that caffeine alone drives coffee's benefits. But the story shifts dramatically when we look at neurological outcomes, like cognitive decline and neurodrenarb diseases. This is where caffeine clearly takes center stage. Regular caffeinated coffee drinkers typically those consuming around three or more cups per day show a remarkable 34 to 37% reduction in the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease compared to non-drinkers. Even moderate caffeine intake about two cups per day, or around 200 milligrams daily, noticeably slows cognitive decline, particularly in people already showing signs of mild cognitive impairment. This is a common precursor to Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, genetically predicted higher caffeine levels in the bloodstream have also been linked to lower Alzheimer's disease risk, suggesting caffeine itself might directly influence brain aging. The neuroprotective effects of caffeine can be traced directly to its unique biological mechanism of action. Caffeine functions as a competitive antagonist at denacing a2A and a1 receptors. The a2A subtype is especially critical here because these receptors are densely expressed along the indirect pathway of our basal ganglia. This is a key brain region that's involved in motor control and movement regulation. By blocking a2A receptors caffeine reduces the excessive inhibitory that's characteristic of Parkinson's disease simultaneously boosting dopamine de-tube receptor activity. Animal studies reinforce this mechanistic picture, so chronic blockade of the A2A receptors with caffeine consistently reduces neuroinflammation. It limits harmful aggregation of alphastic nucleon. This is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and it also preserves mitochondrial function in dopamine producing neurons. The clinical relevance is pretty striking in that some Parkinson's drugs now specifically target the same A2A receptors. The precise molecular action of A2A receptors could explain why caffeine delivers unique neurological benefits that de-caffeinated coffee does not replicate. So if you're wanting to preserve your cognitive function, if protecting your brain is a primary goal, caffeinated coffee clearly emerges as this superior choice. Now beyond just protecting your brain against long-term neurogenar diseases, caffeine is also a powerful rapid acting cognitive enhancer. At moderate doses roughly 100 to 300 milligrams per day or about 1 to 3 cups of coffee, it reliably boosts attention, improves working memory, speeds up reaction times by about 10 to 15 percent, and enhances overall cognitive performance, especially when you're tired or at those less optimal times of the day like early morning or the mid afternoon slump. How does caffeine achieve these immediate cognitive improvements? It all comes back to a dentistine. So as you stay awake, a dentistine builds up binding to specific receptors A1 and A2 in the brain, slowing down neural activity and increasing sleep pressure. Caffeine blocks these receptors, essentially removing that break, allowing the brain circuits associated with alertness and attention, powered by neurotransmitters like dopamine and neuropinephrine and acetylcholine to become more active. And the result is greater mental clarity, quicker thinking, reduced feelings that fatigue, but caffeine is not the whole story. Coffee contains several other bioactive compounds, particularly the polyphenols like the chlorogenic acids that independently benefit the brain, even without caffeine. Decaffeinated coffee, which preserves these polyphenols, can still improve blood flow and oxygen delivery to active brain regions during challenging tasks. This is a process called neurovascular coupling. Polyphenols also increase levels of brain-driveneratrophic factor or BDNF, which is an essential growth factor for neuroplasticity, for learning and memory. So for example, studies have shown that a single serving of coffee fruit extract can boost circulating BDNF levels by over 140%. In addition, these coffee polyphenols act as anti-oxidance and anti-inflammatory agents, activating protective-solar pathways like NRF2, and reducing inflammation-promoting ones like NFCB. And this helps maintain vascular health and neuronal integrity. So practically speaking, achieving these polyphenols-driven cognitive benefits typically requires around 400-800 milligrams of the chlorogenic acids per day, which is roughly found in about two cups of medium-rose filtered coffee. Interestingly, a small amount of caffeine around 75 milligrams to 100 milligrams actually seems to improve your body's absorption of these polyphenols, creating a beneficial synergy. Higher-cafing doses might narrow blood vessels, constriction, slightly counteracting some of the vascular benefits. So again, moderation remains key, and while caffeine clearly drives many of coffee's immediate cognitive enhancements and long-term neuroprotective effects, the rich blend of other bioactive compounds in coffee does deliver meaningful brain benefits even without caffeine. D-caf won't match caffeine's potential impact on a denocene signaling, but it does remain a valuable option to be preferred to avoid caffeine, and you still want to have some brain support of effects. Now let's talk about caffeine and physical performance with the data says how to use caffeine optimally and when you're getting too much. So first off, caffeine is arguably the most studied and reliable performance enhance your available. It consistently improves performance across endurance sports, strength training, and cognitive tasks requiring focus and reaction speed. So how much caffeine do you actually need? The science points to a dose range of about three to six milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of your body weight. Practically speaking, if you weigh about 70 kilograms or 155 pounds, that's roughly 200 to 400 milligrams of caffeine or about one to four cups of coffee depending on how strong your coffee is. Lower endoces around three milligrams per kilogram body weight are effective for most people, but higher doses up to six milligrams per kilogram body weight might be necessary if you're habituated to caffeine. In endurance events like running, cycling, swimming, you typically see about a three to five percent improvement in performance. In strength or power-based activities, caffeine reliably boost strength output and muscular endurance by about two to four percent. And even again, cognitive skills, focus, reaction time, attention. These get about 10 to 15 percent bump from a modest caffeine dose of about 100 to 150 milligrams. Caffeine peaks in your bloodstream around 45 to 60 minutes after ingestion and the performance enhancing effects do last about two to four hours. So keep this timing in mind to maximize its benefits, especially for competition or intense workouts or if you're looking for that mental pump. There's a clear ceiling to caffeine's benefits going beyond 400 milligrams rarely provides additional performance gains and frequently increases negative effects like anxiety, jitters, increased heart rate, digestive issues, and crucially, sleep disruption. So consuming caffeine later than about eight hours before your bedtime will cut into your sleep quality, undermining training adaptations and recovery. Unfortunately, D.C.F. Coffee does not have the same performance benefits. Studies consistently show D.C.F. Coffee is essentially equivalent to placebo for physical performance. D.C. Coffee does provide beneficial polyphenols and there's a variety of health benefits that we've already discussed. But if you're looking for this documented urgogenic physical performance enhancement, caffeine itself is necessary. If you are wanting to harness some of the urgogenic effects from your coffee, you might aim for a dose around 1.5 to 2 cups of coffee and consume it around 45 minutes to 60 minutes before your event or your training. If you use caffeine daily periodically taking short breaks anywhere between two to seven days can actually resensitize you to caffeine, making caffeine more effective when you return to it. And again, it's very wise for most people to stop consuming caffeine at least eight to 10 hours before bedtime. You want to protect your sleep, you want your sleep quality be good and you want to be able to recover. For general health, longevity and even cancer prevention, both caffeinated and de-caffinated coffee do offer substantial benefits. Regular consumption of either type of coffee is consistently associated with impressive reductions in chronic disease risk, including lower rates of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. And importantly, studies reassure us that neither caffeinated nor de-caffinated coffee increases cancer risk. Instead, these protective benefits largely stem from coffee's rich, complex-bend of polyphenols, anti-oxidants and other bioactive compounds not just caffeine itself. But if you do drink de-caff coffee, it's important to be aware of how the caffeine was removed. Most de-caffination processes use chemical solvents like methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Methylene chloride, for example, can sound concerning, it's industrially used in paint strippers. But the levels permitted in coffee are extremely low and strictly regulated, generally far below any threshold considered harmful by the FDA. Ethel acetate is sometimes called natural because it occurs in fruits, is similarly safe at these tiny residual concentrations. Independent testing consistently shows actual residues of these solvents in commercial de-caff coffee are often undetectable or far lower than the FDA's already stringent standards, which is reassuring. But if you do prefer to avoid chemical solvents entirely, there are excellent alternatives. The Swiss water process, for instance, uses only water and activated carbon, no chemicals involved. Another popular solvent for your approach is the carbon dioxide decapination, which uses presheride carbon dioxide gas to gently remove caffeine without affecting flavor or leaving residues. Both methods reliably eliminate caffeine while keeping beneficial polyphenols, anti-oxidance vitamins and coffee oils in them largely intact. Nutritionally, de-caff coffee remains virtually identical to regular coffee just minus the caffeine. And modern solvent-free methods also also preserve the flavor remarkably well. So, the science does show that de-caff coffee no matter how it's produced, even with solvents, is safe and has beneficial effects overall. If you look at most of these studies that have been done showing the beneficial effects of de-caffinated coffee, most people are just drinking standard de-caffinated coffee that is not using a solvent-free method. But if even trace amounts of chemical solvents, do make you uncomfortable choosing the Swiss water method or carbon dioxide decaffination coffee is probably your best bet. There's a lot of discussion out there about whether coffee is contaminated by mold toxins called micro toxins. And if these pose real health risks, let's cut through the noise and look at what the science actually says and then talk about practical steps to ensure your coffee remains safe. First, what exactly are micro toxins? Their natural toxins produced by certain molds. In coffee, the primary micro toxin of concern is called okrotoxin A or OTA. At high chronic doses, far above what you'd ever encounter in coffee, OTA can damage kidneys and is considered a probable carcinogen. Occasionally, you might hear about aflatoxins too, but they're mostly never detected in coffee. Now, how common are these micro toxins actually? Large scale global surveys involving thousands of coffee samples show that more than 95 percent are well below international safety limits for OTA. Importantly, roasting your coffee beans destroys roughly 70 to 90 percent of any existing OTA and brewing removes even more leaving the final amount in your cup extremely low. Far below any scientifically established health risk. In fact, epidemiological studies consistently show coffee drinkers have a reduced risk of liver and kidney diseases, exactly the opposite of what you'd expect if a low level OTA micro toxin exposure was a significant issue. So, the reality is, for most coffee drinkers, consuming moderate amounts, any micro toxin exposure is minimal and far outweighed by coffee's proven health benefits. But if you're still concerned and it's reasonable to want to minimize any potential risk, here are some of the best practices you can follow. One, choose specially grade coffee beans from reputable roasters, specially coffee is carefully screened, tested and graded dramatically reducing mold risk. Two, opt for washed wet process coffees. Wash coffees from regions like Ethiopia or Columbia have lower mold risk due to the removal of surface contaminants during processing. Three, make sure you store your beans properly, keep coffee beans in an airtight container away from moisture and heat to prevent mold growth, ideally consume them within about a month of roasting. And number four, use paper filters when brewing. Paper filters can help capture residual compounds including potential trace micotoxins, which further reduces exposure. So, in summary, yes, molds can occasionally grow on coffee beans, but good sourcing, storage, roasting and brewing practices reliably eliminate any meaningful risk. I think the bottom line here is coffees proven cardiovascular metabolic cognitive and neuroprotective benefits far outweigh any theoretical micotoxin concern, especially when you source and handle your beans with these simple precautions. Now let's talk about coffee additives. Many people ask, does adding dairy to your coffee blunt its beneficial effects? The shorter answer is partially yes, especially if your goal is rapid polyphenol absorption and maximum cognitive benefit. So here's what happens. Milk contains casine and way proteins which bind tightly to coffee's main anti-oxinins, the chlorogenic acids. These protein polyphenol complexes slow down early absorption in the small intestine, reducing the sharp immediate surge in these antioxidants in your bloodstream by about 20 to 30 percent. Instead polyphenols travel farther down that digestive track where the gut microbiomes eventually break them down. You're not losing the benefits completely, but you're massively delaying them and modifying how these compounds are metabolized. If you want to have immediate brain enhancing effects such as improved cognition, rapid antioxidant activity, and early anti-inflammatory signaling, black coffee or coffee with minimal protein is the way to go even small amounts of dairy can significantly blunt this rapid polyphenol availability. On the other hand, if your priority is general health, gut microbiome support, or simply taste an enjoyment, modest dairy consumption likely won't erase coffee's broader benefits. But if you want peak immediate cognitive enhancement from coffee's polyphenols, I strongly suggest you keep your coffee black or use a small amount of plant-based milk, such as almond milk, which interacts minimally with these beneficial compounds. Or what about MCT powder? Medium chain triglycerides or MCTs behave differently from dairy proteins, unlike casine and way protein and milk, MCT powder does not bind polyphenols in coffee so it won't significantly delay their absorption or blunt their rapid bio-availability. In fact, adding MCT to your coffee can potentially enhance cognitive benefits through a different pathway by increasing keyto levels, which provide an alternative rapidly available energy source for neurons. This can support alertness, focus, and even mood, especially in a fasted or low-carb state. But there is another critical point to consider when you're using MCT powder, and that would be the saturated fat content. Heavy cream, MCT powders, these contain substantial amounts of saturated fat, and if you're consuming multiple cups of coffee daily, say three to four cups, you could be easily taking in an extra 15 to 20 grams of saturated fat per day and just your coffee. Consistent high-saturated fat intake does elevate apobie containing lipropotines, which is the primary driver of cardiovascular disease risk. So you don't want to be consistently elevating your apobie with every cup of coffee that you're drinking. If you do drink coffee frequently throughout the day, it's probably wise to be mindful of what you add to your coffee. So occasionally use MCT or cream is likely harmless, but multiple times a day, and you're doing if you're doing heavy additions of it to your coffee, it might actually have a significant impact on your lipid profile. If you do want to keep your apobie in check, well, maximize in coffee health benefits, you should probably stick with black coffee or small amounts of cream, small amounts of MCT, or also opt for the unsweetened plant-based milks like almond milk. Another common question I get is, can you add something to your coffee to amplify its cognitive benefits and reduce some of the jitteriness caffeine can cause? And the answer is yes, a particularly effective compound is L-theane. This is an amino acid naturally found in green tea that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Eltheane works synergistically with caffeine on its own caffeine enhances alertness by blocking a denysing receptors, boosting dopamine and norphenaphrine, great for focus, but sometimes this creates anxiety or jitteriness. Eltheane increases GABA and glycine signaling in the brain creating a state of characterized alpha brain waves. These are the primary brain rhythms that are linked to calm, attentive states without sedation. So what you're doing by pairing the two is essentially smoothing out caffeine's stimulatory spike. Multiple studies show that combining roughly 100 to 200 milligrams of eltheane with about 100 to 150 milligrams of caffeine, approximately the amount in a standard cup of coffee, significantly improves cognitive performance. People experience enhanced sustained attention, faster reaction times, better accuracy on demanding cognitive tasks, and notably fewer feelings of anxiety or jitterness. Eltheane even dampens caffeine's transient blood pressure increase without sacrificing alertness. So practically speaking, here's what I think is best for maximizing the cognitive benefits of coffee. Parabout 1 cup of coffee, so 100 to about 150 milligrams of caffeine, with about 100 to 200 milligrams of eltheane. Take them at the same time. They have similar absorption kinetics, so if you simultaneously take them, that works the best. You can easily find eltheane as a powder or a capsule. It dissolves directly into coffee and has minimal taste effects. So this combination is really safe. It's well studied and it's low risk at these doses. I do want to make it absolutely clear that eltheane doesn't remove caffeine's sleep disrupting effects. So you still need to keep caffeine intake early in the day, but if you're looking for that calm, sustained jitter-free cognitive boost from coffee adding eltheane really is a powerful scientifically validated tool. So in summary, coffee, when consumed correctly, is really a powerful tool backed by rigorous science for enhancing health span, extending lifespan and protecting against the deadliest diseases of aging, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. We now know that coffee actively influences the fundamental mechanisms of biological aging at this cellular level, shaping everything from our epigenetic age and DNA integrity to metabolism, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function. But to summarize some of the benefits fully, timing and preparation do matter. Early in the day consumption, maximize is circadian biology, optimizes sleep, metabolism, and overall health. Filtered coffee methods eliminate cholesterol raising compounds while preserving anti-oxidants that actively repair DNA and reduce inflammation. And while caffeine offers unique neuroprotective and cognitive benefits, even decaf coffee contributes powerful bioactive compounds that nourish our gut microbiome and also fight disease. In practical terms, the science suggests consuming about two to three cups of coffee daily, ideally filtered and primarily in the morning hours. You want to keep added of minimal to preserve the immediate cognitive and long-term metabolic benefits, and you also want to consider strategic supplements like eltheane to amplify caffeine's cognitive clarity without anxiety. Ultimately, coffee is an accessible evidence-based approach to improving our health at every level from cells and genes to cognition and physical performance. If used wisely, it's not just a beverage, it's really a scientifically supported intervention for longevity and well-being. I'm Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and I'll talk to you soon.
