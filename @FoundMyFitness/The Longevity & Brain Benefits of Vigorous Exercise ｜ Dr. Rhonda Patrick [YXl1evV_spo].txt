Welcome to the Family Fitness Podcast. I'm your host, Rhonda Patrick. Today we're diving deep into the science and practicality of incorporating vigorous intensity exercise into our lives. It's not just about living longer, it's about enriching the quality of life at essentially every stage and also influencing brain function. During vigorous exercise, our muscles essentially become mini biochemical labs synthesizing compounds like lactate and myocides. These aren't just muscle bound. They get into circulation. They travel to far-up tissues and they signal to them and they have a variety of benefits, including the synthesis of elements like brain-drive neurotrophic factor or BDNF, crucial for brain health and neuronal health. They also potentially initiate anti-cancer mechanisms. Not only are muscles little chemical producing factories, but they also act like sponges to soak up compounds that can be harmful to the brain, improving mental health and reducing neurodegenerative disease risk. We're going to dive deep into the realm of VO2 Max optimization. VO2 Max is not just about a measure of cardiovascular respiratory fitness, it's directly linked to longevity. Essentially, the higher your VO2 Max, the longer you're likely to live, and there doesn't seem to be an upper limit to the life-extending benefits of enhanced cardiovascular respiratory fitness, at least within your genetic potential. We'll get into the details of how to calibrate high intensity efforts with zone 2 training, methodologies for improving VO2 Max, with the spotlight on the Norwegian 4x4 protocol, and even touch on some straightforward tactics like assessing VO2 Max, so the pragmatic test, which is the 12 minute run test. Equally important, we'll navigate through the processes of myotophageen mitochondrial biogenesis. These are cornerstones for cellular rejuvenation, essentially reversing the aging process on a cellular level. There's a lot of questions to answer, what is vigorous exercise? What is high intensity exercise? What about zone 2 training? So let's start by covering what is not vigorous exercise. Zone 2 training is also sometimes known as aerobic-based training. It primarily targets aerobic energy systems and can be sustained for longer durations. We're talking an hour and more. Some experts define this type of training to be around 70 to 80% of maximum heart rate. Possibly lower for people that are unfit. It's also defined by the talk test, so you should be able to talk comfortably, but not sing. So you should be a little breathy when you're talking, but still able to talk comfortably. Zone 2 training involves exercising at a moderate intensity. It's a steady state type of lactate threshold training. Lactate threshold refers to the point at which the body begins to produce lactate at a faster rate than it can clear it away. So keep in mind there's a lot of individual variation in determining the lactate threshold because people can have different baseline lactate levels for one, which is typically around 0.9 to 1 millimolar generally speaking. People also have different rates of lactate production and clearance. And even at the same relative exercise intensity. So for example, trained athletes might have a higher lactate threshold in terms of both exercise intensity and lactate concentration compared to untrained individuals. Genetics also play a role. There are many great podcasts out there covering zone 2 training, including Peter T. as the drive with guest Dr. Enigo San Milion. Now let's talk about vigorous exercise. So generally speaking, vigorous exercise represents a level of exertion where exercise goes beyond the lactate threshold, which means lactate begins to accumulate in the muscles more rapidly. There are various intensities within vigorous exercise. So a level intensity referred to as the maximal steady state threshold. Sometimes called zone 3 is above the lactate threshold and it's challenging to hold a conversation and it's difficult to maintain this level of exercise for longer than 20 to 30 minutes. This level of intensity is somewhere between 80 to 85 percent max heart rate. However vigorous exercise also includes exercising at intensities higher than this. So a higher intensity training where there's significant amount of lactate accumulation and your close to your what's called anaerobic threshold, this is a level of intensity usually around 85 to 95 percent max heart rate and it's difficult to maintain for longer than a few minutes. Sometimes this type of training intensity is called zone 4 training. Then there's the all out near maximal intensity and this is sometimes called zone 5 training. These are shorter intervals and it's generally hard to maintain this level level of intensity for longer than one minute. So when we're talking about high intensity interval training, it involves alternating between periods of high intensity vigorous exercise in periods of lower intensity rest depending on the high intensity interval training or hit for short protocol. These can include intervals ranging from zone 3 to zone 5 followed by recovery periods. The idea that high intensity interval training is only anaerobic is a misconception. While high intensity interval training exercise does rely more heavily on anaerobic energy systems, it still requires significant aerobic metabolism. So hit can improve both aerobic and anaerobic fitness and it's my opinion that getting your heart rate to at least 80 percent max heart rate. So that being at least 80 percent is a really good place to be if you are targeting brain benefits and we'll dive a lot into that in a minute. But I want to start by talking about cardiovascular respiratory fitness, health span and longevity. So the O2 max is a measure of maximal oxygen uptake which reflects an individual's ability to utilize oxygen during exercise. It's considered one of the best indicators of cardiovascular respiratory fitness and it's associated with improved health span, increased lifespan, higher cardiovascular level as measured by VO2 max have been consistently leaked to reduced risk of mortality and longer lifespan. So in the podcast when I use the term VO2 max, just keep in mind that it's a measurement of cardiovascular respiratory fitness. The greatest longevity benefit that comes from improving your VO2 max is from people starting from a below average VO2 max and moving anywhere above average. So even going from a below normal VO2 max for your age group in gender to a low normal is associated with a 2.1 year increase in life expectancy. bumping that up going from a below normal to high normal VO2 max is associated with a 2.9 year increase in life expectancy and going even further to the upper limit of normal is associated with 4.9 year. So almost five year increase in life expectancy. On average each unit increase in VO2 max. So that's one milliliter per kilogram per minute is associated with a 45 day increase in life expectancy. In another study involving only men for every 10 unit increase in VO2 max. So this would be then 10 mills per kilogram per minute. There was a 17% lower risk of death from cancer and a 11% lower all cause mortality. So dying for many different non accidental causes of death. Another study published in JAMA in 2018 found that there was no apparent upper limit to the benefit of cardiovascular respiratory fitness on mortality within normal ranges of human life expectancy of course. In fact the study reported that elite performers, these are people that performed in the top 2.3% on the fitness test, had an 80% reduction in mortality risk compared to the lowest performer. So they performed in the bottom 25% on the fitness test. And if you compare the elite performers to the high performers, so these folks did really well but they were just under the elite. They were between the top 25% and the top 2.3%. The elite performers had a 20% mortality risk decline compared to even those high performers. But going back to what I said earlier about just moving out of that low fitness group will give huge advantages to life expectancy. So people on the low fitness group had a five-fold higher risk of death than the elite performers. But what is also so interesting is that the risk of dying due to low fitness was similar or even bigger than risks associated with having heart disease, smoking or diabetes. So being fitter is really good for your health at every level of fitness and there's always room for improvement. So the question is, well how can we improve our B02 max? Lots of different training protocols zone. Two training for example, high intensity interval training, you know, vigorous intensity exercise, all improve cardiovascular respiratory fitness and can increase VO2 max. Hit has been shown to significantly improve VO2 max, even with shorter training durations. This is because hit recruits both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems and increases the intensity of the workout resulting in greater cardiovascular stress and then adaptations. But this is important. There are individuals who engage in more moderate intensity, you know, steady state, zone 2 training that do not experience significant improvements in VO2 max. In fact, research is shown that approximately 40% of people do not see a measurable increase in their VO2 max. Even after engaging in guideline-based, moderate intensity exercise, which is about 2.5 hours of this type of exercise per week for several months. But when these, what are called non-responders, incorporated more vigorous intensity exercise, such as high intensity interval training, they do start to see improvements in VO2 max. So this suggests that adding higher intensity exercise to an exercise routine can help eliminate that non-response and also can lead to greater benefits in cardiovascular respiratory fitness. The reason for non-response to moderate intensity exercise, it's not completely understood, but the addition of vigorous intensity exercise is important for overall improvements in VO2 max. Engaging in more vigorous exercise seems to provide a stronger stimulus for physiological adaptations that lead to increased cardiovascular fitness. So again, I think these findings do highlight the importance of incorporating vigorous intensity exercise, particularly incorporating maybe a high intensity interval training into a training routine. And obviously for individuals who were time-pressed and can't dedicate several hours per week to doing a more type of zone two type of training, including shorter sessions of higher intensity exercise can still have significant improvements in VO2 max and overall health. So you might be wondering, how much time do I dedicate to my more vigorous type of exercise versus a more moderate intensity zone two type of training? And I really think that answered depends on a lot of factors, your individual goals, what you enjoy doing most, what you're going to do the most. I mean, all those things are important because at the end of the day establishing a habit, having an exercise routine that you're going to consistently do is what is most important. For endurance athletes, I mean, the answer is easy, right? You're already dedicating several hours a week to doing more zone two training and about 20% of that training is dedicated to shorter higher intensity workouts, more vigorous intensity workouts. And this is commonly known as the 80-20 rule. But remember, this is people that are doing extensive amounts of training anywhere between 10 to 30 hours a week. I think it's a common misconception to apply that 80-20 rule to like any committed exerciseer and any casual exerciseer who are doing well under less than 10 hours a week. As you think about someone who is a committed exerciseer, maybe work out three to five days a week, how much of that time should be spent doing vigorous intensity exercise. I would say for VO2 max and other adaptations we're going to discuss, including the brain, about half of that exercise training time, I think, should be spent in vigorous exercise. So again, you want to be at least 80% of your max heart rate or more, obviously, there's resistance training to incorporate as well into any training program. There's casual exerciseers, so people that work out maybe two to three times a week. They should probably spend more than half of their time doing more vigorous intensity exercise. I think this ensures you're pushing your limits and making sure that you're getting adaptations, fitness gains in a shorter period of time. There are a variety of VO2 max training protocols, so for people that are looking for that more vigorous exercise using, you know, using high intensity and able training to improve their VO2 max, the key here is longer intervals, so incorporating longer intervals, such as two, three, four, maybe even five minutes at the highest workload you can sustain for that time, and then performing four intervals with rest and recovery in between each of those. So this protocol may require maybe a 20 minute time commitment, but it can lead to significant improvements in VO2 max. There's a few examples of VO2 max training Dr. Martin Cabala who was a recent podcast guest gave a variety of examples of this, so there's three to five minute repeats at the highest sustainable intensity. We talked about you doing those three to five minute intervals that you can maintain and then you rest and recover and repeat those intervals for a total of 20 minutes. I think a popular variation of this is called the Norwegian 4x4 interval training protocol. So the intervals are four minutes long and you're aiming for about 85 to 95% of your max heart rate or the maximum level of intensity you can maintain for the entire four minutes. These intervals can be brutal, so the recovery period is three minutes long and the intensity is significantly lower, like light exercise, more like a zone one training exercise. You want to allow yourself recovery time, the clearance of lactate, you want your heart rate to come down significantly so that you can prepare for the next four minute interval. So these four minute intervals are repeated four times and again in between each interval is a three minute recovery. So that's the Norwegian 4x4 interval training. There's another type of VO2 max training protocol. It's the one minute on one minute off protocol. This is where you perform one minute of intervals at the highest intensity you can do for one minute and then it's followed by one minute recovery period and then you repeat this interval pattern 10 or maybe five times for about 25 minutes or so. And this protocol also is effective at improving VO2 max and it does provide a lot of flexibility in terms of time commitment. It's also not as you know, grueling in terms of like doing a four minute interval versus a one minute interval when minute intervals are a little bit less intense and less painful. Obviously it's important that you know these protocols are sort of templates. They vary a lot based on individual fitness goals. You know there's other protocols out there that can improve VO2 max. The key is like a longer interval longer than like a tabada like a 20 second interval and so you know probably about at least one minute at the highest sustainable intensity that you can do. I think the Norwegian 4x4 protocols probably one of the best out there. One of the best hit protocols out there for improving VO2 max. So how do you measure VO2 max? Without equipment found in exercise physiology lab it's obviously challenging. There are several sort of tests that have been developed and verified for getting an estimate of your VO2 max. So they don't directly measure maximum oxygen uptake but they predict your VO2 max based on the relationship between your exercise intensity and your oxygen consumption. They're sort of useful in determining whether or not you're improving VO2 max if you're testing a type of training protocol. So that there's a couple of really like I said validated tests that have been validated in scientific literature that can sort of be done. Probably one of the best ones is the 12 minute run or sometimes called walk test depending on your level of fitness. It's often also referred to as the Cooper test and it involves having the participant run or jog as far as possible in 12 minutes. So you're supposed to pace yourself evenly. You don't want to start too fast and the test should be conducted on a flat surface. So like a track field is the best you don't want to have hills and stuff because it's about you know the maximum amount of distance you can cover in 12 minutes and if you have hills and stuff that's going to lessen that it's going to be more challenging and you know the distance won't be quite as far. So you'll need a fitness device, something that can record your distance and Apple Watch or you know fit or something and depending on your fitness level you can walk or you can run or a combination. So the distance covered within that 12 minute period serves as the primary metric for evaluating VO2 max which is then estimated using a formula so it's distance and meters minus 504.9 and then divided by 44.73 and you can look this formula up just look up the Cooper test to find the formulas online. Again you know there's there's some other validated test but I think that's probably one of the best better ones out there. You'll need a device that can Apple Watch or some sort of other device that can measure your distance but there's also some of these devices and wearables do estimate VO2 max during exercise using heart rate and your motion data you know for best results you have to make sure all your personal information's in there like your age and your weight and gender you know that stuff but that's another you know possibility. I would say the 12 minute run or walk test is a more it's a better way to do it particularly if you're trying to do something like the 4 by 4 Norwegian hit protocol to measure VO2 max improvements you want to see if what you're doing is improving your your estimated VO2 max so I think the the 12 minute run test is a good way to do that. I want to sort of change gears for a minute and talk about something that I also think is pivotal and it's a unique role for vigorous exercise in playing a role in enhancing health span and it has to do with changes in heart structure so as we age the heart undergoes specific inevitable changes right related to the aging process so it tends to get smaller it gets stiffer and this can impact the heart's efficiency potentially reducing our exercise capacity elevating our risk for cardiac issues but there can be exercise interventions like consistent aerobic exercise with a high proportion of it being vigorous intensity that can actually combat some of these effects so there was a landmark study published from Ben LeBien's group and it was an intervention study and it showed that two years of vigorous exercise in 50 year olds was able to reverse the aging of their hearts by as much as 20 years effectively making their hearts look more like a 30 year old which in my opinion is simply astonishing you're taking a 50 year old heart and making it look like a 30 year old heart. Now the exercise protocol used in this this particular study it was a protocol that that gradually increased the exercise intensity and also frequency so again I mentioned it was a two year intervention by the end of the first six months participants were exercising about five to six hours a week with a large portion of training being in that maximal steady state intensity exercise which I referred to earlier in the podcast it's often sometimes called zone three it is a type of vigorous intensity exercise they also were incorporating more higher intensity exercise so they also did the Norwegian 4 by 4 B2 training B2 max training protocol I just referred to and they did that once a week and I just think it's like I said I simply astonishing that you know you take these 50 year olds and after two years of a more vigorous intensity exercise training protocol it essentially reversed the effects of aging in the heart okay so let's shift gears yet again and talk a little bit about metabolic adaptations and again this is where I think vigorous exercise really shines particularly high intensity interval training it improves glucose control insulin sensitivity more more efficiently and more importantly than even continuous you know moderate intensity workouts and you know I do think that of course both exercise you know training protocols can enhance muscle adaptations and glucose regulation hit really seems to to do it quicker and again more robustly whereas moderate intensity exercise kind of demands longer sessions for comparable outcomes so research has found that high intensity interval training can enhance the muscles ability to take up glucose and improve glucose transport capacity so during high intensity unit interval training I'm during vigorous exercise there's a demand you know a demand for rapid energy production and so the body relies both on aerobic so oxygen using an anaerobic non oxygen using metabolic pathways to generate this energy the anaerobic pathway can lead to the production of lactate especially when the intensity of exercise surpasses the point at which the oxygen intake can keep up with the energy demand and so this is sometimes often referred to as the lactate threshold as we talked about for a long time lactate was considered primarily as a waste product contributing to muscle fatigue and you know this is of course been completely reversed recent research has you know totally changes understanding lactate generated in muscle tissue is transported not only back in a muscle and into mitochondria to be used as an energy source but it also when it starts to accumulate at higher levels travels systemically into circulation and gets transported to other tissues like the heart the liver the brain where it's used for energy it's also used as a signaling molecule so this is known as the lactate shuttle and was pioneered by Dr. George Brooks who is really trained the field and he also happened to be my second podcast guest ever on on this podcast. Anyways lactate you know it I mentioned it acts as a signaling molecule in those tissues as well and you can think of a signaling molecule as a chemical messenger that is sending a message to other cells. One of those messages is the upregulation of glucose transport capacity so vigorous intensity exercise high intensity interval training when when that lactate production accumulates it stimulates the expression and activity of glucose transporters known on the muscle known as glute 4 and this is on the muscle cell membrane and so that lactate acts as a signaling molecule to increase the transport of glucose transporters on on the muscle cells and this then allows for more efficient uptake of glucose into the from the bloodstream into the muscle even at rest and so consequently then insulin sensitivity is also improved and blood glucose levels are better regulated there's been several studies that have demonstrated that hit can improve glucose uptake enhance insulin sensitivity and decrease the risk of developing type to diabetes this may be due to the intense metabolic stress created during hit which leads to greater activation of glucose transporters and improve glucose clearance so as I mentioned both high intensity and role training continues moderate intensity exercise can also be effective at improving glucose transport capacity in the muscles hit promotes rapid increases in glucose transporters allowing for that efficient glucose uptake immunization whereas continuous moderate intensity exercise although it's less intense still does also enhance glucose transporca capacity it improves the overall fitness of muscles as well so you know again it's just a longer duration of exercise time to get there and with the lactate generation that happens with you know high intensity exercise you're getting that immediate signal from lactate to increase the glucose group for transporters and so it's a very rapid and robust adaptation that happens there's at our other metabolic adaptation so just just kind of talking about mitochondria mitochondria are very important and they play a lot of roles in the body but one of the most important ones is the production of energy in the form of ATP this is obviously very important for muscles but also hugely important for the brain the heart the liver pretty much every organ athletes are very interested in mitochondrial health because they want their muscles to efficiently and effectively produce energy when they're training but mitochondria are also very important the context of aging as we age our mitochondria become less efficient at producing energy and this poses a problem for physical activity but also just for normal functioning of our organs now that problem of mitochondria not producing enough energy can actually be overcome by increasing the mitochondrial volume or what's called mitochondrial biogenesis and exercise particularly vigorous exercise is one of the best ways to do that so one of the most powerful indicators of healthy mitochondria is the ability to generate new healthy young mitochondria called mitochondrial biogenesis vigorous intensity exercise like high intensity high intensity interval training I mentioned it's one of the most powerful stimulators of mitochondrial biogenesis this has to do with the metabolic stress that is induced from vigorous intensity exercise the lactate itself again lactate is a signaling molecule when you're producing greater amounts of lactate that actually activates one of the major pathways that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis it's called PGC1 alpha and again lactates acting as a signal to produce more of that PGC1 alpha so when we perform vigorous intensity exercise such as hit that lactate generated from the muscles it's shuttled into the mitochondria because exercise increases the the number of mitochondria per cell again mitochondrial biogenesis and the more lactate that's able then to be used as energy or to produce energy and this is important to know if you're wanting to understand the bigger picture of where metabolism and lactate utilization fit into human performance but it's also important to realize that athletes put around anywhere between like I said 10 20 30 hours of training in a week if they're endurance athletes and usually about 80 percent of that training is in you know the the the modern intensity zone to training world with the remaining 20 percent being vigorous intensity exercise like hit if they're if they're putting in 20 hours a week of you know the the of modern intensity training then they're doing anywhere but you know they're doing you know for anywhere between four to six hours a week of vigorous exercise like hit so just the portion of their vigorous exercise alone they are doing is more than what committed exerciseers are doing so the question is what's the best training protocol for a non-athlete someone that's perhaps a committed exerciseer who is interested in health and longevity again both high intensity interval training zone two training also moderate intensity training can increase mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle hit does it more rapidly it's a more potent stimulus again with with lactate being a signaling molecule on the other hand zone two training you know first which is you know doing a more moderate intensity exercise that's sustained for longer duration does lead to an increase in mitochondrial content I think the key here is the total volume of training so higher intensity higher intensity exercise is a smaller volume and it can result in more rapid larger increases in mitochondrial content while doing a more moderate intensity zone two training also does the same thing but it just requires larger exercise volume or duration your muscles ability to use fat as a fuel is also closely tied to how many active mitochondrial you have so in other words increasing mitochondrial content also determines the ability of muscles to be able to oxidize fat both high-intensiable training so vigorous exercise end zone two training increase the capacity for fat oxidation by increasing mitochondrial content now by enhancing the growth of new mitochondria you're increasing the activity of key enzymes involved in fat metabolism so one of those is the carnitine pometole transferase enzyme or the CPT enzyme both types of exercise training moderate and also vigorous intensity exercise do increase the CPT enzyme capacity as well and you know obviously that is directly related to the utilization of fat as a fuel source so I think the bottom line here is that you know mitochondrial biogenesis increasing mitochondrial volume is key for mitochondrial health it's key for improving fat oxidation as well and both high-intensiable training and a more moderate zone two type of training will get you increases in mitochondrial volume so another way that exercise improves mitochondrial health is through a process known as mitophagey or mitophagey as some people call it so mitophagey is a type of a topology which involves the selective removal of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria from the cell or within the cell this process really helps maintain mitochondrial quality control and overall cellular health so when you put stress on mitochondria through exercise the body triggers you know the elimination of damage mitochondria and the replacement of those mitochondria with new healthy ones through mitochondrial biogenesis there's not a lot of direct human research on the effects of different training types of different training types of um different exercise training on mitophagey but I know of at least one human study that is found particularly vigorous intensity a rubic exercise enhances markers of mitophagey it's likely that both both vigorous exercise high intensity and a well training and more moderate exercise training can stimulate this process with hit just getting you faster and you know the moderate intensity zone to requiring a larger training volume but overall you know both hit zone two can promote skeletal muscle adaptations including mitochondrial biogenesis that oxidation mitophagey this is a repeating theme of this podcast and also on the one that I did with Dr. Martin Gabala on high intensity double training I think the choice between the two really depends again on individual goals preferences the amount of time available for training and just what you love to do hit offers that time efficiency it potentially has the the ability to have rapid improvements and adaptations in mitochondrial content while moderate intensity zone two training can yield similar adaptations with a larger volume of moderate intensity exercise you know sustained for a longer duration but I do think that it's important to probably try to incorporate both types of exercise training for a more well rounded way to kind of cover all your bases um and for those that are committed exercises if you're putting in let's say anywhere between two to five hours of training a week it's it's my opinion that you know you you should probably be doing a lot of a lot of that training or half of that training should be vigorous intensity exercise not only because the VO two max improvements be spoke about earlier but also because of brain benefits so let's talk about the brain exercise intensity like high intensity interval training has been shown to have unique benefits for brain health um obviously all types of exercise are beneficial for the brain but high intensity exercise may have additional neuroprotective and cognitive benefits and one of the mechanisms that's thought to underlie this is you know the unique effects of you know vigorous intensity exercise or hit on the brain because of the lactate production so during high intensity exercise lactate is produced in large amounts as we've talked about um largely as a byproduct of the metabolic stress you're you're kind of pushing that anaerobic threshold and when you produce lactate it's getting into circulation and it can cross the blood brain barrier there are lactate transporters MCT transporters on the blood brain barrier and it can you know cross the blood brain barrier and get into the brain where then acts as a signal and it triggers a variety of beneficial adaptations so let's talk about some of those first you know lactate can be used by neurons as a preferential energy source so it's it's actually energetically favorable it takes less energy for mitochondria's to to mitochondria to use lactate versus glucose so um in effect neurons are are used to using lactate because asteroids in the brain which are a supporting cell for neurons are most eclectic that means they're mostly using glucose as energy they're not using mitochondria and they're producing lactate as a byproduct so asteroids are turning out tons of lactate in the brain and that lactate is being taken up you know by neurons through the MCT transporters and used as energy so um there's actually even been studies showing that the brain is working harder during exercise much like the muscles are working harder your heart's working harder and it's been shown that lactate actually fuels the brain during exercise so that lactate that's being trans like um that's being transferred into circulation it's being just soaked up by the brain and it's fueling the brain brain activity during exercise now another benefit of neurons in the brain using lactate as an energy source instead of glucose is it's spares glucose it's freeing up glucose to be used by another biochemical pathway known as the pentose phosphate pathway and this pathway uses glucose to make precursors called NADPH that's needed for the production of one of the most powerful antioxidant systems in the brain called glutathione so the less glucose is being taken up by neurons to be used as energy the more it can be spared to be used in this pentose phosphate pathway to make glutathione and this has really important relevance not only for just you know normal brain aging right I mean if you're if you're able to use more of the lactate as energy in spare glucose and make more glutathione in the brain generally speaking that's going to be more beneficial for just normal brain aging but it has special relevance also for traumatic brain injury TBI because you know that when there's that you know bolus of damage that's been done that that traumatic brain injury then glutathione is needed the most but you're also needing you know glucose for neurons as well and so and it's it's also awful because you know astrocytes which are usually making lactate for the neurons also become damage during a TBI and so there's a lactate shortage for neurons and there's been a few studies showing that a few infusion when there's TBI patients with TBI that get infused with sodium lactate this actually improves TBI outcomes and this is you know measured by the the glass cow scores so you know generally speaking I think that this glucose sparing effect also you know there's some evidence again obviously direct evidence with TBI outcomes that's been shown to have you know improvements in TBI outcomes I'm proposing a mechanism here with glucose sparing with respect to lactate lactate again also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis animal studies have shown this in the brain and neurons as well we don't have direct human evidence of that but there's no reason to think that wouldn't be a conserved mechanism so I think you know we covered the importance of brain lactate energetically speaking it's energetically favorable right neurons preferentially they prefer to use it we talked about the glucose sparing but let's go back to the signaling molecule aspect as we talked about earlier and the muscles we talked about it increasing glut for transporters it's also a signaling molecule in the brain you know it's acting as a messenger it's a way for the muscles to communicate with the brain directly and when neurons in the brain are using more lactate they're releasing a variety of neurotransmitters they release more north and fern for example so to help the brain working better to have more focus and attention it also signals to the brain to make more brain drive neurotrophic factor BDNF and I mean this is a very powerful neurotrophic factor it promotes the survival the growth and the function of neurons it plays a crucial role in neuro plasticity so this is the ability of the brain to adapt to form new connections higher levels the BDNF have been linked to improve cognitive function enhanced memory protection against neuro to gender of diseases like Alzheimer's disease if you want to put this in a sensational words to explain it BDNF is the youth elixir for the brain and exercising muscles produce lactate to help you bathe your brain in it so that's a little a sort of simplistic and more sensational way of thinking about it but essentially that's what's happening when the lactates increasing BDNF in the brain lactate is also a messenger not only in the brain but at the blood brain barrier you know this is made up of tiny blood vessels we covered this in a podcast with Dr. Axel Montaine so lactate signals to increase another growth factor at the blood brain barrier called veg F and this is bascular and defyield growth factor this helps grow new tiny vessels it's called this is called angio genesis the growth of new tiny blood vessels it helps them grow at the blood brain barrier it also helps repair damage blood vessels I mean these are these are these are things that are you know important for preventing the breakdown of the blood brain barrier so essentially veg F is increasing the vascular density and breakdown of the blood brain barrier is a major cause of brain aging it's a major cause of neuro inflammation it contributes to the vicious cycle of neuro inflammation and there's also emerging evidence that now suggests breakdown of the blood brain barrier is one of the earliest signs of dementia so again another reason why vigorous intensity exercise through that just generation of a lot of lactate then getting to the brain get into the blood brain barrier has unique benefits on overall brain health it's important to know I guess this is you know there are benefits to high intensity exercise on the brain that are not just exclusive to lactate right so there's increased blood flow there's the improved cardiovascular fitness the release of neurotransmitters the release of endorphins you know all of these things contribute to the positive effects of physical activity on the brain but vigorous intensity exercise I do think has some unique and very robust effects on brain health because of that lactate and so I really wanted to kind of dive deep into that so that you guys understand that you know your muscles are being pushed to work extra hard and this is then now causing adaptations in the brain that are pretty substantial in addition to lactate exercise intensity also affects the muscles ability to produce other compounds known as myocines so these are molecules released from muscle cells that signal to non muscle tissues that the body is physically active you know so again it's similar to what we've been talking about with lactate myocines have anti inflammatory they have anti cancer effects they also participate in metabolic pathways involved in fat oxidation glucose uptake they play a role in you know again cancer biology as well so generally speaking the greater the intensity of exercise the greater the myocine release again it's one of those you're putting stress on the muscles and the muscles are then forced to adapt and one of the adaptations is releasing myocines again duration also matter so the harder and the longer the muscles work the greater the myocine release some myocines are a little more sensitive to exercise intensity so I'll six was is one probably one of the most well known myocines it was initially thought to be a pro inflammatory cytokine so cytokine that plays a role in instigating inflammation when it is produced from muscle it acts as a myocine so it does play a role in inflammation but when it's produced from muscle during exercise it's signaling to other tissues to have an anti inflammatory response and so you'll often find even larger production of anti inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 in response to IL-6 produced during exercise Irson is another myocine it's involved in cancer protection it's involved in bone health metabolism and more and then there's also another well known myocine known as oncoastatin M and that myocine sort of plays a little more prominent role in you know anti cancer effects the key here is I think that exercise intensity and or duration are really what increase myocine levels so you're going for a two or three mile run probably crank it up a little more intense right you want to be you know at least 85% your max heart rate so you're not going to be really talking during that run are you going on an eight mile run maybe duration is on your side right and intensity can go down a notch since we were just talking about cancer it keep in mind that any level of physical activity is better than none so a study investigating physical activity and breast cancer and colorectal cancer found women who were more physically active before being diagnosed with breast cancer had about a 23% reduced risk of dying from any cause and a 23% reduced risk of dying from breast cancer compared to those who were less active those who were more active before being diagnosed with colorectal cancer had a 26% reduced risk of dying from any cause and about a 25% reduced risk of dying from colorectal cancer so being active after diagnosis had even stronger benefits for both cancer types so these women had a 48% reduced risk of dying from any cause and a 28% reduced risk of dying from breast cancer compared to those that were less active after diagnosis and the individuals with colorectal cancer had a 42% reduced risk of dying from any cause and a 39% reduced risk of dying from colorectal cancer again after being diagnosed with with cancer so I do want to talk a little bit about you know there's a lot of mechanisms by which exercise can you know dampen cancer metastasis can improve cancer outcomes but there's one specific mechanism that involves tumor cells escaping from the original tumor site and then traveling into circulation to other locations other organs and you know other tissues they sort of take camp there they grow and divide and they form a secondary tumor those cancer cells are called circulating tumor cells and that process I just described is often called cancer metastasis right those circulating tumor cells are in circulation for a period of time and these circulating tumor cells are very sensitive to the shearing forces of blood flow so when you exercise and blood flow increases those circulating tumor cells they actually they actually die and this happens in a dose dependent manner so the more intensity exercise the more sensitive they are to to cell death durations also a key right so I mean you're talking about increasing the shear forces both intensity and duration are key here and and so it's really just a matter of getting that blood flow up intensity duration and that has been shown to kill circulating tumor cells and again this is associated with more positive outcomes with respect to cancer survival not only we talked a lot about you know muscles being little chemical producing factories they're producing chemicals like lactate they're producing myocines but they also act like sponges to soak up compounds that can be harmful to the brain so skeletal muscle has the ability to take up a compound known as chineurinean and convert it into chineuric acid which is a non-toxic metabolite and it does this by increasing an enzyme on the muscle called chineurinean amino transferase so this essentially reduces the amount of chineurinean available to then be transformed into other harmful metabolites such as chineolitic acid in the brain so chineolitic acid is a neurotoxin that plays a role in depression it plays a role in schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disease and so this is just one other mechanism by which you know exercise also seems to improve mental health it's also you know another way that again exercise intensity is important here that is what is increasing that you know that enzyme that chineurinean amino transferase on the muscle cells to then transport chineurinean into the muscle so that is not converted into the chineolitic acid so I just another mechanism that I kind of wanted to point out because again intensity plays a role here with those amino transferase transporters soaking up more of that chineurinean I want to shift gears and talk about short bursts of high intensity interval training so this is sometimes called exercise snacks exercise snacks are short bursts of vigorous intensity exercise that are incorporated throughout the day and they can have numerous benefits on metabolism overall health these exercise snacks can be as simple as doing some vigorous jumping jacks or vigorous air squats or high knees or burpees and they can be done in just a few minutes there might be some distinct metabolic benefits to exercise snacks particularly when timed around meals so performing these you know short bursts of exercise before or so directly before or after a meal is particularly effective in controlling blood sugar levels you know this this sort of thing can lead to a rapid uptake of glucose into the muscles again having to do with increasing those gluten-free transporters it helps to lower blood glucose levels more efficiently then staying sedentary post meals so timing exercise snacks around meals um really can help the body handle sugar influx better and it helps you know utilize glucose more effectively and reduces the demands on the pancreas to produce insulin so it's um particularly beneficial for people with both type one and type two diabetes in addition to the direct metabolic benefits exercise snacks can also combat sedentary behavior so many individuals even those who engage in regular exercise still spend a significant portion of their day sitting at their desk working being sedentary centri behavior has been shown to be a modest independent risk factor for certain types of cancer um and it can also increase the risk of premature death even among physically active individuals so by incorporating exercise snacks individuals can kind of break up those prolonged periods sedentary behavior and potentially further you know reduce their cancer risk and just have a a variety of health benefits so exercise snacks also can enhance cognitive function it's directly increasing blood flow to the brain you know again that that can also just have an immediate mood enhancement which affects motivation there's not a lot of direct evidence on exercise snacks in the brain but again of course methodologies can differ anywhere between one minute to 10 minutes but there at least is one study showing that 10 minutes of an exercise snack does improve cognitive function so what could be a good protocol to implement let's say during your sedentary time would be perhaps you know setting a timer and every couple of hours you get up and you do a couple of minutes of you know high intensity interval training and a very similar now there's something called vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity villpa it's it's somewhat similar to exercise snacks but it takes advantage of everyday sort of situations to get your heart rate up high and to do some high intensity exercise so for example instead of you have to take the stairs everyday to work once that of walking after stairs you sprint you're getting your heart rate high so these types of villpa's have been measured in large numbers of people so there's a variety of publications and studies that have been done measuring you know people's their their their villpa's that they're doing and you know just three to four minutes a day of this vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity has been shown to be associated with a 25 to 30% reduction in overall mortality risk when that villpa durations increased to about nine minutes a day it's associated with a 50% reduction in cardiovascular rate related mortality and a 40% reduction in cancer related mortality and these benefits extend even to individuals who identify themselves as non-exercisers in other words these are people that are not necessarily doing leisure time activity they're not going to the gym and not going on runs but they're still engaging in these villpa's so so even those people are getting mortality reductions and you know cancer mortality cardiovascular mortality reductions with villpa's so I think that you know that's also an important benefit to keep in mind so I hope you guys enjoyed this episode a deep dive into the science of why vigorous exercise is important it's important for improving cardiovascular respiratory fitness particularly people that don't respond to more moderate intensity exercise it's important for metabolic adaptations it's very powerful at increasing glucose intake into muscles it's also a very potent stimulator of mitochondrial biogenesis allowing for mitochondrial adaptations improving not only mitochondrial volume but also fat oxidation capacity as well it's increasing my topology the clearance of damage mitochondria from muscle tissue and it seems to have really unique benefits for the brain and a lot of this does come down to lactate production the metabolic stress that's induced from vigorous intensity exercise produces more lactate this lactate is getting into circulation going to other tissues including the brain and not only is this allowing the brain to use an energetically favorable energy source so neurons are using lactate as energy it's allowing the sparing of glucose to be used to make precursors for a very powerful antioxidant glutathione in the brain it's also acting as a signaling molecule in the brain increasing brain drive neurotrophic factor this is hugely important for you know not saving off neuro degenerate disease and just improving cognitive function it's increasing veg f at the blood brain barrier you know saving off the breakdown of the blood brain barrier lactates also increasing myocines in the muscle that have all sorts of benefits so I think I think we covered a lot about the importance of vigorous exercise and also these the vigorous exercise can be done in in short exercise snacks as well and I think this is a really great way for schools and workplaces to incorporate some sort of physical activity to break up the sedentary time when people are sitting in their cubicles at their computer or sitting at their desk for prolonged periods because just those periods of being sedentary in and of itself is a risk factor for early mortality so again exercise snacks are a type of vigorous exercise that can be incorporated into everyday life as well as the the villpeas these are things where you're you taking advantage of every day situations like like sprinting up the stairs rather than than walking up them as well so I hope you guys enjoy this podcast and I'll talk to you soon as a companion to today's episode I've created a free evidence-based blueprint that you can download in this guide which
