A big objective for metabolic health summit is really to bridge the gap from science to implementation. And as we were as we are organizers planning for this event, we had a short list of people who really have the proficiency, the knowledge, the skills, who transmit or translate science to the public. And high on that list was Dr. Rhonda Patrick. So, and around this time, Dr. Patrick Rhonda graciously invited me to be on her podcast, found my fitness podcast. So, she had actually came to our lab maybe about four or five years ago. And so, you know, I told my co-host, Angela and Victoria was like, well, I think I can answer on to Patrick. I didn't want to do it in an email. I don't think I did. So, I asked her in person. And he had, I'll have to say, she was very task-loaded during this time. So, I am extremely grateful that she took time out of her busy schedule with a lot of things going on in her life right now to join us at Metabolic Health Summit. And I'm going to give a short introduction. She has quite a long bio, but Dr. Patrick is a scientist and a health educator based in San Diego. She runs a popular website and podcast on YouTube channel called Found My Fitness. Her areas of focus include micro-nutrient deficiencies, the role of aging, and the role of genetics and epigenetics in health status. The benefits of exposing the body to hermetic stress such as sauna and heat stress is why I do the hot tub. At various forms of cold exposure, exercise and fasting. And also plant phytochemicals and the importance of mindfulness and stress reduction and sleep. So, really take in a holistic approach to metabolic health by health and general. Her work has been published in journals like experimental neurology, phasive, nature, cell biology, and trends in cell biology. Dr. Patrick's talk is titled, intestinal permeability and the bacterial link to aging brain barrier dysfunction and metabolic disorder. And with that, let's without further ado, let's invite our speaker to the stage. Thank you, Brian. Good evening, everyone. I'm so excited to be here. Thank you, Dom. Thank you to the organizers, Victoria Field, and Angela Poff as well. I'm so excited that this finally worked out. You guys have invited me a few times, so just so happy to be here tonight. I am discussing something I haven't, I'm excited actually because this really pressed me to there's some topics that I've been really interested in lately and diving into doing a lot of research literature reviews on. And so I was like, I need to push myself to learn more about this and what better way to do that than to present on it, right? So I'm going to be presenting on something a little bit new in terms of things that I've talked about generally speaking. I'm going to talk about the role of intestinal permeability. And today we're going to cover, we're going to cover how what intestinal permeability is and how it can lead to the release of a bacterial product called lipopolty saccharide or LPS, which is a type of endotoxin. It's present in the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria, the bacteria that are inside of our intestines. We're going to talk about how LPS, as it's called for short, bind to lipoprottynes and circulation and how this can play a role in atherosclerosis. We're going to talk about how LPS can compromise the blood-brain barrier and also how that plays a role in the development of neurodegenerate disease. We're going to talk about the role of LPS in the way we feel and our mood. And then finally we're going to get into what everyone's probably most interested in is what do we know about certain lifestyle factors that can regulate intestinal permeability. So let's start off by talking about what intestinal permeability is. So if you look sort of at a schematic of our intestinal lining, we have antarasides. These are gut epithelial cells. They are connected to each other by tight junctions. These are groups of proteins that are basically connecting our gut epithelial cells together so that they're forming a tight barrier. Basically it's one component of the gut barrier. Another component would be the use in secreted by our goblet cells in the gut. So intestinal permeability refers to most of what's understood with intestinal permeability has to do with the some disintegration or disassembly of tight junctions, which allows bacterial products like lipopolysaccharide, it allows bacteria, it allows food antigens to leak into circulation. So we're going to talk about what happens when LPS is able to leak into circulation. So what effect does LPS in circulation have on cardiovascular health? So lipoproteins, everyone here is familiar with what lipoproteins are, they're a mixture of lipids and proteins, they originate in the liver. Their main role is to transport triglycerides and other goodies, other lipids and cholesterol as well to other tissues. Mostly they're transporting triglycerides. Our tissues, ourselves, cannot make triglycerides. Most of ourselves can make their own cholesterol. So it's really important to have triglycerides being transported around because they're a really important source of energy. There are various shapes and sizes of lipoproteins from VLDL or very low density lipoprotein to low density lipoprotein LDL to small dense LDL or small dense low density lipoprotein. And as these lipoproteins start to transport around our circulation and donate triglycerides for example to other tissues they be get, they get smaller in size and also they become more dense. Well LPS binds to lipoproteins, it actually binds to all of them and through a lipid lipid interaction. And it's actually thought that this is one of the protective mechanisms that our body has to prevent lipoprotein saccharide from causing for example sepsis. And we know that lipoproteins play a role in actually lowering LPS levels in our circulation. And this happens because the LPS is bound to for example the LDL molecule. So lipoproteins are recycled. They're they're they're recycled through the liver. There's a protein present on lipoproteins called APOB, APOB interacts with the LDL receptor in the liver and is absorbed taken up and that's how it's recycled. Well because LPS is attached to lipoproteins, the LPS also gets lowered or decreased in circulation. And this has been shown in a variety of mechanistic studies for example using statins which lower LDL through a variety of different mechanisms. One of many includes increasing the number of LDL receptors and therefore increasing the recycling of these lipoproteins and subsequently LPS has been shown to be lowered in circulation after statin use for example. So again this really seems to be a protective mechanism lipoproteins buying this lipoprotein saccharide to help prevent our bodies from having massive inflammation and based on undergoing sepsis. And so one of the ways that does that is by increasing lipoprotein production when basically when LPS levels become elevated. And then the lipoproteins then recycle the LPS through for the liver. But not all lipoproteins are getting recycled as most people here know. There are a variety sizes of lipoproteins we've now had increasing evidence that the smaller and denser LDL particles don't get taken up into the liver as well. And mechanisms have been worked out on this including because as the LDL particle gets smaller and size the apob protein that is interacting with the LDL receptor becomes somewhat obscured. And so when this apob is supposed to bind to the LDL receptor it's not binding as well and therefore it's not getting taken up and it's not being recycled as well. And subsequently that means that the LPS particle bound to the LDL is staying in circulation. So what consequence, what's the consequence of this? If we have a small dense LDL particle that's not getting recycled it's actually in circulation longer and there's been evidence that these small dense LDL particles will insert themselves into the arterial lining, the arterial wall. And of course the LPS is a signal to our immune cells, resident macrophages, since the LPS signal and it's like oh I've got to get rid of that bacteria because it's a threat. So it comes and tries to try to engulf through phase at Fego Saitoosis, what it thinks is a bacteria but which actually is a small dense LDL particle with an LPS bound to it through a lipid lipid interaction inserted into the arterial wall. And so it Fego Saitoosis that entire lipoprotein and you get the formation of what's called a foam cell sort of a soft plaque. And this is stuck in our arterial wall, the lining of our arteries and as it's sitting there for you know more and more time and undergoes more inflammatory and oxidative transformations which then causes the foam cell to become you know stiffer and more plaque like. So this is the beginning of atherosclerosis, there's been a variety of animal studies nicely documenting this as well with the small dense LDL particle and LPS and in fact even showing if you for example increase the production of muterate producing bacteria in the gut which can help prevent LPS leakage that can sort of reverse some of these effects. Quite interesting. So that's sort of one aspect of what LPS can do when it's in circulation to cardiovascular health. The next question is what about the brain? What effect can LPS in circulation have on brain health? So the blood brain barrier much like the gut barrier is made up of a series of endothelial cells that are bound to each other and held together through tight junctions again these proteins that group of proteins that are holding the endothelial cells together on the basement membrane side of the blood brain barrier we have a variety of different cell types sort of all interacting together parius sites and microglio cells which are the brains resident immune cell as well as astrosights and together they're making up the blood brain barrier. So LPS again originating from intestinal permeability can actually break down some of the tight junctions itself and it binds directly to receptors present on microglio cells these are called toll-like receptors I'm to like four receptors and we're going to talk a little bit about that in more detail in a moment but when that happens it actually shifts the microglio cells in the brain from a protective mode to an attack mode and so they kind of change their their phenotype and this sort of results in the astro astro sites moving away from the parasites and the basement membrane and so you end up getting then even further breakdown of the blood brain barrier becomes more permeable and this is sort of the beginning of this vicious cycle where then you know you sort of have a slow sort of insidious more permeability effect because more LPS and other inflammatory molecules and other things are getting into the brain and then it's you know changing the phenotype of our microglio cells for example and this sort of this vicious cycle of neuro inflammation so why should we care about you know blood brain barrier breakdown well the blood brain barrier is key for brain aging in fact nearly 50% of all dementia including Alzheimer's disease begin with the breakdown of the smallest vessels in the brain and in fact biomarkers of blood brain barrier breakdown proceed classical biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease like tau tangles and amoloid beta 42 aggregates LPS in circulation also affects the way we feel so healthy individuals that are injected with LPS experience symptoms of depression, depressive mood, feelings of social disconnection they also have elevations in inflammatory cytokines like TNF alpha, IL6 compared to people that are injected with a saline control there have been a variety of studies that have now sort of established causation with respect to the role of inflammation in in depression and basically in in the way we feel in our mood and there's been a variety of mechanisms that have been sort of delineated one of those has to do with the metabolism of triptophane so triptophane is an essential amino acid we get from our diet it is transported into the brain once it's in the brain it gets converted into serotonin which is an important neurotransmitter that regulates mood it regulates cognition it regulates impulse control long term planning it's important for a variety of cognitive functions well if there is a acute inflammation or even sort of low grade chronic inflammation this can shift the metabolism of triptophane such that triptophane is not transported into the brain rather it's converted into a metabolite called chenurine and chenurine has been shown to accumulate in the brains of people with depression also neurodegenerative disorders chenurine gets converted into a neurotoxin called quenolinic acid which also has been associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders by polar disorders schizophrenia as well as neurodegenerative disorders I have exercise on here because exercise as most people here are familiar with is very it's it's been shown to be important for brain health or cognition for the way we feel and part of that is because it increases the transport of triptophane into the brain before any conversion into chenurine so it actually increases the transport of triptophane in the brain and also the conversion of triptophane into serotonin so it's sort of a summary of of this part of my talk is that intestinal permeability can lead to the leakage of bacterial products like lipopolysaccharide LPS into circulation and we talked about cardiovascular health and atherosclerosis but it also affects the brain and it can generate inflammation and flammatory responses that can change triptophane metabolism change the way serotonin production is made but also it affects the blood brain barrier and and that can also affect the way our brain is aging so LPS in in in circulation is not a good thing and maintaining healthy gut barrier is important for both cardiovascular health and for brain health but there's other there's other mechanisms by which LPS can sort of wreak havoc on our health and this has to do with the binding of something that's a receptor on almost every single cell and our body it's called toll-like receptors we have these everywhere we have a monoramune cell so toll-like receptor for TLR4 LPS binds to these receptors and when he does on when it does this in immune cells of course there's lots you know lots of inflammatory responses that are generated but it also leads to what's called inflammation the aging of our immune system or our immune system because it becomes less robust at protecting us against pathogens as we age it also becomes better at making inflammatory cytokines and doing it in a sort of like you know shotgun approach you know where that it's kind of like there's a lot of collateral damage the toll-like receptors when they're when they interact with LPS on muscle tissue it's been shown to in paraglicose uptake into muscle tissue which of course would affect metabolism cause metabolic dysfunction on liver cells it's been shown to play a role in non alcoholic fatty liver disease and in the brain we talked about a few problems with the breakdown of blood brain barrier it's been shown to also lead to depression as well as neurodegenerative disease so let's talk about what happens when these toll-like receptors on immune cells are activated and inflammation inflammatory biomarkers are elevated so for example people that are this is a different study than I when when I mentioned previously this isn't even lower dose of LPS when people are given a low dose of LPS such that there's really no clinical symptoms no clinical endpoints that were noticeable the the individuals had a up to 100 fold increase in their inflammatory biomarkers so they had a 25 fold increase in TNF alpha a very powerful poro inflammatory cytokine and a 100 fold increase in IL-6 which is also a poro inflammatory cytokine they also had an increase in markers of insulin resistance homoir increase by 32% and markers of insulin sensitivity decreased by 21% so this is this is kind of evidence that even a low dose of LPS remember LPS originates from the gut can massively increase biomarkers of inflammation and you know the the levels of LPS we're talking about are chronically elevated and people that are overweight in obese so we're going to talk about that in a minute but inflammation itself has been shown to play a role in aging it's been shown to accelerate epigenetic aging clocks so these are epigenetic signatures that have been identified by Dr. Steve Horvath Dr. Morgan Levine and others to basically be able to biomark biological age there was a study that was done by Dr. Levine and colleagues where people who had head and net cancer that were undergoing radiation and chemotherapy treatment combined their epigen they they had this treatment done and immediately after their treatment their epigenetic clocks accelerated by five years so that's like they had aged five years six months to a year later their most people's epigenetic age and clocks were turned back to base line return back to normal except for people who still had elevated inflammatory cytokines those individuals with elevated inflammatory cytokines at the six month mark or one year mark after their treatment still had massively aged epigenetic agent clocks so chronic inflammation can accelerate epigenetic aging it's also been associated with accelerating aging itself in fact suppression of inflammation has been shown to be important for aging and the quality of life as well as cognition so this was a cohort large co-host study out of Japan where a variety of biomarkers were measured individuals that were elderly individuals that were centenarians that there were a hundred years old individuals that were semi super centenarians these are individuals that are 105 years old or in super centenarians who were a hundred and ten years old and a variety of biomarkers were measured everything from long term fasting like glucose levels so HBA1C to liver function to lipids to kidney function to telomerangeth immunosinescence to biomarkers of inflammation and the only bite and the only thing that was predictive of an individual basically living to the next stage was suppression of inflammation so low markers of inflammation and that was also the only thing that was predictive of cognition like being cognitive cognitively capable in older life as well so I think probably what most people are interested in now are okay well it seems as though it's really bad to have LPS in our circulation and it originates from our gut when our gut barrier is in some way shape or form compromised intestinal permeability occurs so let's talk about some lifestyle factors that are known to affect gut permeability or intestinal permeability since we've been talking about the brain and we've been talking about the role of LPS from originating from the gut on the brain it's a two-way road so the brain also affects the gut and I think that anyone in this room who's gone to graduate school or med school or any kind of higher education and has experienced the massive stress probably has felt some kind of gut symptoms I know I did I mean there was definitely like there's an association between being chronically stressed and having a GI problem and it took me a while to figure that out when I was in graduate school I didn't know what was wrong I thought maybe I had you know I BS or something and turned out it was actually stress so there's been some nice studies done in fact people giving a presentation a get release LPS into their circulation so in fact you probably measure my LPS right now I'm sure it'd be off this charts compared to yesterday when I was having fun with my family at Disneyland but a lot of the mechanisms have been worked out on this and in fact one of the stress hormones that is released when we are stressed is corticotropin releasing hormone and this binds to a type of immune cells that are present at the level of the gut called a mass cell there are receptors for corticotropin releasing hormone on mass cells and when so when that stress hormone binds to the mass cell the mass cell releases proteases which then degrade a bunch of proteins that make up the tight junctions that hold our intestinal gut you know membranes are our interocytes together and so this causes again this is a intestinal permeability this is what happens and that allows food antigens to leak in a circulation allows LPS to leak in disserculation it allows other things as well bacteria so this is this is how psychological stress in the form of a talker giving or financial stress or you know social relationships lots there's lots of different taking care of a sick family member there's lots of ways that a person can be stressed graduate school but it's it's kind of I think it's important to realize that managing our stress is really important for our you know our gut basically and for helping to prevent intestinal permeability probably not surprising what's called an obiecinogenic diet something that can lead to obesity this is a combination of high fat high sugar low fiber so you can feed people high fat high sugar low fiber diet and after about four weeks you know their LPS levels are increased by 71 percent I would argue that you could just do this and then one hour later measure that because there's something called post brandial endotoxemia which is the the release of as I mentioned LPS is a type of endotoxin so it's often you'll see in the literature the words interchange like a polysaccharide LPS or endotoxin so so food itself you know I mean when we eat meals there's post-prandial inflammation part of that post-prandial inflammation can be you know connected to LPS that is released not all of it but part of it so an obiecinogenic diet something that can make people you know get fat can also increase LPS levels obesity itself has been associated with higher circulating levels of biomarkers of intestinal permeability such as zonylon and we'll talk a little bit more about zonylon in a minute and so there's been this this sort of is it the chicken or the egg or what does it is at the obesity that causes LPS to be released you know from intestines and causes is basically causing intestinal permeability or is it the diet that's causing the obesity that's doing it and it turns out it's probably both there seems to be evidence of both of these things occurring and so then what you have again is one of those vicious cycles because you have the diet that's causing the obesity to you know that's basically wreaking havoc on your your your gut health and an LPS basically and then the obesity itself is also doing it and in fact weight loss can decrease markers of intestinal permeability so people that were were obese that that decrease their BMI by about seven were also able to decrease markers of intestinal permeability and there's a million reasons why we should you know lose weight if if you're if we're overweight or obese obesity in extreme cases very extreme cases can can have a massive effect on life span so extreme obesity this is a meta analysis of about 20 prospective studies found that extreme obesity a BMI between 40 and 45 is associated with a seven-year decrease in life expectancy more bit obesity this is the BMI between 55 and 60 is associated with a 14-year decrease in life expectancy so there's you know there's every reason to want to lose weight and particularly you know lose fat in this real fat and there's a lot of ways that that can happen I know a lot of great speakers at this event will discuss that but probably one of the easiest ways that Dr. Roe just mentioned a moment ago is caloric restriction and it's there's a lot of ways that you can get to caloric restriction you can counter calories and diet you can skip meals you can you know exercise and skip meals there's lots of ways to do it but I think that at the end of the day the reality is is that when you when you limit your food intake you can you can lose weight it's effective binge drinking is something that also has been identified to cause massive LPS release from the intestines probably a lot of people that already have underlying gut issues or more familiar with this because they've probably noticed when they drink alcohol they might start to have gut issues and and and so binge drinking this is this is for women about three to four drinks and for men like four to five so it's a lot I mean this is more relevant for a college audience you know to be honest but it's important to keep in mind right I mean you know binge drink drinking does increase LPS and they most of us are probably more interested what about moderate alcohol consumption what effect is that have and there's been associations with moderate alcohol consumption and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth so the bacteria in our gut mostly are localized to the distal end of our large intestine or our colon as it's called bacteria are not really supposed to be in the small intestine I mean this is where fats are absorbed it's where simple sugars are absorbed proteins so the complex carbohydrates are mostly broken down in the colon but when bacteria make their way into the intestines it can cause problems it can cause zonyl and release and we'll talk about why that's important for intestinal permeability in a minute but so there is some connection between moderate alcohol consumption and in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth I will say this I mean this is not a ton of literature on this and it's quite you know likely like like we all know observational studies there's a million factors I mean maybe it's a combination of people that already have some underlying gut issue or maybe it's a combination of people that are eating obeseogenic diet and drinking alcohol or there's stress and they're drinking alcohol you know maybe it's a two-hit hypothesis like we don't really know but it's something to keep in mind alcohol can be hard on the gut especially in combinations with other things that are hard on the gut like stress for example so let's talk a little bit more in detail about the zonyl in that I've mentioned a couple of times again looking at the intestinal gut barrier we have our entire sides that are connected together through tight junctions so gliatin is one of two proteins that is present in gluten so glutin is found in a variety of different types of whole grain sources gliatin bind to a receptor on the on the surface of our intestinal epithelial cells called the CXCR3 receptor and when that gliatin binds to that receptor it causes the release of a protein from our interacites or gut cells called zonylin and zonylin then binds to a series of other receptors present on the our epithelial cell surface when that happens this then causes tight junctions to his disassemble and when that when the disassembly of our tight junctions happens again that's intestinal permeability we can have things going from our gut into our circulation like LPS a lot of this work was pioneered by Dr. Alicia Ofissano at the University of Massachusetts Hospital it is thought that you know so people with celiac disease it's thought that gliatin is the major problem for them because of this this mechanism the the release of zonylin and therefore disassembly of the tight junctions which actually stayed disassembled for quite a long time and allow LPS to then go into circulation and do all the things that we just talked about with people that don't have celiac it's thought that it might be a more transient opening and closing so just to kind of play devil's advocate here what do you think okay well if gluten has gliatin and gliatin is gonna release zonylin and that's gonna disassemble my tight junctions even for 30 seconds like I don't want that right so I mean that's kind of what I'm thinking but again to play devil's advocate when you when you look at some of that observational data and people that are eating whole grains we see that people that are eating whole grains seem to have a lower all-caused mortality for for example compared to people that are not eating it now again as Dr. Robo point out nutritional observational studies are just I mean it's like a disaster for establishing causation and I think I mean I could just point out like ten things but you know with studies like this for one whole grains include a variety of gluten and non-glutin containing proteins the non-glutin ones wouldn't have gliatin so these are things like quinoa buckwheat oats millett you know barley at the other would be okay well then maybe people are eating whole grains are just eating less to respond if we're fine grains and in fact that is the case people are eating whole grains are eating less refined grains and so there's a million there's a million things that you can look at here but at the end of the day it's still it's still kind of makes you go and well maybe you know maybe I shouldn't freak out too much if I have a little bit of gluten and the same goes when you look at for biomarkers of inflammation people that eat whole grains have lower biomarkers of PAI1 and also of C-Ractive protein compared to people that are not eating it but again people that are eating these whole grains in fact if you look at the methods of this section it's all whole grains it's not just gluten containing ones so we know that whole grains are a good source of fermentable fiber for bacteria in the colon and fermentable fiber is then by many bacteria converted into buterate so buterate is a short chain fatty acid it is the major energy source for for colonic sites these are these are the the the the interocytes the gut epithelial cells that I was talking about they're producing about 70% of all the energy for for those cells and so so it there's also been a variety of studies that have shown for example if you if you give buterate to an animal it can prevent LPS leakage and it can prevent the formation of atherosclerosis and animal models that are predisposed to this for example so so buterate produced by bacteria in our gut is actually it's actually a good thing there are a lot of different dietary sources of buterate these better that don't include gluten so pectins for example or a type of fermentable fiber this is found in berries it's found in root vegetables it's found in citrus beta blue cans are really good source of fermentable fiber they're found in mushrooms oats and barley inulin is another source of fermentable fiber it's found in garlic onions and arduchokes and resistance starch is is another source and it's found in green bananas and cooked and then cooled potatoes so these are other dietary sources of fermentable fiber that are known to increase buterate or an also increase buterate producing bacteria in the gut but there's other lifestyle factors that can affect buterate as well so a mega-three fatty acid consumption is able to increase the concentration of buterate producing bacteria in the gut aerobic exercise training can increase the production of buterate producing bacteria in the gut independent of diet and time restricted eating it's also able to increase the production of different types of buterate producing bacteria in the gut because bacteria in our in our intestines are also on our circadian rhythm much like every cell in our body are on our reciprocating rhythm we'll hear a lot about that from doctor's such in panda in a couple of days but time restricted eating basically having the absence of food seeing our gut is important for for basically decreasing you know non-buterate types of producing bacteria and increasing buterate producing types of bacteria in the gut what about dietary fat so if you were to if you were to take this is the studies been done if you take 300 you know calories in the form of a glucose beverage or orange juice or cream heavy cream and you look at first inflammatory biomarkers after consumption of those 300 calories from those beverages or water there's no calories in water inflammatory biomarkers will be elevated in the glucose containing beverage and they'll be elevated in the heavy cream but not the orange juice only they have a cream increases LPS the glucose is not which is very interesting there there are meta analysis that have been done looking at fat and LPS and it seems as though fat can be hard on the gut particularly saturated fat without fiber now does that mean fat is bad no I think that we've established that quite nicely over the last couple of decades I think that if you look at the quality of evidence here you'll see a couple of things one that most of the fat torches used are processed oil they're coconut oil or palm oil and when you look at the high fat studies they're mostly given also with the biscuit or something that's refined carbohydrate and there's enough evidence out there to show that saturated fat in combination with refined carbohydrates seems to really be key for increasing LPS from the gut but I just kind of wanted to point this out because I think as we are kind of shifting there's a metabolic paradigm here where we're learning maybe fat and saturated fat isn't as bad as we thought that we shouldn't just throw everything out there there there are still things to consider and there's a lot of interacting in nuanced factors here and I think that looking at the effect of dietary fat on LPS leakage from the gut is one that we should probably explore more and explore it better so saturated fat and then and then polyunsaturated fat in the form of omega 3 has been shown to lower LPS leakage from the gut in the form of omega 6 like vegetable oil in humans if the vegetable oil is it is heated it increases LPS leakage from the gut but if it's not heated it doesn't seem to have any effect in humans in animal studies it omega 6 will increase LPS leakage from the gut but animal child when the pellets are made it's possible that the omega 6 is heated I mean there's just no telling I think the bottom line is also when you look at some of these studies when you have saturated fat with a fiber matrix the LPS response is blended so it kind of made me like I like cream in my coffee and I was kind of looking through all this literature and the one thing that I really seemed to see consistent was like when you just have fat like just fat like putting butter in your coffee your cream in your coffee like it does seem to be harsh on the gut and a variety of mechanisms have it worked out on that by elacids which are you know increased for the absorption and digestion of dietary fats are you know is one thing that's been shown to basically affect permeability and the fiber actually slows the absorption of the fat much like it does with glucose as well so I do think that I may reconsider putting so much cream in my coffee because that might be affecting my LPS but the other thing is a modified fats seem to be really bad for LPS liquid leakage so this is mean that a ketogenic diet is bad for our gut or is leaking LPS in circulation no there's no evidence of that and in fact there's such profound changes in metabolism when you're in ketosis that it's it's quite I think a good hypothesis that that you know any if there even was LPS leakage that maybe there would be a blunting of the inflammatory responses or in fact like I mentioned in a question to Dr. Row I'm very interested in the production of beta hydroxybeaterate during ketosis and how this may travel perhaps even to the intestines and affect colonist sites and energy metabolism in our gut cells that are helping maintain the gut bear and I would love for anyone to do some experiments on this because I think it's a really interesting and wide open feel that no one's looked into and I honestly if there's any graduate students looking for you know their dissertation hypothesis I think it would be really interesting to look at that so you can buy a mark intestinal permeability a variety of biomarkers in the literature I mentioned so in Yulena big one the lactose manatal ratio directly measures two non-metabolized sugar molecules that are able to permeate your intestinal mark amicosa this is something that a primary care physician can order for anyone I'm actually going to try to get this done now that have really been diving into this literature I'm going to try to do it after a couple of different types of meals that I eat and it seems as though one hour after a meal is when you really get the peak of an LPS response from food so I'm personally going to try this out this is all just me experimenting here so I'm not you know saying that this is going to really tell me much but this is used in the literature lactose-demanatory show is used as a biomarker for intestinal permeability I wanted to get into a mega three because it was quite clear that omega three in human studies and in animal studies seems to blunt the LPS the post-prandial in talks endotoxemia as it's called or the LPS response after a meal and there's been a variety of mechanisms that have been worked out to understand how this is and it seems as though there's there's a few things happening I mentioned already omega three increases buto rate producing bacteria buto rate producing bacteria help prevent intestinal permeability like that's been shown the other thing the other way is that omega three increases the production of something called intestinal alkaline phosphatase or iAP as it shown on the screen so if we're looking again at our our gut barrier what on quote we have our interacites connected by tight junctions the intestinal alkaline phosphatase it does a variety of things one it can it it basically degrades and destroys LPS itself it also changes the LPS producing bacteria in the gut so it seems to to decrease the LPS producing bacteria and then increase the the buto rate producing bacteria so this is another way that omega three may affect inflammation like through a totally different mechanism then all the other mechanisms that we already know about and omega three I just want to spend spend a moment talking about because it's so important and low omega three intake from seafood has been identified as one of the top six preventable causes of death this was this was a big study that was published a few years back out of harbored and omega three there's a variety there's three different sources of it so there's a plant source of it you can find in walnuts or flaxseeds or chia seeds this is alpha-linilitic acid or ALA and then there's omega three that is found in seafood so there's the microbiology but also the fish in all the you know the sea animals and sea creatures that are eating the microbiology accumulates in their and their adipose tissue so there's icosa pentate and you you know iac acid EPA and there's docosa hexate you know iac acid or dHA and so it was the omega three from seafood that was identified as being responsible so basically not getting enough omega three from seafood was that was identified leading to 84,000 deaths a year so 84,000 deaths a year were attributed to low omega three intake from seafood that was comparable to trans fats which was responsible for 82,000 deaths for year literally like the same and if you walk into any grocery store and you look on the shelves like everything's marketed no trans fat this is zero trans fat and everyone knows that trans fats are bad for health and so people it's in the public mind do not eat trans fats and yet omega three intake from seafood was identified to cause the same amount of deaths as trans fat but nobody's thinking about omega three you don't walk into a grocery store and see all the foods we don't have omega three or we do we have it from seafood we are seafood this is fish we have omega three it's really important and i think it's a i really like this because it the way i like to think about food is what we should be eating what do we need to what is the point of eating right we're supposed to be getting nutrients micro nutrients is your essential vitamins minerals fatty acids amino acids which was to be getting these from our food but we're not and instead of focusing focusing so much on what we shouldn't eat we should focus on what we should be eating and honestly when you do that like you don't eat the other stuff it's like well that doesn't contain what i need so i'm not going to eat it and i think it's just a simplified way of looking at diet and it really helps you can always focus on what not to eat and still be deficient in important vitamins and minerals and micronutrients so i really think it's an important way to eat um back to the omega three it's just it's really i think there to me there's overwhelming evidence now that omega three is really important for health so the omega three index this was identified by Dr. Bill Harris and his colleagues the clemenze bond shackie back in 2004 this is the omega three fatty acid level in a red blood cell membrane and it's it's a long term marker of your omega three status compared to something like not what 95% of people measure which is omega three in plasma phospholipids so red blood cells take about 120 days to turn over so they have quite long of a half life and so if you really want to know someone's omega three status you have to measure the right thing otherwise you could be bar marking what they had for dinner a couple of weeks ago and it's like oh i had fish couple of weeks ago and then all of a sudden they're they're marked as someone that's got high omega three so i think this is also a potential for a lot of confounding literature but on top of that again you just we we have to measure the right thing to like get good information right so a high omega three index has been associated with a 90% reduction in sudden cardiac death in the united states the omega three index is about 4% or lower when i say a high omega three index i mean 8% or more so high omega three index is also been associated with a five year increase in life expectancy so people with an omega three index of 8% or more have a five year increase in life expectancy compared to people with a omega three index of 4% or lower interestingly in Japan people have a five year increased life expectancy compared to united states and they also have an omega three index greater than 8% and i want to sort of end my talk with something that sort of blows my mind and i think you guys will find interesting as well and that is that low omega three index a low omega three index of 4% or less was comparable to actually to spew smoking so everyone knows that smoking is bad for health if you look at the red line the red curve here low omega three index and and a smoker had the lowest life expectancy the green the top the highest life expectancy was a high omega three index 8% or more an non smoker but if you look at the orange here that was a smoker with a high omega three had the same life expectancy as a non smoker with low omega three so again omega three seems to be extremely important for health so i'm gonna end my talk with that we talked a lot about intestinal permeability the role of intestinal permeability in cardiovascular health in in in our brain health we talked about the way we feel we talked about lifestyle factors that can regulate it and devils advocate stuff to think about as well and without all say thank you so much for listening and i hope you guys learned something interesting and enjoyable to make thank you so much Rhonda we're gonna open up the floor for questions and we have some questions coming in from the virtual platform so and many of them you you answered during as they're coming in you answered them and but one i think you may have answered but i didn't catch it is there a lab test for circulating lip of polysaccharide or LPS is there a commercially available lab test available that people can utilize to measure this is my mic do i need to stand by this or i'm good okay um so the the there is a lab test for circulating endotoxin and it's notoriously terrible because it's like false positives are so easy so i mentioned the lactolose to maniot manatal ratio that is a much i think more accurate biomarker of intestinal permeability which would i mean directly measuring LPS would be great but until we have a better sensitivity assay i think that it's it's prone to false positivity so i have a question just a button sorry for intestinal permeability we've connected with a group that are using peg 400 as one of the tests so no would like to get your opinion on that i you know i don't know much about that one so i'll say beyond the scope of my knowledge uh you yes have a question um if there's a role with non-steroidal in affecting intestinal permeability great question i don't know the answer i think that's a really interesting in fact there may be literature on it i just am not aware of next please add a couple of comments and a question uh the first to your area of question uh myself as a colleagues published a paper recently where we talked about in part alternative metabolic pathways and interacites and um you see based on the pre-clinical data that we have so far that MCT1 has expressed on the base of lateral membrane of interacites so they can take up ketones from circulation and actually the common pathway with buterate is acetoastylcoate before it goes into the mitochondria so they actually have converging metabolic pathways um so we think that ketones can be used to to fuel interacites um the the second thing what when you're talking about LPS i think what you're really talking about is he co-lion LPS because that's what's used experimentity and it's really good at developing information i do it in my lab i was doing it on Monday um however there's uh you know LPS on any type of granulicative bacterium and there's an increasing body of it's sure that says that actually LPS from various bacteria are directly communicating with the immune system they're immunomodulatory this is our gut talking to us and so just talking about LPS go you know increasing in the blood and that being bad i don't think is is really right um and pretty much everything that we do increases like vetting LPS so you go for a 30 minute jog and you'll increase in testle probitis you'll increase up P.S. and so where that the rubber ready meets the road is in metabolic disease because it's only when you're an insulin resistant that having elevated um LPS is an issue because being insulin resistant the first place increases safely it's an LPS but then you also have a scenario where things like transient increases in LPS like post-prandual endotoxinia you don't have the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of an incidence spike to counteract that and then you're also going to have things like a discord and like protein profile where you can have more small density L.D. L.L.L.L.P.S. is going to bind to and not be cleared so I wonder if we should be focusing less on L.P.S. because we're always going to have someone it's always going to go up intermittently and if we just actually do the things that we know work to improve insulin resistance then that's really going to solve this issue I think that you brought up some really interesting points I think for me the way like looking at the effect of the toll-like receptors and understanding toll-like receptor activation from L.P.S. and I think you know there with anything there's a hormetic stress kind of effect right like you can go exercise and have a little bit of intestinal permeability and it's a type of exercise when you have a whole host of beneficial adaptive responses that are going to counter that you're so your your net effect is going to be lower inflammation right even if toll-like receptors are being activated on immune cells and liver cells and muscle tissue and brain right you know in the microglia for example so I think there's a context is important and so it's not like the same as if you have someone who has you know a chronic low level of constant L.P.S. leakage but I do think that toll-like receptor and looking at the effect of toll-like receptor activation and the chronic insidious type of activation of it is kind of more what I'm you know I think that's kind of connecting them in the sense of the more sort of chronic low grade activation so yeah I think that I think that you brought up really really interesting points and thank you for telling me about about the bed I'd like to be here at do you have time we had time for two more questions maybe mine will be quick is there a reason why someone with intestinal permeability who we treat with a lot of the things that you said and feels better they're so quick often to come back into it versus some people seem to be like they just don't experience intestinal permeability no matter what they either do yeah I mean I think that even getting to the young gentleman's point you know you have a variety of factors that are affecting it and that's kind of why I mentioned with the saturated fat I mean you look in the literature and it's like yep saturated fat intestinal permeability but when you start to dive a little deeper it's like oh but the saturated fat was a certain type of this processed oil and maybe it's the pulmonary acid plus the you know refined carbohydrate or maybe it's the alcohol plus the stress or maybe it's like multiple things in combination with genetics getting to the you know personalized response I mean some people respond terribly to ketogenic diets and some people respond rate so I mean there's always individual variation there's a lot of you know there's a lot of contributing factors to health and so it is it's a hard to just say like there's one villain and there's one like you know what do you call a good guy or hero you
