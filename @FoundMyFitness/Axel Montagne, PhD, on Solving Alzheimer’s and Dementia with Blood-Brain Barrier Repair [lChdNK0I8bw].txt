We have tiny blood vessels in the brain. So if you don't exercise, you don't make sure that your heart is pumping and high rate regularly during the week. Those tiny vessels that are even smaller than your air in terms of diameter, they will start to collapse. And you're going to have, and remember, the capia is, it's, it represents 90% of your brain vascularity. All these tiny blood vessels. So if you don't do enough exercise, you will start chronically to have some vessels that will basically constrict and collapse and disappear, meaning that the surrounding neurons that are here and they need oxygen and nutrients and everything from these vessels. If these vessels disappear, you're going to lose neurons. So exercise is the number one thing. You have to do that not only for the brain, obviously for the heart, it's true for the eyes. Obviously, if you don't exercise, you're going to tend to lose high-dition quickly than in a normal person, person as you age. But very important for the brain, you're going to turn, you know, if you're prone to go to cognitive detain because let's say you have a major genetic risk. But if on top of that, you don't exercise, you're going to accelerate as we know from study. And in that's one of the biggest things we have to put that, you know, we have to put to the world like, okay, each of you just started to handle that, what, and if you want to stay healthy in terms of brain function, yeah, no other choice. Hi, everyone. Today, my guest is Dr. Axel Monten, who is a professor and group leader at the dementia research institute at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. I'm personally really excited to have Axel Monten today because we are going to be discussing really a new paradigm for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Often when we talk about Alzheimer's disease in particular, there's so many ideas floating around, is it brain diabetes, is it amoloid beta plaques? So rather than speaking to the role of amoloid or metabolism, today, I'm hoping to discuss a new paradigm of research that suggests not only an important way of understanding dementia and Alzheimer's, but also how to prevent it. So Axel, thank you so much for coming on the show today. Can we, can you talk a little bit about this idea that dementia can be a vascular disease? Yes, hi. Thank you for the invitation first of all, very happy to be here and talking about that. Yes, so I think the word new paradigm, it's correct and not correct at the same time. It's been several years and there are many studies back from 20, 30 years ago that shows that when you look at the post-multian brain sample on tissue, just a tissue of people that died from Alzheimer's disease, you can see a lot of vascular problems on every single case and it has been shown like 20, 30 years ago, but people didn't really pay attention to that vascular phenotype that we were seeing on post-multian brain. It's just I would say probably the last 10 years or so that we are really tackling this because we have more and more evidence that shows that the vascular dysfunction and we're going to go into details of which later, but the brain vessels, so the blood vessels, starts to be dysfunctional and leaky and not doing their job to make sure the brain functions normally and that's something that we can detect very early on that is something that is happening with normal aging and we know now that this is something that is accelerated in people that go towards dementia. And this is true in Alzheimer's disease, which is the major cause, I mean the main dementia form, there's also small vessel disease we'll talk about this, there's vascular dementia there's different kinds, but the commonality about all these dementia is they have a vascular component that is quite early in the disease and we want me as a lab and different groups in the world try to understand how vascular dysfunction contribute to dementia and that's something that people pay really attention you were a co-author on a paper showing that about 50% of all dementia start with breakdown of the smallest vessels in the brain and I mean this seems very important so let's talk about how a leaky blood brain barrier could be even more important than beta amyloid plaques or amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles what causes that breakdown of the blood brain barrier? Yes, so so the paper you were mentioning so I guess that's the paper we published in 2020 in nature where we show and we had a few other papers prior to that where we showed that just the fact so just the fact that we age normally the vessels start to be normally dysfunctional as we age like the whole body it's not telling the brain just not telling the vessels we are just aging and these vessels we we've developed a way to to measure how leaky if I can use that term which is easy to understand so everyone how leaky meaning that things from the blood can leak out to the brain and we can measure that with magnetic resonance imaging MRI so we developed that technique in the US and California and the University of Southern California where we can really detect small weakness of the brain barrier and what we've noticed is when we scan normal in cognitively normal individuals young and old just normal aging we start seeing some brain regions that are leak here than others so first of all there's what we call the blood brain barrier there's not only one blood brain barrier in my opinion very several and we are trying to understand how they have different properties different depending on where we look in the brain but we see special brain regions that starts to leak with normal aging and these regions it's a bit that's the region of the e-pacampus that we call medial temporal load so that's the spot of the brain medial temporal load where we have the major you know the learning and memory region that is called the e-pacampus that region somehow we still don't know why at that at the time is leakier than normal in people that are older versus controls young and we know that this region is the region that leaks the most early in dementia as well so we developed that MRI technique where we can really see visually okay where do we have this vasculopropics and interestingly we also I guess we're going to talk about this but not only your imaging is important but we also developed new biomarkers to look at in in plasma so in the blood or in cerebrospinal fluid we can measure markers new markers of that gives us an idea of how leakier the brain red vessels basically to make it simple and so we have this new imaging marker this biofluid marker and we show on both that we we see etapa we're acknowledging an increase what we call bleperine value breakdown so the vessel vessel disruption in the brain and and we we know also in this paper that you mentioned is we can predict future cognitive neglect so the people having more leakiness at base like when we scan them on when we we measure on the plasma of csf cepers waspanofluid the level of the vasculopropics in the brain we know that there are more they're going to decline more faster than the people that have low levels of this biomarker so we have some predictive value of looking into vasculopryne disruption so to try to link amilloidant tau which is which are the classical Alzheimer's or mark what we found is the the leak areas that we seen the brain are have nothing to do with the areas that where we start seeing the buildup of amilloid plaques and tau tangles so it seems to be two different two independent paths where we say so you have people that have vasculopryne dysfunction but and in some brain regions they're going to start having some amilloid plaques and it doesn't seem to relate to each other so that's the first point I wanted to make but also what is interesting to know is when people start to have amilloid plaques they tend to have cerebral what we call cerebral amilloidant jocacy c-a-d which also will disrupt vasles so you have two schools in research right now we use people that think that amilloid is something that happens very quickly very hurly that will disrupt the vessels and you have the others school that are in thought of that we say that we can see vasculopryne without amilloid happening at that stage and we know that having vasculopryne dysfunction will promote also the formation of amilloid plaques in the brain so it's still unclear how this is going what we know for sure is there's early vasculopryne and we need to fix that to make sure that the brain doesn't develop plaques function normally to avoid dementia specifically you mentioned some early diagnostics I mean both more more sensitive types of MRI to detect some of these you know leaky vessels but also a plasma biomarker and this is these were in cognitively normal individuals and mucher what age range but that seems like extremely important because you're talking about a new potential diagnostic well before cognitive decline is occurring it seems like intervention you know it's obviously there's been a lot of failed attempts to treat you know even people with mild cognitive decline that have Alzheimer's disease so is this is this something that you see coming into clinical practice this is you know like what what what are your thoughts about that no that's a great question just to have something from the previous answer question because people don't know is we we have screened people by the major genetic risk factor that for Alzheimer's disease which is apoly pro protein E4 so we know that the people carrying this particular gene have more chance to develop Alzheimer's disease than other people and these people they have much more vasculopryne problems in the brain and they are still cognitive normal so we can detect as you said we can detect perhaps I don't want to speculate but we know roughly that at least we can detect 10 years it's not more prior cognitive decline we can detect those vasculopryne problems so as you said there is a window where we can intervene and if we have the right therapeutic we can proceed to protect the vessel and what I used to say sealed barrier to avoid this leakage so the way I see it so first of all the research is ongoing right now there's a lot of a lot not but several targets that are very promising currently tested in both animals and clinical trials to try to protect these vessels because it's not only a question of leakage but if the vessels are not functional there's not enough blood flow throughout the whole brain so which is a big problem so it's I see that the two vasculopryne issues blood flow is reduced plus the leakage of the barrier so we know that we have a street targets that basically target different cell types that comprise the neurovascular unit so it bears the under-tile cells that are forming tubes basically that's where the blood flowing but around these vessels there is multiple layers of different cell types one of them that is it is to meet one of the most important one is called the peri site so they wrapped around the blood vessels in the brain and those cells are very sensitive the detach the vessels and they die very early into disease and if they are not there to maintain the integrity of the barrier we know that there's these leakages so the whole idea of different labs in the world is to make sure that these various size of wrapping the smallest vessels in the brain don't detach they have to stay there to maintain the integrity and to avoid the leakage so there's some targets either targeting the under-tile of cells themselves or targeting the peri site's direct there's gene therapy there's a lot of things ongoing stem cell therapy and things like that that are very promising so I would say it will happen tomorrow in a sense that it's going to take a while to do the clinical trials but I want to stay very optimistic for the listening because we're talking about less than 10 years I would say if these targets are successful which they already are in the edible modes we're going to have some sort of intervention to fix the blood vessels in the next few years so I think it's very important and to do that the critical part as you said there's a lot of failure in anti-amidoid treatments we have to design the trial very you know we have to really think about the design of the trial and what are the category of people you want to treat right and I think one way you said is screening people by apoi genotype so if you have the genetic risk you could get get the treatment but again we're talking about one fourth of the population of the world having the apoi fauchia type so one third there's a terrorist eye case and a homozygous people so it's I don't think it's realistic to just screen anti-altypropedition or just give them a treatment to fix the blood vessels which would be a bit more realistic is to do a combination of biofluid biomarkers of the talquate where we can see whether there's things that starts to go wrong in your brain and when we know that there's something we can do to fix the vessels before there's a no-degeneration and cognitive decline so I think it's more like maybe screening for apoi but it was also screening for other things around that will tell you okay this particular individual will benefit from getting a drug that will fix the blood vessel and I truly believe based on the animal experiment and based on the transletrature and clinical trials that yeah if we fix the blood vessels we may not be able to cure that's a big world worth cure as a disease but at least we will be able to postpone the symptoms by quite a few years for sure which is a big deal obviously for day-to-day you know when people they really dementia on the day he basis it's a nightmare so he can have a decent life for another 10 years that's a big progress hopefully I mean hopefully we want to cure the disease but I think we are going to the right direction so a couple of questions kind of stemming from you know what is causing the parasites to detach or causing the endothelial cells to you know become you know leaky and the blood brain barrier if you have someone with apoi four you mentioned that's happening sooner I mean it's it's very detectable and people with apoi four and also is is that is the parasites detaching is you know these these signs of I guess you know what you might call leaky blood brain barrier is that something that happens in normal aging or is it something that happens in abnormal you know brain aging that is almost certainly going to lead to cognitive decline because the reason I'm asking is you know with the amoloid beta plaques which is one of the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease you find them in cognitively normal people and it's a little perplexing right yes no I think so to answer that question so there's a bit of controversy in the field but most of the literature says that yes parasites is a it's they're all the particular cell type that are quite vulnerable and quite sensitive so they do detach and they do die as you page of course we're not talking about the extent of what we see in the match but we see just to give you some numbers which will speak to people we know from mouse studies and human studies plus more temperant tissue analysis we can see that when we stain when we look at those parasites around the micro-asculture varies roughly a 10% to 20% loss of these cells just with normal aging it's more complicated than that because there is a brain regional differences we have some region that lose more the others let's say if I talk again about the picking piss there are reports showing that there's fewer parasites in the picking piss than in the cortex the human brain at baseline so we'll that's why I was saying from at the beginning there's a different blood brain barrier properties there's different cell types different numbers probably different functions so we know that these parasites some regions have fewer than others but they do tend to detach and die with normal aging the reason why they detach if I had the answer we didn't do my research right now we have some answers the first one is very close crosstalk between the endotillium so the between the blood basically in the parasite very the endotillium so the endotillium cells on the parasite cross-stalk a lot and I didn't mention it but parasites are here to wrap around the vessels and make sure there's no like a strict barrier between the blood and the brains nothing can cross easily except because and things that we need oxygen to the the second major property of the parasites that they do have contractile proteins meaning that those cells are able to constrict so to constrict vessels and die red vessels so if they are not here you can easily assume that your blood flow will be disturbed so they are here to to contract to constrict and die red vessels so obviously when they detach not only you have the leakage of the barrier but you also have some flu problems one of the hypothesis that we are working the lab it's not only hypothesis very kind of growing evidence on that is the the leading cause of parasite lost might be that the under-till cells themselves so they are they are what we call in in a familiar static state so they are normal they expressed certain proteins certain transports those that are there to make sure of the transport oxygen and because as I said and other things as you age these under-till cells will turn to a pro inflammatory phenotype and that's a normal thing as we age we are there's a phenomenon called inflame inflame g it's a contraction of inflammation and pg and there's several things happening as we age based the what we called what is called the seven pillars of age which basically has very seven things that overlap between normal aging and new-digit generative diseases and out of these seven the central one is inflammation so as we age we have more information going on and we know that there is a more cell-dition molecules to sight-mortes of a cell-dition molecules are start to be expressed at the under-tilly which is normally not there or very minimal quantity and we start having significant amount of these cell-dition molecules throughout the whole but and the brain is very sensitive to that because these cell-dition molecules what they do is they collect the immune cells from the brain from the blood story to bring them into the brain the more you have the more information the what we call neuro information the more information you have in your brain so that's a normal aging process and the fact then those cells end up to your cells turning to a pro inflammatory phenotype the pericisertal right next to them will will so there's a cluster of this I won't go into details but the pericite will have to detach because to let the immune cells go through physically if the pericite stays of touch to the vast to the vessel there is no possibility for the immune cells to go through and to their job so the fact that there is more information of the vasyletry as we age there is more detachment like a which is a physiological detachment of brain pericites that's one thing and we there's some report that as we age very less we don't have the capability I mean the pericite don't have the capability to reattach as we can do as we are young so I don't know if that's clear but at least there's some int some that tells us that the fact that the undertale cells become more enslaimed in a way the vasyletry is enslaimed the pericite will react to that in a bad way and so they will start shortening their processes also so I didn't mention it but pericites are there's a small cell body with a process like small processes like an optopus kind of thing sitting on top of a vessel and all these processes are here to to push the blood through basically and maintain the integrity and these processes will shorten because of the inflammation and of course if the the pericites are shortening their processes the flow will reduce and if it's a chronic thing if we think about chronically having too much information at the vasyletry the pericite will chronically detach more and more and shortening their processes so the leakage of the barrier will be will come at some point because the tight junctions and everything that makes the barrier intact will stop to degrade over time and the flow will be drastically reduced so short answer I'm speaking a bit too much inflammation of the blood vessels might be one trigger and that's something we can target theoretically relatively easily by injecting drugs IV right intravenously so that would be perfect way of targeting the vessels to improve the healthcare function hopefully I think also the the fact that you're you're mentioning the role of inflammation being so so critical on key in this in this process kind of makes me think about you know lifestyle factors of course that you know aren't necessarily the same as you know therapeutically targeting you know with the drug but Omega 3 being one of you know at the forefront of one you know Omega 3 transport has been shown mechanistically at least in animal studies to regulate blood brain barrier function through the MFS D2A transporter and it's also like many of the metabolites of both DHA and EPA the marine Omega 3 fatty acids are involved in resolving inflammation so they have resolveings they have the specialized promediating molecules the SPMs and the Marisens and there's and so do you think there could ultimately be clinical relevance for Omega 3 status in in regulating dementia associated you know blood brain barrier leaking us you know in humans or maybe something worth exploring no I can't agree more I think there's a more and more studies coming up nowadays Omega 3 and you mentioned MFS D2A which is one of the markers we are studying carefully because it's specific to the smallest blood vessels in the brain so the capiaries and that's where the most of the parasites are and there is a recent studies are that shows that as we age and we've dementia MFS D2A so the receptor for Omega 3 it's reduced the blood vessels and there's also a link that where there is a reduction of MFS D2A on the vessels that's where we see very site loss so we can almost connect what we were saying earlier of course these are just a few studies and it has to be confirmed but apparently there's a more information of the blood vessels to go back to the first question to link it which as we age also MFS D2A transpose and other transporters not only this one but this one in particular is decreased at the capiary bed which have an impact apparently on periside function because we can see that this hotspot of MFS D2A loss are also hotspots of periside loss which means that where we have the leakingness of the bark so yes I cannot agree more I think we have two study a bit more DH share Omega 3 and how do you seem back bread bread bread value functions because that would be some preventive interventions things like that even like targetable drugs like a retract but yeah cannot agree more and just to we can talk a bit more about this but just to go back at the beginning of your question you were mentioning exercise and I think exercise is very important even me at mid you know I'm not too old I'm not even 40 years old and I try to practice every week knowing all the the recent data so we have we have to do some exercise some higher up big exercise to make sure that the vessels we have tiny blood vessels in the brain so if you don't exercise you don't make sure that your heart is pumping and high rate regularly during the week those tiny vessels that are even smaller than your air in terms of diameter they will start to collapse and you you're going to have and remember the capiaries it's it represents 90% of your brain vascularity all these tiny blood vessels so if you start not see if you don't do enough exercise you you will start chronically to have some vessels that will basically constrict and collapse and disappear meaning that the surrounding neurons that are here and they need oxygen and nutrients and everything from these vessels if these vessels disappear you're going to lose neurons right so exercise is the number one thing you have to to do that not only for the brain obviously for the heart it's true for the eyes obviously I should not exercise you're going to tend to lose high-dition quicker than the normal person person as you age but very important for the brain you're going to turn you know if you still prone to go to cognitive detain because let's say you have a major genetic risk but if on top of that you don't exercise you're going to accelerate as we know from study so I think exercise right now it's highly funded very a lot of we're going on and and that's one of the biggest thing we have to to put that you know we have to put to the world like okay each of just such a normal matter what I mean you should want to stay healthy in terms of brain's function yeah no other choice I could not agree more when you're talking about if not exercising and how the small vessels lining the brain they start to get you know basically go away are you is that small vessel disease or is that something different so we have to be careful yes it's not it's not like a person if you don't exercise you're going to get small vessel disease I mean it's a bit more complex and and I think that's a where that didn't say at the beginning but these dementia as I'm with disease is one but the second major form of dementia is cereble small vessel disease and and I thought it were wanted to say what was the question again oh I was just yeah I was asking about what I mean what is small vessel disease yeah okay so yeah so I wanted to just mention I want to people to freak out of course it's a multifactylial disease you know it's felt like if you have a genetic respecter on top of that you can kind of contour balance that by doing more exercise and eating better and stuff but we can discuss about this but small vessel disease is it's very different from our sinus disease although there's a lot of commonalities in terms of brain imaging if you look at two brains our Alzheimer's in small vessel disease you're going to see a lot of similarities meaning that you're going to see what we call microbleeds so the we were talking about blivering bar breakdown so if there is a significant breakdown of the vessels you can start having red blood cells going to the to go break so that that are detectable using MRI so we can see those microbleeds that's one feature they also small vessel disease compared to other studies this tend to have small strokes like what we call lacquins so they have small spots small lesions that we can detect in the brain which chronically and over time will you will have a deterioration of your cognitive functions the the other the first thing that is very important is white better eye print entities so these are white metal disease it's it's a heart topic a heart rate heart research area because it overlaps as we age we are white matter disease normal age we do have some as I read these there is quite a lot of white matter small vessel disease there is a lot also and blivering bar breakdown obviously in other other reasons small vessel disease these are key features of these two to the disease especially to explain the white matter i current entities people are these white metal disease are from the task of resource so it's it's still ongoing research but we know that these are we do have lead vessels possibly the pericide detachments leakage of the of blood toxins into the brain which will damage the milding sheets and all the the axons and the white matter fibers that that makes your condition running properly so these are the features of small vessel disease and small vessel disease also the common the common cause of stroke so and so there's many many small vessel disease we have a quote here in the UK that we are following with the leader is trying a workload so I invite people also to if you want to learn more about small vessel disease she is probably the the world expert in small vessel disease but so it does to disease that I'm independent of the middle it that's the big difference obviously from last time as disease but they do have the micro vessels do have some problems and I can tell some of them which we've talked a little bit the the find the deandotinium gets pro inflamed so that's something that is very present in small vessel disease and to give you an example i told you about the cellarogen molecules that are expressed at the liminal side of the micro vessels of the brain when they get shaded they are released into the blood right and we can measure them and we know that people that do have small vessel disease they are very high levels of soluble form of this cellarogen molecules that can detect in biofluids so that's already a feature so the what we call on the tail of this function so the on the tailium of the blood vessels are getting very inflamed and they don't do a proper job which in ply also and there is some evidence that the perisites surrounding them are also dysfunctional very quickly in those details and we can measure one I don't know if you mentioned that today but the soluble form of very complicating them pdgf receptor beta so it's platelet derived growth factor receptor beta that's a receptor on the perisites and that's receptor same thing it can be shaded and released into the plasma and into the cs and that can be measured so basically we know in small vessel disease they are high level of perisite dysfunction and high level of point formation of the vasculature so that's and those things we can also what we do nowadays is we try to relate those biofluid biomarkers with the neuroimaging features that we see in people to try to correlate whether there is if you have high level of perisite problems do you have more weight metal disease and things like that so we try to relate what we see in the blood and cs that's what we see in the brain and obviously we look at cognition whether there is a predictive value or whether there's some correlation or association between these biomarkers and cognitive problems but now we are fairly confident that targeting somehow the blood vessels the micro vasculature in small vessel disease is the way to go we have to fix this blood vessels very quickly to to make sure that these people don't go into small declines micro bleeds and other things that will make them detailier detailier very very quickly in terms of cognition and the last thing maybe I forgot to mention is this is the sporadic form of small vessel disease but there is also the genetic form same with our zymers we haven't talked about this but there is the sporadic form the most common form and the genetic form so in terms of small vessel disease there is two diseases that are quite known now and quite studied one is called cedarsial the other one is called cedarsial and interestingly these two diseases involved parasites and vasculus muscle cells so these are the two cells of the brain that are basically dropping around the vessels and eating both the aggregates and in four cedarsial it's not three proteins that aggregates in parasites and vasculus muscle cells which makes our vessels dysfunctional very quickly and those people develop white varieties is at the edge of 30, 40 years old and they go towards cognitively trying very rapidly very severe and can I really about the same thing it's htl1, htl it's tr, he1 sorry protein that is involved but there is the also genetic form that has exactly the same features white monodysis, micro bleeds, lecunes and pre-bren bio-re-issues and we can measure that we have all of the tools now to measure those things very early before people really go to cognitive problems so which means again have to target those vessels to make sure that function properly how common is small vessel disease and do any how common is late on says small vessel disease and how do any of those people actually that have small vessel disease end up getting Alzheimer's disease so our common is very common because a ad and s vd so our pharmacy small vessel result two major form of dementia so it's it's very common more common that we take and and what she said the second question was about sorry people that have if you said there are two separate diseases but I was wondering if people that do develop small vessel disease end up sometimes getting also Alzheimer's like if there is a lot of so yes that makes the research more complicated right yes to give you an example we are we have the duke bio bank here where we have brantishy samples where we can really look at features of these different things out of the house of small disease and a good proportion of small vessel disease dying those patients they do have some sort of CAA that what we talked about earlier several aminoidensuphety and some of them have aminoate so that's the complexity of of dementia there is no pure Alzheimer's disease there is no pure asvd effects always also a new or a new or a new or a new disease that are coming into into the play and so it's difficult to disentangle things but at least when people are alive very good imaging tools and very markers that can measure in blood and C.S. have tells us who is what but some people have and that's true and I couldn't say I'm not an expert that I couldn't say the ratio of how many can have both some people have asvd and leweeper ewe body some people also have some Parkinsonism traits so yeah and for frankly it's not it's very common that we can have two form of dementia kind of simultaneously but yes I hope that that's an interesting question. It does circling back to something you mentioned and sort of briefly you were talking when you were talking about blood brain barrier not functioning well you mentioned glucos metabolism and you decrease or you know it's important for the you know the blood brain barrier being in tact is also very important for you know glucos transport reduced brain glucos metabolism can be measured you know up to decades even before any Alzheimer's disease symptoms or dementia symptoms occur hence you hear the term type 3 diabetes if what effect does breakdown of the blood brain barrier have on brain glucos metabolism. That's another great question and on going studies are tackling this because it's not that key and quite controversial just to tell you a bit more so the main transport of glucose at the blood brain barrier to make sure glucose comes to the brain is a good one. So that's a receptor glutton that has been found to be reducing Alzheimer's disease so people have looked at again post-mortem brain tissue bank and looking at the micro basculature and that be your vessels and they found that as a respite they have much less glutton at the brain barrier which means that there is less that are you know potential of the the flowing glucose in the blood that to penetrate the brain so that's one thing and we can measure that even with several techniques but one of them is a very spectacular pet so positive on the mission to mammography and we can measure what's we call FDG so which is a marker of what people say neural activity things like that so we know that when we inject that tracer it's field delixible because tracer into a patient if you have Alzheimer's and if you don't you will have much less FDG signal if you have Alzheimer's computer control but what is interesting and there's a bit of controversy and how to tell too much about this but people are explaining these data just saying that there's less neural activity and that's that's all but what they don't take into account is these people have less glutton so there's less probability that the the regular lagoon lagoon will go very less with one receptor into the brain so I think the FDG pet signal has to be carefully analyzed in a sense that it could be a neural activity but it also could be indirectly the marker of vascular problems because of what I've just said but again there's experts in the pet field that will tell you the reason why it is not an vice versa it's very technical and I don't have that these but again we know that there's less bit quite one independently of the retuction of the vascular networking as I'm as easy but I think because is a playing a big role here and it's crunchy and sophisticated I don't know much more than that sorry well that's it's everything it's very interesting and it certainly doesn't seem like it the like we have you know the consensus or you know on on on the answer to that question I'll just mention I remember reading a couple of studies years ago where animal studies where omega 3 deficiency caused a reduction in include one transporters in the brain again of course omega 3 deficiency also breaks down blood-brain barrier you know so it's kind of what's first you know like it's always goes reduce glucose getting into the brain affecting blood-brain barrier is blood-brain barrier affecting the glucose transporters are both you know I mean it seems tricky to sort of figure out but um that's the chicken and a question all the time same thing with normally the I mean up I'm not an expert on omega 3 but it's basically the same thing when it comes to peri-side loss on the t-o-le activation like pro-information breakdown of the barrier loss of blood flow what is happening first it's always difficult to address those questions because the human must have the king of studies are cross-sectional you look at one time point now um I think there's more and more studies that follow individuals along it in a little leave with scanning with a looking at biomarkers looking at neuropsyched testings so we're going to get more and so it's very very stupid there's big centers working to that but for the omega 3 yeah I'm not surprised that you said that omega 3 deficiency leads to a reduction of good work that what you said yes it's a good show I haven't read that paper but um but it goes well with what we said earlier right there's a vicious circle where I think it's likely that of course the under-trial peri-side cross-stoke should be very involved in that problems in my opinion and that's something I would love to study I um I'll send you my paper I wrote a sort of interactive review article back in gosh it must have been like 2018 or something I think and it was it was on the important role of MS MS MFS D2A and omega 3 in apoi 4 carriers and I have references because I for for a lot of the studies like the the deficiency you know omega 3 causing group 1 transporters to go down and uh so I'll send you my review you might have been in of course it's it's a little bit uh a little bit of a hypothesis sort of review you know so I review the literature but there's a lot of my sort of thoughts for for people that are actually exploring the field because I'm not I'm not doing these these studies that you know so you might be interested in that and um it's just oops sorry uh just rings a bell um I just remember um reading a couple of stories and it's uh very relevant to what we do in the lab is that yeah omega 3 the fact that you give omega 3 to an to aged animals and I told you with as you age you have information like like an hyper activation of the brain on the tailion and a couple of studies I've I've given some omega 3 to the mice and I remember seeing the reduction of one particular protein that I really like to study and we are currently studying is V KM1 that's a series of the addition molecule 1 and that and um omega 3 was able to reach those levels and we know in the lab we know that V KM1 is a major role upstream of pericite uh detachment so again it's um there's a lot of things that can be connected uh I think it's very interesting and just another word on V KM1 is Tony Whiscoray in uh 10th birthday university uh one of the big lab working on proteomics and all these uh fancy homics uh techniques he looked at arsems and um and uh healthy controls uh he looked at their plasma and he has looked at using proteomics looking at different proteins which which for arsems are in normal aging and what he found I think the most striking finding was normal aging he found um I think very plus uh proteins in the plasma that were elevated with normal aging that were related to blibbin barrier and if you look down I think uh the total five candy dates were uh cellar proteins that are part of the uh on the teal cells obviously the number one that stood out as the number one protein that is elevated with normal aging was soluble decamant so everything um uh you know if you put some studies together it kind of makes sense and are very a bit more to dig but uh I think it makes sense and it might go well with also what omega 3 omega 3 is doing to the to the vascriture so that be nice to leak further it's very interesting that you mentioned uh Tony Wise Cori as well because uh if I recall correctly he's also been involved in research where he's transplanted um young plasma into into you know older mice and it's sort of rejuvenated in the brain and it's like well are there proteins I think the opposite was done as well where it's old plasma was transplanted into younger mice and it's sort of accelerated and I think if I recall correctly blood brain barrier breakdown was part of that um and so it's like identifying those proteins that it's causing it is he's doing a fantastic work and uh and yes correct uh he's doing he's looking at the proteins that we have in the young blood that will help not only uh brain functions or anything like uh to help enough aging too fast but also we found a few key proteins that are involved in the maintaining blood brain barrier as we age so I think it's very interesting and he's using oscodepara alright by osy's model where he can uh link-pronged aging young mice but I think right very important studies uh yeah I and you know the other interesting thing this kind of brings me back to some of your work where um you know I don't know if if I think you mentioned this very early in in our discussion about you know blood brain barrier when it becomes quote unquote leaky you know this allows molecules that usually don't pass into the brain to then pass and uh you had a paper where you had published a couple of years ago with I think it was with your postdoctoral mentor Dr. Slovavik about uh protein called phybrinogen which interestingly enough is also like when I go and get my inflammatory biomarkers measured I like to look at phybrinogen as well as as well as high sensitivity sensitivity to your protein it's an inflammatory marker I mean it's involved in blood coagulation but um you found this in the brain what is the significance of that? Yes um yes and it's not only two years ago I think there's uh in the first report it's probably ten years ago but uh the first report was on again brain tissue samples very valuable tissue samples from the donors where we see that uh in if you compare a control brain uh someone cognitively normal though though issues which so ever and another side was brain or small this will be this brain you start seeing what we call this um extravascular deposition uh phybrinogen is one of the it's one protein that is supposedly in the blood it shouldn't be in the brain at all but we start seeing this extravascular uh deposition of phybrinogen which means that to cross it has you have to have some degree of breakdown of the or the barrier um so it has been found in parisam disease we also found that in animals that either do have our zm disease or have some sort of preventative issues and we know that this protein um that is um important for blood coagulation as you said and information has nothing to do in the brain and it's toxic it's just toxic and we found that it's neurotoxics or toxic to neurons it's also toxic to all the good endrocytes uh where we found that um the the or the good endrocytes are basically cells that are making up myelin and make sure that the white matter is intact and we can function properly and those those or equals are crucial in the brain and we show that when you have the leaky barrier and your phybrinogen going in the or equals are very sensitive to that uh to that phybrinogen so they take it up so they internalize phybrinogen and they die by what we call auto-fagy so it's almost like a suicide test and which leads to white matter disease and if we go back white matter disease is a common feature of Alzheimer's, smallness of disease and as I said earlier also it's the source of white matter disease is likely a preventative brain break down so phybrinogen might play a role in this formation of white matter uh disease so yes it's a very important protein that we found we um interestingly we in animals we were able to reduce uh phybrinogen levels systemically in the blood of course at a level that you don't want to increase uh to have some coagulation problems or increase readings and things like that so you have to reduce at a level that you don't start doing uh bleeding or clotting but just by doing the read just by reducing the phybrinogen level in a mouse model that you have blibbrin bar issues we were able to to demonstrate that very less so we speak mixing let's try to reenegin going in to the break let's wait minute that damage and also interestingly by reducing phybrinogen we were able to to partially restore uh vascular functions in terms of blood flow and also uh integrity of the barrier so phybrinogen has probably different roles that are in the coagulation and inflammation probably a bit more but that's I think that's uh that's one other way we can target toxin things in the blood uh to avoid doing damage to the brain I think it's far easier to fix the uh I don't know but fix the blood vessels rather that but at least it's another evidence that leaky barrier is leading to uh damage to the brain and you don't want that to be seen and the last thing on phybrinogen is just remember going up phybrinogen can activate uh the brain resident immune cells that's all microwave cells uh through CD 11B so that's a specific receptor so when phybrinogen gets in it can bind to micro via so it will induce an over reaction over inflammation of the brain which will be detrimental for for many things for the functions of the cells surrounding and that reminds me that there is a fantastic researcher uh Katarina Kastudhu she's a plat-glat-stolen university you see a set barrier where she I think she developed an antibody that blocks the interaction between phybrinogen and micro via to avoid that over uh because over expression of information or over activation of micro via cells because she's also as Tom Billy ver that that's good at this option though very early and the major contribute to the ledge so that's a very interesting research it's it's very interesting again like you said it's it really um shows the importance of maintaining the blood brain barrier so that it doesn't allow you know things like phybrinogen which is involved in blood coagulation to cross into the brain again as you mentioned the inflammation it's activating microglia cells and it's causing them I mean that whole process you described earlier the inflammation and parisite detachment perhaps and all that um it also as I was reading and doing some background research on some of your work and because I knew of the inflammatory role of phybrinogen you know I had already been familiar with that protein you know separate of uh what happens when it gets into the brain I um I was looking up omega 3 because I had remembered coming across some studies with it and interestingly uh people so air particulate matter so when you have um like air pollution particulate matter when people are exposed to high amounts of it it causes their phybrinogen to go up right it's again an inflammatory marker as well but people that were taking in high amounts of omega 3 it blunted the increase in phybrinogen in plasma and so it would be very interesting to see if in some of the animal models you were discussing if omega 3 could blunt you know the white matter dysfunction caused by phybrinogen getting into the into the brain so again it's another prevention more you know an easier low hanging fruit thing that people can do now right I mean they make sure they're taking in an alpha omega 3 yes exactly um no I cannot agree more um we don't want don't need to repeat what we said but yeah there's this uh kind of vicious cycle where omega 3 may play a major role into uh that skill of functions of course it's not even made play I think that it does play role and it might play even a more important role in people that's risk for us and it's possible like the apoi phybrinogen areas that we've talked about and you mentioned interesting you mentioned airborne particles like pollution right and each I think it it's linked to what we've said earlier so various as I was to keep it simple if we think about as I'm ready to some multifactyl of disease so you have genetic risk possibly you have you have life time makes a size and everything which is also what we've learned very on mental, on environmental factors and pollution is what and there's multiple studies as you know showing that if you're if you live in a city big city you're more chance to develop some sort of dementia and I'm part of two studies that we've published four to five years ago maybe where we we exposed my studio bones particles from Los Angeles were taking from the the highway the particles and giving it to the mouse to see what's the impact of the pollution on vascular function because there's some evidence also using scans those people have tend to have more weight better disease and seeing the like that so we started looking into that and we found very interestingly we we found a high peak of a vascular it's a longitudinal disease but we very rapidly a few days after giving the particles to the mouse we were seeing blibbering by a breakdown and pericycle generation very quickly one of the first sign that we could see of course now there's debate on the mechanisms whether the particles penetrate into the brain through the dual-sactory area or whether it's directly the particles in the bloodstream that activate maybe as we said the under-tillium a bit too much which will indirectly cause some vascular issues that I think there's a more studies going on but definitely on environmental factors and pollution is a big thing to take into consideration when it comes to dementia and especially vascular function because we breathe that everyday right so this has to to to something with vascular so it's another factor but I guess it's not good I guess if you have a happy four and not doing exercise and living in a big city you probably have much more chance to develop some sort of vascular problems as we know but we try to understand how this is happening yes I I remember reading a study where babies you know in Mexico City post-mortem they found in unfortunately in babies they had like all sorts of amoloid plaques in their brain and don't think that's normal and Mexican stuff like yeah yeah it's highly polluted yeah yeah it makes it makes it wonder about filtering out the air I mean if there's some happy filter or something that helps a little bit as well as omega 3 has been shown I know I keep going back to that but it's been shown to help a lot some of the air pollution I know it's it's you know it the research has it you know so yeah I mean the I don't know I mean if we that be nice to I'm pretty sure people are working that but there is some countries or cities that are wearing masks things like that in China for example so that we I guess it's hard it would be a long study but I guess we could compare highly polluted cities and people wearing filtering and masks things like that to see whether they can pre-tive preserve some mask better mask reforctions and things like that but yeah I guess there's probably on Goex studies that yeah going back to the apoi for you know because it is such a a big genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease and you know as you mentioned you know at least about a quarter of the population has one allele I know you had done some some research we talked about how blood brain barrier seems to break down at least you're able to measure it you know in earlier in or not cognitively normal individuals but you also mentioned in one of your papers there was a protein cyclophilin a matrix metalloproteinase as a as a protein that seems to be really involved in you know it's an inflammatory protein but how does affect the blood brain barrier? Yeah those so in the same paper we were mentioning earlier that people carrying at least one allele of apoi for the tend to have more leakage in the major temporal lobe that we can see with MRI and biomarkers but of course it's a great descriptive study but we went deeper to try to understand how this is happening and what we found is the people carrying the apoi for a leal so apoi you have to know that the major source of apoi are astrocytes so when astrocytes makes apoi so if you have apoi three makes apoi three she has four makes apoi four we know that there's a different affinity to one of the apoi receptor that is called LRP one on parasites so astrocytes and parasites are close to each other they are here to maintain the the vasculature as well as the owner function and your vascul coupling but if you so the apoi four is I don't want to say anything wrong but there's a different affinity to the LRP one receptor you have less chance to buy to LRP one which will induce a cascade we win the parasites that involve NSKPB to be completely complicated cyclophina which then will lead to expression of MAP9 from parasites and other to yourself so basically if you have the apoi for team you will induce much more that cascade for 10 people having the apoi three because it doesn't bind to the LRP one on parasite it doesn't trigger the cascade of expressing cyclophina which will release MMP9 and MMP9 is the matrix METALO proteinase NIE that is basically is doing two things that you don't want number one is disrupting and the tight junctions between the endotield cells so all the endotield cells are tightly close to each other and there's tight junctions in between so this MMP9 will eat up those tight junctions so if you think about this you're going to get some gaps and that's what we call breakdown the barrier so you're going to start to see leakage and the other thing is there's a basement membrane we haven't talked about there's a basement membrane wrapping around the vessels and wrapping around the parasites and MMP9 is also eating up this basement membrane so two things that will basically break down the the integrity of the the membrane ferrie and interestingly MMP9 it's good to go back a bit she years back it's a very nice marker when it comes to the membrane barrier leakage we know as the stroke when you have a blood clot in your prey you have weaving to the next few hours you have a breakdown of the membrane barrier and a big East chemical agent and six like that and we know that this breakdown is correlated with high levels on MMP9 there's a perfect correlation of these breakdown but they're interestingly when you have a the NISCANIC stroke you have a second breakdown a few days later so it's a what we call BPhasic a bi-phasic or B-cyc, C-E-Z, M-O, that's my friend Bphasic breakdown of the barring two hours and two days and and same thing for MMP9 two peaks of expression so it's a very nice marker that goes very well with a pre-branded bi-pop it so we found this in a Poi4 and both MMP9 and cyclophinae levels were elevated in several spinal fluid of people carrying the Poi4G so we were we were talking about three to four volt if I remember correctly compared to people carrying the Poi3T so that's a major thing and so and we also found that we've used pure purely put on stem cells so we also used human derived parasites so IPSC is derived parasites in culture and when you look at them these are just culture the human parasites human on the TL cells and different cell types and we did that for donors from MMP4 and donors from MMP3 and just at baseline we were able to also see that the pericides just at baseline looking at that they produce much more of a cyclophinae and MMP9 than the pericides that do have a Poi3 so it's these are the evidres that we put and I think that goes very well with that is we published a photo-op studying vites where we decided to target cyclophinae to block cyclophinae to see whether if we have mice that do have a Poi4 if we block cyclophinae can we restore vascular function and ultimately the goal is to restore neural function and coverage so we did that we used a humanized apoi4 mice this is our mice that have the apoi4 gene of the human so we we have also the mice that do have the apoi3 we follow them as the age we do MRI on them we do tap the oblivion bar function how the blood flow and everything and we we see exactly what we see human is they have reduced blood flow in the brain they have a leaky abridvant barrier they have some behavioral problems also in terms of cognition when what we call novel object recognition of object location those memory issues so these mice are quite you know doing what we were expecting to and we gave every day for one month to the apoi4 mice we gave a non-type an inhibitor of cyclophinae that is called at a debut 025 so that's a drug that is available charging clinical trial for hepatitis C so we gave it to the mouse every day for one month and we checked the same thing we did MRI we looked at brain tissue analysis we did behavior and as we were expecting just by doing that we were able again it's not a fully of school recovery but we were able to partially and significantly restore vascular function so just by protein cyclophinae we were able to restore tydronctions we were able to restore the very side coverage of the vascular and ultimately those mice had less neonol damage and less cognitive problems so it's a good good paper that says she target the vessels you can have a big impact on neonol function and cognition so that's a that's kind of the whole story into two papers regarding the apoi4 yeah is that drug is it a couple of questions regarding it so that is it the same as the Alice poor of your I think it's when yes yes okay how safe is that I mean is that you know something I mean first of all like I mean like if you have an apoi4 allele it's like you know like could you take that prophoralactically would you have to take it like your whole life like is it you know like that would be interesting yeah I mean these are good question I don't know easily expect to address these questions but I'd be sure if you did say so first of all I wouldn't say it's safe but so they had been shooting equal trials and unfortunately some of them have been stopped and I think it was for design for epititisi it's also currently used by the way it has been used a year ago for COVID-19 in France we're too to kind of for the long people having very long like a lot of long information uh things like that actually but I again I haven't checked recently but I know the this stopped the trial falls one person that had some cardiac issues after the treatment so I cannot see it safe for it's not safe what I think is we need to design the trial and give it to the right people I think rather than giving like this I think you have to go through criteria before being able to give it I don't know if targeting cyclophine is the best approach at least we know it partially work in animals but it might be another possibility might be to target MNP9 so these are close to each other this has been also studied quite a lot in context of stroke but as you know there's thousand compounds that failed in stroke for many reasons but I don't think anyone has tried targeting MNP9 to look at more subtle driven by leaking essence see whether we can kind of seal the bark yes I'm not yeah so basically there's a whole purpose of what we are doing right now is we are we know the if she targets that might not be the safest of maybe not the best target but we have the list of other targets that we are studying which will hopefully do the same thing we want to restore pericide function we want to restore on the tail function and make sure the driven part barrier is not that he pushing the floor as you need to for your brain and make sure also something we haven't really talked about the transporters of the brain barrier if you start having a leaky barrier you're going to have some transport issues so it comes back to leaky or oxygen but also I'm you know it if you have a leaky barrier and you have your vessels that are not functional there is a few receptors rage LAP1 there's a few others if they don't work properly you're going to you won't be able to waste I mean to clear your your waste from your brain while you sleep and things like that so you won't you will have the tendency to accumulate more aminoate or ecomers and possibly the replacing so everything is interconnected but again yeah I think fixing the blood vessels whether side to a few nays or right target I don't know but I think it's promising we just have to see who will benefit from getting the drug so if you if you're having a dysfunctional blood brain barrier you know if you're basically having blood brain barrier breakdown everything you've been describing the glimfatic system which is when you sleep it squirts the cerebellisinal fluid into the brain to clear out the amoloid plaques is that is that also impaired somewhat so there's active research in this area obviously but that's that that's fair to say yes of course if you have because the you know at the arterial level you have the perivascular space which is a large when you sleep just been shown and and yeah of course if you have disruption of these vessels obviously the perivascular space will be the properties and the cells being around the perivascular macrophages and everything will be highly disturbed yes it's fair to say it's just the glimfatic system it's it's a very controversial node as you may know we don't really know whether I mean the the fact that we clear out of things from the arterial level and then it gets fairs a convective flow that trains the interest to show through it back to the veins that's kind of the theory of the system but I think it requires a bit more work to prove that this is truly happening in my opinion but this is also all the system there is the iPad so that's the intramural peri arterial drainage so there's basically either the kinphatic and all the iPad system to clear out stocksings out of the brain again I'm not the expert on that but it's fair to say that of course if you have a vascular dysfunction the the clearance of of toxins not on the amilloid but I fast-neutling or all the things will be highly disturbed yes so and my opinion that that sort of puts of course the the vascular function and blood brain barrier integrity upstream of amilloid in a way because you'll you know having that dysfunction first will then lead to more you know amilloid accumulation you know if you're not able to clear it out right I mean so what do you think of a lot of so there's been a lot of failed attempts to target amilloid beta plaques amilloid soluble soluble amilloid although recently there's the licanumab which is targets the protofibro fibro so it's still a like a soluble form of amilloid but there's some positive results with that drug do you have any thoughts about it do you think yeah I think I like to be optimistic and I like to be positive so yeah I think it's good that we have drugs for not only for yeah for research for people so it's for people so the semi-neus affected it's good that we have a drug that can remove some extent the plaques we visit evidence of that what is the best the best a bit less a bit more controversial is the the impact on cognition so there's some some you know improvement but it's not what you would hope for so which goes back to okay targeting amilloid on this probably not the way to go and sparmine not sufficient or maybe too late also so it goes back to our important research if you tackle things and and target things much more earlier than that you would have a bit of chance yes so I don't have much let's to say I think I we see more like as a cocktail of treatment if you give something that will make your blood vessels working as this should work in terms of pericite function and clearance on the tail function plus the drug of like an entire milloid any four I would bed that you would have more chance to to have a bigger impact bigger positive impact very positive impact on cognition but again this has to be done very early shea shea shea shea shea shea her brain is full of plaques it's probably too late alright so that's the importance of the research we do right now but I see that as a cocktail maybe improving the blood vessels because we know we need those blood vessels to be functional to cheer out amilloid and yeah so the combination would be probably a viable solution in the near future maybe so on the opposite end of treatment would be prevention and I think looking at dementia and Alzheimer's disease more as a vascular disease sort of opens up the doors for a lot of preventative measures you know one you know blood pressure so it's actually very common you know in at least in the United States almost 50% of the US adults have hypertension and 20% of younger adults do age 13 18 to 39 so how does high blood pressure affect the brain and dementia risk? no that's that's very important so Vesa I would see this three at least the three major to at least in my research I'm not saying major is all the three major cardiovascular aspects I pretend to be one but there's diabetes I pretty pity but in terms of hypertension and I think you've sent me a few papers but I think it's very interesting to you to know that if you have early hypertension you have hypertension it's possibly more harmful than if you have it later in life and I guess it's just a question of duration if you have a sustained like if you have hypertension stain over many years you speak it can impact the stiffness of your blood vessels it will impact as we talk with the very site function at some point so yeah I mean a lot of line is yes hypertension is known to impact the brain and very like the basal ganglia and those deep structures that serve for quite a lot from my hypertension where we see also a vasopo is an association when people have hypertension it tend to you have more microblidings also in this area of basal ganglia so yes he does impact to brain and we know there's a few studies that shows that hypertension also trigger triggers a preventative barrier leakage and pericite loss it's not the most story because in terms of small vessel disease if we come back earlier we we are sad that one of the cause or maybe the major cause of small vessel disease was hypertension but nowadays we know that's not the case because to give you an example here maybe a third even more of the coat of swan vessel disease patient that we follow they don't have any hypertension first of all so it tells you that there's a big chunk of people that can move to your small vessel disease so meaning adding white metal disease that's where it's sought to be due to hypertension and how the damage vessels but it's not the case so that's a bit more complicated but obviously it's not good to have a hypertension as we know for the brain and there's some studies showing that the giving on type pretensive drugs as a positive impact on cognition as well so it tells you that no matter what if you have hypertension you have to try to reduce it obviously to pharmacology because it will have an impact but interestingly to just go back at the beginning of my answer if this it's a bit controversial but she has heraly like 30 40s the 30s 40s she has heraly hypertension you you will have a likely good and more chance to develop community kind quickly as compared to a normal like a normal intensive person at the same age and interestingly they were showing also in the paper that each other potential during this year 70s if I remember correctly it doesn't impact you will likely to develop so it goes back to you I think the just the final point is I think it's very important the duration is the crud the crud the part of hypertension is very critical if you have that for many years same thing for inflammation as you age you have a crudnik slow low grade inflammation as we'll disrupt your vessels very slow probably the same thing we have pretension if you have too much hypertension your terrible stiffness will be you know disturbance and damage of the time and this will up the gradual prevent barrier value much faster than a normal tensile person and this has the regional specificity and different sensitivity in the brain but yes but that's an active area again we have tools now to measure these brain regions how the leak and try to compare to you people with hypertension but the difficult part in clinical research is no one is hypertension and nothing else right i-contensive in the fingers there's always comorbidities or bgte other things so it's hard to disentangle what pure hypertension is doing to the blood vessels because there's always other things you can try to correct statistically with covariance and things it's quite hard to do to study so does seem like last you mentioned cumulative exposure yeah seems to be the the more important thing here and again people that are probably in there 20s 30s 40s aren't even if they have high blood pressure aren't probably thinking it's a big deal and in fact that's probably the biggest deal because they're starting early with the high blood pressure that's my thought that's what we've read yeah same thing with exercise i think what we hear from these recent studies is the critical window is I don't think I'm correct you may know better than me but it's like 4555 something like that where you really had have to exercise and to come come back to the small vessels you have to open them up and make sure they are functional that's the critical window is that I think it's partly true for sure the tell you you may know a bit more than me on that question but yes I think that's the time that's it yeah certainly it's never too late to start exercising and there's been there have been studies showing even the 70s you can have cardiovascular improvements of course in this back earlier is better you know and and exercise as you mentioned it is one of the best ways to improve you know cardiovascular function and improves blood pressure or territorial function all those things and interestingly the sauna also does that the heat stress a lot of the physiological aspects of elevator and you know that the test yeah just and there's a lot of research in fact there's of course with you know observational data it's and you never can establish causation as you mentioned there's all sorts of acoustic covarious and things but there are studies showing that you know do independently sauna uses a society with like a 60% lower dementia risk and Alzheimer's disease risk if you're using the sauna 47 times a week if you use it you know two to three times a week there's like a 20% lower risk after adjusting for other factors as well but we do know sauna like there's there's intervention studies I mean it's it's comparable to moderate aerobic exercise in in terms of the effects on blood pressure okay heart rate variability and stuff so also sort of just interesting but exercise being a really important one for you know prevention you know dementia and Alzheimer's disease prevention as much as you can do how does alcohol affect the blood brain barrier? Again I think it's a bit controversial with a case where I know from the literature is a chronic consumption obviously is not good and interestingly we can see I don't know if you've seen that but there is a gender effect with sex effect so the male's tend to have if you're a chronic drinker of alcohol you tend you you will have some best-cubler issues it has been linked so you're chronically a trickle you have a leak here but Brebren barrier it has been shown but if you're a woman drink the same as age miles and everything they will they will have almost preserved vasculine function that's very interesting again but it's again a few studies but the hypothesis that they bring you are your estrogen and all these that have on time inflammatory properties and triglyctopes but so obviously drink too much does impact your vasculine function so what is a bit more controversial is like moderate drinking so there's a you can see things showing that moderate drinking is up is impacting your brain function but not only brain function but vasculine properties of the brain and there's also other studies that show that moderate drinking doesn't do anything it's it's even positive sub case so I think it's I'm not an expert on that subject but I guess if you go in details into the design of the studies you may find the the reason why these are different results but that's the the results they put that short so yeah I you probably know better than me what what it does but yes to some extent did just the alcohol itself impact preventive functions just by increasing the level of cytokines in the blood blood and which will increase the inflammation of the blood vessels so yes and if we go back to dementia and in some aging if you do that chronically obviously if you sustain if you have sustained level of inflammation of your blood vessels we know what it does you know it's it's it's currently in per per side functions and all the time it possibly leading to leakage which yeah it's a bit bad so chronic drinking is of course people will have a more chance to develop dementia very quick so but yeah I don't know if you know more than me but that's what I know about that yeah I know that the the same guy's very kind it's there's a lot of conflicting data yeah and you'll find again as you said some studies showing moderate alcohol consumption protecting against dementia and I'm showing it not as I sort of tried to dig deeper what I was finding was it was protective and people that were not April before positive yeah okay and and so you know and then of course it all comes down to each study how they defined moderate or light drinking actually different as well so it's not yeah and some in some cases it's like okay well light drinking is less than wondering cadet yeah or then in some cases it was like the study that weekly so it's like okay less than three drinks a week well that means some days you're not having any so there's so many variables here that it seems challenging to that's an interesting area because I mean I'm just thinking when when we tell me drinking I think about red wine and pratch and red wine our full of slavanoids that you know from the grapes which has been shown to be very important for brain functions and and also for vascular so there's also the positive of thinking that way she take a little bit of wine I don't know how frequent because I don't know the studies and how much she should drink but at least one glass every now and then right should be helpful and good for your break that's another thing so I think void daily drinking sounds of course um do you know about you mentioned like you know obesity and and tap-tube abd's and these things also I mean does obesity accelerate the blood brain barrier breakdown or weakness? so yes so I've seen a few studies showing that but also interestingly I don't know she know that William Banks one of the he's not the one of the most I've the yeah the most highly society researcher when it comes to bliper and barrier I think he is the incaliponia he also brought a recent review that bliper and barrier leakage will trigger obesity and not the other way around as we as we age so it's very interesting I haven't read the region details but yes I found studies that shows that obesity of course these people tend to have higher levels of in print-fametery markers, cytokines, chemokines in the blood and things like that which will have an impact on barrier function we know that but the other way around I didn't know I've just found that recently we've William Banks so interesting but I think he's claiming that very some sub like epitome is a barrier that are basically you know controlling starvation and the way you should eat and things like that and if the vasculature in this area or kind of leaky that's where you're gonna start having some of this function in this starvation and footing take and things like that so people will start to eat too much and so I think it's interesting I haven't read the review but I can send it to you make it so interesting idea but a few ways when data is supporting that sounds like a vicious cycle I mean I thought this ending is he was like obesity visceral fat I mean that's inflammatory you know environment so it makes to me it would make sense that it would affect the blood barrier in a negative way what about homocysteine high homocysteine does it's a cause of one of many causes of high blood pressure I don't know much yeah yeah just curious yeah because I did see you know like it's also associated with brain dysfunction and dementia and there was like at least one study I saw where yeah I've seen that it's a classic I mean look classic it's a mockery that is often looked at but I'm not very knowledgeable and the past ways that are involved we've almost stayed yeah you know if you don't study that yeah if you have some I'll be to read more about this yeah yeah there's a paper I linked you to and some of the notes I sent that in people with that had high homocysteine when they were treated with a b6 b12 fully sort of concoction to help lower their homocysteine it improved their their cognition and also markers of bloodbremberia so interesting but I mean I know it's not the focus of your research it's I mean I think this is really great actually like looking it's it's there has been a lot of paradigm shifts in people's thoughts on Alzheimer's disease with them thinking about it being a metabolic disease and a lot of it type 3 diabetes so here but like I think this vascular dysfunction is it's so crucial and you know I think me go hand in hand with the metabolism maybe you know at the root of it but you know identifying some of these early biomarkers that you were mentioning even in plasma I don't know how early or if they're even available to people to measure are they it's till at the research phase so there's a I don't know you know but there's a new technique called editorial chemoly mini-sense and there's two major platforms worldwide one is called mesoscal discovery MSD here's the one it's the c-mole c-mole platform and the beauty of these two technologies is you can use a small amount of fluid and you can get a lot of data basically to make it simple and and so these particular failure new vascular biomarkers are currently being you know validated and everything in those platforms that will be eyes through put and where you can imagine to to do a lot of the patients at the time right eyes quite the work flow right I quite long and difficult for the toy which I asked anybody markers we want like same as we heard from Japan if you can get same as you get your blood glucose right from the finger you can get your amino it status right I'm your age 42 levels now and she's like that and get diagnosed with a she has Alzheimer's or not from just a drop of blood so that would be the idea basically having this but this would require probably a few years obviously but it's available at the research level but not at the clinical level as of yet what about the cyborg platelet derived growth factor receptor when you mentioned so it's it's and it's ongoing in clinical trials in the U.S so I guess it requires it has been done in hundreds of patients participants now they try to build up go to thousands you know you need some validation step with bigger cohorts and and make sure that this is truly elevated let's say we've up before we veging in a much larger cohort of patients but yeah I think it's much closer to to be available hopefully talking about months you're you're to hopefully yeah but I'm not well a lot of that validation step but hopefully this will come quick because I think it's a very very very valuable tool for for us yeah I'm I'm very thankful for the research that you do in your lab axle and and others you know Dr. Slobobick and and some of the people you mentioned I mean just that people are out there trying to identify new biomarkers of dementia and Alzheimer's vascular biomarkers and new treatments and also opening up more preventative measures and you know understanding it in a different way so thank you so much for all the research you do for coming on the podcast I I know you're on Twitter I follow you on Twitter your Twitter handle is at a xl and then underscore m o n t a g n e for anyone that wants to follow axle and Twitter he tweets interesting studies related to the stuff we talked about today you also have a lab website which I was perusing a very nice one and montain lab at dot com so that's m o n t a g n e l a b dot com and a willing to those as well on our episode but really I learned a learned a lot today axle I really appreciate you taking time to to educate to educate everyone on on this important role that vascular function plays in cognitive function in preventing neurodegenerative diseases and just healthy brain aging in general so thank you very much for invitation I really enjoyed it so I hope the listeners will will do
