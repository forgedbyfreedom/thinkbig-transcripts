Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Predensation and I have a message if you want to be as lean as possible You should only do your cardio when you're fasted Wait, no, that's wrong. It's actually BS looked it Take a quick look into why The rationale for fasted cardio in a certain sense actually makes a lot of sense So let's cut it some slack If you wake up you have some black coffee or whatever you go do cardio There's nothing in your stomach. There's nothing in your bloodstream from your gastrointestinal tract You're burning a lot of just straight body fat to get that done totally if instead You ate food You would be burning some of your body fat stores, but also you'd be burning a lot of the food that you just ate Especially towards the tail end of that cardio when the food starts to really adjust and some people eat breakfast Do whatever work and then our two later if they'll like go do cardio. Wow, yeah, it's a lot of like food you're burning And why would you burn food if you could just burn body fat and stat so fast of cardio logic seems to make sense But Direct research shows that there's a teeny tiny difference and we don't even know which way it goes Usually at favors fasted cardio by like some infinitesimally small uh Barely statistically detectable difference so it turns out fed state cardio where you eat a meal Wait a while they go to cardio that in the real world versus fasted cardio causes almost the same amount of fat loss Like how how could that possibly be if we're burning food in one for the most part and burning body fat the other for the most part Well, here's the thing If you eat some food and then you burn up some of it during cardio That's food that's not available in your bloodstream to get stored into fat stores That's food that's not available in the bloodstream to power energy for daily tasks later So where are you going to get that energy is your fat cells? So it turns out that as long as the calories between those two conditions of fed state cardio and fasted cardio are equated 2000 calories 500 calorie deficit in each one of those you really end up over the course of the day Burning roughly the same amount of body fat whether or not it's fasted or fed To that end How do you decide if you want to do fasted cardio or fed state cardio and there's a really an easy decision making process How Hungry are you versus how much energy do you need to do cardio if you notice that hunger is a big deal It might be a good idea for you to try fasted cardio here is why You wake up you do whatever you go start doing cardio without having eaten yet Cardio takes an hour you finish your cardio you shower whatever the need eat During cardio for sure and even after cardio for 30 minutes or whatever you're often just not hungry Because you're in a sympathetic state of activity and you're not relieved like very much hungry at the time So you sort you kind of bought yourself or hour or two or three if you stretch it out of non-hunger time That means all of the rest of the calories you have spread to you through the day can crunch together and then you're eating in any unit time for the day later More calories per unit time because it's same calories, but the unit time is shrunk Normally you would eat 2,000 calories over 60 hours and kind of be really hungry during that time But you bought yourself two extra hours of doing cardio and then showering when you're not eating So now it's 14 hours Same number of calories divided by 14 hours you're feeling fuller on average So it's a great way to manage your hunger and that's the big power of fasted cardio But if your hunger's not really an issue and your cardio is really suffering energy-wise Fed state cardio is just way easier because you have energy from food for your brain glucose stuff like that So if you eat a meal do some chores do some work two hours later you do cardio You're gonna burn over the course of 24 hours almost the same identical amount of fat But at the same time you're gonna be able to really power through that cardio So if you need cardio power Fed state cardio is better Especially if you do higher intensity cardio if you compete in some kind of sport there requires you to train train If you can plot through your cardio in no problem little bit of black coffee goes a long way and you're really Want to hunger manage by squeezing the remainder of your food into a smaller eating interval Then fasted cardio is your choice So the idea that fasted cardio is always superior To fed state cardio for fat loss is Bullshit and the hated stop it Thanks Arnold it's great to hear your voice again and until next time see you next time
