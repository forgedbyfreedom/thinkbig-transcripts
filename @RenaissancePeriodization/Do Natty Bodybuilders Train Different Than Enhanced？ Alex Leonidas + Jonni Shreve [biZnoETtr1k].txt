Slow. No! Buz! Holy f**k. Ha ha ha. That's what we want to see. Hahahaha. That's what we want to see. Yo, what up, YouTube? Listen, I used to roll solo. And then I realized there's a four-letter word that takes that and throws it away. And it's CR-E-W. That's crew. And I'm deep-stacked today, fellas. We got Mr. Alex Reynitis, who is a literal Spartan. You never heard of the 300 per Spartan. That's my man. He didn't die in no battle. He straight up beat up everyone. Perceus, Alamo, a fucker's dead. And now he's a natural bodybuilder. Three weeks out of his neck show. He's my man. He's got his own channel. You better be checking that out. It's Alex Leanditis, formerly Alphabeshti. But the destiny is that he's shacked and shredded and ripped. But the only downside is he's a tiny bit too light-skinned. Which is where my boy Johnny comes in. Johnny Shree, the Nigerian Prince, the man, the myth, the legend. What more can I say? What less can I say about him? So I don't get canceled for that Nigerian Prince shit I just said. You guys see Johnny before you know who he is. These guys both call me up at the same time. I have two phones like this. And they were like biceps, it was like, yeah. And the other was like delts, I was like, yeah. So we're going to do biceps and delts. Delts and biceps. Shout out Mike, let's get to work. All right, let's do it. We're going to do my rep match. Cool. Which means, yeah. Sorry. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I know what that is. This is what it is. Fuck that. Nice. So who's wiping my ass after? Right. Come over. We'll take care of it. He's going to take a shower. Tongue wipe. Just take. Daddy. Okay. First exercise is the Atlantis lateral raise machine. The best lateral raise machine in the business. We are going to be doing sets of 15 to 20 reps, but it's my rep match. Probably three sets is good enough because damn. That means. Do about 15 to 20 reps very close to failure on the first set. Walk off. Alex comes in. Johnny comes in. I go back in. I have to do as many. Many sets as it takes to get to 15. So if I get to 12, that means I put a dot. I rest for five seconds. And then I do another three. I have to match 15, 15, 15 every single set. And so do these motherfuckers. Or whatever reps I'm going to get. That. Yep. One. Slow. Eugh. Ugh. How many? I don't know. Just do it. I don't know after 15. 15. I'll come back. Come on. Come on. Come on. Two. Slow. That rest for a sec. Don't go anywhere. Rest. Begin. Come on. Finish. Push. Now slow. That's it. Oh yes. Dude, there's only one. One. One, kingly and I. That's not my. Fucker. Dude. Awesome. Your delts are coming out. I'm delts. Is there really three heads? It looks like one, three heads. You cheated. What do we activate in the make sure we did this entire thing? Like crap. Far end emotion. Like what are we? Where are we thinking? Feel in this entire movement. The first thing you want to do is make sure you're moving right from an external perspective. So start here. Are you thinking arc out? Not like this shit where you pull in. Don't disappear. Are you out? Up. And try to get the tops of your hands to touch at the top. You don't have to do that, but it's a cool cue. Once you get there, think of slowing the descent down, using the very tops of your shoulders and nothing else. And then back up, just move. Move on the concentric, control with your side delts on the eccentric. There's other cues, they're good cues. That's my cues for the shit. Cool. Let's go. Two more and then rest. Hit it. Come on. I sit. Yeah. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Come on. Go in. Slow. Slow. One more. One more. Take your time. You got to take deep. Take deep. Take deep. Come on. Move it. Push you. Move it. Yes. Slow. Control. All the way. There you go. How are you? This shit. It's amazing. It worked, man. Really good. Side five. Solid. Y'all. He's got his own foot. I'm pushing you. I'm pushing all that. I don't even know what I'm saying. Wow. I'm glad I said why are these idiots going so high up that their front delts take over the movement. It's because your front delts get so much training from chest movement. They don't need a lot of extra training. So this top part is probably good enough for them. I don't do any other front delts work than the small part I get here. But also, yes, past about here, it's mostly front delts. That allows us to get free front delts work and the side delts are still working to some extent. But it allows us to get up so high that on the way down, we're instantly essentially controlling right off the bat because the side delts are a bit unloaded up here. Once you reach the top, you can say, okay, now I'm in control. And that slowest centric is worth the extra front delt in all of them. Can you stop short of that top? Yes. Is it still just as great of a movement? If you just go to 135 degrees instead of 90, instead of all the way up, to 180 row of the fuck that is? Yes. There's no wrong answers here as long as you at least clear parallel. And then a little bit higher is usually better. All the way up is not mandatory. But for us, the extra front delt work is totally cool. And that is centric of control on the way down is easier if you go all the way up. So give me that some thought. That's 12th. Yep. I'll take a little break after this one. Finish off all the two. One more one you're ready. Two more one you're ready. Easy day today. Yep. Yep. Slow. Holy fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. How much does whole dumbbells have to do this? It's a barbell. Good news. Great. How does whole barbell are off there? I don't know. I was hoping you didn't ask to follow up. Let's go find us a barbell, yeah. Look, man, I said, hey, we just I just did a video on. Do I do one of the prices in the squat rack? Shit. Man. Only because Pyramos has about 75 squat racks. So as you only time you allowed to do, biceps in the squat rack. Johnny, why not curling? What are you doing? You just want to curl, don't you? Just let it just let it just let it do it up, right? Just let it mother fuck curl up in here. Do it up, right? But still, is that considered? Is it an accessory like this? Considered? These are upright rows. We're going to be pulling them to above the face in height and pausing at the top. That allows us to do this get a crazy amount of range of motion. Use not so much load. It is insulting to the ego. But that pause at the top activates your side delts and you keep them active in a slow control-based center, gone the way down. And because we're warm already for who skeptical is some shit? What's he doing? I can't see his face. Just sit in the head, man. Yeah, it's about. Sit in the head. So I've just got actually started my first work set because we're already warmed up for shoulders. So consider this an intro. And set number one. Like, you know, I'll feed baby, I need space. At least sets the tone. Ah! Just the intensity standard. Sir. Oh, no. Wow, I can't wait to do these. I used to fear upright rows. Do you do a certain somewhat. So I've ordered... Jeff Cavaliere. We can say it. What's your gonna watch our channel? So I'm kind of a new bed this movement. So let's see what this feels like. Yes, but you gotta stop at the top and pause. The visible pause. It's gonna be painful. Fuck you, you feel that? Let's go. Yes. Hi. Yes. And then slow. That's one more Alex. Big move. Up. Pause. Slow. Oh yeah. So I'd be punished last. You're like, a freak. All these idiots already want. Slow. Slow. Slow. Ah. Oh yeah. One more Johnny. Go rest. Go rest. Up. Slow. Holy fuck. That's what we want to see. I feel like we should be putting like six plates on each side. 100%. And just fucking hot. We're talking now. We're talking. Ah. How do you make a simple movement as shitty as you pause and can? Mh. Like is the architect? Come on. There you go. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Whoa. Nice. Come on. Ball. There you go. Yes. Three more. Three more. Three more. There you go. Come on. Go. This shit. Let's go, man. Come on. That shit. Good one, zone me. Come on. Yeah. Yep. All the way up. Come on. Come on. That's just nice. Slow. That's nice. That was awful. Fight it. For a second. One good one. One more good one. Here you go. Come on. Yes. Four. One more. Just one. Hold it. Slow. Slow. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's good enough. That's good enough. That's good enough. 13. Beautiful. 14. Last one. Yes. Slow. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. So good. Nobody's helping you, man. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Good work. Let's do some curls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was good for you. It was good for you. It was good for you. It was good for you. All right. I don't know. I kind of wish it was more whatever. I think I think I think I just got to get it. Get set yourself somewhere behind it. I've been like kind of shit over. Not like to like, you know, come up. Walked with tight. I think it over top with things. That's all this is going to work. That'll work. It's like last exercise. Weird. Pinnata machine bicep. Preacher curl standing thing. It's kind of a trip. It feels pretty cool. Three sets. Relatively heavy. 10 to 15 reps. My rep match. And then we're going to do one set of like 20. This many many sets of takes. Lighter. Work that's total. And we're fucking done. I'm out. You motherfucker. Never. Come on. I ripped a place. Let's go get it up. Get it up. Come on. Oh yeah. Come on. I pull up. Pull. Come on. Pull. I see. Come on. There you go. Control down. Control down. There you go. Come on. Stay hard. There you go. Shit. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Pull. Pull it. Pull. Pull. Let's go. Perfect. Pull. Nice. Nice. Nice. Sounds nice. All right. Penata. Mike's over there. Get it. Black belt. No. Thanks again. Thank you so much. Nice meeting you. Because it's because it's just you. That's why it's getting back up. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Excellent. Good technique. Only. Got. Slow. Got. Good. Slowly. I'm going to do my usual set of 12-mile rent match here at 110 kilos. I don't know. I don't know, pounds. And then after that, I'm just gonna walk and put it into the 77 or so, or whatever that is. 110 down to 77, and I'm going to do 20 total repetitions right after my 12th. However, many old mini sets of takes. That'll be the end of the end of the line. Last work up. Oh man, I think I was just trying to say anything but I don't know, I thought those, I'm like, is that part of your sweater or is that like a, miss, are you that hairy? When that we fucked up, I was yesterday we changed. I'm sure that was hairy. I'm so glad to be the first. And I'll stay in the entire time. Come on, Mike. Come on. You're right, you're right. I'm so easy. Let's go. There you go. Two, there you go. Come on. Three, back there. That's it. Come on. That's good. There you go. That's it. There you go. There you go. Come on.
