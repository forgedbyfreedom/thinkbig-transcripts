17 pounds in 22 weeks. I wonder if he's going to be any real people that have had real results on. That's what I do next, Father Charles and F. So I gave the supplements the two viewers five days ago. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Piersation, creator of the RP Hypertrophy app. The RP Diet Coach App and Professor of Exercise and Sport Science at the Lehman College in the Bronx. Hey, the Bronx. Whoa. F*** off. Hey. Anyway, that's why I speak when I'm in the Bronx. But I also speak like that when confronted with people making false claims about diet and exercise. It's right. I get quite hood. And maybe nobody has made more false claims in public and then take into a congressional hearing because of it about nutrition and exercise science in the most false way possible. And Mr. Doctor Oz. Matt, the Oz you're used to going to when the tornado spins or ass-up dumps you somewhere outside of Kansas. But the Oz of lying to people about what they can expect from pills that do nothing. Oh, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's take a look at some of Dr. Oz's claims and see if we can make any sense out of them at all. Roll camera. You make a magic as make believe? Yes, magic is make believe. Anyone after the age of eight is either in that opinion or is deemed mentally unwell. But this little bean. A bee. Love f***ing, I mean, in-sex and shit. Bean. Bean. Thanks for got the video guy. Has scientists saying they've done a magic weight loss cure for every body type? Wow! I wonder how many scientists have actually said they found the magic weight loss cure for every body type. As a scientist, let me break this down for you. Nobody. No wait wait. I can do better. Body types aren't even a real thing. Magic isn't a real thing. And weight loss is not something to be cured, but to be treated because you're not a choir weight loss as some kind of disease that occurs from the pathogen or something like that. Finally, I'm cured of my weight loss. No, no. Access body weight is the thing you're actually trying to cure. If you were even going to architect that position intelligently, doctor, Oz, yes, I know you're in a world-winning heart surgeon in a spaceship like that, but your boy went to PhD in gym class. And I finished that shit about the critique you more. I'm already channeling. Ah, that's gone. How am I supposed to say? That duck side. I just wish I had a lightning bolt. The zap does dumb out of the f***er with you feeling me. All right. It's green coffee beans. And when turned into a supplement, this miracle pill can burn that fast. Did he say green coffee beans? Yes, he did. Okay. But apparently, the only burn fat fast if turned into a pill. And I wonder if Dr. Oz makes any money off said pill. Now, for the record, there's nothing wrong with making money. And nothing wrong with promoting your own supplements. What's wrong is, if you're lying about the effect. Now, I'm sure he's not lying. Let's look at more of these claims. For anyone who wants to lose weight, this is very exciting and it's breaking news. And breaking news. I just want to see like a little snippet of life. You create more heating up again, and this Russia counter-tacked weight. No, Bob hold on a second. We've got breaking news coming in. Dr. Oz is a f*** liar again. Thanks Amy. Let's go to that story right now. This study, 11, when they mix beakers and shit, you hold up that look like blood. Do they accidentally get footage of the vampire lab from like blade Trinity? Yeah, you don't see it? The five size height is the kind of fine too. What's up, girl? I love beakers and shit. You can, you can, you can, you can, you can, you can, you can, you can, you're blood and I'm, all right, huh? I'm f***ing, and I'm meeting up. You're looking through a microscope and f***ing coffee beans and shit. There's nothing I love more in this world than stock science footage. And remember, a scientist never ever enter the lab without a laboratory coat on. If you ever actually been to a science lab, you'll be shocked to see how much just regular people in there with regular clothes in most contexts. A huge disappointment. Me, lab coat, goggles, and generally, I like just like to wear hazmat suit the whole time. It's fine, it's cozy in there. The world's largest scientific society triggered unprecedented excitement proweight loss study. It showed women and men, you think? God, and I thought it was only half of us. Lost in a stumbling amount of fat and weight. 17 pounds in 22 weeks. Try the doctor and certified nutritionist, Lindsay, don't get us here with the findings. Folks, what do we think about men with the name, Lindsay? No, I know there are many people in the NBA with that name, but uh... I don't know what I think about it. You know, like it's 2023, all the genders are great, but uh... Oh, f***, why your name? Lindsay, get a real man's name. Bob, or Mehmet. The doctor asks us first name by the way. Solid name. So that was you love this being. Why is that? You know, I usually don't recommend weight loss, someone is. Uh-huh. There comes the qualifications, folks. Look at your screen. Natural Pathic Doctor and Certified Nutritionist. Certified Nutritionist almost certainly is a play around the term register dietitian, which he's almost certainly not. You can be a certified nutritionist with a variety of gardening bodies that don't have a whole lot of authority in the United States or any other country, and you can actually make your own nutrition certification in the most places just by announcing that you have one. Um, natural pathic doctor. Folks, that is unfortunately real thing. And without offending too many people, it's all f***ing bullshit. Because doctors select from a variety of treatment options, they don't care if it's natural or not. If something natural works to help you, doctors love it. Real doctors that is people with MD and DO after their name. MD, uh, I have an issue. And if you're a natural pathic doctor, uh, hello, but go get a real degree. I'm kidding, sort of. I'm not kidding. I'll put my phone on that one. But this one has got me really, really excited. You look so excited, Lindsey. So in the medical community, you're not in the medical community, mother f***er. Scott, this is going to take a while. The weight loss community is all buzzing about this. Mhmm. I still want it to be a B. If you add me in B, is that be like, I believe it? That's weird enough to work. And here's why the recent study that you were talking about earlier, the participants took the capsules and they did nothing else. They didn't exercise, they didn't change their diet. They actually consumed 2400 calories a day. I don't understand how that's relevant. But please continue. They burned only 400 calories. Now that's weight gain, not weight loss. Mhmm. Hot. Folks, there is no one past the size of a small child that has a resting metabolic of less than 400 calories. So it is impossible for these people to be burning less than 400 calories. There is no mathematical trickery going on here. This is at the best a wild misunderstanding of how reality works. And it worst a blatant lying. Now, there are people on the internet that claim to be able to read facial expressions and analyze whether or not people are lying consciously. I sure should hope they get their f***ing eye lasers on these motherf***ers. Because I can't tell. I'm f***ing autistic as shit. And I don't know, I'll sound like they're trying to me. But god damn, that can't be what he understands to be true. Do you know why? Because it's not true. And they lost over 10% of their total body weight. 7. How? Over 10% of their body weight. That means the average study participant would have to weigh less than 170 pounds. Hmm. Generally, people in studies of drugs or supplements that help people lose weight are considerably overweight. And these people would not be. Again, nothing's adding up. Straight. 10%. 10% they lost. But guys, again, lie detector people on the internet. Can you focus in on Dr. Osis face? He looks so interested in so compelling. And I will say his hair is just fabulous. Listen, again, as I continually insist on this channel and dwell in perpetuity, I may be in the conversation for the top 10. No, five straightest men of all time. But a little salt and pepper older man with authority, a doctor. Oh my god, little grrr. I'm beyond my knees quick. On my knees for what you ask, oh come on. This is a visit. Channel for families. I can't get into that. Blow job. If you guys like that and you want a little bit more, we have an extended, ex-rated. No, no, triple x-rated cut. And our member section, give that a click, check it out if you're interested in seeing more. And they lost about 17 pounds per participant and they had no side effects. Zero side effects. Okay, so he was wrong earlier. God, it thanks. We're just throwing make believe numbers out. By the way, zero side effects is bullshit. Every single study properly designed collects side effects data. And in every single study just through statistical noise, you'll get people reporting a certain number of side effects. People report gastrointestinal distress when there's nothing happened in tenement reality. They report headache in most cases nausea and so on and so forth. So it's actually very unbecoming to say there's no side effects. You can say minimal side effects. You can say trace side effects. No side effects. Well, that's exactly what the kind of bullshit you expect on a doctor's channel. And how long did they have to take the pills for? They did it for 12 weeks. Oh, it's okay. I'm no scientist. But earlier Scott the video guy didn't they say 22 weeks? 17 pounds in 22 weeks. I mean, I don't know, it is. You can't even keep your own story straight. Like if you're gonna lie at least like consistently. Lindsay. You had one job, Lindsay. Why would just drink can coffee do this? Yeah, because when the coffee that we drink is roasted and when they roasted, they roasted at 475 degrees Fahrenheit. That sounds like a big number that scares me. But the most important thing it does is it removes the chlorogenic acid. That's the key to what we're talking about today. You know, I don't even know what the f***er genoc acid is. Sounds made up, but it could be a real thing. It absolutely is possible with that various modifications made to food in the proper toy process, such as the heating of coffee can degrade some of the fighter chemicals and prevent them profoundly positive effects or negative effects on your body. That's totally plausible. And so with this channel going to say, sounds plausible. It's the results that we're concerned about. Does it really cause the things that he is claiming? I suspect the answer is, oh, by the way. So how does it work? Well, it's amazing. It's what we call a triple threat. Yes, that's what we typically say in science. Triple threat. It goes in and it causes the body to burn glucose or sugar and burn fat mainly in the liver. He's either phrasing this very poorly or he's just making shit up. The liver doesn't burn a lot, unless the liver metabolism goes up and typically when you're liver metabolism goes up the doctors tell you you're going to die really soon. The liver can liberate its glucose and fat stores and release them into the bloodstream. Maybe that's what he means. Never can tell. The second way in the most important way is it slows the release of sugar into the bloodstream. contradicts my earlier point. I just don't know anything. So when you don't have sugar building up in the bloodstream, you don't have fat building up because sugar turns the fat. I mean, everybody knows that. That guy's a great public speaker. He could run for office, which Dr. Oz actually tried to do recently. It reduces the amount of sugar going into your bloodstream. Somehow that's also supposed to increase the amount of sugar you burn. I know where that sugar is burning. I guess it stays in the liver and gets burned inside the liver. What does the liver do with the extra ATP? Or is it an uncopling process where extra heat is generated in the liver? You could make yourself into Fwagra. Ooh, that sounds kind of tasting. Scott, do you guys hear a moral enough to eat Fwagra? Do you like it? Do you pronounce it foys groys when you order it? Of course. My man. That's how people know your cultured. Everybody must remember that. When the two are combined together, you get this synergistic effect. You mean contradictory effect? That basically burns and blocks and stops fat. You definitely want to stop fat. I see fat like shaking at a security guard with it gun. Give me your money bank teller and then the police come in and like fat. You got to stop this. He's like, oh no, oh my god he drops his gun. That's how the body works. Now I always pride myself and having this smartest TV audience out there. Oh god that's good. Notless. If you watch Dr. Oz, look, my grandma used to watch Dr. Oz. No longer with this. Not because of Dr. Oz, but sure shit, not, you know what I'm saying? He didn't help. Politically amazing thing to say. I mean, fuck. God is he like a sociopath or something? You know what? I'm getting quite hot. Let me take my sweatshirt off. This is war. Those smartest audience. So I'm hoping some of you are skeptical about this. Oh, I love it. Foss, skepticism, encouragement. I don't, don't just believe what I say. Let's talk about real results. Real people. I wonder if he's going to be in real people that have had real results on. That's what I do next. Five of the Charleston. So I gave the supplements the two viewers five days ago. Brilliant. Brilliant. And he's given him way for free. Oh god, what a nice guy. Oh, how did they work for you? Ah, yes. The March of the Carrons begins. I believe that Dr. Oz is secret is that he draws energy from Carrons like Goku draws energy from all life to create the spirit bomb. I have to be pro and Renaissance periodization, body building coach, Jared, father, draws energy from women of Southeast Asian and Latin descent. And you know, Dr. Oz, and stay calm, Scott the video guy, Dr. Oz draws energy from Carrons. Because there are a lot of Carrons that want to lose weight, understandably. Carrons, no offense. Call me whatever you like, stare at, add a ugly man, all true. But they got this just so many of them. And so that explains why Dr. Oz is so powerful. It gave me more energy than I usually have. Is that woman in gunpoint? She looks very afraid. Tell them right now. Tell them you hate the US government. Tell them free all terrorists around the world. And that you like this green tea extract supplement. No! Okay, okay, okay, okay. It made me less hungry than I usually am in the beginning stages of trying to lose weight. And I seem to get fuller faster when I was eating. I did get a lot more energy. I didn't change my diet. Everything was the same. I was fuller and I was fuller longer. Oh my god, I was going to dig into these women. These seem like such nice ladies. Fuck, Dr. Oz stop ripping people off. They're good people. Here's the thing. I get snarky all the f*** time on the channel, especially in these reacts videos. I are all though like, we have all the same team. You know what I'm saying? We're all human beings. I got love for everybody except people like Dr. Oz who rip everyone off. These are such nice, oh my god. F***. And I was excited with my ring gold. You were. She excited. Okay, I find out. Can I store it off at 176 pounds and five days? Guys, five days means nothing in the weight loss world. I could give you a diuretic, a pill that makes you drop body water alone. You lose 15 pounds and five days no problem. It doesn't mean anything. Five days with nothing else changing. Ooh, I like that the weight loss comes from a random number generator. They're like, well, it's actually like a lottery. You lost two pounds. Oh yeah, that's not even that exciting. I thought for a second that the green bar was for how much weight she lost. Did you? And care and lost 174 pounds. Congratulations, oh god. It's good. Okay, again, five days ago, you're 255 pounds. That's a lot of care. Less than a week later, on my, has lost six pounds. That's just, we're gonna pound the day. Black men in the audience are like, boo. Am I allowed to say that? It's got the minute, guys. I'll see. The non-drug free side of bodybuilding, these people will try anything and everything in due try. Anything and everything to put into their bodies to maximize their results. And these are the leanest people in the world. Coffee extract and shit like that. It just doesn't really make the list. Truly powerful weight and fat loss drugs are actually available. They're called GLP agonists. And they're, they're getting more advanced now that they have GLP GIP combined agonists. They're in the lab working on triple agonists. We're looking on so that triple thread he was talking about. That's a real thing now in the lab. The results from these are way more impressive. They're real. It's not like one BS study that some supplement company makes it. Nobody's able to replicate. And this is the real problem in pain with this kind of stuff. People who want to lose weight, you know, it means something to them. Sometimes they even describe accurately as desperate. And they go and they get hoped from watching his stupid shows like this. And then they take the stupid green T extract or coffee bean shit that he's selling. Him and his cronies get a f***ing fat cut. So he can have a net worth of f***ing god knows to 100 million plus. And then you go and spend your hard time money on the shit. You take the pill and basically nothing happens. And that blows. That blows, selling people shit that does not work is, um, jeez a moral. I would call it a moral. F*** out, drive. What do you get when PhD sports scientists collaborate with pro body builders? The most effective muscle growth training at ever made. Get yours now. You know, most women are eating food that are absolutely wreaking havoc on their metabolism. As an exercise physiologist, I can tell you flat out. This is categorically false. There are precisely zero foods that wreak havoc on their metabolism. They just don't exist. One of the biggest setbacks to weight loss says Dr. Act. Clearly, papyrus, potatoes, what else? What else does bad things? Is eating apples, they're f***ed up. But he calls metabolism death foods. Man, you know someone's on to some right shit. When they can say metabolism death foods with a straight face. Shut down your body's fat burning potential. I've more to say in a second. I've discovered the secret to help you rev up your metabolism and turn your body into a fat burning machine. Finally, someone with secrets. I don't mean to get personal, but I wonder how far my fist could move through this man's face. Before violating the laws of classical physics and leading to Einsteinian reactions causing the destruction of an entire city block. Behind him. I'm being a bit extra. Let's go to the video. Metabolism death foods are foods that act like toxins on your body and actually put your body into a flight response. Hey, you f***ed up your can-pitch idiot. Fighter flight responses typically lead to weight loss. The fighter flight response is characterized in almost everyone by a reduction in appetite and an increase in energy expenditure. You know, that's how that works. If you shock a rat with electricity and engage all the time, weight gains not the result. Weight gain generally comes from a lot of parasipathetic activity. A lot of just sitting on a couch and being really relaxed and throwing back cheetos. God damn it. This is all backwards. Oh, and it's Josh X, DC, who DC seems to be not also a real doctor. This is Dr. X. He since moved on after his clip recording to be a doctor in his own right in Scott to video guy will get to his ass at some point in his own stupid f*** video. Physician and nutritionist. I man. You know, and one of the scary things about it is a lot of these foods are actually labeled as being health foods by idiot real doctors. When in fact, they're the very same foods that are shutting down our metabolism. The first up, rest in peace metabolism. When we got the Hello Grave stones and there's a little skull on there, so adorable. It's kind of like a Dia de los Muertos. You know what I'm saying? Like, by the way, when bitches and Dia de los Muertos get that half the half skull painting shit, you know what it's all about that. It was something ladies. Just kidding, I'm married. But Jared Feather is not. So what's your problem with it? Well, you know, the problem that I have with whole grains. I don't care. God damn it. It's my job to care. Okay, I put on my care. Well, one big one is that these are empty calories. I'm sorry. What? What? Oh. Let's do some science. Empty calories is a shitty term. It was made up a while ago and it should have never been made up. But let me explain what the best intention of the term is. Empty calories are when you have a food that has calories in it. That is, it has protein or carbohydrate or fat. But it has a very few micronutrients in it. Per an any given amount of it that you eat. So very few vitamins, minerals, fatacamicals or fiber per how many calories that food has. So something like Laffy Taffy. Eat Laffy Taffy. Laff with your friends eating Taffy. Must understand simply. And it has carbohydrate. It has calories in it. But not really any vitamins or minerals or fatacamicals or fiber. Do you guys want to know a food group that's the opposite of empty calories? Whole grains. Oh, I got a shit. I just... Ready, place of those grains. Sprouted grains and coconut flour. If I told you that sprouted grains were a subcategory of whole grains, would you be mad at me? And coconut flour? Why lie on the subject? Coconut oil, which many of these people push this healthy, turns out to be in large quantities, not so great for your cardiovascular health. This is a double rock. We know the good news is you can have your grains and eat them too. You know, when you're looking at sprouted grains or doctor's, like, that's pretty funny. Man, man. So now your body's able to absorb all of those nutrients that support metabolism. And my favorite flour is coconut flour. It is a dieter's best friend. I'm going to kill myself. That's it. That's all I had to say. We know more than ever about why you're fat the deposits where it does. So here's the question for all you. Which new body type are you? Old body types. A knowing new body types. What up, girl? Hey, Max, the editor guy. Can you take that mean where it's the guy with the girl when he's looking at the other girls asked, but it's all the new body types? What? You know what I'm saying? Now we volunteer to stop as being the sugar type. You love sugar. I do. Yes. No, it's one sugar type. Oh, she should have love handles. When you have a lot of sugar, the insulin has to deal with it. And when you make more insulin, gets what it does. Alright, hold up. She's got her got big. Isn't that the stress type? She got some love handles, no, elicit ladies. Mass, not my place to say this, but... ...little love handle. My own. Who f*** best. I'm stressed too much. Otherwise you're the stress type. See? This has to store the sugar as fat. And it then very meticulously goes to certain parts of your body. In many cases, it'll become those love handles. Yeah. So to deal with it, you have to use sugary, low-ring techniques. Yes, sugary, low-ring techniques, Dr. Oz. Tell us more. This, my friends, is a mashed banana with two eggs. Okay, mashed banana is essentially all sugar. I don't know what's happening anymore. I'm confused in the world as becoming dark. Again, there's no flower. In the good? Yes. Who would have thought? Eggs and banana look at a pancake. And with this, you won't have the problem with the insulin. The other thing you can do is... The problem with the insulin? But nanos are literally made of f*** sugar. You idiot? How is this real life? So folks, when the child bearing years are progressing, you have a lot of estrogen, but you'll have strong PMS symptoms as well. There's everything bad about women. See, I air women. Tree have PMS too, right? She's like, uh, he's like, you hate it. She's like, yeah. And here's the stupid banana sandwich for you, bitch. I do. I have a very bad PMS, like, I get tired too. I'm tired and I want to overeat and not eat these foods that sit in here. I'm not a positive thing. We're all in with your body, Karen. I'm looking to find a shit. But I could see an argument for more estrogen for this girl. Where that ass though? But she's got something. A little white girl pancake back there. But more estrogen, not less. Yeah, no, they don't. Why would I put these foods here? These are vegetables, right? But that not just any vegetables. No, no, they're specific vegetables. What? Here's the big story. What you want to deal with the estrogen? You actually have to deal with the food jewelry, because they can help block the estrogen blockers. Use in the treatment of breast cancer that come with a variety of downsides. You see, estrogen is good for building strength, good for building muscle. It is excellent for maintaining a good mood day to day. It is vital for proper psychosexual function, and it helps your bones grow. And lastly, and very importantly, is cardio-protective. It actually increases the probability that your heart will continue to be healthy for years to come. Astrogen is good for you in almost every way. Astrogen blockers are taken in two circumstances. One, in the medical world, one, there's a tumor on your f***ed titties that is eating up estrogen and feeling in self-worth it. You got estrogen block to kill off that motherf***er. And two, if you're a bodybuilder, and you're using estrogen blockers in the last maybe week or so before your show to get the extra drying effect, it is not good for your health. It is profoundly bad for your health. The last thing in the world you want to do is block estrogen. Luckily, cruciferous vegetables do almost nothing to block estrogen. So the following will be a lie. Thank God. Look, I'm back here. You know, and the... Oh my God. Is this a... is this pre-arepost me too? What the f***? He can like grab people and like, hey man, take my hands, you know? Yeah. Broad died plans that were off-right. Like the day off died as an example. What I love... Scott, once the last time you were guest out of game show and the host was holding your hand while talking you through a list of non-starred Chee vegetables. F***. Because you can eat as much of this stuff as you want. All these great things, these progress is the bad bushes. There's no need to hold her hand anymore. Look at her face. Max, zoom in on her face. She's like, get the f*** off of me, God damn it. These are the cruciferous vegetables. And they very specifically seem to help us deal with estrogen levels. That was a lie, by the way. Just for those of you still tuned in. Whatever it is that you do in your life can be entirely selfish and help nobody else. It can be super selfless and help everyone but you. Amazing. Both types of people are awesome for society. Then there is another type of person who does things to benefit themselves at the expense of everybody else. Those are not good people. We should have a general degree of compassion and love for all living beings. And for them, we need to go, you get the compassion and love. What you're doing is a bad idea. You should probably stop. Doctors, all the f***er, you're in that third category. And if I ever see you in the street, I'll probably just look at your hair and go, wow, he's so beautiful. But there's an off chance, things could get quite confrontational, verbally of course. I don't want to issue physical threats as I believe that's illegal. But if we didn't have any laws, ooh, it's sort of f***ing good. Scott, you made a guy cute up more bullshit doctors for us to have this rate. I'm officially upset. I've been Dr. Mike, I rate Dr. Oz as an asshole out of 10C guys next time. Yes, you're not right there. I've got a quick YouTube thing she liked it and we think YouTube's usually correct about stuff.
