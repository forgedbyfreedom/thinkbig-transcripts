Oh yeah slow, trolled. You got it. Delt's a silt's. Yeah, that's good enough. And, Rack. Is it, though? I need to do that. Yeah, that was epic. YouTube, YouTube, YouTube. Guess what I have me today? I have YouTube, I have me be pros. Mmm. Not me. This guy, Chad Caudill, he's a men's physique, I have TV pro, which is fucking hilarious because he's enormous. I'm an open bodybuilder, but I ain't shit. Jared Feather is a classic physique pro. Jared quickly hit a classic post to remind them. Boom, you see how classic that was? Can you do a men's physique post real quick? Oh yeah, it's a cool thing. It's all my business. Oh no. Last time Chad was here, you guys saw him on the channel. We annihilated Justin, try a substance. He even hit him by a substance to this time. Actually, on his way out, he was like, back. And we were like, well yeah, didn't get enough. Scheduled a men for some reason. You came back. A lot of people, not so interested in coming back after the workouts. Chad is the fucking man. He's back here. We're going to do back. I texted him earlier today. It was like, hey, do you want a thickness priority workout? We're a width priority. He said, thickness. Thickness is in. Let's get to it. Just got the bar. Big chest at the bottom. So a lot of people will do them right, but then they'll kind of go like this at the bottom. Big chest that we're really just key spine is curved a little bit. Upper back. So here. So enable. You touch the tummy every time. Full stretch to touch the ground every time. But you're back never moves. Okay. Zero-eating zero-howing, too. Zero-eating zero-howing. Zero-howing. Don't do it. Don't hoe. You can even, don't hoe. So before you pick it up, let me know when you're ready to pick it up. And I'll give you some more cues. Ready? Yep. So before you pick it up, don't pick it up. Just lift your chest up, arch your back. More. More. More. Now. Just in that position, touch the tummy. Yes. Touch it. You don't have to pause. Touch gently through the tummy. No pause. Touch. And down to control. Control the center. Slow. Great. Control. Gentle touch the bottom. Yeah. Good low back with straight man. That's perfect. Yep. Control that last bit of range of motion, too. All the way down. Gentle touch. You're good in one more. Slow and rack. That's it. That was a great man. Very good. A little different. Dr. Mike, I can't get a big back. What do I do? Barbell Batrail. For the last one. For the last one. For the lats. For the lats. Let's take it away. If you want to roll for the lats, here's how you do it. Pick the shit up. Make sure it sticks in alignment. No deck, no problem. Barbell Batra Rose sets a 10 to 20. Maybe even 15 to 20 reps here for Chad. Probably about four sets. He's just learning a technique. The super crazy super rom technique. For the first time, you guys see the mouth deficit. He's a fucking killer though. He's got a downpat. It's going to be a total back. An isolation. That gives us the overall mass of thickness stimulus. Me need why. Because the row hits the middle traps, lower traps, rhombines. Terror's major lats. Final directors. There is actually not a part of the bass that the rose doesn't hit. Or what else? Even the rear delts. Those rear delts that you're like, how do I grow them? We're just on good terms with the rear delts. I do rear delts. I do rear delts. We've got all of my pulling. We've got all of my pulling. Makes where we're at. I'll take one of my best. Chest. Two. Chest up. Three keep going. Fuck it. I'm going keep going. Keep going. And no bullshit either. You know they're good. Next time, when you hit your last wrap, slow it. If you can do another one, even a little extra. Let the eccentric fuck you up on last time and then just let go. Beautiful. Full stretch around forward. Ready to stay in the heels. Yes. Or come out. There you go. Here come one. Two more. Let's go. Big chest. One more. Big chest. A string of stretch. Good. Oh. Slow and perfect. Woo. You get that question mark face like what the fuck? I'm gonna do it. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna let everybody. We were also a couple of years ago. Yeah. It's kind of cool though, right? Because when you do that roast typically people are like at even four plates. No, you don't. Get out of here. Yeah. How much do you weigh right now? Two 60. Two 60. We're rolling. Listen up. Two 60. I FBB Pro. 260 pound. That's physical competitor. Doing 135 pounds on deficit roll for sets of 10 to. For sets of 15 to 20. Get in the fucked up. A little bitch. Damn. Damn. I mean, I didn't go on salt. I mean, I didn't go on salt. Delete this part off camera. I can't see GIME more weights on that. I can't be seen like this. That's the foam weight there on here. Just up at the bottom. Yes. Feel your shit stretching out like that. Boom. More. One more. We just, we just, we just. That's it slow, slow. And. And that roast is the easiest and most unequivalent thing ever. Yep. We're done. Almost worse than like straight like a delifts. Walsh. I hate those. All right. Ready for the next workout? You do this. You're going to need this again. Come to the swing. I want you to pause at the very fucking top for a split second. Pause. And then go just like that every single time. And you're going to notice that that pause burns, living fuck out of your back towards the higher reps. Crunch. Yes. And then a big full stretch with it. There you go. Yep. Every time it has to hit the bottom. Chattley touched the bottom. And up. And then down. And relax. That's it. Four sets of bottle of out rows down the hatch. Amazing. Chad super pumped. But now we take the directors at least the lower directors out of play by sitting down in a machine. The prime row, which I love. The prime row is actually leveraged. One of the ways you can use it. It's a super crazy psycho stretch at the bottom. And then make the top nice and easy. You get the awesome peak contraction. And a big stretch. It tends to hit the middle upper back. A ton of rhomboids. All the muscular chair around there. It's going to be beautiful. Again, we're going to be doing sets of 10 to 20 reps. Typically results in a really good set far to the back. You guys are going to see we're going to be a big focus on the super stretch. And a big focus on a one second pause at the top with the chest up. He will be rounding his back at the bottom. Arching his back at the top. Why do that, Dr. Mike? Because your back does that. And against resistance, your back grows. Stretch just over deep. Yes, two. Three. That's one. Make it good. Four, hold, slow, slow, stretch. Back. Good chest. There you go. Square can feel your back growing from all the way to the muscle. Beautiful, it's just like that. Or just. There's a big chest. Three more. One. Over. Let's go. Two. Stretch. Fuck yeah, slow, deep gentle. You're fucking out. This knee pads are awesome. You like that, you're just like fucking sets you right in. Yeah, go anywhere. Usually, like this. Oh, it's all I was doing. Yeah. That really looks like this machine. Take that Jared Jared Pizza. I think I really like this one. Three more. One. Two. Three. Down. Do not unstrap, strap and harder. Strap in. Take it a little way off. When you're strapped, do four more reps. Oh. Good. Yep. Two more. Go. Slow. Gentle. One last one. Now, it's wrapped. Straight. Strap in. Super lightweight. No pause at the top. Just going to do ten. Ten straight. Slow, eccentric. One tiny fraction of a second at the top. And then go, go, go. A little bit of fun at the last set. Hit it. Boom. Slow. Two down. Three. Seven. You're right. Chest at the bottom. Yeah. Eight. Yes. Two more. Nine. One last one. Big stretch. Ten. That's it. That was dirty. That was nasty. I'm not sure. Good stuff. Good stuff. We'll be back here. What a test for Mark. You know, why don't we do deal with choice or Jared's choice? What do we think? I feel you pros. Seems like some of these techniques are kind of new. We're getting it down with a regular bar choice mark. That's true. Just pull downs. I don't know how to do this super well. Jared will take over as coach. Yes. How do you reach this? I'm not just I stand on the thing. Why you look at me ask me how I reach it. I'm not too much. I'm at least your height. I got right on the ground and bend. Really come forward. Yep. And I'll stretch you up completely. You should feel this tear apart. Keep going. Like basically smack. Fucking neck when you don't. And then down like this. And all the other chest. Yeah. That's why I didn't grab a little closer. It's gonna be hard to set your chest there. You try. All the way up. Let us stretch you forward and up. Four sets of bent rows. Four sets of prime machine rows. Now we're probably going to do three sets of lap pole downs. Three sets is fewer than four of course. Definitely fewer than eight than we spent rowing. And it's at the end of the workout. So it's less efficacious. But that is the nature of a thickness or horizontal emphasis back workout. Which this is. You can't emphasize everything. It's got to be one of the other. So we say, well, why does the view more pole downs? Well, that's for another time. It has to work out. Maybe a workout later on of the week. Maybe another different. That's a cycle of ways. I'm emphasizing with to be eight. She's wide as fuck. So I might not need to happen for a while. And yeah, just three sets of pole downs. Ten to twenty reps each time coach Jared. Here's gonna. Gonna be giving the cues because. Pull down to me is just another opportunity to express my bad assory as fucking wild animal brother. I can't be cageed. You do this fucking bullshit. Bullshit bullroom technique. Out of our pee. Out of a rum. Bunk all y'all. Come on baby. Get it. Anyway, let's do some work. Just up. Just up. Just up. There it is. Don't stop that shut. I'm pulling you for like a full second. There you go. Perfect. Yes. Good. Good. That's it. What's your. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Ouch. Yeah. I got on my own a stretch and my body won't let me stretch the high. It's like fucks over here. This hurts. Good. Good shit man. I think. All the way all the way. Yes. There you go. Me and forward. That's fucking full. Yes. Yeah. Extratch. There you go. That was a perfect breath. Oh fuck yeah. And shit man. All day. I told that last bit of the emotion. Full stretch. Pull you a little. Pull you. There you go. There you go. You got the more. You got the stretch. They just come on. Only big chest. It's just the bar. powerful. That's one. It's just. Just. Just up. That's your slow stretch. Rack. That's it. Very good. Very good. I have some water. I have a seat. Yeah. We'll be on our last exercise. Scott, can I move your. Can I move your Gandalf staff? You shall not film without a thing to put your camera on to do this. That's what this is for. You guys didn't know. You boys in Hollywood. Last exercise for the day. It's back thickness and stuff. But Chad wanted to build. It's tough because you can never have to build. It's for men's physique. Super on laterals. Of course. Myorups. Of course. So we're going to do myorup match. We're going to let him do a single set. Very close to failure. And whatever rups he gets on that for the next three sets after that. Or sets total. He's going to have to match that first sets reps. No matter how many mini sets it takes with three to five seconds. Rakes in between. Full range of motion. Super control in the bottom. Out. Let's do it. Start down here. With zero momentum only with your shoulders. Albo's relatively straight or completely straight. Do you lose choice? Come all the way up as high as you can. And then slow it on the way down. The temptation is to come up control. And then kind of let it go like this. Come up under control. And then slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow. And backup. Technique is number one. The first thing that's going to try to go on you is this is going to start to get fast. We're going to yell at you for you not to do that. Control the eccentric. Cool. Let's get it done. Oh, you got to come on. Four more. Let's go one slow. Two slow. Two slow. Two slow. Two slow. Two slow. Two slow. Two slow. Two slow. No woman. Delta. There you go. Three slow. One more. We got a call man. You got it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go slow slow slow. Good. Good stuff. Chad, did you get a count on that? 21. I think four more was that was that 15. Okay. Somewhere around there. So it's in 19. I know. I know. 21. Let's call it 20 or 21. 20. 21. 21. 21. 23 sets of 20. All right. But you get a three to five second rest break as many times as you need to take it in each one of those sets to just get to 20. Okay. One more. Off slow. Raph. Jesus. Punching ocean of the top. Say what? Sadja was going to be taught. What? We're doing this a while. You're like a doctor. It gave me a cold degree and everything. That was a mistake. How's your back in? I'm going to get 12 for you. Yeah. And let's do five. Oh. Great control. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Four. Up. Up. Up. Up. Go, go, go, go, go. Slow. Raph. Three. Take a five to ten seconds and it will be last three. Then two more sets of 20 of course. Three to be all day. Control just. She's the delts. Delts are right there. Yes. One more. Perfect. Slow. Raph. Come on. Ready? I'm not feeling well. You're laying in shame. Come on, Branch. Come on, Branch. What's up with your forearms, bro? As far as? Look, the veins. Oh, this. You ever see some show like that? Oh, wow. Once every couple of years. Yeah. Once every couple of years. When I'm in prep. Yeah. Up and more. Up and more. Up and more. Yes. Slow. Slow. One more. Get it together. Pappa, pappa, pappa. Slow. Raph. Oh, that's 12. So, 12. 12. 13. It's shut. Fuck. I'm in back. Go, go, slow. It's good. Raph. Oh, I three left. Did your fucking killing this is awesome. One. Great control. Two. I'm right out. Let's go. Get him. Pappa, pappa, pappa. Yes. Oh, yeah. Raph. Base forward. Completely straight arms. Again, squeeze. Slow. Up. Slow. Up. Slow. Up. Again. This last one I want you to hold it at the very top until I say, up. Come on, man. Hold. Hold. Go. Hold. Hold. Resist. Resist. Resist. Resist. All set. I'm not sure. Jesus. That's a fun one. Hey, thank you. Of course. Oddly, enough. Thank you. I would make the prayer hands. What a can of my arms. This is good. Let's get it. Dude, good stuff.
