One more Marvin, let's go. I wasn't forced to many, many, many, many. And in down slow, down slow, down slow. What up, RPG YouTube? I'm here with Marvin, my client from Hong Kong. Today we are going to be doing a barbell only, lateral delts, and bicep session. Trying to bring you guys some limited equipment sessions that we're doing for the YouTube channel. So today is going to be one that you can really fry your lateral delts, and your bicep swith, just with the barbell. It's going to be a lot of fun, fun, I say, insert Marvin's agonizing face here. And yeah, we're going to hop to bicep's first lateral delts after that, and then Marvin's and doom, your pain, your pain, it's coming. The agity. Let's get it. Bicep's up real quick. Bicep's up real quick. You've seen it a million times on YouTube channel, probably on Instagram social media, whatever. The bicep has helped. And glino-humor-old joint action, including forward flexion. This is literally shortening your bicep more. So when you see people in the internet talking about how you need to keep your elbows back, you need to stay here at 90 degrees. It's all based on people thinking that force production is the only thing that matters, to satient-vintagent position to training, don't matter, etc. When you combine the action to that forward flexion to the go on, you can more joint, and you create a little bit of tension here, in-world on the bicep. You are shortening the hell out of this head of your bicep. And you are not taking any tension off at the top. I understand what people are saying when I say tension off of the bicep, if you go like this, because their elbows are here. It's hard for me to contract my bicep too. The second you have that forward flexion at the glino-humor-old joint, and you're pushing your elbows in, you're contracting the hell out of your bicep. So that just limits the load you can use. Notice she was really curling super well before I gave him a couple of cues, and then how hard it looked for him to do that. People don't like to limit the load on the exercise. When you curl with your elbows at your side, had 90 degrees, it's easy as fuck to use like 90 degrees. To use like 95 pounds, 135 pounds, or something like me. But I don't give a shit about the weight on the bar, and you guys really shouldn't either. We want a good stimulus to the bicep who want full-moving unit recruitment to the biceps, and that's done by going through a full range of motion, including all actions of that particular muscle, including, again, for flexion at the glino-humor-old joint. This is okay. It's shortens the bicep fully. So hopefully you can get that into people's heads. It's definitely fine to do this. If you find it discomfort in that movement anywhere, at the shoulder, at the bicep, maybe you have some nagging elbow injuries, fuck yeah, do a drag curl for elbow injuries. I noticed when I keep my elbows back a little more, it helps quite a bit. If you just want to add it in for variation purposes, totally fine too. But doing a curl like this, there's no dogma, you don't have to, but don't shit talk it. It's definitely fine, and it actually recruits a lot more motorion to three biceps. I think that's where all this comes from. It's hard. When things are hard, we notice more than likely. There are a shit load of excuses, and you can come up with many scientific excuses, or as many brooks, excuses as you want. But I just, I know, it's hard. You want to find an excuse to load up a bunch of weight. So you do. You try to find whatever excuse you can. So just keep that in mind with the cypavicep curl. You don't have to do it, but try it out, man. It's really good. It's really fun, and it hurts really bad. Like you can't have noticed, watch from Marvin does this. That was it. That was in. Now slow with your elbows in. Down slow with your elbows in. And right back up. A little stretch, Marvin. A little stretch, Marvin. And up. That was in. That was in. That was in. That was in. That was in. So again, notice, these are absolutely fucking painful. So we're a lot of people tend to do what the East Center on these. And this is why people also say that tension gets taken away from the bicep. It's a loser shoulders forward. You want to keep those shoulders back so you can really stretch the bicep. So when it gets hard, you're going to notice he's going to want to do this because it's literally taking tension away. You move like this. You are taking to something bicep. You want them here. Which is why it's very odd to me that people say when they're here, you're taking tension off because it's actually more. So when you move your shoulder forward, that's less tension. So he's going to be going like this to try to get away from that pain. But I really want him to slow or slowly from right here to stretch the hell out of that bicep. And then instead of resting a long time down here and swinging, I'm trying to get him to, I'm killing him to really come right back up. Once you get that full stretch, full stretch, right back up with the Melva's in. It sucks. And it's true, quarter-quick constant tension. Especially here at the top and especially here at the bottom with your shoulder back. It's pump ready. Yeah. Marvin, this might be a little heavy, but we're going to use this weight again. Okay. Well, you might get like six reps on your first, you know, five minutes a day. So it's like 15 kg. Mm-hmm. But look like shit now. I like this. So like this. And almost four, how was four? And like this. Oh, that was not a four-up. All the way down, Marvin. Over you down. Oh, that was nice. Yep, up, up. Which you're finding is almost into. That's all. Up. Yes, exactly. Do you? That's all. Got it. Up. Got it. Oh. That's all. Let's get one more just like that. Up. That was all. That's all. That's all. Rack. Whoa. Shake it out. Shake it out. Shake it out. I'll take some weight off. Hold on. I'll see you there. See you there. I'll go down front. I'll make full stretch, Marvin. No bullshit, Abs. Full stretch. All right, yeah. Back up. I'll go in. I'll go in. I'll go in. I'll go in. I'll go in. Oh. Oh. Oh, I'll go in. Yeah. I'll go in. Oh. Yep. Good, Marvin. I'll go in. Good. I'll go in. I'll go in. I'll go in. All right. All right. Squeeze. I'll go in. Pass. Squeeze. Squeeze. And then then then then then then then then down. So. You'll put it down for a couple seconds. Huh. Big out. Shake it out. So you're up. Two more. You've got to go away. Two more. Okay. Straight. Straight on first. Straight on first. Up. Down. So. Ableton. Keep. Ableton. Okay. In. In. In. Down slow, down slow, down slow. Good. Wow. Let's go. It's kind of turning to do a try, Zaff. So I did say two by set exercises. We're already at the bar as you can see. So we're probably going to do an exercise that we've never done on the channel before. And to be honest, this is something that like, if you're someone with nagging elbow injuries, how I talked about earlier, a drag curl isn't that bad of an exercise. Anytime that I've had some sort of tend to elbow going on, that become a lie, I've definitely taken more of a to the side approach or behind the body approach with a drag curl. I'm going to have Marvin do a couple sets of 15 to 20 drag curls, getting the bar as high as possible and that drag curl. There's maybe a couple things that we can give you technique wise and you've never heard about a drag curl to hit the bicep a little better. So we might put the tins back on and I'm going to have them more up at the bar and we'll see how you like these. So two sets of 15 to 20 for drag curls with very short rest periods. Now back to the normal technique, I want you to use just your arms. So curl. Yep, just your arms. Go ahead. I'll use squeeze. I wasn't. Oh, good. Yep, squeeze hard. Downslow. All the down, squeeze hard. That was in. Squeeze hard, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, up. Come on. Downslow. Let's go Marvin. Good. Downslow. Up. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Keep going. Now resist. Resist me. Downslow. Downslow. Downslow. Downslow. Downslow. Oh, yeah. Oh, try. I tried. I tried. Can you imagine week four like this? You bet lost. Oh yeah. People always say, I don't need the load. I say, you don't train hard enough. How could you not? How could you not have the load? Every week four. The body usually deludes for them. So what happens to those types of people? It's like, I don't need the load. And then they're lower bodies injured. They have a bad knee or something. So then they take their leg training volume goes down. Or they're still trying to train really fucking hard to upper body. And then something happens to the upper body when they're leg heals. And then they're training hard for the lower body. So they have like these weird intermittent deludes periodically. Because their bodies, like, you're fucking deluding. So. Okay. That's a bad delo though. Exactly. A pain-pillity low. Yeah. Autoregulated delodes are much better. Yes. So the way I like to structure PM sessions, which is what this is for Marvin, is two in one. Because I train my ladder with lots of biceps, three to four times a week. So today we're doing two bicep exercises, or even who was just one bicep exercise, but it was top and down sets. I count that as two different exercises technically. So we did the biceps. Now we're going to do one intensity technique for his lateral delts. I'm going to put them through a very short, rest period, giant set for a slightly bit forward upright rose. I'm going to really smash the lateral delts. Yes. The upper rose is going to hit the lateral delts very well. And probably going to do about 50 reps. So let's warm it up and see what you're going to use. All right. If at the hips slightly lean forward like this, I'll pull the elbows full high. His highest posture, Marvin. I want you to really get it up there. Look here. Yeah. 50 reps of this shed. You feel ready? Yeah, I'm ready. You feel like your forearms are bicep. We'll be the limiting factor in the sound. Tid it there for your personal trainer's future clients. A couple of factors to know if they're ready for the next exercise or the next set. I'm asking him about assisting musculature. So I said, do you think that your forearms or your biceps will be the limiting factor in their set over your lateral delts? And he said, no, he said, I feel pretty good to go. I think my lateral delts will take most of the stimulus. That's good. I'm just going to get to the top. Don't lean forward too much right there. Good. Just slightly lean forward. Good. Good. Good. Right. Good. That 14, please. 14. When I come to ask one. Good. Good. Breck. No. It's 28. 21. 21. Oh, shit. You can stand upright. Leading forward. Up right, real? Yeah. Limits the load. Yeah. Because it's a lot harder in a more disadvantage position. Pretty good for lateral delts. Up right goes. Our little easier and the more mechanically advantageous. Just go to the regular upright row. Okay. So we can finish off the 50 reps. So let's go. I don't think you're getting 50. We keep doing it forward. I'm just going to use your hips. One more. Good. Rack. Ah, fuck. It's getting harder and harder. So actually Marvin, let's give us a minute you can here. One of the tank. And then we're just going to use your arms. Okay. Let's finish it off. All right. Cool. Up. Come on. Up. High. One, two more. One, two more. Let's go. Don't swing. Don't swing. Don't swing. Try to use the delts here. That's good. Good. Put it down. Arms. Arms on. Yep. Five more. One. Two beautiful easy and tricks man. Good stuff. Three. Four. Last one. We're going to use the top one. You're going to hold and squeeze. Hold. Squeeze. Elbows high. Elbows high. Elbows high. Squeeze. Squeeze. Hard. Squeeze. Mark. Good. Wow. Ah. Fuck. Good job man. Thank you man. How was that? Painful. You got nice pumping your delts? Oh yeah. Good shit. I mean, I wish my delts always this pump on time. Oh wow. Well people. There you have it. Hopefully I gave you some good tips tricks. Coaching cues. All that fun shit. And maybe we'll make a believer out of you yet that these exercises are really good for training the biceps and the lateral delts. Marlin, how do you feel? I feel awful. We can't stop touching this also. I see. That's a good. Awesome. Awesome and awful. Yes. That's kind of how I described it yesterday. Ah. Yes. Yeah. Good man. You did a great job. Thank you. Lots of effort. Thank you coach. Absolutely man. Thank you.
