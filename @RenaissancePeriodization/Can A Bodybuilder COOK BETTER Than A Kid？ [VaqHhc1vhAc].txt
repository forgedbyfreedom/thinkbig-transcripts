I feel like you have corrupted my shoulder. Hey folks, it's me Dr. Mike for YouTube and it's RPs Head Chef Mrs. Lori Shaw. And her two lovely children, Zach and Emma respectively, and they are going to compete with me in a cooking competition to see who can make mystery food. I haven't been informed about yet. Why are the kids here? Well, I've defeated every single other chef in combat, the man and the women in just like in a Trishon warfare. Eventually, they give the kids a K-47 in the send them into combat. These kids are getting a spoon and spatula respectively, but it's a start. Shall we do battle? Folks? We're going to wipe the floor with you. We're going to be you. We've seen your videos. Well, they're confident. They're very confident. I can't wait to see this. Oh, I think hands down they're going to win. Okay, to quote Michael Jackson, the cheetah's not my son. Let's get to the cooking. I know we're cheating on the... Yeah, you can't be cheating on them. Yeah, you're up first. It's a very simple recipe. The last time I followed a recipe was also to make cookies like we are today. And it was with my grandmother in 1992. 350 oven, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. I did take pity on you and do that for you. This is a good news because I don't know what parchment paper is. So, it's digital interface. Nice. Oh, there's an analog section. So I hope this could think of that turns. Great. And then we don't want clean. We want 350. And I know how to turn a knob. I think. So who made this? This is a little bit of... Okay. As an Iraqi. Okay. For all of us. All of us well. Combined banana through oats. Stir in raisins. Combined is oddly non-specific. Oh, there's a... A mouse. I think God. Two large ripe bananas mashed. Oh, why not? I'll use your teeth. Looks at banana. Examin's audience. Dumped banana and what's saying anything. Dumped and so... You guys should rewatch this video when you grow up. It'll be a lot of fun. Okay. Through oats. Through with, through with. I can do this. You have a plethora of... Don't... Don't consent to me. Glory. I've had enough. Ha ha ha. Ha ha. Nice. Good. Large. The cookies not a science. Forget these numbers. Stir in raisins, but how many? We look up the raisins. And algorithmically, we determine that there are 20 malimet carbs. Wait, no. One quarter cup. So you're all the way at the raisins stage. Correct? But a good, right? He's really big on the even sprinkle. It's looking really good. And we're done. Winana, raisin, that cookies are whatever. No, no, that's not. It looks tasty and appealing. Look at oat coated banana. It's the way what you've made. Winna and Douh, move robotically. I say tie dance. That's how I made some print cookies. I'm not like married a butter girl who does this. This is tough. I'm tired. You don't feel free. Who is still here? Oh my god. It's still happening. Why is it done yet? Ugh. It needs to be here. Other than I was going to say that. There's some combination of this as far as I'm going with this. I just want to say, please put me out of our misery. Mix thoroughly, drop by even scoops on your prepared pan. I don't know what these devices are. They're the every- Look like they're. Everything's there that you need. But it's totally even like. Hey, Zach. More of your advice is so needed. So that all that just makes four cookies? That is a good and interesting point, Emma. Four big cookies. OK, problem. I noticed there are a lot of other ingredients. I have a mess with you. I can fix that. I forgot a few ingredients, but I'll fix it. Watch. See you first. Is the pan hot? No. There's a problem. There are three levels to this oven and it doesn't see which level. So chalk that up against the book on specific. In it goes. People actually do this. Isn't there a factory where cookies come from? I forgot that cinnamon, vanilla and salt exist. Bad news. But it's not something I can't fix. It says later to put the jam into the cookies and little doll up in the middle. But didn't say that it couldn't be a little bit more cinnamon. A usual jam. Salt goes in. Oh, this smells so bad. Oh, let me smell it. These are all. All right, now we clear the way for the children. Let's wipe the floor. No. Two large, right, right, bananas, mass. So start using the instructions Emma. Where's the parchment paper? See, seesack. Are you getting frustrated and how it could be done faster? I'm fully know I'm not. Because I'm a patient guy. Unlike you and my dad. You're a little dad. Slip the oven up for us. See? Almost impossible. Move it. You're on my side. Emma, don't you feel like Zack's taking a little too much credit for his cookies? Yes, I'm here. I think it's time for you to shop. Careful. Are you sure you want to use that? You don't need to use another bowl. You all go in the same bowl. Maybe you made a mistake. Maybe you made a mistake. Maybe I'm a set of them. Maybe I chose. I'm maybe like this. Right, maybe I don't need you. Hi. Wait, wait, wait. Put on. Did we get everything? Yes. Salt, vanilla, cinnamon, and oats. Is it the pouring? Or is it the dip? It's the pouring. Mix thoroughly. Hey, don't go crazy. I feel like you have corrupted my shoulder. Then you just have one more. Okay. Uh, we don't know. Right on time. Go ahead and finish you guys' eyes. Ah! Did you fall the instructions? Yeah, he's ready. I don't need the instructions anymore. I have memorized them and Samarlee improved them. And I'm done. And the kids go to the oven. I didn't mean that literally. I didn't mean that. All right. I think we got it. Am I a little say? I once saw a monkey at a zoo, tried to repair a television set. And it was doing a significantly better job than you are at whatever does that you're trying to do. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh, Emma. No. Evidence. It's delicious. I am very disappointed in you. The instructions clearly say, Chicken-Bine banana. Threw oats. Which means you start a banana. And you go down the list of ingredients. Adding everything in until you get to the oats. So that seems self-explanatory. I don't know why you would see a list of ingredients in a assume that they don't have a place in the recipes. So that was surprising. And then what else? You made giant divots and in your cookies. Well, you only made four cookies. Four big cookies. Which instead of 12. Oh, it's the recipe for the first one. Do you want seven Honda Civics or four Lamborghinis? So I mean, honestly, really are you destroying art because you hate why don't you just try one of the cookies, chef and see which one tastes good and which one tastes terrible? Yes, you can. Yeah. These are delicious. OK. So it says you. Even though I'm afraid to, I am going to try this. God, it's so moist. And juicy. And really, really. That's all. Oh. Better, I'll be taste so good. Oh, no, no, no, try it. Don't try it. Try it. It's great. That's pretty, you'll ever have. So awful. Oh, it's so salty. It's so sweet. I just want you to taste this and see what you've done. Oh, fudge muffin. Who the fudge made these fudge in things? Ew, it's terrible. Fudge. Thank you so much for making this amazing recipe. Look, the book of recipes. OK. For sale on a website. So if you like me having more Lamborghinis, please buy a recipe book. We have many of them. All kinds of delicious ideas. TVH is a whole thing to look like if I wasn't mentally unwell, it would take like two minutes to make. So it's awesome. And as far as who won the challenge, I think on taste, texture, appearance, and generally being a good cookie, kids won for sure. Yay! That's all. Yes, yes, yes. All your just desserts. Thank you so much, guys. Thank you so much. We grew up this video. We'd be much more funnier, much less fun into depending on which way your life is exact. I'll see you guys next time.
