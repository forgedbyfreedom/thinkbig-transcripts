No bullshit. We get a rest after this. Let's go to the bottom. Slow control control. We'll get a pain. We'll get you. We'll get you. We'll get you. We'll get you. Up. I'm. Hey guys. Dr. Mike for unsancededization. And I'm sure glad Jared Father, AFB Pro is okay. Because near minutes ago, Jen Aguirre, our superstar now AFB Pro. Congratulations AFB. She physically lifted Jared up Darth Vader style. He was hanging on to Dear Life by his neck. And she's like, bring Dr. Mike and Scott the video over here to film a proper quad training session. Or else, when Jared was a group. And I think I made out that he was like, yes, and he texted us. We flew right over the Derizurable take some time, but we got here. And now we're here to smash Jen's quads. Jared and he revenge fantasies here for you. Yeah. What was the pull? You might throw up. Yeah. We'll see what happens. No promises. You feel good? Yeah. A fun thing to cut back to. Let's get to it. We are going to warm Jen up. And then we are going to get to doing probably three or four mile rep sets of hack spots. We're going to be slowly descending. We're going to be pausing at the bottom. And we're going to probably start the first set in around 10 to 15. Rest a few seconds. Hit it again two more times. That's one set. We're going to do three or four like that. I don't think Jen has ever done this with us. She's had it quads once at the end of a glute workout. Let's hit the great news. It's got the video guy. It gets past muscle. One more. Come on. Go. Control. Control it too. Slow. Power. Oh. Oh. Beautiful. This device has three purposes. The first purpose is for when you don't have blocks to put down on a hack spot to make an inappropriate range of motion. Thanks, my god. Unless you guys are doing great work. Just kidding. It's a great machine, but there'd be a lower. Or I guess we could be taller. In any case. One thing we can do over doing Jen today. This is Permister Jan Feather. We put this here and her shoulders push into this. It's nice and solid. It's comfortable enough for the next. Seems to work. It stays a range of motion by about four or five inches, whatever that is. I'm not used to measurements that large amount of personal life. The other thing you use is for. I think is to pick it up and to look at your friends and go, hey, you know, you just do. And the last thing, a minimum kind of like a third-hand design element. It wasn't even really designed for this. It's something to do with yoga. Something with yoga. But I'm not sure what. In any case, hack squats. It's a Christian option. Knees bullshit anymore. I'm pushing up my knees. I've seen it in almost every leg video. You never. Don't shoot. I'm a person. Fucking video up right now. Go ahead, pull it up. We're friends. I'm here in the last one that I was with. Oh, you guys. I just want to know what they're doing now. Slow. Big pause. Up. Rest. Breathe. Breathe. Nobody said, rack. We're resting. Yeah. I think you're going. There are a few ways that you can actually increase range of motion without using something like that because it does seem a little unstable. Yoga blocks, we're looking for those. There's a little yoga blocks. Or you can stack plates or blocks on the foot part. And that'll increase range of motion too. This works for us today. But the yoga blocks might be a little better. You put them on each shoulder up against this thing. You can even tie them around. Or the foot. At Mike's gym, you guys have seen. He has like actual pads and he can place there and kind of tape around. So this works though. This is good. We can slow. Control. Control. Up. One more. No. Go. Control. Control it at you. Slow. Slow. Up. Power. Rack. Oh. Oh. Beautiful. Oh. That's suck. That was amazing. Good. Good. That was all giant. Literally how I recounted my last sexual experience to the word. The socks was amazing. My mouth was dry. It's good when it's dry, right? Oh, I do want to be with you. You're not ready. So relax, yeah. Just breathe it out. Gen is a woman of fury and valor. And this is a sword, by the way. And she says she's ready right away. But we noticed that she is still breathing quite heavily, which tells us that her cardiovascular abilities will limit her abilities in the next set, which means she's not ready. We have to make sure she's fresh enough in the target muscle to get at least five more reps. That she's already been for quite a while. Want to make sure the cardiovascular ability is not limiting. So breathing has to return roughly to normal. We have to make sure that she feels strong and ready to go. She already does. So that's a check mark. And also you have to make sure that the synergists are not limiting. Do you know about feeling okay and everything good? All right. So we check all the boxes when she breathes a little bit more normally, which is probably pretending she's doing now. She's going to have her mental aid soon. Then we'll get back to it. Low. Up. Stand up. Breathe. Breathe. Come. Come. Whenever you're ready to, there is no rush. There is no rush. There is no test. There is no evaluation. Nobody's judging you. You go with your own bit. Come ready. Let's do it. Hit it too. Slow. Slow. Yes. Deep. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Yes. That's it. Deep. Up. Stand up. Up. Up. Breathe. Rest. We'll do one more. You did amazing. You're going to finish up strong here. Okay. I'll let the pitch off the bottom. Okay. Get your feet lower a little bit. Get your feet lower. Not ready. Feet lower. All you. Slow. Begin. Hit it. Okay. Slow right here and all the way to the bottom. Slow. Slow. Lower. Lower. Up. Yes. Go. Up. You're a little funky there. Oh, we got one. We got a live one. Good. Stop. That was your message. Just one. I know. They'll feel huge. Just walk in the room. After she said. Z. She went. She had more than one friend. Oh, my God. She didn't good job. That lady had needs. What do you want to know? Oh, it's such. One more. Four sets of squats and. My. We talking about. What we got. Game over. Three sets of squats. I see the issue with this kind of stuff is when people aren't used to those and ranges approach like that and she has to be shaking. Yeah. That's a damn good time. She's just going to overreach up this very perturb. She, yes, she's not used to that at all. Yeah. So there's a lot of fucking damage and curing it. What? Do we just want to keep like give her bad. What the fuck. Right. Of the same. We're probably value. Usually, we're pretty good. You too. All right, so we're done here, yeah? Or one high reps that here. You want to do a higher reps that here? And then I wouldn't do four sets of squats. Yeah, okay, yeah, two or two to three. Yeah, okay. And that's how volume happens. All right, let's get this off and just a plate. If you guys have ever come back from a D-Load or a long off period, and you notice your technique during that time is really shaky and weird. Notice that she's a very well trained individual, clearly. But notice when she's getting into the hole and we're telling her to control that last part, I've seen her train. She doesn't normally go as deep as stuff. Or control the essence of that well. Notice how she's having that similar, oh, I'm new to this stimulus type of shaking going on. That's actually a physiological thing that occurs. And very essentially damaging exercises like straight leg deadless. Any other hip-nges, when you're not used to those deep stretches, you'll get those shakes. You guys have seen that happen. So if she was hack squatting her regular weight, which I've seen her do like 405, and she tried to get in that position, high chance of an injury. So if you guys want to mitigate injury, lower the load, really control that last part of the eccentric mic was talking about, and you'll probably be good to go, and then you could progress from there. So one, you're going to recruit way more motor units. You're going to have bigger quads and you're going to mitigate the risk of injury. So it's all around the lens. Up, up, Jen. Down. No bullshit. You get a rest after this. Let's go to the bottom. Slow control, control control. The pain is good. We will watch him change. Hold the tension. Hold the tension. Hold up. Yes. Stand up. Yes. Breathe. Rest. Two in your gun. Watch your knees. No bullshit. You're time to rest. Grab the bar. Let's go. Let's go. Slow. Each one quality. Slow right here. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow, slow. Slow. Breathe. Up, go. Go, go. Grab. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm going to do that. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That was good. Good job. Good job. I'm good. Okay. Oh, God. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna slow up. Jen, I would help you up, but it's better for YouTube if you try to do this. I'm just making a sound. Oh, I'm sorry. I've flowed, not in the nose there. We're gonna go do the regular squats. The... She's fine. Okay. Okay. Oh, fuck you. Fine, Jared. What is it like, while they're well-swalled? Yeah, fuck you. Yeah. I'm not moving until I can see him. What was that for, Seth? For Seth. Fuck you, that was like 900 sets. So, point to toes out. Just to tad more. And I'm gonna show your hips. So your knees should be in line with that toe. So, point to toe out. There's a tad more. There you go. I don't really keep your hips open. Can I help your lower back? Yeah. I'm really gonna keep your hips open. Can I help your lower back at the bottom? Now, she's doing squats. High bar squats with one of those elevation heel thingies. Really great technique. The focus here is to keep the chest up. So that when you're standing up and push through the chest, which really means you're pushing through the quads. If you start to push the chest down, you can get more leverage with your posterior chain. It's a lot of glutes. It's a great thing for lifting more weight, but not ideal for the best stimulus to fatigue ratio for the quads. And bonus round. These are quads are so pre-cooked. Really fully cooked. From the abs squats, she needs to use a minimum amount of weight here. Thus, the amount of loading through her back. The amount of stabilization you have to do is very small. 65 pounds. She's squatting. You know, two plates and stuff before the depth. This is the kind of squats that you do. Once your legs are already cooked, that means the stimulus of fatigue ratio on them is going to be unbelievable. It's all quads, all quads, all quads, essentially. She's so pre-cooked for half squats. This is the ultimate high SFR squat exercise for quads. You just don't need you a lot of it to really put that cherry on top. And the cherry, unfortunately, happens to be pain flavored. Chest up. Please, the corner. One blink of your chest. Up. Go. Slow. Yes. Get to get there, Jack. Good, you're no matter here. Chest up. Slow. Up. Quads, quads, quads, quads. Eight, two more. Good. Slow. Good chest. Good chest. You're just going to leave the quads. Up. There we go. There we go. You're good. Stay there. Hands up. This is the last set of the day. Descend slowly. As if hands forward like this. Slow. Pause. Up. Oh yeah. One more gen. Slow descent. Wait. Up. What? Up. Go. There's one more gen. One more gen. Stand up, gen. Stand up. You're a flettakelle. Descend. Slow. Slow. Slow. Watch. Don't you hear about that first? Up. That's it. Yep. That's it. That's it. Oh, amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Gen. Great job. When you failed, keeping it in the quads. Oh, yes. Most people know. Most people will modify their technique and then fuck me. You're the best last representative. I was amazing. You never compromise to check the first of all. This may be the most pathetic anyone's ever looked at the gym. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Do something about it. Fuck you. Do something. Go ahead. Take all of them. Okay. Shut up. I'm getting up. Okay. Oh my god. I'm in the first video we did with her. What she was like, I don't sit between such a thing. Why not? Because I just don't do that. I do. And then I set her a section. Okay. I can do this. Gen. That was a classic genogery level of effort. We expected nothing less. We got nothing less. You're amazing. You're a superhero. You're a superhero. Just because I want to make this out, you're even longer. She's living building the tablates. As she's standing here and she's really having a hard time. Like she's getting more and more active. Gas and burn the more we talk. So a gen. Kind of like hobbyzer into whatever energy you're using channel. Gen has her own YouTube. Go check her out. Check her out at Instagram. This is how real training works. Yeah. Gen. You've been amazing. We'll have you back soon for another muscle group. Thank you. All right. I'll be back soon. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.
