I was like damn he's really doing this. I'm gonna ask. I think he'll put up folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance periodizations. You guys know, I'm pretty big channel. I'm sort of important. I was like, I wasn't always like that. I had a little tiny channel coming up. We're trying to give love to the guys coming up in their own little way. It's not friend Jeff Nippard. He's trying to get a YouTube following going. So I brought him on the channel. And if you guys want to give him some love, this Jeff Nippard, just YouTube, it'll come up. Doesn't have a ton of followers yet. He's a really great guy. Life time drug free lifter. And just a good person. Thank you. And he trains in Canada with great weight north. And we've chatted about this just before we got started filming. But he would like to introduce this video by singing the Canadian National Anthem in its entirety. Jeff hit it. You started off. I'll do this. I'll do this. I got it. And that's what it up. Let's do chess and try some. Let's go. Exercise number one is going to be the Atlantis Incline machine press. You guys have seen it before on our channel. It's just dope. It's awesome. The Atlantis people knocked it out of the park. You do almost everything. We are going to be doing sets of, oh, some were 10 to 15, 8 and 15 repetitions. You're going to look for that slow eccentric troll. Deep pause with the chest lifted up. And then a nice athletic return to full range of motion. And let's go. Let's get to it. Oh, you don't have to do this crap. You say I do. Oh, geez. Okay. Well, I like to make sure folks warm up exactly as they want. Okay. I'm doing it, Jeff. Very well. We'll do the panted doctor Mike. The pants, if leg and bed lift. And you have to do the T-RxR. How many warm upsets are we doing? So I generally like to do about three. Okay. And they're just getting mentally heavier. And then I do first working set. How many working sets? Probably three or four. That's four working sets. So three or four warm upsets, three or four working sets. Okay. That sounds great. Okay. Yes. Again. Slope. Control. Hit it. Thumb. Go. Go, god damn you. Now slow is if you're going to do another one. Slow. Slow. Slow. Pause. Wait. Unload. Ooh. Nice. Yeah. That was a really good man. Man, I tend to find that that last wrap. If you just dump it, like it totally cooled. Yeah. But if you fucking let it go, it's like when your muscles are closest to failure. That last thing I forgot. Oh my god. It's like that actually. Yeah. Let's go, Mike. Go. Wow. Yeah. Ooh. You're right. I'm going to be. Ah. Good. Slow. Ah. These are flawless, dude. Again. Perfect. Big chest. Go. Go. I got one more. That's it. Let's do it. Slow and controlled. Big pause. Up. Move it. Just. And then as if another. Raise your chest. Go slow. Take a solid pause at the bottom. Unload. I've got that shit. Yeah. I've got that shit. I've got that shit. Yeah. I've got that shit. You know what? I just noticed the big chest queue. When I do that, you really feel the stretch. I was like, huh. I was like, huh. I was like, Mike's doing a powerlifting thing with the get their arch up. You know? I was like, oh, wait a minute. It's a button. It's a button. Yeah. It feels much slower than what I'm used to. I'll say that. Which I don't mind at all because it'll allow me to train a little bit lighter. Sure. And protect the. Sure. Sure. Sure. At least pain wise even more by going slower and simultaneously reducing to re-risk. Right. Yeah. It's kind of like we're winning on all sorts of. Sure. I'm well with you. I mean, you don't have many more rocks left to unturn with this machine here, right? So. You have to do something to keep it challenging for you. I am going to. I was at 240. I hit eight and then six. I'm going to do down sets, which my app has just been updated to do. So whatever you can buy it watching this video, it will do that. Down sets. And I'm going to go to 180. And hit that for another probably two sets. And then that'll be a good start. And we'll go to do some. Try some stuff crushing of the skull perhaps. Oh, Jeff. It's a hard word. I'm sorry. Yes, sir. Let's go. Good job. Oh, my God. That's really good. Thank you so much, Jeff. Oh, yeah. Hi. Hi. I'm going to put a little bit of that on the floor. Not sure. Not sure. Okay. So I went one plate later. Yes. So I should be able to get something in the range of. 11, maybe 12 with this. Big chest. Great. Keep going. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Yes. One more. Slow and controlled. Big stretch. Ah. Slow and controlled. One more. Good moves, Jeff. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Okay. Okay. Oh, oh. I was like, damn, he's really doing this. Oh, oh. It was awesome. Okay. I really did try. Everyone's not sure where to find. Really, really, really, really fine. Yes. And then people say, but you didn't really, really, really, really, really try. Yeah. I'm going through. Really. On YouTube. Five step time. Oh, hello. Hello. So, now. Good. Good. Good. All right. Good. All right. All right. We can learn. We can learn. Natural. I don't know if you've seen this before. Oh, they have a thing. It's so beautiful. Huh? They've got to come back. It's Italian. Yes. I have only ever done Smith Machine Scholars One's. And my life. So I might need some guidance on these soon. It will be twice. How is the biomechanics looking here? Looking like biomechanics. Get him in a little bit. Want at the bottom so don't let him flare. Yes. Sorry. I'll stop. I think you're too excited. I love the Smith Machine Scholars Russia. I like three way of scholarship. Also, but I got to say this for a patata. But not. The Smith Machine here is like unbelievable. And also it's very generous to strength because it's an unloaded Smith, which means the barways nothing. And, uh, G-Wiz. I'm going to be stall crushing a lot. And then steps first time doing this movement in a long time. So, can we work on some technique queues and tips? Let's get after it. Like that is mind boggling tries to strength. Thank you so much. Wow. See, I respect that man. Like I like it when big guys are also strong. As opposed to me. Well, some of the guys are like, how the fuck did you get that break? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, they're probably strong if they knew how to use their body better perhaps. Sure. But like the potential is there. It's just not realized. But in your case, it's obviously like a mediocre drug free power whatsoever before. So I do know how to like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Pull my body in a decent place. Who it? Go. Yes, two more. Slow and controlled. Big moves. Up. Up. One more Jeff. You got this. He's it up. Yes, I got this. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Oh, yeah. I'm going to do two downsets here at 135. Okay, and we'll do 95 for you. Okay. All right. Yeah. Some sense. Three. Very nice. Beautiful set. Very nice. I'm trying to decide if I want to like, if I want to JM press it almost or you're really skull crushing it, right? Like, the most choice. Yeah. So yeah, so it'll fun fact. The JM to skull crusher is a spectrum. It's not one lift or another. It's close grip. JM. The skull crusher to the face. It's all across your behind the neck. All right. It's all a spectrum. Okay. There's no wrong answers. It's just whatever. Because your joints feel okay. And you have a real good connection with your try. Okay. I'll tell you what I feel. I feel like I have a good good connection with my try. I feel a tendon stretch in a way. It doesn't hurt, but I'm just saying. Yeah. Okay. Two more. No more. I got more. Good. We did the troll it. Awesome. Go. Come on. What have you got? Slow. Up. Move. I'm not helping you. I got more. Oh yeah. How are you? Yeah. How are you? How are you? I'll go in. Yes. Big push. Go. Go. Go. Oh. Woo. Very good. Come on. Come on. Let's push it. Go there. Come on. Yeah. You fall. Nice. Very nice. Go on. Go. Yes. It's going to resist you. You're going to win. Move. I got one more. Okay. Yes. Slow. No. Okay. Yeah. Slow. Slow. Go. Go. Go. Okay. He's got two. Dude. My man. No shot. No shot. I'll kill him. Okay. Smaller. Smaller. Smaller. Smaller. I can't see you. I can't see you. I can't see you. Just one last one. Another. Did my last one? No. No. No. No. Another. Okay. Yes. Which is. Which is. Yes. Last exercise of the day. The prime chest press. It's adjustable as all prime machines are to various biases of loading from the deep stretch all the way to the contraction. And when you go with it. Well, we are scientists. We literally people. So we are going to go with the deep stretch bias here. And we're going to take your closer grip to kind of do both chest and triceps because we did chest first and triceps. Now it's a bit of both. This prime press I've actually never used up before is my first time. It's like sex is being had with my chest and triceps. Totally with. Not against my will. And it's amazing. And I love it. I think I'm in love. Like if I woke up next to the prime machine the next day. And it was like. Looking at me. I would look back into its eyes and be like, I think this is a thing. Power couple. So this is fucking sweet. And we're going to do sets of. Probably 10 to 15 15 to 20 reps something like that. Nice soul burn. You ready? Go. Slow. Go. Go. No. No. Less weight for the backside. Yeah. Man, just with those pauses, it just. It makes me so much harder. Yeah. Jeff, I got to say your triceps are unbelievably. Unbelievably impressive. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I kind of don't know what to do with myself when I'm around them. Let's go, Mike. Let's push it. Come on. Let's go. Come on. I'm with you if you want another one. Yeah, I know. I feel that. It's because of the stretch. Yes. Yes. But, it's a bottom. Okay. Give me two seconds. Let's do it. Whatever you need. These are beautiful. Two more. I'll go in. Go. One more. Up. Yeah. Slow. Yeah. Okay. Push. Push. Push. And then there's another slow chest up. Because all the way down, all the way down and pause. Big stretch. That's it. That was a good set. Come on, Mike. One more. Let me help you get this one. Oh, time. Control. Control. Control. Pause. Guys. Hey. Very nice. Oh, thank you Jeff. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, my bag. I think we should do one more fun. Something fun. Find me up. Yeah. So I personally think this will be a nice finisher for the thriceups. We're really overhead. Whereas with the skull crusher, we were still a little bit more more of a neutral position. So. Have you ever used this before, Mike? Oh, but she's like him without this one. This is exactly what we'll have has a. My favorite. He knows what I like. And then it's just an overhead extension. So it's quite smooth. So we can do maybe one set here. Perfect. Yeah, just one's. One set. Pretty hard. But yeah. Okay. There you go. One minute help. Nope. Okay. Maybe help. Yes. All right. I'm done. I got like really hard really quick actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I get hard, it's never quick. For it all. Good. Good. Stop. One more. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Oh, shit. That hits. Did you like it? That was good. Yeah, very good. I'm like a little bit too much stuff going on back there. I don't do it anyway. I don't do it anyway. Jeff. Huge pleasure. Have you ever heard of the water? What did you think about the workout?
