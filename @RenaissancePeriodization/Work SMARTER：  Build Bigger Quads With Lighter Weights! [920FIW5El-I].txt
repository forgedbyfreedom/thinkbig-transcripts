We were back to high school set of six with 185. To you guys make me weaker. I said bigger and not weaker. I said bigger and not weaker. I said bigger and not weaker. You two, what's going on? I'm clearly Dr. Mike still, despite my best efforts, I continue to wake up in the stupid body with this ugly head. That being said, Jared Feather, look at his mocha. He's great. He's a guy. Mocha. Did that come out wrong or very right? That was the thing. Anyway, I was real massive. Load, really slip, I want whatever that is. Batteries not included. Listen, Jared Feather is an I.C. pro. Here is our man, Ali. Now he caught us out in the streets and he was like, I'm two things. A competitive bodybuilder and I'm Lebanese. And I was like, that means you're going to have to honor the legacy of all the unbelievable Lebanese bodybuilding champions, including Mr. Olympias. And he's like, I'm so ready, y'all. And even I ain't even playing. And I was like, leg day and he was like, yeah. And so here we are today. This is going to be a hamstring focused in the beginning, then eventually quad focused in the end. High-repe, leg pain, day of doom. I'm just kidding. But everything's going to be great. Don't tell him, let's get into it. What you're doing, how you're like pushing your hips down like this. So you can hold the stretch at the top. That was perfect. A lot of people want to get to this top. It's going to clank and just let all the tension off their hamstring. Try to hold that deep stretch on the eccentric face at the top for one second and force on the way down. Seated hamstring curls sets of 10 to 20 reps. We're going to do my rep match because why wouldn't you? What is my rep match? If you're new to the channel, you at how long are many reps you can close to failure. One or two reps away, shy, even zero reps right at failure. We're going to do that. Let's say he gets 18 reps straight. Rest two, three minutes. How long it takes to get all the energy back, breathing normal. Next set begins. He goes pretty close to failure or two failure. Let's say he gets 16 reps because he's tired now. He waits for five or ten seconds. Finish is off the last two. So it's 18 on the first, 18 on the second. Third set, however many sets it takes. So five to ten seconds. Rest breaks between the many sets to get again to 18. So that could be like 10, six, two. Brutal multiple approaches to failure. Give each huge growth stimulus. 26. Let's get to 30. Down. 27 slow. Let's do it again slower. Slow. Slow. Slow. That's 28. One more good one. 29 slow. Slow. One last one. Finish up strong. Touch. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Hold. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's that, Brian. How did I come up with this workout? I sort of did. But the RP training app Alphabild, which we're testing right now, when you see this, it'll probably out for sale. It's keeping track of all of our exercises. It's telling us how much low to use, how many sets, how close to failure. I love it. And I built it. I'm not just the client. I'm a customer. I got that whole thing wrong. Let's just go train. Superlock. Excellent. Excellent. As the reps get harder, you press yourself away. So a big deal on seated hamstring curl machines is as much as the machine design allows. Luckily, this is a good machine that all come this good. It's to lock your legs down into the pad as hard as possible until it comes so physically uncomfortable that the pain of being locked in is worse than the hamstring in. Why? Because you want maximum stability. You want the only thing being trained and moving is the knee joint ideally. That also means that you don't just lock in the thighs, but you take your hands usually in the press yourself into the machine such that it's pure stability for the legs and it's nothing wiggling. If I look at someone's hamstrings training and I look at them doing a seated machine and they're wiggling around while they're doing it, that is no good. People talk about energy loss. That's not how physics works. But I will tell you how neuroscience works. If you are stable and locked in, you can gear in and produce a fuccload of force exactly to the muscle you want. If you're unstable, your nervous system is like, I'm even fuccing doing something for real here and it doesn't allow you to be as strong with the movement. Get a stable, locked in as possible. Tell them to turn up the gangster rap. Just great, fine, let's shit and then get into it. Speaking of which, let's get into it. 25 people join. Again, 26. Let's get to 30. Down. 27 slow. Let's just count on. Do it again, slower. Jolot of a slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. That's 28. One more good one. 29 slow. Slow. One last one. Finish up strong. Touch. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Hold. Good. For me. Good shit. Good shit, man. I'm not burn. Do you feel? You got veins, Chris crossing your ship. So, are these like a super heavyweight bodybuilder here in Vegas? What'd you win last year? High roller. High roller. So, he won the high roller last year. Qualified for national shows. And now he's kind of just an improvement season. Quorum quote. To a hopefully, do nationals at the end of the year. That's a goal. We can really get it. Yeah. Everything works out. Right. Yeah. 24. That was a perfect rap. Do it again. 25. Beautiful. One. 26. Let's go, Ali. Get your shit together. 27. One more. And then you rest a little bit. Joel 28. Control. Breathe for a second. Rest. Last two minutes. We'll go. Begin. Two. And your dog. One. Break the Joel. Again. Resist me. Don't let me pull your legs. Don't fucking do it. And your dog. Hell yeah, man. That's the strong. That was hard. Got a little pump in your hamstring. Oh, fucking. That's the pump in my hands. All right. So our app has a question for you. How did your joints feel during this exercise? No pain, low pain, moderate pain or a lot of pain. Just for your joints. Not your hands. No pain. No pain. Sorry. It's going to say no game. That's good. Did you imagine? You just encourages joint pain. All right. We saved that. And then it'll program the rest of the shit. Hell yeah. Good stuff. So I never had a hamstring pump. This fucking drastic muscle. I'm like three sets. Yeah. And we just started the shit fellas. Three sets. My rep match of 30 reps each. Done for the seated hamstring curl. I'll use hamstrings are in a state of disarray. We're going to use a smaller amount of load. Do stiff leg and deadlift with dumbbells, which I don't think we've ever done. The channel haven't got the video to do. I must be a first time. First time for everything. I always say that's what my ankle told me when I was four years old. What happened next? I can't talk about on the channel. More technically outside of a court of law. In any case, it's going to be dumbbell stiff leg and deadlift. For probably sets of 10 to 15 reps, the focus here is arching the lower back to pre-stretch the hamstrings by tilting the pelvis anteriorly. Keeping your knees back, push your tummy out and slowly lowering to make the hamstrings at load. Pain is the menu item and depth. As deep as you can go while still feeling it in your hamstrings with an arch lower back, this is the key slow and low. I'm sure shit why I'm not all these hamstrings right now. And after this, you're going to be a fucking lawsuit. Those hamstrings are going to sue the rest of the body. I didn't think that through it. I was never smart enough to go to law school or school. Yes. Go go go. They say number of hundred pounds. More. You got this all fucking day. Big check. More. But back. Big chest. Big chest. Big chest. Go. Go. Go. One more in your dumps. Let's do it. Chest up. Come on man. Fuck back. Chest up. Pause. Up. Ooh. Strap them. How do you do warm up with a 50? I was fucking. Another level. Chest up. Come on man. Let's go. Chest up. Let's go. Chest up. Hold. He stretch. Up. Yes. Come on. Two more in your dump. I know fucking hurts. Big chest. Big chest right here. Sky chest. H-book. Back, back, back, back. Up. Come on. Go. Come on. One more. Get back. Chest into the sky. Or we won't count them all. Even at the bottom of your chest should be pointed completely forward when you're holding that chest forward. Chest forward. Chest forward. Yes. Up. Good stuff dude. Raff. Good stuff. That's it done. Whew. My man. My man. Good job for you. The technique like that man. I'm really good. Oh fuck you. It's good. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh. But the fun is just beginning. The selectorized original body masters linear leg press hacksquat, selectorized Schmiggle dig thing in the jig. Beable butt. This is the OG amazing machine type that has been recently perfected by Atlantis with their model. This shit though is all this is. It's like older than me. And I'm like a hundred in a spaceship. It's fucking good. Real good. Atlantis is better. It's newer. It's better engineered. God damn. This is a hell of a thing for its time. We are going to make sure that Ali skutes in here at its deepest possible setting. That he is controlling the eccentric. Here's the thing about this machine. It unloads the axial component, the spine crushing. You barely feel. It's a force us an opportunity to milk that eccentric that's slow lowering for the Quad to an extent that even Scott the video guy called needlessly painful. Now, I hope I'll be camp here this hopefully is far and away off camera. But this is going to be my rep sets. Probably two my rep rest breaks sets of I don't want to say this. A lot of 15 to 25 reps. The Quad are going to be cooked. It's all about high quality. Floreng of motion. He'll stay down. We'll clue you in a similar cues. Honestly, I'm scared to even admit it's true what's going to happen. Let's get on. Let's attention off. Get to the bottom of the halls. Control. Control. Control. Pause there. Yes. Down. Slow. Slow. Got gamut Ali. Slow. Slow. Up. And then as if you're going to do another one. Fucking extra slow. Slow. Right here. Slow. Yes. Yes. Pick them up. Good. Wrap. Mothin. Good. That's a fucking set. Dude. That slowing down in that middle portion is because it's essentially mechanically like the most torque transduced. Yeah. That's the toughest part. If you can slow down during that part, the amount of muscle growth stimulus is like that's what we're doing this exercise. So we're not doing just to do reps. Yeah. You doing an amazing job. As soon as your breathing is back to relatively normal. No rush. No rush. Yeah. Yeah. From now on, dude. Literally. I don't even think about reps anymore. I don't necessarily want to be honest. Yeah. Like all of a sudden, I could get 15. I could get 20. I don't know. I'm just going to keep my technique fucking perfect. Come on. Go, go, go. Nobody said rest. We got two more. Joel. Seven. Down. Slow. Slow. Got gamut. We won't count. Because if they're not slow. Slow. Pause. Up. Rast. Breathe. Come up. Four. It's just going to be harder. It's not a big deal. Slow. There's just a few. Heels on our way up. Up. Down. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good job. Good job. Again. Again. We'll give a fuck if you go to failure. Slow. Slow. Slow. Good job. Good job. That's it. That's it. That's it. My man. Ha. Fuck yeah. Good shit man. Good shit. Holy crap. What? Do that's great. That's like right when I started hitting failure. I noticed that middle part. Yeah. I start to fucking lose it. It's the hardest part, man. It's who he wants it. That's how I like to kind of regulate my volume when I'm training. But I fall out of the rep range that I'm giving myself for an exercise. So like we said we should get like 15 to 20 here. You got 10 on that one. I just go ahead and that's when I program a down set. Yeah. So like I'll reduce the load by 10, 20 percent. And then I'll get back into the rep range that I was doing. Yeah. So I try to struggle with the same way. Check that. And get 70. Every rep. The same. Just like last set. Even though it is lighter. Slow on the descent. Solid. Pause. Only rest at the top. When we say it's a break, he gets killed. One more. Slow. Yeah. Yeah. Slowly. Yes. We're a fucking machine. Up. Go. Go. Go. Rest. Breathe. We got one more little mini set. Control your ship. Stabilize. Breathe. You're in charge. You're in charge. I'll leave you want one or two more of a row. You're ready. Time to fucking wrap, Lebanon. Let's go. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Come on man. Fight it. Heels. Fast. One more. Last one. Slow. Slow. Slowly. Slow. Zero. Zero. Four. Heels. Go. And if you're going to do another. Last rep of machine. Slow. Slow. Slow your in charge. That's it. Oh shit. Oh shit. You're a fully fine. You're a fully fine. You're a fully fine. You're a fully fine. Hey, we only have squats left. How easy. I good luck. Squats are not the quote unquote best quad builder, right? That's what you hear that and we'll say it. It's like your huge. You could squat a fuck a little weight. So whenever you pre-exhaust and be doing machine or something like that first and then you come Squat. Squat is going to fucking be like that. And then the load is so reduced. The axial fatigue from it. So like actually what's going to is fine. Yeah. And then making you systemically fatigue throughout the week. You just reduce the load. It goes down by a shit load. Yeah. So you're not overreaching too soon. 100%. So you might only do like two plates on this today. But I see the squat like what? Four in the fours in the five. Four is fours for ref and 10. I really go, I don't go when I qualify. So now you won't go more than four plates in the total. Ily did three sets of sets of 10 to 15 roughly of the hacksquats. His quads are toast already. He's a strong guy. His quads are enormous 250 pounds of veins all over his legs. He is going to do 185 pounds for one set in the squat. Probably something like five to 10 reps. He is going to do 135 after. There's we do not anticipate him being able to do multiple sets at 95. Just two sets of squats here. 185 135. Hopefully set of 10 to 12 on 135. As soon as he racks 135 he's going to walk back. And we're going to do the RP patented drop set to bodyweight squats. So that's a failure slash death. And that'll be it for quads and the whole workout. It doesn't take much if you get the technique right. Even if you're big you don't have to use crazy heavy weights. You can't if you want. But you can use lighter weight. Do it properly. Get stronger over time from a lower position because the weights have such a huge effect on the muscles. Let's get into it. We're making a set. Let's go. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Up. Again. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Up. Go. Go. Go. Back. Oh, it's fun. Damn. One of you are back to high school set of six with 185. To you guys make me weaker. I said bigger and out weaker. Let's go to 135. Yeah. Again. Good job. You're in charge early. You're in charge early. It's 135. Fucking pounds. Don't let it punk you out. Slow and control. You're in charge. You're in charge. Chest up. One more. Rest a second. One. What's open? Chore. Chest. Chest. Up. Rack. Slow pain is a good thing. Up. Now. Chest up. Yes. Chest up. Chest up. Sit. Up. Down. Slow. Down. Slow. Let's go. Up. I said it again. Go. Go. Down. Slow. Good chest. We only count the good ones. We only count the good ones that we eat. Up. Go. Up. Up. One more down. That right away. Sit. Slow. Slow. Let's walk and go. Up. Up. Up. Clots. Yes. That's it. Feel free to roll away. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Okay. Body weight is crossed. How long are you so weak? You saw that you were a fucker. I was bleeding. We can't have this embarrassing shit here. Dude. That was fucking awesome. It's great. What do you think, Talik? Talik. But my definitely weigh it. But my weight was blackening. Fuck yeah. I love it. Dude. You did amazing. So it's appreciated. The thing that's most impressive about what you did, which is TPH no joke. It's the gold standard of the way we train and the way we do our channel training. A lot of people can train hard if you just turn up the death metal and just do stuff. A lot of people can be technique masterminds when there's no weight on the bar and they're not close to failure. You took that hardest fuck training and you paired it with excellent technical attention and that slow control. When those two intersect, the explosion that results is enormous fucking quads and a half. I appreciate that. Do it. Awesome stuff. Any time you want to come back on the channel training, anything else I have to do. Yeah. You got social media and shit like that. Yeah. There you go. Oh yeah. All the entertaining bodybuilding. That's my Instagram. We're going to throw it on there for you. Folks who click on it, I'm sure you have an only fan. So we're going to have to. I'm getting a course. I'll be here right here. Oh yeah. Hey badge bunnies. Your boys here. Andy brought us on pipe. So you feel me. Thank you so much for being on the channel. I appreciate you guys big time. Of course. Of course. You can be that stuff. See you guys next time.
