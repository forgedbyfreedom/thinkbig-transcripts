Oh, I don't know. Stay there. Don't go anywhere Jordan. Don't reach for that handle. Oh, shit. I've got an odd pump. You can just stand in front of us. No. Make me a small guy. No, no, you shouldn't. Like, a little bit of a bus. I don't think you're going to listen to me a big guy. I only have a guy in the brother. Folks, I'm Dr. Mike. That's Jared Feather, I fee pro. We're in Montreal, Canada. In Atlantis, Jim. I think about corporate structures. Because all corporations, almost all, have a CEO, a chief executive officer. And this is Jocan, San Sucey. Yeah. And he just happens to be the CEO of Atlantis. And it's one of the situations where like, you guys know how like, in all the like spider managed shit, comic movies, the guy in the CEO of the company that has all the defense contract or nanotech bugs. At some point, he's like, ah, box spider man, I'm using my own shit. Ah, well, Jocan had an altercation outside of here just a while ago. They didn't want to talk about it. I was an elevator guy pushed to me, pushed to back. He's got a major. And he's like, enough, enough being mortal. Enough. And then he's like, what does it I do for living? Oh, that's right. I make the world's best exercise equipment to make me jacked and mean. He said, make me mean. How do you say that in French? What do you say? Make me mean in French. Meshon. It was, it just, it's Jared and I were like, we can't not help you. So he hired us as defense contract. Defense contractors, leg day hamstrings, quads, glutes, CEO of Atlantis on his own equipment. And it looks like it's going to be a very easy surgery. Operation to install the nanolaser. It's an awesome thing. It's an amazing thing. Yeah. How do you feel, and good? I just had to do workout just making sure I could get through it. But, uh, we'll get you through it. Yeah. One way or another. It's a good one. Oh, please. All right. You guys ready to see this? Three, two, one. Dropping. That's how we get big. Shop our way to size. Shopping for trend. I guess. I'm really controlling the sensor. And pause for four steps in the bottom. All the way down, slow, slow, slow, slow, right there. Pause. Up. Good. How does that feel? I actually don't use this too often, but this one looks pretty nice. Want to give you the try as well? Oh, I can't. I have my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my. Leg curls. First we get a cool little Anus piece here we're using. It's a single leg, leg curl works really well. You'll notice that when we start doing the sets here. You can see the two. And the second one is a little smaller. Just look at that. Tor's a last couple of reps, isn't it? And I helped Jordan at the very top. So that he can continue to complete the reps and get more reps in for that bottom half of the exercise, which is the most hyper-trophic. Just technically four straps. It's okay to do it now. Again, it's a special workout for fun. Maximum stimulus. The thing in our pee of the reason why we don't do a lot of the stuff is because of tracking. You know, week one, week two, week three, four. How much is your buddy currently on you Who The Fuck Noons? We get after it. When you want to help the person in the part of the range of motion, that they need to help the most in to get through the reps, so you get more reps. And the part of the range of motion has to least hyper-trophics so they can do the most type of trip apart themselves. This is exactly what's happening with that top range. Shit, we're going to do two sets here, about 15 reps each. It's going to get 15 on the first, and we're going to my arm right the rest of you. Get us a note that yet. I don't know if he knows what my arm is up. You sure should about to find out. Well, three more. I'm right here with you. Keep that technique. Nice control. Good, one last one. Slow. Beautiful. Rest a little bit relax. It's hard to finish your range of motion when you get tired. Yes, of course. It's a big applause for the rest of your time. That's why I'm helping you at the very top. No, it's not. You're going to be able to do that. The reason I'm saying keep it hip forward is because you're putting yourself in a more mechanically out of the position to curl the weight up, which is fine. But to produce a lot of hypertrophy, you want yourself in the disadvantage of your position. So when you're pushing your hip back as you're going down, you're just making it easy on yourself. Yeah, yeah. When you keep your hip forward on this, as it coming down, that's kind of like if you push your elbows out on a bicep curl, like this, instead of being you. And in order to get a huge stretch, and as we know that stretch, you need a hypertrophy huge. You want to keep that hip forward. So the lever link is longer, that makes sense. The lever link becomes longer unless you're here, but shorter now. So if you can keep the hip forward and reach out, you're going to wave at a stretch. Control that last bit for slow control. The rest for a second after this, don't go anywhere. The rest breathe. Two more. Last two. Yes. Two. And that's it. Whew. Cool. I think that's the hamstring. How's your toes? Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. We're just going on everything. Time for the Atlantis Hackswatt. Next up is the Hackswatt. The Atlantis Hackswatt. Next up is the Hackswatt. The Atlantis Hackswatt. Because look no joke. The best Hackswatt I've ever used. It's a smoothest. It's an adjustable plate. The plate itself is super, super fucking high-frient. So there's no way to like slip off. Then anything, just you're like fucking buried in there. The shoulder pads are even comfortable. It's full depth like to the max. Like your quads are stretched through the bone. And gee, we're going to do two sets of like 10 to 20 reps. My arm is a little bit too heavy. 10 to 20 reps. My reps, style. Great, from this your son's seat. Great. Oh we're a whole different fucking play. Great in French Canadian. Mmm, we. How many reps? Ah, yes. We'll see. Do you want a number? Do you want to just go? I won't matter. No matter. I'll just try to move us for as possible. Go, go, go. Go, go, go, go. One more. Get it together. He's out. Slow, slow. Slow, slow. Awesome. Up. Up. One. Rest, breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Hold on, this is slow at the bottom. He's out. He's out. Slow. Slow. There it is. Wait. Up. One. Good. Another one. This such a smooth machine. I can feel it. Go, go, go. Nobody said rest. Slow. Slow. Up. He's tensed out of the bottom. Don't just sit on the right. Again. Down. Right away. Slow. Slow. Slow. Attention. Attention. Up. Go. Go. Go. Go. Don't reach for that handle. Lock your legs up. Lock your legs up. Just wait. Good. One more. Last one. Hit it. Control. Slow. Slow. Slow. Go. Go. Press. Press. Press. Right. Oh. No. No. No. No. No. No. It's fun. Yeah. If she hits the fan and a gentleman is not able to get enough reps to our liking with whatever weight we have on there. Sometimes we just drop it. So we'll go like 225, we'll go to 185, we'll go to 135. Sometimes we even go to there's nothing on the machine. And we'll see if that comes to pass today. Slow. Slow. Slow. Up. Fast. Up. Up. Right. Stay there. Don't go anywhere Jordan. Up. Good. Good. Down. You're good Jordan. Again. Slow. Get your hands out of your fucking pot. There you go. Slow. Up. Yeah. Come on. Good. Again. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Pauze. Up. Fast. Go. Go. Go. Dressed. Don't go anywhere. They talked here. You're doing great. All we want is another eight reps. But it's just the machine. The slowest thing ever. Yes. All the way down. And wait. Up. Go. And one last one down. Down right away. Go on. Slow. Slow. Wait. Don't come up. Wait. Up. Go. Speed. Up. Up. Rack. Yeah. I can't walk now. I can't walk now. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Quick. Let the machine go. Learn. Not a regret. And it would work there. Go ahead. twice In the air? Yes. Never. Amen. Backman. Even frontrest. Yeah. It's like a. Really. In the moment. Working on being stood. Because. Yeah. But i felt the pain is not going anywhere. It's accepted. It's there. Like you just have to accept. This is not going to feel any fucking better. No matter what. Because i have to keep doing reps. going to be more of a pump, more metabolites. The pain is literally just going to get worse. So you have to like, keep eating, you see it, and tell yourself that. Exactly. Bulgarian split squats with an Atlantis Bulgarian split squat machine. It's kind of a really sweet machine. You get handles, you guys will see in the set. And you get to put your foot up on an adjustable foot situation. You can load the handles up. I won't be in an external load of fire. This is how to see his towards the very end of his workout here, fairly stand up on his own. You see how many lunches we can get out of him, or whatever one area is. Four. Control, slow. Five. Again, control, slow. Up. Up. Six. Control, slow. Feet remain like all the handles. Like all the handles completely. No more handles. Come up by yourself. Good. Yeah. Hands forward. Up. Up. Up. Get out of here. Y'all motherfuckers probably ask him right now. How come he's doing like a few sets everything? He hasn't trained legs in a while, like four weeks or some shit. And grabbed him my licensees were real thing. And since we're physiologists, when I'm in this dumb shit, so you can train somebody hard, but hard for them. And that means like he's still going to be sourced for a week. He's still going to be barely walking. We're just trying to keep this piss yellow instead of laughs. Slow. Slow. Hands up. One. Let's do three total. One, that's one. All the way down. Two. Hands forward. That's not me. Let's go. Go on. Shh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. It's. There's nothing to do, right? You don't know what to do. Yeah, you just wait. It's just wait. Wait. Oh, man. How long have we let take? I 35 minutes. 40? Oh, yeah. 40. 45 minutes. Yeah, about 45. It doesn't take long. Yeah, doesn't. What do you think? It was. What's tough? Top. What's good with the excellent. Jared, how do you do? Amazing. Yeah. No. Better than like, I say this all the time. I'm like, people like you just train harder than I can be froze. You just literally did it. Yeah, you just keep trying around it. Yeah. OK, and hard of the meat. That's for damn sure.
