You read a new study and you change your whole training style and facts Until a new article drops and you change it again. Oh, yes. This is so goddamn true. Here's a thing One study in a time says almost nothing all the studies together and physiological anatomical rationale that you've known for like a hundred years And how it works in the real world on yourself for other people for their coaches so on and so forth That whole thing is evidence-based training in its super valid if you are changing your shit every other week Based on a new study your hashtag science based and not actually science based and there's a huge Hey folks doctor right here for our peace strength. I'm a former professor of exercise and sports science competitive bodybuilder Brazilian students who grabler and some wad of a kind of fake authority on things revolving or I'm lifting but I know of a real authority an original a God a Titan know not Darwin not Einstein mister Dom Mazzetti who I learned so much from as a child That now we're gonna go back and check out real Pro science insights and see how scientific they are and how insightful they are three two one Daddy Science based lifting is a scam by big science to get you to do more science and less Lifting the whole reason we started lifting is because we were bullied for being nerds facts I'll be close to home continue please we didn't go to the gym to stay nerds we go to the gym so we can bully other No Oh my god That is a photo Yikes you tell me all you have to do to feel better about myself is make someone feel worse about themselves Where do I sign up now these nerds that's trying to pull confessed on honest if I were a nerd I wouldn't be teaching my bullies how to get bigger than me. I'd be tricking them into being smaller by reading Good news here the bullies pretty much never do science based lifting The nerds gravitate to science based lifting so if you do science based lifting and advocate it on the internet Like Mr. Jeff Nipper does the nerds get more jacked and we are able to defend themselves more from the bullies and The bullies typically are like anti science based lifting because honestly they're just dumber and Science has always been confusing because they were dumber when they were younger too And so actually if you do science based lifting and you promulgated on the internet You're beefing up the nerds and it doesn't really help the bullies because quite frankly That don't do the reading and the science thing all that well and they're proud of it too Man Scott you ever look at some of the elaborate setups like the science science he lifting has and you're like Number one I don't want to set that up. I'm too f***ing lazy number two is like it's so awkward That you spend more of your time trying to figure out how you're gonna strap into the grips than actually lifting the Way All that this is gonna be sick Oh, this stretch is Increased dude Dead engagement You nicely had another one of these over here though you read a new study and you change your whole training style Facts An identity until a new article drops contradicting it. I need to change it again Okay, so this is so goddamn true. Here's the thing Science based lifting isn't just reading PubMed studies or abstracts or titles Let's be honest everyone's just reading the title and then changing your training based on doing that Now lots of people do that. They're not doing it right Science based lifting means the Integrate real studies into physiological and anatomical understanding into practical experience that you have with yourself Into the wisdom other coaches and athletes have also shared all together in one big group of Insighton when that group has a few more studies in it it has to Basically check the box of well, what is my own personal experience? What is the physiological rationale how do other athletes respond in only then is an intelligent to really upgrade your training? So the Dom is under some 100% valid shit here a lot of people do change their training sometimes every week based on the new study That is not science based lifting obviously Dom is a comedian hilarious shit, but like for real for real there's a great of truth There were some people do change the shit all the time and then the yell you yell about in the comments to you look well This is the same base haven't you seen that one recent study one study in a time says almost nothing Everything all the studies together and physiological anatomical rationale that we've known for like a hundred years And how it works in the real world on yourself on your athletes for other people for their coaches So on and so forth that whole thing is evidence based training in its super valid and so if a new study comes out You pretty much never go up that's what I'm doing. It's interesting Let's see if a few more studies can replicate the study and then I'll change my training on the margins To reflect this new discovery of reality if you are changing your shit every other week based on a new study You're hashtag science based and not actually science based and there's a huge difference Lengthen pausels. It you mean half reps. He's no doubt he really trying to rebrand half reps First of all yes second of all length and personal There's specific kind of half rep. It's the length and part a lot of bros won't do length and partials because they hurt a lot They stretch you bros don't do that shit bros do medium range Parts just like right in the middle here or top and partials so they can use a lot of weight the two wrongest kind of Parts that you can do so yeah bottom and partials length and partials really are scientifically valid and really will make you jacked But yeah bros can't take credit for that one because you've been doing it wrong. Oh But it's still harder half. Yeah, but it's still half which means the job is not done It's right we need to do it work I love it if you spend as much time lifting all the weight as you did figure it out how to lift half it you've been twice as big Math somehow words these science based nodes have to speak to your truth like some science justice warrior Why do you care so much? Why would you want to help me get bigger than you is It is really is doggy dog out there isn't it like if I see you at the gym making games Those could be my games, you know that's really the thing Scott. I think I think we have fundamental like philosophical Economic point if someone has a lot of money and you take it you have a lot of money But you can't take anyone's games can you Or can you because you want to be right and need to be wrong because if I get bigger doing it wrong That means the exercising the problem you want and there was no amount of science They can make up for your shitty genetics or lack of work at the fact I say I think science based lifters have more work ethic than non science based lifters Mostly because they're just more conscientious people that succeed in everything including school and work in life Science based lifting question. What's the most amount of weight? You can move the least amount of distance He most important question for you go lifting pull so motifying down It's racked a lot of attention grabs some chalk Stop around yes, okay get everybody looking at you. Yes, you also have to do the thing back in the day We used to wear a powerful equipment these super super tight suits that would the straps would pull you down and kind of cave you over So you did before dead of thing was you would raise your arms to kind of get the straps to kind of sag back a little bit and give you some relief Scott I've seen Natural lifter and that natural good God unequipped lifters with just singlets on or just t-shirts do the strap pull as a Practice for summa Your cos playing nothing you're doing is real But a sure shit gets people looking at you and a Dom says people looking at you. I was gonna say it's half the battle But is it really I think it's probably most of the battle Your max for you grab the ball over under okay Facts Dom is very flexible and has an excellent super sumo setup This is really good stuff. I can even get into this position Boom sumo is like dunking on an eight foot rim but swear it's 10 feet the joke's amazing But let's clear something up every single person that is a problem with pulling sumo is Making an excuse for why someone pulled sumo more than they could pull in any style including sumo I might add yeah, I mean I could deadlift 800 I just want to do that weird sumo shit Shut the f-op no you can't you're making excuse after excuse after you've got I don't know if you were around for There's there was a meme going around it and by meme I mean like something people said until it wasn't funny and then until it really wasn't funny until people forgot about it But they still said it it was like sumo lifters eat ass Do you remember that one? That's for the best and it was like all over the internet like 2015 and there's two parts of it I didn't understand one is the hate on sumo which is nonsense The other is what the f- is wrong with eating ass folks They're still more video to come but if you want an extended version of this video tons of other Alternarity content tons of training logs are member section is amazing give it a click show up subscribe It's not a ton of money. It's great value. All right back to the video speak in a cheat-in cheat Curls do not use the fixed bars fixed bars are the equivalent of adult braces use a barbell not only to establish a six-foot blast radius Yes, but to take the ball for someone who's using it So they have no choice but to watch you curl and say you've done Like how he side eyes the guy the best is when you have like eight people Will it wanting to use a power act and you got a guy and they're doing like just curls and you're like You could have just taken that barbell out of the rack who'd have been great plenty of barbells got to be that guy personal trainers are the biggest train on society Truth I'd apply to more personal trainers than anyone care stood man Personal training is food stamps for fat people why are you trying to help people who won't help themselves Let me tell you something for you is about hate yourself until you build a burning drive But overcompensy for everything in your life using the gym You know Scott there are people who are unaware that they actually feel this way that will get really pissed and comments sections Like there'll be like someone's like I'm using those epic to lose weight They're like you're not earning it man. You're like how you could be okay Do you need a hug is there something unernd in life that you're struggling with you? Real talk though personal training is phenomenal because it helps people who just don't know much or don't have the requisite motivation to really get after it outsourced that and get an amazing shape personal training is amazing. However There is a subcategory of client of personal training which I'm not a big fan of all of her respect It's a tiny fraction of these clients are real and you might have had them form clients that expect the personal trainer To somehow give them every ounce of their motivation and so they bring Zero motivation or interest to the equation. I've had clients who 12 weeks into a program Don't know how to lift at all because they're actively trying not to remember anything you say They want you to just tell them up down move like this move like that go go go go They do it and as soon as they're done They're just they're brain erases all of that data They want zero ownership over their lifting and you're saying like what about when they go a vacation? They just don't lift what about when you're out of town? They don't lift and as soon as you're out of their lives They don't lift there is like a type of person who wants nothing to do with lifting other than a trainer Make in them do it here's the problem you can't make someone do something They don't actively really want to do it when the wake it's heavy and the wake it's hard and the reps get really high People quit these people quit way before any of that So even though you are having them do the movements in the gym They suck at the movements because they're never tried to learn imagine every Every single squats that you do is really kind of your first set ever because you just never bothered to learn and You're barely trying these are the kinds of people that will tell their friends like oh, I can't Gain any muscle or I can't lose any weight and then do you train like I train three times with a trainer? Shut up Betsy I've seen you train with your trainer. It's mostly your trainer doing the work and you just have a Code of excuses if you're attitude as soon as you walk in to the gym is oh I just have to survive this until I can get the god of here You're not gonna make your best gains by a long chat and guess who you have to blame for that Amirir the mirror is the problem go look at it and blame the physical mirror itself this cannot be taught It has to be learned Musselups assure it looks impressive but trust me nobody cares as much as you wish they did Musselups don't actually take that much muscle or strength It's mostly just technique and podcast about senior retention. Yes Yes My god Scott he hit a real demographic with that What you want to do is do odd lift that no one else does so that you don't have to compare yourself to anyone else And find out that you're not that strong you get really good at some weird strange as a terror glyphs You establish those as the core lifts for functional human health and you 100% do heat Ice Crasston techniques the all that shit bands and you you have a discount code for natural supplements You're that guy Mike I bet you can't match me because I can do a Turkish get up with the 75 pounds for 13 reps Does that make you the world's strongest man? That good or the strongest man of all time I don't Small you are the easy read is actually fun fact the strongest part about Musselup is the strength it takes to die a virgin It does take strength um no offense all of respect When really skinny people ask you how many dips or pull-ups you can do I typically answer with shot up Because what they're trying to do is get to a conclusion where they can do more of those things than you But if I can come up to you pick you up with one arm and throw you throw window He didn't really give a shit house strong for your way you are Motherfucker and if I'm being quite serious I'm just no good at pull-ups and dips on embarrassed and I'm really just flashing up So you're watching it. This is the RP hypertrophy app removes all uncertainty and makes the training process Precisely defined choose your pre-made workout plan from dozens available of the app plug in your weights and the app takes care of the rest For months of productive training ready look on the link in the description of this video to get started When that gave me Jim he was some potential red flags to keep an eye out for what he said he doesn't go bad 90 eventually because it's bad for you shoulders This dude doesn't eat pussy and he makes you shower before sex Joe seed man. He's talking about you When someone says you don't need to hit arms directly because you hit them and chest him back I'm gonna beat down to this one someone says you don't need to hit arms directly It means they have dog shit small arm genetics and they abandon the idea of training arms Let's see what Tom has to say these are conspiracy theorists who think training buys and tries is a plot by big arm At the game you spend more time in the gym Bro if my arms go from just blinking I would still hit arms every day Yes, you think the only reason I lift is to grow up. I lift so don't feel so empty side And the ultimate way to fix the emptiness is to have bigger arms guys There is no question in the universe to which big arms is not at least a big part of the answer Probably wrong in the comments people who use a smith machine as a leg race I actually don't understand this at all. I've seen this dozens of times the smith machine leg press It's a dog shit angle you're insanely unstable Scott how much do you trust that your feet aren't gonna slip from a f***ing barbell? What the f*** leg it's gonna split your shit open and crack your asshole open all that? It's just like going way out of your way for just a by no means clear benefit at all I just don't get it. Maybe I'm in the wrong. Maybe it could work somehow But I gotta be honest man if you're doing this you're spending so much effort on balance If you're not training close to the failure or you're not using any kind of heavy load or any combination of the tune straight up You look like a pig What exactly is wrong with getting pegged folks? There's still more video to come He cheated on this exercise. He means he's training for free trip to the by Hey How is it really free? Really you pay in other ways damn dude. What's up with that girl Scott are you seeing that? What up baby is that is that photo shop or Yeah Look shoppy It is definitely like Emirates business class she's sitting Who's up you spot Okay, crap doing that folks Domazetti is the person you can learn real shit from yeah You can come on this channel learn science and lifting and how to get better shape But it is it gonna teach you how to be a man Then it's not what we claim on this channel and it is absolutely not gonna happen Do you want to learn philosophical shit and how to deal with adult situations? I actually have another channel just it's called just Mike Ezra tell and it's about progress in AI and thinking It's also gonna teach you brainyship, but will it teach you to be a grown man and how to really be alpha in the gym and the best way possible No But does Domazetti's content teach you that arguably that's the only thing it teaches you and arguably That's the only thing you ever need to learn folks Domazetti is something you need to check out ASAP I would recommend the following stop everything you're doing quit your job watch all of his content that he's ever put out and then reconsider Rearchitecting your entire life based exclusively on that content sounds good Awesome folks I've been Dr. Mike and I'll see you Next No, who are we gonna rate Domazetti Domazetti gets no infinity out of negative infinity because I even math Good enough for me good enough for you guys Domazetti gets a rating of a pimpe out of boss out of ten Think about that And I'll see you next time All right that was really fun. I feel dominant I don't know that's true this video here though might have some interesting things for you go click on it See you next time
