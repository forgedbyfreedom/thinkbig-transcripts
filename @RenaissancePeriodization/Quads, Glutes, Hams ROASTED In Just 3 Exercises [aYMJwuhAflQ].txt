We've got all the time in the world for crying. Let's fucking get it on. I'll tell you what I tell everyone. The better your technique, the harder it is, the less you got it to do. Dear division of competition. Wellness. Also wellness? Do you think it would be what your shit? Matt, yeah. No. Matt, ever. I'll take care. You don't you worry, I'll. I'll. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm not going to say it. Watch. You get to go? Hey folks, doctor Mike here and well, that's I'm your pro-Jair Puebler's usual. Today we have two special guests. Tweet. And Kayla. Tweet is a competitive wellness. I mean, I'm talking about athlete and she looks well. What up? Kayla. Is a woman of international mystery. I was like, hey, do you compete? She said, don't you worry about what I do? And I was like, what division? She's like, why don't you get out of my face about that shit? And I was like, listen, are we cool? And she's like, yeah, as long as you don't get shanked up in this amount of fucking, she's a stabbing. I recovered luckily. She doesn't even have shit to say. You want to find out about her good luck? But she's here to show us how real training works. If she feels like it though, maybe not. And then I should have a mystery. She's going to do what she does. We're going to do a workout that has glutes. It has hamstrings. It has quads. And it also has a lot of pain. We don't you ladies worry about that. Don't worry. So for stiff leg and deadlift, we're absolutely hitting the ham's. And the glutes and the best way to do that is to pre-stretch by making sure to and to really tilt the pelvis. You want to push that butt back, tummy out, chest up, and descend ultra slow. It's going to be a temptation to let your knee slide forward. Don't do that. Keep your knees back just slightly out of knockout. That will put all the real stress on your hands. You're going to feel deep stretching pain. When you do, get a little bit into that pain. Hold it for a second. And then come back up. That's the way to do these. Set the five to ten. Yeah, let's do it. The chest is just a little bit back. A little bit back. Last one. Big chest. Far close. John told to come back up. And then as if you're going to do another and just put it down. Big chest. Slow. Good. Oh. Ha ha. Let's go two more. Slow. Flut up. Gentle touch. Up. Good. One more. Slow. Back to open. It's open. Yeah. Open the way up too. Up. There you go. As if another slow flow. Chest up. Back. Slow. And rack. Good job. Yes. Yes. Yes. As if another slow. Big chest. Yeah. And that's a good stop. Good stop. This will get your lower back on. Part of the exercise. Again. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. Oh yeah. Gentle touch. And up fast. And then as if another go down slow. Pretend you got another one coming. Big chest. Yeah. There you go. Slow. Control. Control. Control. Let go. Holy shit. That was awesome. Wow. Wow. There you go. There you go. Front, front, elevated. Smith machine, lunges. That was like a lot of stuff. And it is. But this is an excellent, excellent, glute exercise. A couple of things to keep in mind here. One, we elevate the front foot to stretch that front glute the most. That means the front glute is the target. That means your rear foot is going to be used only for stabilization purposes. All of your weight or as much of it as possible is on that front foot. Don't get too shy about using the rear foot. But especially on the way down just use it as a time little point to control your weight. And on the way up if you need to help people use it a little bit. Generally speaking, you want to use it as little as possible. It's really almost a single leg movement. This will stretch the living. Grab out of your glutes. One last big piece of advice is go slow on the way down. Slowly stop at the bottom. Give it a shot. Let's see how these ladies do. We're sharp on that front leg. Not bad. Back legs for stability. We'll need if you need an extra help. Good. Especially on the way down gentle on the back leg. All in the front. Let's go tweak. Last two reps here. Up. Last rep. Go. Right now. Slow. Control. Jensen's holding on right here. It's not going to fall. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Rack. Oh, yeah. Oh shit. How fun. That was not a pause. Do it again. Let's go slow. The sand. Slow. Slow. Wait. Up. Yeah, Rack. We're learning all our pauses today. Good stop. Good stop. About 10 seconds. I can tell we'll hit it again. Slow. Pause. Up. Two more. Slow. Front foot. Front foot. Front foot. Good pause. Up. One more. Last one. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Pause. Wait. Up. You did it. That should give us the distrustful eyes. After she unwrap that, she's like. I hate everyone. That's it, right? I got it all. Okay. I heard this looking at you. I kind of. I don't even work out. Whatever. I literally don't. Wow. Come on. Go. God damn it. Get up. Two. One last one. Careful with the swearing God's listening.

The lower back is gonna be a little tired. Amstring's posterior chain is a limiting factor. That means something like a squat could work. But we're gonna play it safe and make sure that quads of limiting factor with full range of motion. Leg presses. That's a 10 to 20 reps. Ladies. Good luck. Press. Two more. Let's go. Slow control.

Anyway, come to the gym right now. We're going to do a leg session, bring your girl and tweez. All right. That's the start. Now, tweez is the VIP type of type of girl. So she closes the shit. She throws her phone away because she only uses one phone at a time. Ever. I never used the same phone twice. Let's direct tweez. And then Kayla came through and she was like, watch this. She pushed another girl right out of the way. And just did the most technical, beautiful leg workout. Anyone ever third, how you ladies feeling? Great. Yeah. They're convincing for feeling great.
