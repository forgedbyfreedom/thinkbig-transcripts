He said, then you're gonna, baby, do you mind? Oh, I got those, f*** up! Absolutely, Rans. Oh, it hurts. I'm all wrong. Yeah. Stop the video, guys. I'm talking about, for Renaissance Pyrrhusation. This is your father, I have to be pro also for Renaissance Pyrrhusation. And look, it's Genegiri, and she's back from 80th time on this channel. This is Yama Fuchs, can't get enough of the shit. And then, Sam, mommy, you look in straight, super hot fire up here. Would you say you're gonna get in black? 16, 9.4. 16, 9, not only is that a f***ing jack-task weight, you got 69, right? That weight. How can you do? Did you plan that shit? I'm going to play too much, girl. Oh, come on. Unbelievable. All right. The good news is, Gen's gonna be dating a lot. The bad news is she won't have the use of her arms during those dates. Because we're gonna smash her arms up right now. Your arms look pretty big, but they can always be bigger. I never, ever trained by substance rights. Good until, just get a camera, let's fix it. That's a good thing. Pre-motion curls are up first. We're using made into the world's first ever free motion machine. But Goddamn it. It still works. We are going to do sets of 10 to 20 reps on the free motion. And we're probably gonna buy a rep match to shit, which means whatever she gets on that first set, she's gonna be ready to post the failure. Rest in a normal lot of time. However, many, many sets that takes to reach that number again. And again, and again, four sets in a row of sets. Let's say she gets 16 reps on the first set. That means second set. Let's say she gets 12 failure. Rest it a little bit. Don't go anywhere. Another four to get to 16. Then 16. Then 16. Pain is on the menu. And Gen is the meal. No swinging. Use all in there. All in there. All in there. Let us stretch your obisus. There you go. 14, one more slow. We'll stretch it in the bottom. Hold it for a second. Let us stretch. Stretch, stretch, up. Boom. Yeah. Slow. And that's it. Fuck it. There you go. Very good. Very good. Very good. Our goal is 50. And we're going to add a note. Boom. So we're going to take Gen and we're going to move her down off the machine. A little bit in front. So she gets more of an intense stretch on the bottom. That super stretch of the very far end of the range of motion with a ton of tension is really really good for muscle growth. But it's bad for how Gen's going to feel. Is that two? 15 reps as the goal. Let's hit it. Yep. Three. Very controlled. Two more goal. Almost there. Almost there. Amazing. Slow. Amazing. Slow. Nice and smooth. No explosive. A little senior forward in the forward. Yeah. Hell yeah, Gen. Slow. Slow. Big stretch. If they're another. As if another. So. Rack. Oh. Oh. Oh. The dinosaur hands. Do the dinosaur hands. Oh. I need to drink. But I can't. That was another way up. You don't have to go that slow again. Okay. Two. That's better. That was in. Come on. That was a bullshit. That does not count. Do it again. Ah. That's three. Good. Two more. It's okay to take a break right there. One more. Tacky the moment. Okay. You don't get it. You just drag it and hold. Keep going. Yes. One more. Oh, those engine. No bullshit. No fucking bullshit. Last one. No bullshit. I'm an up in. Yeah. Yeah. Slow. That's it. That's it. Oh. Audible. Yeah. Why does this set? It's like a. Just changing it. Yeah. Yeah. Ahh. Oh god they are so bad. I'm talking about painful memories for your childhood or your biceps. That too. I don't really have a lot of memories. We're gonna make an audible here. That's a shitload of overload. A lot of stimulus. A lot of damage for one exercise. We're gonna go into the next exercise. And so we're gonna get our handy dandy RP training app out. And then we're gonna say, okay, We got first set, we got the second set, we got the third set, fuck all that on the fourth set, now it's time to go on and do barbell curls, roots with an aerogrip. I was in and forward, more, so you want to push them in towards each other, like this, supinate, go ahead, curl, and, and, and, yeah, really? Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, we're just warming up, we're just warming up again, we're starting again. Is this starting? You want some N more out here, like just pushing them towards each other. I don't know, I can physically go in there. You can do it. There you go, yes, exactly, exactly. Stay upright at all times, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest, big chest. Beautiful, good one, good stuff. Up quick, good one, I have need tense. No, yeah, I know. This is the working way, that's absolutely the working way, yeah. Holy shit. Hi. Good, no, I'm not, I don't know why. It's not helping. I'm not good. This is 35 pound bar though. So why? 35 pound. Second exercise, the biceps are pre-cooked already from the three sets of the free motion curls. Now it is an easy bar curls, probably sets of 10 to 15. This is Jared Techni, one of our YouTube viewers, one of our channel members I believe, recommended to be called Jerry Curls, which is not really that far off. And we're going to do in three sets of these, 10 to 15 reps, watch the technique on this. Elbow is going to be super close in together. Chest is going to be up and the slow eccentric almost comes out in front as much as down to give you a crazy psychotic stretch. This exercise, if these had knees, it would be composed of very knee ligaments. Think that through. Let's get going. I was in a forward knee hard and making it hard and making it hard. 11, slow chest up, hit it, finish up. 12, slow as if another. 8, slow. And Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, yeah, that's it. 9, right in the slow, relax. Relaxing. Okay, don't come down. Just stand there for a sec. Let's finish up three good ones, like them in. Good set up, Chad. Go to the toilet. Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, yeah. 2, last one coming up. Good technique, only, Jen. Good technique, only. Up, up. And then slow as if another. Chest up. Oh, that's what we want. Rack. Chest up makes it hard. Oh, huh. Try fix your hair really good. No, no. Oh, there you go. Your hair is fixed. I was just fucking with it. No, it's not. I can't. This is pathetic. What is going on? I don't have. You do use pain. I say there's a good and a yin and a yin to crying during the workout. The bad part isn't sad. What's sad? The good part is running makeup. Fucking. Is that okay for me to say? Yeah. I'm not going to say I was enjoying it for that. I might cry right now. Good start crying and start curling. Three left. And slow. Control. I don't know what. I did it. Again. I did it. Up. I did it. Up. Slow. Control. Last one. Good technique or it doesn't count Jen get your marbles together. Okay. Go. And you're strong. Yes. As if another. Slow. Slow. God dammit. Slow. Beautiful. Rack. Oh man. That was so good. That was so good. Oh my god. Those fucked up. She gets angry. Fuck you. Whoa. Whoa. These people are nothing to do with it. Fuck them. Just sorry. I'm just hear me sing this shit. I don't know what to do. I'm really flaky. I do that. I'm really flaky. For the Biceps as a whole. This is funny. Low pump moderate pump our amazing pump. Is there one above that? Neither. Nothing amazing. Okay. Folks. It's a little bit more of a press. It's not the worst thing in the world, but not ideal. If you take the elbows and push them in, the front belts can't really contribute to the movement. It's more of an extension rather than a press. We're going to be doing very strict, especially elbows in on the way down. On the way up, it's okay if they come out a little bit. On the way down is really, really critical. Deep stretch every time. That's probably 10 to 20 more times. It's really good. It's really good. It's really good. It's really good. It's really good. It's really good. It's really good. It's really good. That's probably 10 to 20 more, like 10 to 15 desuctin. Once those are done, we're going to finish off a whole thing with a bunch of pushups, Super sets, but I think God right now that I'm not the one to do it, let's get into it. 10 slow. Okay, well... Big push, 11, 1 more slow and forward. Up, good. Good! Back! Okay. Thanks. Okay, I could do this. Let's go. Let's go. Nine, one more, Jen. Let's get superpowers going. Turn on that wonder woman shit. And then down. Yep. Big push. Go. Go, damn you. Yes. Good. Yep. That's it. Oh, you're a little too old. Hold up, hold up. You just getting nowhere. He tried to push by. You ready yet? You want a little bit rest. I'm not gonna stop this thing. It's a how well can you do in your next set. No, no, no, come on, let's go. Yes, six. Watch it. You got it. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Push, push, push. Seven. Two more. Way to go slow, jab. Deep. Deep. Good. Good. Big push. Come on. Oh shit. Get it. Get it. Back. Go. You said eight, then you're gonna, baby, do nine. I did say nine, but then eight. Eight is good enough. Yeah, okay, thanks. And so far, you physically couldn't lift the weight of your. Yeah. Remember that thing about not being a bitch with like regular pushups? Neep pushups? Treat me like a mopedch. I guess we're going to do something. I need to do chick pushups. Oh, yeah. I'm a triumphant. How am I doing? Tasty to do those next. My RP training app, Alpha Build, says it's time to superset pushups from a deficit with pushups through from the knees. So Jan is going to do three sets, but kind of six sets, three supersets. First one is deficit pushups. The second is also deficit pushup, but from the knees, once her ability to go from the toes gives out, this is the end of the workout. Try to step to already pre-fatee, pain time equals gain time. Let's get it done. Let's fight. Look at the perfect. It's got two more stomach up, Jan. Six. Let it get it. Go. Seven knees. Oh, yeah. Mungin. Two. One more. Mungin. Up. Up. That's it. Rest. Up. Up. That's it. Rest. Up. Okay. I have the lyrics. Oh, it hurts. Only Jan and Gary has enough intensity to make arm training make her delirious. Push. Come on. That's it. Okay. Do the knees. Knees. That was four good ones. That little break, taking a little break, taking a break, breathe a bit. Two to three. Let's go. Yes. One. Come on, Jan. Up. Up. Done. I'm no bitch. Okay. You let me do push-ups from the knees. I did some from my toes. That's all that matters. I did some from my toes. Oh. Stop the video guy. Have you been offered an emcee to my day to die, everybody? Yes. And peg. $1,000. $5,000. $5,000. $1,000. I'm going to choke you to death. Take the money. It's money, can't. Oh. Great stress. One more. One more. One more. I think you're going to do that. Good. Good. Rast. Nice. Long time. 10 second. Oh, God, two more, Jan. Rast. Rast. Rast. Good. Okay. Up. Push. Yeah. It's right. It's right here. My arms are stuck. Yep. Fuck. I'm not going to let you in. You need help. What is this shit? That was legit. Oh, my God. I got tired just watching that workout. Jared thoughts. Amazing. Great technique as always. Jim pushes. Pushes the limits every time. Pushes the limits. I don't fucking go further. Yeah. Fucking nuts. That's my parole officer told me. Different kind of situation. Folks, Jen has all kinds of social media. If you're into this look that we call muscle mommy, you're going to want to see a whole lot more of her. And you know who you are to get in here.

Okay. Thank you. Never again.
