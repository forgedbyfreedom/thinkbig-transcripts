Oh God, they just... I'm not the hurt. Oh, choose this. I'm trying to set it up. I'm trying to set it up. I'm trying to set it up. Hello, folks. Myself, I am Dr. Mike. And today we have two special guests in an old person I'll introduce in a second. Our first special guest is Joycey. And she is an extraordinary, but kicker, supreme. She's like, I bet I can run through a workout that you and Dr. Mike cook up for legs. No problem. I want to even sweat. And he's like, well, I've got a shot up. Get me on your channel. If you ran to me, tail tucked between his legs. I calmed him down. We got her on the channel. She's like, what, hold up. I don't ever go anywhere alone. And we're like, okay, do you have like an agent or a manager? She's like, I have a defense contractor with me. This is Brandon. He has a PhD in mechanical engineering. And his job is literally to work for the evil military industrial complex, which keeps you safe. You hypocrite mother. I'll peep that myself. We are going to do legs, which might be in two or three exercises. We see how far these young kids get into this. Any last parting thoughts before you atomize the weight into the atmosphere? Did you bring your birthday? No, but there's a bag over there. So I know. Got a lot of nice bags. Shoot in these little eyes. You're a gym bag. Oh, you mean my bag. That's disgusting. Let's get into the workout. All right, folks. We are going to do a 45 degree back raise. Interesting call. Interesting name for an exercise. We are going to be doing it to target hamstrings. There's a couple different variations you can do. We recommend taking your machine and putting it on stilts. And the reason for that is we wanted to be pretty vertical so that more of the tension gets in part and during stretch. If you have a totally horizontal back raise, then the peak contraction is the hardest part. As you go down gravity pulls you less and less. If you're all the way down at the bottom, you actually get nothing. We want more of the tension on the leg. Part of the contraction, which is why we lift this up. This makes the force curve better for this exercise. Just don't make sure the shit. Make sure the shit doesn't slip out half or you threw and you kill yourself. Here's how we're going to be doing this exercise. You want to lower this platform so that it clears the hips so you can get actual hip rotation. You don't want to platform so high that it ends up being articulation of the spine because that's not the hamstring function. That's your spinal rack. So you're going to take your feet. You're going to push them all the way back to get a very firm perch at the top. And then you're going to lock your knees out or almost completely out. You're going to keep your lower back arched. You're going to descend slowly under control until a painful stretching of hamstrings. Try to keep your tummy out and your back arched and you're going to come up for the peak contraction. And slowly descend again all the way down and then come up. A way to challenge yourself with this exercise is the first few reps. If you're holding away it's all same. But if you're doing this with just body weight, first few reps you reach your hands out. To create a longer lever arm and more tension on the hips. When you get tired, bring your arms in. Shorter lever arm and then it's easier. It's almost like a mechanical superset type situation. Give that a shot and let's get started. Good. I want a more convincing lock out. Squeeze at the top all the way up. Yeah. Couple more. Two more. Look. And one more. And up. Throw the dumbbell down. Continue. Yes. Try looking up. Look up. Yes. For lock out one last rep. Go lock it. One more. One more more. You'll shake your strong. Let's go. Lock it out. Good enough. Good stuff. Not bad. We're getting out as always embarrassing. I don't have hamstrings to get out with. Alright. Folks. What you're seeing is we have them do a dumbbell. We tried doing a barbell but the supports are hitting that's unfortunate. They're holding a dumbbell here right at the chest. When they're done with being able to go close to failure with the dumbbell, we switch to dumping the dumbbell and just doing free because if the dumbbell weight is gone, you've bought yourself some more effective reps. It's literally, I think it's called a mechanical drop set or something like that. In this case, it's just a conventional drop set but it's a really cool thing you can expose yourself to doing the 45 degree back raise. The situation with people think, oh, I've got to tell you I'm done. In this case, if it's just as easy as dropping the dumbbell and you get three or four more amazingly effective reps, why not do it? Also, the stimulus to fatigue ratio on those reps is going to be really high because the mind muscle connection is already so set in. Typically, once you're doing something heavy, if you switch quickly to doing something lighter, the mind muscle connection explodes because your body kind of feels overqualified to do the coordination and you can really focus on torching your muscles. Give this a shop. Don't do too many sets at the beginning. You'll burn your hamstring right off the body and the corner will have to write that in this report. Patient, presenter, corpse presented with no hamstrings. Burn marks included. Let's do more workouts. Shut up, my full convincing lock out. Oh, shit. Let's go. Let's go. We're here to work today. But forward. Yes. Rack. Good. Stop. And the embarrassing crawl out begins. Oh, my. Awesome. Awesome. Good job. Awesome stuff. Awesome stuff. And awesome stuff. If you keep your feet a little more straight and you just get that because your feet kept going like this and you're turning because it was getting hard. You're trying to leverage yourself to basically make it easier. So keeping your feet here and trying to force your knees open. It's going to hit your hamstrings even more. You'll get less reps. But it'll be more effective for the hamstrings. Okay. All the way up. Seeing position hits open. Yes. One more track. All of your transition. Go. Hit it. Look up. That's your chest that way. There you go. Here we go. Hip so thin knees and position there. Yeah. Yeah. Look up. Look up. Saved it. There you go. There you go. Hip so thin knees and position there. Yeah. Look up. Look up. Saved it. That's it. I really felt it. Yeah. I was a modification. Made it more difficult. Yeah. Definitely more difficult. But keeping that feet. At least the toe. Yeah. Getting it from your knees instead is. Yeah. It keeps it on the same. Because like I said, it's just like, okay, these. I'm getting really tired of my hamstrings. So I'm going to start pointing my toes out and leverage myself to use. Maybe a little more glue or whatever. So just really really lock in place and get it from here. You're going to feel the hamstrings are going to get way more fatigued way more quickly. And then just a little drop the dumbbell at five reps a week after. No big deal. Okay. I'm going to get some of my strength. Because at least for me, I can feel like as my feet were going out, I was using more and more collout. Exactly. Exactly. All the way up. Yes. One more. Good one. Finish that wrap. And then as if another slow. Jump. Again. Good. Oh shit, man. This is all based stuff. Let's go all the way up and back. Yes. One more and you're done. That's it. Oh yeah. Good start. Good job. We need a lower. I don't know if I'm going to get out. Ha ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha. Jesus Christ. One more. One more. Good one. Come on. Knees. All the way up. Yes. And dump. Good. There you go. Let's get two more at least. Come on. Forward. Cast off. Up. Come on. Up. There you go. All right. Good job. Oh, this is getting really embarrassing. Yeah. Kind of just kind of melt out. Just melt away. Oh, my back is so tight. Excellent. Feel free to lay down. Ah. Already. So soon. Oh, my back. This might be that tomorrow. This is so much harder in person. I'm going to be doing sets of, oh, I hope kind of 10 to 15 reps here. We will be absolutely doing some higher reps. This is a great exercise. My reps. This resting at the top. I'm going to be doing sets of, oh, I hope kind of 10 to 15 reps here. We will absolutely be doing some higher reps. This is a great exercise. I'm going to be doing some higher reps. This resting at the top of the pendulum is actually pretty easy. You get a whole back pad and you just kind of lean back, lock out your legs safely. And you can just chill for a few seconds and then do a few more reps a few more reps. If you're reps here, it's the big kicker for this exercise. The beginning of the movement at the very top. Once you unlock your needs, the force is insane. And then it drops off towards the bottom. Not the ideal strength. Perfect. Great variation to try outside of leg presses and hacks. You have to be ready for that force in position at the top. Otherwise it will collapse you. You can tell someone is doing a pendulum squat wrong when they just fall into the ship. And then rocket backed up and fall into it. Must control the center of the whole time, which is going to be a lot harder to do at the top. Then it will be at the bottom. It's going to heal like your quads of caring, which is exactly what we want. Let's get to work. Don't go anywhere. Don't you fucking reach for that hand. There is no hand. Chest up. Control. Control. Two. Rest. Rest. Rest. Last one. Begin. All day. Chest up. Slow. Slow. Up. There's a force. It's the... Ooh. You're going to be okay. Really stressed with quads. Good stuff, man. Great. Good stuff. Last one. Again. Control. No rush. Keep. Keep us one. Go. Come on. Go. Go. Go. Go. Up. We only do it for you. Holy sh! You broke the machine. Rest. Last one. Go. Control. That endurance. No bouncing at the bottom. Control. Control. Control. Up. Push. Back. She's like, I'm not doing any more. Hell yeah. The melt. The melt is up. Kind of a little more time. What do you just asked her? What do you want to lay down? Here. How do you explain her before you? What do you want to lay on this? We're doing this last roll. So I need to get the special. Let's go. Once you've gone, we bring it over here. After you're done, I'm here. You're going to walk up and there's going to be a little platform. You're going to step halfway on the platform and halfway off. You're going to throw your hands up like this. You're going to do bodyweight squats with a positive bottom until we say good enough. Strong heels. You go down faster. Control. Control. Control. Gentle touch. Up fast. Yes. You got it. You got it right out. No crawling. Stand up. You can do this. Very good. Stay as upright as you can. Squat down. Knees forward as good. Deeper. Deeper God. Come on. Good. You got to try. Come on. Come on. I'm going to do this. A couple more reps. Go. Up. Again. Down. We're at your back. Fucking shit, Joyce. You know what I'm talking about. That work. Keep your chest up. Squat deep. Up fast. Like an athlete. Down. Down. You got to go. This is where we come to get muscle gain. Keep your chest up. Keep control. Up fast. Up. One more. Down. Right away. Slow. Slow control. Keep your chest. Keep your chest up. Up. That's it. Like, Squid Games. We got my fuckers crawling over to the camera. Help me camera guy. Save me. These been instructed not to talk to anyone. Deep. Stretch. Pull. Go. Go. Rock. Rast. What you're going anywhere. One left. Fuck. You got it on there. You got it. That's good. Time. Begin. Jared's got you. He's right there. We're giving that. You got it on there. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. Speed. Yes. Rast. Boom. Up. So again, down. We're here for the pain, Brandon. That's why we're here. Up. Up. Down. Right away. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Wait for it. Up. Down. Keep your chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Come on. Up. One more. Down. You got this. You fucking got this. Keep it chest up. Up. You're done. Trash against. There. No. Trash against. My clothes. My clothes. I'll hurt. That's great, man. Can I throw up out of my quads? Oh, they thought they're going to pop. Oh, God. They just have a hurt. Oh. Jesus. Oh. Let's try sitting on. Oh, my God. I've only thought that like in my calves. You're a fucking machine. You're a fucking company. You just do the work of fucking hurting other people because you're the fucking man. Folks, sometimes the outro's right themselves. Brandon, joy-see. Would you guys think of the workout? I'm pretty tall. I didn't throw up. Yeah. Nobody threw up. Nobody died. That's mostly victory. Close. But it's still journeys out. Jared. That's great. They freaking. Good job, coach. I took some but. Folks, it has been a pleasure having you on the channel. Go into the world and be excellent at your professions. And also marginally more fit after this workout. marginally. All right. That's it. Folks. See you next time.
