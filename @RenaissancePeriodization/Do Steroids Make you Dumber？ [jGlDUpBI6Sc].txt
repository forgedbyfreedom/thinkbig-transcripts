Hey folks, Dr. Mike Isrtle here for Renaissance Periodization. The question for today's video is, do steroids make you Dumber? Now I'll give you a following, couple of seconds, to make any and all jokes in my clearly abusing ass go. All right, and I earn them. Here we go, do steroids make you Dumber. How would we begin to illustrate something like this? How do we answer this question as evidence-based folks? Well, one is through theoretical mechanisms, specifically, you know, is there anything in the literature that shows that steroids might cause some kind of harm to the nervous systems and neurons and stuff like that? I think if it says like oh, trans seems to be or testosterone, seems to be poisonous to neurons in some context, it's kind of like oh shit, maybe it actually does hurt the nervous system and by that method because the nervous system is the seed of all intelligence, maybe it hurts that as well. Okay, possible. Number two is actual experimental illustrations those mechanisms. I guess it's fun. It's totally fine to posit that oh, I think Andrews and hi-doses would be neurodegenerative, but if you actually test that and Andrews and hi-doses are neurodegenerative, at least in cell culture, then you can say, wow okay, like this harm actually occurs in some contexts. Not sure that it actually decreases intelligence and users in the real world, but at least some mounting insight into that. Number three is this is a very big one is a direct observation of cognitive differences between users and non-users because if you, you know, say, steroids make you domer, but you compare a steroid users, non- steroid users and non- steroid users are no smarter than steroid user-like, well, I guess all the theoretical stuff just kind of goes out the window. Mind you, there's, you know, here's a perfect example of how that breaks down. Alcohol absolutely is neurodegenerative, and if you bathe cells in petri-dition, alcohol, it fucking kills all of them, if they're nervous system cells, it really does a whole lot of damage. We know that alcohol causes, you know, they kills your brain cells, that's actually a true thing that they're very, very, very popular. But when you look at people who drink you do glasses of wine versus non-drinkers versus people who drink tendrings to light, you know, tendrings night, yeah, clearly they're going to have lower intelligence. Not that much lower as you would expect, it takes a significant amount of alcoholism to really do damage to your brain and that capacity, but you know, two drinks a day, two glasses of wine versus zero, there's actually no evidence at all to suggest that that much alcohol reduces your intelligence. So it's not quite clear right off hand that we, you know, could say, oh, because, you know, we've seen like 10 articles, ways in which testosterone, other addrogens are bad for nerves in general, a bad for neural structures, that's not immediately clear that some kind of steroid use would have to make you dumber because without alcohol, their relationship doesn't seem to be like that up to pretty high levels of drink, right? So we would like to see direct observation of cognitive differences. If you could have some research that says, look, any more than one and then two and then three and then plus drinks, you just lowers your IQ the entire time over across large samples of population, but I don't know, we fuck maybe that's because of the alcohol, maybe not, it could be correlation, not causation, but be sure at least would like to see correlation here, right? Number four, sort of trying to unweave that mystery between correlation and causation at least a little bit is potentially linking the degree of intellectual decline with or cognitive differences put more specifically with dose and duration. Like if you have from some research that people who used very small amounts of antigen for a short time had very small or unnotable decrements in ability or they're just a score average as bad as highs you expect on IQ testing versus if people ran 10 years of gear at three grams on average per week and they're the ones that are like the most cognitive deficient like, it's a bit more evidence the fact that maybe something there is going on, but hold on the last thing is an obviation of potential errors and to all of the stuff I just said there's lots of ways in which even if the relationship seemed very clear it turns out that might not be the reality that steroids and andadrogens actually do make a dummy. For example, if you have really good research to say as a kid the more gear someone takes and for longer they took it the dummy are. You say, okay, fucking clearly the gear makes you dumb or maybe maybe but maybe it's actually that dumb ass motherfucker stupid people to begin with make the choice to take five grams of gear for 10 year straight and smart people just don't do things like that on average. So you're actually getting a selection effect and no direct effect. Maybe it's a combination of the two. Maybe dumb ass people start taking way more gear and take it for longer anyway and making their stupidity problem even worse and smart people if they do take gear they do get less smart but they're usually more responsible with it usually more moderate and those they don't see as big of a hit so that that window between the two groups can really open up and also is at the drugs themselves or isn't something else you know every time you take gear lots of other stuff happens that's not the gear itself that you could maybe control for. For example, steroid users have on average much higher blood pressure than non steroid users and to most people is fucking insane as who use gear do not control their blood pressure and then we've made an attempt to do it. We've had lots of videos on this channel where we've seen people you blood pressure's really bad you don't let it get out of hand. So maybe it's the thing that actually high blood pressure chronically is neurodegenerative we actually know already that that's the case so that's definitely a part of the puzzle and maybe that it counts for 100% of the variants we don't know so we have to make sure before we say yes it's for sure the endrogens we have to make sure to at least try to get obvious out some of the obvious errors so this is kind of the task that isn't front of us and now we I think yep go directly to the literature which I'll have if you guys pause this at any time you can get the the you can copy the link or whatever directly in your shit. I will say a trick to this I don't know if Android does this because I'm an Apple man and I don't soup down these Android filth but if you take a screenshot of this on your phone and you zoom in you just open the screenshot and your photos on your iPhone you can actually text select all the stuff and you can just go right to the article. We may be able to dump some of these links into the description but if don't get to that then for sure just click through here but here we go each one of these points that I just described points one through five we're going to take a look at the state of the evidence for them so first is theoretical mechanisms is the as are any evidence in literature that steroids might my cause neural harm the answer is absolutely yes adrogens may cause neural degradation via apoptotic and necrotic pathways which means apoptosis is when the steroids basically tell the satellite hey you should kill yourself and the cells like thia and it just degrades its structure but in a clean way necrosis is the cell kind of dies in more natural death it's not program cell death it just falls apart can't do its job anymore and regions might have a role in that as well so okay all right definitely not good news for me so okay this is a definitely a thing number two do we have experimentally illustrated mechanisms so of any studies actually illustrated that this occurs the answer is yes there's a bunch of studies there seems to be a potentially similar way in which hydrogen exposure occurs or affects the brain maybe to something like Parkinson's you know men do are are more affected more by Parkinson's and men do have way more of a lifetime exposure to testosterone which is the original androgen and so there's some decent evidence here and there's a lot of studies you can look at potentially to see if you're going to and weave the rainbow on that but okay so we have theoretical mechanisms check we have experimentally illustrated mechanisms check okay not not great news so far let's see where this goes next we need direct observation of cognitive differences do we actually have evidence the steroid user is dumber the answer is yes okay there's a few studies that have looked at this in a couple of different ways a quote one really quick long-term and metabolic engine exterior users showed no significant differences from non-users on measures of response speed sustained attention and verbal memory but on visual spatial memory however a S users performed significantly more poorly than non-users within the user group visual spatial performance showed a significant negative correlation with total lifetime a S dose okay the real bad news of that is maybe something going on especially with visual spatial performance the not so bad news potential glimmer of hope is that generally when you have a single substance that's very general mechanism of action degrading the brain in a way that like it kills off the above in nerve cells you just generally tend to see a decline in global ability so for example you have like lead poisoning and your IQ is reduced like that they didn't basically hits every part of your intelligence you'll be worse at everything that requires intellect with engine exposure maybe this is just very very preliminary work not a ton of evidence it seems that it leaves a lot of your intelligence alone but only hits you in a specific place and remember that males and females are actually considerably different in visual spatial performance and maybe there's some interaction of brain and hormone there that specifically toggles that switch right maybe in a sense the brain makes you the steroids make you more energized or feminized in that part of your brain that is more responsible for for visual spatial but but this at the best case is this is not ideal news the worst case is that like a couple studies in the future will show that you for sure get done with this way and maybe other ways to so okay we ask the direct observation of cognitive differences we have we have not ideal next is their link between cognitive differences and the dose and duration of Android application the people who take steroids for longer do they have worse performance in their cognition some research suggests no some research suggests yes I would say it's very mixed in this regard sometimes you know there are some analyses they do where they kind of do a brain aging index see how old your brain is and they sort of found out that longitudinal analysis revealed no evidence of increased brain aging overall in the antibiotic engineering steroid user group but accelerated brain aging was seen with longer AS exposure that doesn't mean they gave people AS or animals AS or antibiotic engineering steroids and just like measured the shit that's a self report so there's a big confounder there there's it's not explained by other substance use but they only ask certain things it it and it's not explained by general cognitive abilities which is interesting it is kind of good news because while steroid users some of the probably most high steroid users there is some research to show or some insight to show that they may have more aged brains at the brains of this big an aged faster and you can see some guys very off-hand remark here by me then don't take this too seriously but guys that run a shit little gear you can look at their face face and you're like what the fuck how old are you like I'm probably I don't look all out young and so gear seems to kind of maybe age you a little faster but it said that there's actually no connection here with general cognitive decline so while brain aging index goes up it doesn't actually seem to drag down your IQ which is mixed mixed and there's other studies that do say yes actually there is a link of cognitive versus between dose and duration and and how bad the intellectual deficit becomes so I would say this is mostly not so right news but with maybe a couple of little silver linings now sort of lastly how do we know guys taking grams of gear for decades aren't just done as fuck to begin with right and here we have a quote from one of these studies the typical antibiotic energetic steroid abuser is a male poly substance abuser which means here's not the only thing they're doing who has poor self esteem that's you baby everybody laughing at you now dog ha ha ha okay maybe it's me poor self shut up Scott the video guy laughing back there poor self esteem poor school performance and cluster B personality disorder or trades look that up it's fun to look up who may or may not participate in organized sport so with it it's actually people using steroids more are not necessarily the jock people there people who like maybe on average more help like a chip on their shoulder and aren't so smart to begin with and so no study can have instantly rules out the fact that it could all be selection bias it is possible I'll get to this later I consider it unlikely but possible that steroids have no negative effect on your cognition as far as general tall jumps is concerned that it's just like you're done a shit you'll take a lot of gear which is at least partially true right so it's certainly a factor that people who are stupid are decided to do stupid are shit with steroids and usually take more of them and for longer and don't take as many of the risk preserving mechanisms as they can that's for sure true the real question is how much of the difference in intelligence between users and non users does that explain is it all of it as a part of it is definitely part we're not really sure how much of a part the thing is is that we know that people who use antibiotics for a long time especially recklessly have a higher long term exposure to oxidative stress they generally take anti-estrogens sometimes a lot and there's a lot of chronic high blood pressure involved and we know that each one of these three can have very profound neurodegenerative effects most of these three have much more intense neurogenerv effects than any antigen has so there's definitely stuff involved and almost certainly some antibiotic antigenic steroids are much more neurodegenerative neurotoxic whatever where do you want to use than others so for example you know if you are like hey I wonder who I'll protect my brain but I'm going to take only trend and try and all the time there are direct studies that show compared to most of the drugs they studied against trend as the worst for your brain so there's definitely some nuance here and we haven't mediated all the potential errors so what are some implications here this is my reading of the literature as it stands at the time this video was released as always as good scientists we have to be ready to modify our positions with incoming evidence okay so my position is tentative they're tentative you know so it's my reading so maybe in an accurate read it if I get this wrong just like an unsubscribe from this channel so you never I'll just stop post jk so first I got point a through point c point e yeah five points point a there is no body of very strong evidence that shows that steroid use makes you dumber so it's not like old for sure it's not bad oh there you go alright but there sure are lots of candidate mechanisms for such a thing happening and we can't just rule it all out like I don't worry brother just watch your cholesterol and you'll be okay nah and there's plenty of decently controlled correlative literature which should at least make us like do the the people's eyebrow at it and be like oh no we're it that's not good you know that's not good the evidence is convincing but they sure are a lot of hints if I had to bat on it I had to bat money on it I would say my best guess is that long-term adjunct use does reduce some factors of intelligence some of your sub abilities of your general intelligence if not the underlying general intelligence factor itself though that is also possible and I wouldn't rule that out either so I'm saying some kinds of intelligence I think it's probable that Andrews do degrade and it's possible they degrade by some small but notable margin you're overall general they may not do this directly so indirect mechanisms like oxidative stress heromatase inhibition and chronic high blood pressure are likely involved I would bet they're involved to a pre-highest which brings us to the last point point E of what I think your best bets are in the situation clearly hands down best bet number one is just don't use steroids don't use androgens if you really need to be sharp for work and you love being of whatever intelligence you are and you don't want to get any dumber just don't use ananders right getting dumber makes everything you can imagine worse everything you can imagine feel free to debate me in the comments below I may we may find one or two exceptions but generally I think being smarter is better for almost every outcome if you do choose to use anandrogens or you currently using anandrogens like I should I'm a competitive bodybuilder the fact of my supposed to do just quit my sport you may be able to do some things that guard against this or minimize the effect to some extent here they are first use the smallest doses you can to get the result that you need don't overblast gear that is also a good idea for fifty trillion other reasons mostly your health but then this case may come in handy as well next is use drugs that are the least likely to do neurodegenerative harm use more premable and less tremblone I know crazy the more you know right next is do not use aromatase inhibitors at all preferably or use them for as little as possible if you use them to get dialed in for a show they probably are neurodegenerative probably much more than steroids so they're not a good idea I've seen many cycles of pros and national with a year-round smash anti-estrogens that's the fucking worst idea you can have stop doing next is take met foreman and otherwise reduce overall oxidative stress that means eating healthy that means experiencing less life stress everything after you bring your oxidative stress down get as much sleep as possible sleep seems to be super protective against a lot of the stuff and very neurogenerative and if you degrade your quality of sleep bad things can happen and all these things can become worse measure and control your blood pressure via any means necessary including blood pressure drugs the amount of research that shows blood pressure drugs reduce your intelligence is zero the amount of inference for that is also zero so you having a little blood pressure makes you better often every single fucking way you can imagine and potentially keeps you smarter for longer so kind of an operator there and then wait as long as possible to use drugs so if you're you know you're 20 years old and you're getting really good and really jack you want to start competing a bodybuilding go on man I just want to jump in and start using gear don't way too you're like 25 or 27 or something really tap out your natural gains go as long as you can without drugs and then when you use them use them with a buff recommendations which is like use less of them and use the safer substances and take care of the rest of your stuff and watch your health your blood pressure etc and then on the tail end get the fuck out of suit as you can so I'll end this on a personal anecdote I'm 38 years old I gave myself more or less hard-ish cut off of like age 42 to try to do whatever it is I'm going to do in bodybuilding I have a couple goals I'll keep them to myself the big one is just show up on stage looking like yeah like last time I competed I get it real close I just need maybe a few more shows around like oh yeah and those are real walnut lutes you know I really fucking peaked I really did it as soon as I'm done with that and or age roughly 42 hits as I understand things to be now I'm getting off all the gear that isn't TRT and I'm fucking dropping bodyweight from like like 245 right now I'm going to go down to like 190 within a few months if I make it this far you guys will see that happen in real life and there's a new you will not see me at age 51 red in the face from running grams of trend that won't happen so not only should you start drugs late if you're ever going to do them don't do them if you're going to do them start them late take us few as you can watch your health and when you're done doing your bodybuilding thing generally people in the early 40s can no longer match the peak of their um their physique that they achieved in their you're right around age 40 late 30s to age 40s when most people mature um once you're done especially in your mid to late 40s get the just stop taking gear and get the buck out that's my plan hopefully it's your plan to yeah series shit we'll see how this happens and maybe in a couple years we'll see some updated literature and I'll make another one of these videos yeah consider this mine a gruff the the crime dog moment of folks don't do drugs see next time
