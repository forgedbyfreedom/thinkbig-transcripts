He just had a f***ing 30 minute conversation with a chef when he's prompting, but he doesn't even know what he's cooking. And they don't know why he's eating it. Boom, Acro's, no calories, no goal is eating a fat loss phase. I'm also gonna keep the f***ing on on. Damn it, I'm getting sick just thinking about the shit. The f***ing out of my face. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for NSound's Periodization. I'm also an exercise and sports science professor at Leemon College in the Bronx, and the creator of the RP Hiperchrophy app. And I'm here for Part 2. I can't believe it. Two praise, Mark Wahlberg's workout, a different one this time. Hopefully one that's better than last time. If you missed us last time, pour acid into your eyes before you click that link. Let's get started. Get out what you put in and you have to be disciplined. You have to want it and put in the time. Respect, all true so far, A plus so far. Do you see the results it makes perfect sense? It's just what you do. Oh, it's sponsored by Performance Inspired. Excellent. You're by a bird fat. You definitely have to build muscle and for that to happen. You have to give yourself some work. The way I kind of break it down for people is it's... What the f***ing is Mark, you aren't doing in there. Ultra fast, focused on the concentric reps. These are not good reps for us. You want to go down slower. Maybe even pause at the bottom and come up quickly. D plus. So for most people, they have between three to six hours a week to actually work out and exercise. So far so good. If you only have three hours a week, then focus only on strength training. That's really the thing. You know? Yep. Even though I'm trying to pay attention to this while Mark and Mark slaughteres, whatever dog shit, pneumatic leg thing that is terrible technique, coming down fast, going halfway down for the f***ing knows what's going on anymore. A lot of people say, oh, I don't even have time for the elliptical machine. The one thing you'll notice with the gym and what we set up here with Mark is we really don't do any of that stuff. That's... As my known means clear what it is you actually do. I look, Mark is doing another circus act. Bullshit exercise. The train's nothing. The mouse wheel stuff isn't the mode of action for fat loss for that 45 year old. Yep. What is trainer saying is right spot on. If you have a limited time of training, restraining is key. And then if you have more time, potentially you can do some either more resistance training, more cardio. So this is good stuff. So far, let's not get too excited yet. Even for someone a kid that's trying to get faster in his high school stuff, that the mouse wheel isn't taking there. It really is good old fashioned strength training that's missing. I love it. And I love it if this guy actually prescribed good old fashioned strength training. But I bet that's not what's going to happen. Whatever world you live in, strength training is really the biggest piece that's going to sing today. Now the f***er, you don't live in that world because watch what you're about to do. You want to build something that's going to last? You're going to do it the right way. Marky Mark, I love that quote. I also don't really know what it means. Nonetheless, I like the spirit. I'm just trying to stay positive guys. It's only a matter of time until his turn's negative. It's f***er. How to build with all the right material. Yes. All the right material. Mark, the material you use is just what your body makes protein out of. It's not up to you. When a build some quick fast over time is going to break down. You're going to get injured, hurt. All the stuff's not good for you. I just don't know what the analogy extends to it this week. I don't see it. No, I don't know Mark. I want to build a form of this level, so I'm in my 60s. I'm so in the middle of how to do it. Still in it all natural. What? Oh, that's right. It's also f***ing protein at or some shit like that. Do it all naturally. I like how he said that for no reason at all. Totally out of context, slightly suspicious. I believe he's all natural. Sure. They camp. When I refer to camp, that's the time period it takes us to really prepare for a role. They saw him last camp, taking 12 weeks to really drop the same amount of body fat that we've dropped this night. In six weeks, definitely tells me that this performance is fired is off the charts better. Okay, so this is a commercial for performance inspired, which I guess is a protein. And their cleaning, the marquee mark, was able to drop a similar amount of body fat in six weeks that it took him 12 weeks last time to do. I think it's almost sure you proteins, supplements, don't have that much of an effect. Considering that the only variable that's really different. So, marquee mark seems to like to dump barbells on his chest, no eccentric control. Hey coach, shut the f*** up about performance fired. Coach, you're athlete. F*** is the supplementation. But I'm seeing the results, you know, that's a thing. You're working hard, training, eating right, taking the right self-ness. And then you see the results in the morning. In the morning, I assume this happens all in one day, marquee mark. And of course overnight. Instead of feeling discouraged, you feel like, oh god, well, I'm going to work twice as hard the next day. Twice is hard. And then twice is hard the next day. And then twice after that, it's like a f***ing Moore's law of training out here. It's easier to stay in shape than it is to get in shape. That's true, good point. Not exactly what I'd call inspirational, but nonetheless, let's evaluate these tricep extensions. Just kidding, onto more protein commercial. This video sucks. Our exercises are multi-plating. Oh god, battle ropes, multi-plainer, which again means almost nothing. Certainly not a concern for an actor, moving on. Right now, marks doing a lunch pattern, but he's also doing the ropes at the same time. Technically, that's in the same plane, but at this point, who's counting? So a lot of the motions that we do in this particular camp, hasn't been anything about just the normal, like, squat deadlift. It's not that, because you're not qualified to coach that ship. It's not that only because of the size that we're trying to get marked too. So really, a lot of the complex movements have whittled his body size down, body fat down. Folks, the movements you do have zero impact on your size. Your size is always an everywhere up to your nutrition. If you train with weights and you eat a lot, you're going to gain size. If you train with weights and you eat very little, you're going to lose size. Mostly fat size. I very highly doubt that if Mark focused on actual compound heavy basics, like allegedly is a good idea. According to this man, except not this time, he would just be really chiseled and really lean, and it wouldn't make his waist grow at all, and has his being implied here. First, rate awful. In a minute, Lee, we always add jump rope. Always add jump rope. Everyone knows that. So that's kind of like how we do all our moves. Two big complex moves, then jump rope. And it's worked out great for us this cap. I feel like he's just making stuff up on the spot. If you don't want to move, we don't have to move. And we add the jump rope. Which is great. So far. Cool. Is there like a principle there or anything? Nothing we can learn? Sweet. Oh, raise. There he goes. Walking around with a f***ing dumbbell for no reason. This was in the last video. It still doesn't do anything. It's a 70 pound suitcase right there. Not any power. That's a big suitcase. A training to be a f***ing hotel dust clerk. Alright, folks. If you want to see the full uncensored version of this video, much more extra content. Some stuff we did not put into this video. Our members area is Afra Graves. Give that a shot. And maybe we'll see you guys there. Hey coach, get in there and coach a real movement. Like a pull-up or a row or a bench press or a curl or a squat. Actually get your client. Best, most efficient results. Stop just watching them walk around and pointless patterns. Pointlessly for no point at all. Hello, it's a fire. Can you hear me? Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Mark is just mumbling nonsense at this point. He's a trippy guy. Oh, the trainers doing it too. Come on. This comes very close to being just random ways to do work. Like, you ran out of good ideas as a trainer. And you just f***ing just like, hey, like just, uh... Just walk around or move around. Just do this. It'll be great. And Mark's like, sweating and tired. He's like, oh, this must be great. He's being ripped off. So the beat behind this one is that the offset load forces your court to reliance. So yes, sure does. And how will that make me jacked? How will that make me lean? How will that make me look more like Mark? The f***ing thing that the figure ate behind me and how to make it. Really created dynamic of the hips. What? Yeah, it's pure, very athletic. Athletes move a lot faster than this sir. Have you ever seen a sport being done? I didn't want to turn your guard off. There is no sport called Figure 8, Candle Bell Walking. There is no sport that looks remotely like it. Your whole body had to respond to that weight. I've never seen someone over-explained the f***ing out of you carry a weight around in a random f***ing pattern. Go ahead, sit, triple force. Ooh, sit, triple force. You got your real scientist. So it's huge coaxes. Huge core exercise. The biggest. Because core is really important. Because reason. Consistency takes you there. And then you think that if you're going to be consistent with a regular product, that product would be great. And this infomercial shit is getting f***ing old. We want everybody to be able to feel good about it. We're going to grab a thing off the shelf without having to really worry about what's in the bottle. I don't ever want to worry about what's in the bottle is a shit I'm taking. In the camp like this, it is all nutrition. It's all nutrition. The training has no effect. As long as the metabolism falls into the right place, and muscle will just... ...will melt all that fat. What? You guys? He's legitimately just like saying shit on the spot. It makes no sense. But like, we need 30 minutes of you talking about muscle and metabolism melting. Just start talking and we'll put it together later. Boom. Mission accomplished. So really for us, 90% of the work is just the nutrition. Correction. It's not all nutrition. It's now been downgraded to only 90%. Much more sensible. I mean, there's nothing that box that we eat. There's nothing packaged. You don't want to eat anything in boxes or packages. Because I don't know. I've taught nutrition at the D1 University level. And I fail to teach that part because it's not true. Even the performances fired proteins that were having it's all natural. This guy just said, you don't want to eat anything out of a box or a package. Now, if I get my performance inspired protein, if it comes in either a box or dare I say a package, I will be very upset. You're not even good at shaling. So that's just a big piece of the puzzle is that the body doesn't have to filter all that crap out. Filter and crap. The body hates doing. They've pulled the body and the body's like, fffffffffffffffff. Yeah, filtering crap hate. Getting laid love. Parting with my friends love filtering. I'm not big on. What about your kidneys? Oh yeah, yeah. It exclusively designed to do that and they're really fffffffffffffff. I hate it. But whatever, I hate doing it quote body. This is make believe folks. All of it. What the fffffffffff. Godinal exercises that. Holy shit. He's like, explain himself out. That fffffffffffffffffffffff. I don't even know what's going on. You know, fat is a way for the body to protect itself. Protect itself from what mother fffffffffffffffff. You don't even train hard. And then, you know, making sure that he's got his rest days lined in. God, I have your rest days lined in. You know, we work out. Super hard. You do not work out super hard. Period. Recovering such a big topic because people don't really recover anymore. Recovering such a big topic. Because people don't really recover anymore. You guys remember back in the 50s when the cars looked really cool. And you count on your old friend, seen you to serve you up a great malt shake from the fffffffffff. Local diner. Hey, I got you guys from T-Shake. Awesome. I love protein. And you looked around and everyone was recovering. And you're like, oh, this paradise, this splendor. He'll never end. And then the 70s and 80s came along and everyone just stopped recovering. This is an own pandemic. I can't believe. This gentleman was asked questions on television and was allowed to answer them.

I worked out hard, but now you walk away and you're so sore that you can't even work out the next day. You failed. No wait wait. That just means you switch muscle groups. You recover from that soreness in that next day and you go back again. If you smash the shit again and get sore, I thought this is how people got jacked from time in memorial. But with the f*** do I know, I'm just an expert and jacked. You also have to work you the pain. Mark's like, shut the f*** up and we'll cut you off right here. You got to work through the pain. The trainers like, mother f***er, you are putting your goddamn stick in my spokes. Shut your mouth. I just said a bunch of shit. You're gonna contradict it. And he did. Let's see how this resolves itself. If you work through the pain, see you work out. You sore the next day. You're going to work out 15-20 minutes into the workout. That's soreness's got to be a little bit of it. Yep. So I guess it is okay to be sore. I don't understand there's no unified message here. I'm a confused member of the audience. What do I do? Who knows? The muscle sore is going to happen to anybody that has a workout long time. True. When you do work out hard, there's a lot of people that do. They'll be in the gym for 90 minutes, two hours. And then they'll walk away from the gym. They're dripped and sweat. Tripped and sweat. This is bad news. Sweat causes soreness, I think. They force so hard. And then they won't eat anything. I'm trying to lose weight. And they won't do anything. And that's probably one of the worst things you can do. Because you just expend all of this sugar. All this glycogen storage and all the protein in your own body. If you don't replenish it immediately, your body will feel that the completion in a sense of soreness. Mark, all of our just took out a dumbbell. Did two lung swings with it and then put it back. I don't have any context for this. This is if you're ever tied up by terrorists. And they're like, all right, the keys to your handcuffs are inside this little f*** ball in front of you. But I bet you can't use your feet to pick it up and curl it towards yourself. Pussy. They lock the door on the f*** off. You're like, ha ha. How but wait, I've been training for this. These are just random movements at this point, folks. Oh, the body. Little bit of body, brother. What's it going? Oh yeah. Mark's hot. But I get up at a tree of rock. You know, in the morning, every morning. Then the first thing I do is I prepare egg whites, easy co-cred, with a little bit of pommel butter. This is his chef. He did say tree or clock. Interesting. So by the time I finish my workout, I don't know what I do. I'll get the shape. Yeah. Mark doesn't know what his nutrition is. The chef has to remind him. Excellent. That's a rich dude. Performance inspired with a little bit of blueberries. Maybe like a blueberries. Well, the blueberries better not have come out of a box, man. This is crazy talk. After that, we go up for golf. Worst after that golf. Hard life. But I went golf all the time. Seven with clock. No, six. Six. Is he mocking his chef? He's like, you don't even know my schedule. Why don't we even pay you? Then 10, 30, we didn't. We didn't. We have a tuna salad. It's made with lettuce. A spinach. Put a little bit of bell peppers. Come on. Tomatoes. A little avocado. Why is this detail relevant? Oh, they're going to get him right in this down. We had a bell peppers. Not red peppers. Erase red peppers. That's going to be a f***ing bell peppers. Red city. What did Mama said? No beans, right? I'm not said no beans. What? I don't know why she said white. I love it. Someone named Mama said no beans. And is unclear to the chef as the reasoning for that instruction. But he knows the instruction. I doesn't think he's marking too much. Mark Wahlberg's female significant other. He said that his level of gas production was too much. And the beans were cut out. It makes sense. It's the first thing in the whole f***ing video. It makes sense. Yeah, I don't think the beans are going to make you fired. I think it might be the, you know, what do you think that is just eating healthy. I think that's it. Just eating healthy makes you fired. Everyone knows that. When you break down greens, the parents here in our stomach. As long as it's just I don't know. It's just I don't know. We don't want to be in the car when that happens. I'll see you guys next time. I'm not getting ready. No, I'm not going to give a f***ing rating Scott to video guy. But the f***ing my supposed rate. He just had a f***ing 30 minute conversation with a chef for these property. But it doesn't even know what he's cooking. And they don't know why he's eating it. No macros, no calories. No goal is eating a fat loss phase. I musta gave the f***ing on on. Damn it. I'm getting sick just thinking about the shit. The f***ing my face. I'm out of here again. This is my full of reps.
