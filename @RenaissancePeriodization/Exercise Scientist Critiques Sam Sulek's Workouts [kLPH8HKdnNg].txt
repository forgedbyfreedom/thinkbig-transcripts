I think he's like in his early 20s, so he probably doesn't give a flying f*** about the staying super healthy. At this point, what Sam is doing here was what I would just call colloquially moving weight around. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here, creator of the RP Hyper-Trifi app and Professor of Exercise and Sport Science at Leem & College. And I'm going to be taking a look at Sam's Sulex training videos. He's all the rage on the YouTube's. And even though a slight misunderstanding in the law prevents me from interacting with people in the early 20s, especially young men, weird, locker room experience, I won't get into. Let's take a look at how the new generation is training and see if we can give some old helpful tips. Alright, roll it. This hair was strength machine. It only holds six plates. Okay, so it looks like we have back up first on the menu. He said the machine only holds six plates. Let's find out why that's a problem. You know, I've been known to throw around seven, especially when you're fresh. When you're fresh on back, you're pretty fucking strong. So I'll just go out and say it on most machines, especially that particular rowing machine. If you're using much more than four or five plates, call them a curious. I'll say I'm given the skeptical eyebrow here for how is this technique going to look. Because if you say you need six plates on a rolling machine, the smart money is you're using it wrong or you could be using it better. But I'm prejudging literally. So let's judge away after he actually does a step. Instead of doing seven plates and then like trying to ...jerry-rig machine, like a fool, kind of to make it harder. Right, for the first set, I'll grab this handle. That's in the lower position. So that's actually really smart. If you grab the handle high up, the lever advantages yours. You will have lower internal forces to your muscles. You would give in the same amount of load on the machine. You'll have higher internal forces if you grab the handle lower because the lever advantage is no longer yours. But that being said, the different grabbing position makes the movement art shorter. And it potentially doesn't give you as much of a stretch. So if you're considering doing this yourself, try to experiment to see where you feel the exercise the best, get the best stretch, get the best arc and motion, lock in your lats at the very top of the movement. Something I don't think about. Right, I don't know how much you know about torque and mechanics. Torque and mechanics. Two of my expertise areas. Maybe the closer something is to the point of rotation. Right, the more force you're going to have to exert. It's the lower handle is harder. Bro, Sam just passed like a very basic gym IQ test. This is looking up. A lot of bodybuilders would not have said all that and they'd made any sense. This is totally valid. Three cheers Sam, amazing. Somebody who went to school at least some time. So the first set will do with the lower handle. Depending on how strong I am, I'll stay there until I think the higher handle will be better. Okay, this is interpretable. But for better results, safer have a couple tips for Mr. Sam. One is to control the eccentric, the downward motion considerably more. It's very growth promoting and because controlling it more asks your muscles to work harder, it's harder to control. It provides a great deal of hyper-traffic stimulus. Another thing is to go as deep as possible for the biggest stretch you've been shown. Time and time again now with good theory and empirical support. That big stretches under big loads grow the muscle more than if you stop a little shy. You want to really let your tire back and folded out and then crunch it back in. Is he going high enough at the top? Not a major concern. He's going high enough for very good effect. But the control on the eccentric is not a lot. And the big stretch at the bottom is just not happening. If he changed those two things, good news he would have to no longer use six plates. He could use about four. But the actual muscle growth stimulus would be at least as high probably higher for any given unit of set. Any given number sets he performs. In addition to that, the impact on the joints and connective tissues would be low. So it would actually keep him healthier, muscular, skeletal heat for longer. And he gets like in his early 20s, so he probably doesn't give a flying f*** about staying super healthy. At this point, it's some shit that really comes in handy when you're getting into your late 20s or early 30s and someone's like, all right, you're an IP pro stage, time to gain 15 pounds of muscle. We're really push the big boys and you're like, but my joints are all broken. And I can no longer lift heavy or hard enough in order to make that happen. Something you wish you would have done when you were younger is established excellent technique, first to stay as safe as possible. As long as possible, with maximum effect, slowing those e-centrex and getting big stretches every time is a real big deal. Yeah, another problem with such inconsistent range of motion is this very difficult to determine where failure is. He seems to be just be like when he's really really tired, he gives up, which is also totally cool, but it can create some variation training session to training session. And ideally what you want to do is have as little variation as possible but for the variables you control. The load you vary, the repetition number you vary, the reps and reserve you vary, everything else should be as consistent as possible to deliver the same exact kind of stimulus over and over that leads to predictability. It leads to awesome consistent gains, minimizing injury risk. If your failure point is kind of like, when I stop, I stop. That's not terrible at all, but it could be done a little bit more precisely. All right, I'm moving up to the higher handle. Much better stretch on this one. Very good. Still lacking that slow-ecentre control. How slow? Two to three seconds is really good on a movement with this kind of amplitude, with that much range of motion. If there's something like a squatter like press, even three to five seconds can work because it's so far to go down. For something like a bicep curl, even one second control, the center can be good enough because it's such a short amplitude movement, but yeah, I would like to see him control the center a little bit more ideally. No actual latin pull down at this gym. Not awesome, but that's f***ed up. How the f***. And this is not a critique on Sam at all. This is a critique on the gym he's at. How do you not have a latin pull now? I mean, holy shit. That's like it's the top five machines you would ever order for a gym. That's kind of insane. I wonder if they have an assisted pull-up or something. Maybe it's broken. Good God. Single-up pull-downs, especially with a stack that is heavy, that's this heavy. I mean, you're getting the stimulus you want. Okay, so we're doing single-armaged stud wise choice. Yeah, same critique as before, the eccentric is very rushed. In the single-arm latin pull-down especially because you're off-center to the machine. By reaching up in a cross like Coach Casim at N1 advocates often, very valiantly I might add, you can reach up as high as possible and let your latkin pull. Get your shoulder really up there, really stretch everything out, and then come down for that crunch at the bottom. Can really optimize this movement. What Sam is doing here is what I would just call colloquially moving weight around. It's fun to be young and jacked and strong as f***ing just like bully the weights. It's dope and it's effective too. But the ratio of stimulus to fatigue and the ratio of stimulus to injury probability isn't ideal. Not so close to ideal. This is good. It's okay, but it can be done better by milking that slow-y centric. Controlling the weight at all times and a big stretch may be even hold for a second. Let your latts really tear apart at the top and then crunch it down totally good to do that powerfully and explosively. That's awesome. You got a lot of f***ing energy in the gym. Great. You don't have to do it explosively, but it sure a shit does hurt. It's just that back on the eccentric, you want to control and go a little bit slower and get that full range of motion. Like I said, you know, we're going to do something upper back biased. So these are going to be essentially seated rows right. One handle for each arm. It's not just pulling towards my body. The cables are kind of wide. Not only am I getting a good rowing sensation, I'm also kind of pulling towards my medium line of my body. So it's like combining, I don't know what it's like combining. But it's basically instead of doing a row just straight towards myself, the hands are wider. So I'm pulling like this. Yeah, that's kind of cool. You know, some machines are designed. Most machines are designed to a row in a straight line. I've seen some machines that are designed to pull apart. That tends to engage the very high area of the upper back and the rear delts a ton. I have seen very few machines that have you pull in. It's a little bit awkward, but I think if you're pulling in, you can get a little bit more lat activation, and normal because the latts kind of tend to pull in as well as back. The rule with these kinds of setups and modification and specific angles is that all boils down to SFR as King, stimulus to fatigue ratio. What does that mean? Science Man shot up a news American words. If you feel the crazy amount of tension where you want it for that exercise, if you're getting a crazy burn in the muscles with high reps that you're targeting in that exercise, if you're getting mega-f***ing psychotic pumps, and if it gets you sore and really beat up in that area, and you're joints feel good about it, there's kind of no wrong answers. Like if you're doing some kind of lunge that someone says doesn't target the glutes, but your glutes get crazy tension during the movement, they get a burn in high reps, they get psychotic glute pump, which of course instantly go and take pictures in the back. Ideally you hand someone in your camera in the locker room and you go, can you take a picture of me real quick? They're sure, in that expected native front of a guy, you turn around, drop your pants, anyway, if the stimulus to fatigue ratio is good, then your glutes are getting sore, and your joints feel great. Whatever that person said about those lunges don't hit the glutes, is actually just wrong. It's empirically wrong, it's obviously wrong. So, I could critique some silks set up here in the row as much as I want, but if he can check all those boxes, it's f***ing golden by me. Can he get even more out of it by potentially controlling the eccentric more, getting more of a length in contraction? Yeah, almost certainly, but that's just me being nitpicking. I should probably stop giving random strangers my cell phone at the gym with which you take pictures of my ass. Nah, f***, I'll just keep doing it. If you guys like this stuff a whole lot, they're extended much less edited addition with raw footage is available in our members area, give it a click and join up if you like. Yeah, that was curious. The range of motion is very low. If he grabbed closer together automatically, this is all range generated for the back musculature. So, that's a reason why in many instances, though not all, you want a little bit of a closer grip than a wider grip to target the back. A wider grip is gonna, I think, do less overall mechanical work, making it not as efficient. It's also gonna hit the rear delts and sort of middle upper traps a little bit more, but I'm not convinced this is the greatest setup in the world. Definitely something for you to try in the gym, but when you try it, if you're like, and you go back to the closer grip, more long range of motion version and you're like, oh yeah, that's great. Don't be surprised. Interesting thing is doing is he's doing some spinal flexion and extension. I think for cable row, that's actually really awesome. Again, as usual, I would love to see him really fully flex into the motion. Almost putting his head sort of closer to his knees, really rounding his head back and then as he comes up, arching back and putting that chest sky high, literally putting his shoulders behind his glutes with a huge arch belly out. That's gonna be extra tough and it's gonna hit the spinal directors like crazy. I'm sure you guys have seen some pictures of my spinal directors. Kind of look like two people running up my back, which is what they always told me that in jail. I don't know why. Oh, my fellow inmates, you guys, but that would be dope. I've been on a barbell kick for the last few months. And then maybe in client Smith, I might just be done with incline pressing with barbell. Do maybe five or six sets. It's interesting that he's really organically assembling his workouts. I think it is age and his level of development. This isn't the worst idea in the world because you really should be exploring a lot when you're younger. I do prefer a more methodical approach, something like the RPI purtrophy app. You pre-program all of your stuff and you can always change exercises on the fly. We're really trying to push people into doing end of the same exercises they started out with in week one and finishing them all the way through week four, five and six. This was totally cool to do at his age. I would like to see him as he gets older and progress is more to take a more formalized approach to writing down all of his stuff. There's lots of guys that do this. Jordan Peter's does this just an entire dust this that consistency week on week on week allows you two things. One allows you to track your progress which is awesome and two it allows you to see if the exercises you chose really are hitting the muscle groups like you want them to and learn from it. Let me tell you guys about the RPI hypertrophy app. With over 28 preset programs already in the app you could choose to make your own. You could modify an existing program or you could just run the programs exactly as they were written by eight personal. This app programs everything for you exercises weights sets reps frequency the whole thing. After every single workout and every single week the app adjusts to your unique parameters with every single input. We have over 250 exercises in the app with detailed video tutorial links to every single one. You never have to be confused about technique or form ever again. Guessing right now you're pretty interested in the app download the RPI hypertrophy app today. Yeah, not ideal bench press technique here in the incline. Hand positioning looks very good. The lockout at the top or close to lockout is totally fine. The eccentric is notably faster than the concentric which is backwards. You want a slow control eccentric and then a slightly more explosive or normal speed concentric. Again, huge gains are made when you stretch a muscle under load of ton and so if you could slow down that barbell reach all the way down to his chest gently pause at the bottom for a split second and then come back up. First of all he would probably only need like 275 pounds not the 335 that he's doing. It would result in better joint health and a much lower risk of injury while at the same time minimizing systemic fatigue because you don't have to handle as much external load. Is it as impressive? No. In a certain sense on video, but in a certain sense it's even more impressive because you are exposing yourself to the weakest possible position at the bottom. At the end of the day impressive or not, you just want to grow as much muscle as you can and the way to do that is not to skip out on that last few bottom inches. If you know what I mean how ladies, eh? Am I right? Anyone? Okay. Yeah, that he's dropping that eccentric real fast, quick reversal, eh man. Pack injuries are real folks, especially when you're on steroids, hot calling the kettle black, but it's just true. Especially when you're young and growing really fast, your pack muscle size can outpace your tendons temporarily and doing rapid eccentric's on an incline barbell has in prior cases result in an devastating peck injury. It would not want to see this happen to Mr. Sam who seems like a real small guy. So I'm slowing the eccentric and going all the way down for a big stretch and a nice gentle pause is probably supervised. So obviously, I didn't jump straight to f***ing three plates at a ten. I'm not a f***ing fool. Very wise, you don't just want to get in there and do that. When I was his age, just to put into perspective how big of a f***ing 80 I was, it was 20 years old, this is how I would lift. I would put three 15 on the bar on the flat bench and I would do a set of like 15 pushups. I would rest two minutes and then I would do my first set, working set of three 15 for like 10 to 12 for something. Mironic. So when I critique Sam Sooluk and folks like him, please understand that I've made all of these mistakes and more. But now I'm old and gray and maybe wise. So yeah, I've done worse than this. So it's great that he's warming up at all. You know, I did like a 15 minute cable warm-up. 15 minute cable warm-up. Who's excessive? I take back everything I said. I set push downs, like faceball stuff, rows, a little bit of like crossbody, single-on cable presses. That's just f***ing gigantic waste of time. I'm going to be clearly honest. Three plates again. You know, way too fast on the eccentric and cutting that Ranger Motion at the bottom seems to be a pattern from Mr. Sam and most of them are having savings. Oh, there we go. Using those supports. That was close. Let's say for whatever reason you like doing something slightly unorthodox in the gym. Right. You know, slightly counter-intuitive to the general populace to the point where people might look at you and say, what is that guy doing? If that works for you and for whatever reason, like if you're doing some kind of weird bicep curl or some kind of weird something, I can't really think of anything right now. But you're f***ing feel some crazy fatigue in the targeted muscle you're working at. I love it. Preach the good words, sir. And you get a crazy pump and in the long-term you're making gains. I mean, guess what? That's f***ing perfect for you. Right? There is no right answer. Touching, we're until whatever desired Ranger Motion he cuts a set off at. That would just require the same or less load, the same or fewer repetitions for just more gains. So it's I think pretty close to objectively a better idea. You'll notice that on the way up he's kind of throwing his whole body forward. That's not as much chest as it is like abs and stuff. Nothing terribly wrong with that, but if he sat straighter and really lifted his chest up he could really isolate the packs and make them work the most. Oh my god. So in terms of the stretched position? My years are fluttering go on. Love Pack Deck. That wasn't the stretched position, Sam. Maybe for him it was. I'd love to see what his technique would look like. Well Mr. Gerd, Father got a chance to train with him. Really push him in that direction. That would be really fun. All right. So that concludes the Sam's Soulic video review. I think Sam seems like a very intelligent person. He seems like he's super excited about the gym and making gains and just living that good life and I think that's that's f***ing great. I think much of his training is very sound. I would love to see him focus on a slower, more controlled eccentric and just in every position bigger stretch at a pause at the bottom. I think that will just elevate his training to the next level. Then he's going to weigh 380 pounds with 0% body fat and we're all truly able to bow to our new king. If I were to rate this workout, it would get a 1.7 9 out of 2.35. Feel free to grab your calculators and turn that into a letter grade. That's right. I'm flipping the script as you guys next time.
