You're supposed to be tough Oh, damn, so many years down mass Oh Damn, so many years We haven't even come to ultra flex fitness Oh, now We're going to train with Marisa In the Marisa Indar Marisa? No, no, no, no Vamos JK, what up family?

Yeah, we'll see Yeah, yeah You already have a paper We do have a paper And the paper is Hmm Come a daddy But pronounced in a way that I can't say on YouTube Because they would flag us from porn Let's get into the work out Why are we over here doing lat pull downs? When apparently the first exercise is going to be pull ups The reason is that just like you don't just get into your working weight The bent presses right away on a first set You got to warm up The same thing applies to pull ups And we use the pull down to warm up for the pull-ups So typically we do something like a set of 12 Very light with like a 30 rep max Then we go do a set of eight with something a little bit heavier like a 20 or 15 rep max And then we do a set of three or four Something pretty damn heavy and or that set of three or four gets replaced And a set of two to three pull-ups is done with the actual pull-up And then boom we are ready for pull-ups now If you could do quite a few pull-ups are really awesome thing that you can try Is putting on a little bit of weight Doing a set of two with like 25 or 10 pounds hanging And then after you're done with that starting your working weight And if it's just your body weight it's going to feel a lot lighter Because of the potential and nervous system wakes the whole up for that heavy weight Light weight or reps are easier Just doing those different teagas better Your mind muscle connection is better And there's a gentleman that clearly wants something from this rack And I'm taking them straight and he's going to get them like out of here He will mind not know this But Marissa was on Ellen the generous doing pull-up dancing And pretty impressive So I'm compliment from Jared Strange Hard to come by There you go You can touch your chest To the bar It's no longer a rep if you can't touch your chest Or a strict technique So when you can't just slowly lower as if you're going to do another The bar is at the bottom and then just back up That's good And each bar is at the bottom It's a for real-pass Okay, okay, we're at some no rush Start starting that deemestir Starts with the right there Every rep me here right there Down slow And we're long on it Pull pull pull pull Two, beautiful Not quite that slow, a little foul There you go Three, slow, good All around There Good Yes And that's it Slow, slow, slow, slow And rack, good stop Excellent Excellent That's better Crazy impressive, that was beautiful We are going to do technically two exercises for a vertical pull with Marissa But it's really just one exercise The first multiple sets, three, two, five sets Are going to be loaded The second, three, the four sets are going to be unloaded Marissa is full, fucking strong But she can do decent reps with a crap load of weight hanging Which for anyone is good For a female is ridiculous And we're going to take advantage of that strength and do weighted pull-ups Why do we just do regular pull-ups after? Intentional notice that weight pretentious in nervous system so much That regular pull-ups function essentially as assisted pull-ups after They allow you to really get in touch with a crazy my muscle connection The technique feels super stable and smooth After weighted pull-ups You would be this not to try some unloaded pull-ups Because the feel is just going to be that good Up, go, go damn you Chin up No, good slow We'll get you back for that one Fuck that one No worries That was my daddy Oh yes, okay, safe work Yes I should did it All right, unclip if you can Let's take a take a minute Boom Boom Roll stretch up Excellent Two Very successful stretch There you go Three Four Four These are the back muscles There you go Five All these are perfect Good stuff That's it, relax Good stuff They were very good They were very good I feel like my forearm is to go But for anything Yeah, you're feeling your back somewhat here, yes Yeah, I definitely felt my back I just feel like my forearm is good But with the straps that no big deal, it's hurt a lot Yeah, yeah You guys might notice that Those of you watching The straps can take away the limiting factor But they don't take away the pain And the ones who there are some kind of song Like I can be your hero baby I'm a that shit I can take away your bans You're saying it approximately like that What was it?
