Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, come on, come on, and try a regular pushup on the ground. I knew you were going to say that. Come on. Real quick, this is just to embarrass me. Got to you. Folks, I'm Dr. Mike. This is Jared Feather, IFED Pro. This is Alex Leannitis, and he only does one kind of chess workout. Hard core, barbells, dumbbells, and body weight. No thanks, machines, no thanks, cables, no thanks, we are pulling angles. Alex Leannitis, just one man, no 300 today. One big ass compound heavy chess workout and Jared Feather here to be a technique stickler. How are you feeling? I'm feeling great, Mike. Happy to be here. Can we have a show with the basis can produce? Like you said, barbells, dumbbells, dips, can go wrong. Anything else that goes? Let's get it in. We start with bench press. The bench press is an excellent exercise to build a chess for a few reasons. One, it biases the length and position because that's the mechanic the most difficult position, which is also the most hypertrophic position. Two, it's a barbell movement which means it's incredibly stable. Especially with good technique, you can produce a ton of force with treating pretty much all of your muscle fibers in your facts. And lastly, if you have a really good technique, it puts your pecks under real safe position. Shoulders in real safe position, nice and retracted, chest up. The stimulus to fatigue ratio or the barbell bench press can be incredible if you use good technique. And if you have the body type for it, some people don't like it, that's totally fine. But if you've heard somewhere bench is suboptimal for pecans bullshit. It turns the guys built enormous pecks with the flat barbell bench press. We're going to be doing sets of five to ten, maybe ten to fifteen here. We're not Jared, put it every one in. Let's get it done. And the pecks should be going toward the ceiling. So you're not tating at all. So you should be leaning the bar and then even as you press up, even more of the pecks to the ceiling. Okay. It sounds like a soft touch. It's holding it like they're not resting at all. It's going to drop by quite a bit, but we're here for a fucking great stimulus. Absolutely. For sure. Do you want these matching? I'm so proud to have this. That is not good for my brain right there. Yeah, I'm the same way man. Desend the interman to the illness. Excellent. Meet the bar with your chest because you're kind of really good and you just go, yeah, drop. You know what I mean? It's good. I got a little bit more control. Like I said man, it's going to be making it with the way fucking heavier. It's got to be perfect. It's much different than the parallel thing bench press. I got you. Do a one or two reps just to potentially and then get to the works that after or are you good to just start work set? I was going to just start it in. Okay. It's long as you take nice pauses, we're good to go. We're going to wrap up. First up out. Let's go. Meet the bar. Meet the bar. Now press the effects. Yes sir. Big chest. Yeah. Come on. Meet the bar. Chest to the ceiling on the way up. On the way up. Push. Push it. Good shit dude. Oh yeah. Got that. That was good. Just left man. Try to get the hell of a strict. What was that seven or something? I was like six. Six. I fell in my pecks ripping. Yeah, I never really heard that. That's what we want. Two twenty five. Yeah. Oh damn. So we're going to. I'll give some pain in here. Good shit. Did we see the one? One more. Oh, okay. Come on man. Did we see like mic right there? You're good. Thanks. See you like feeling go. Go. Go. Go. Right. I didn't really hell man. That was you. People like let the scouts move freely. I'm like that's a terrible, terrible advice. I don't know where that came from. What biomechanics expert. A.K.A. functional anatomy enthusiast came over that bullshit. But it's completely wrong to stress the pecks. This stretches the pecks less. This stretches them more. Absolutely. The fuck are they talking about? Like I don't get it. Especially if it's lengthen by us. Yes. Like a ball of bass press. So you're not going for that. I can understand if thumb up the converting effect. Sure. Maybe then you want to pro track and get your arm across. You're really squeeze barbell. So. Beautiful. Come on. Shit. Here we go. Last one. You're just feeling. Go. Whoa. Oh man. That's shit. Humbling. It's very humbling. But just go to show you don't need that much. Totally. And when you do the reaching especially. Oh yeah. Because if you drive with telling before. Of course the bond is that tendency to want to rush. That last portion. That's the most important part. Yes. And it's not enough to just rush down here and hold it. Because you can get good a mass in that technique. Yep. That's how guys move big ways. Just. You know, they drop it. Yeah. Hold and then just explode. Yep. But if you really reduce all momentum. Control that way. The short arms too. Yep. Right there. It's like it's like it's like it's doing the work. Yeah. Man, it's tough. That's it for bench. Let's go do in high dumbbells. You know, never use these things before. Neither. You do it. Kind of one of the chime in the videos. Oh yeah. So chest up. Can you do this? Totally. Sure. Can you do this? Sure. But the packs open up a few do this. And they get a big stretch. So you start in this imagine there's a straight line to your face that goes all the way through to the outside of your shoulders. Start here, open up elbows out. Reach big at the bottom to get really between your own. Yep. These dumbbell things right here. Under your chest to touch your bicep. Right. Get that low posture, sec. And then curve back up. Big reach. Curve back up. Right. And I bring dumbbells out. But somewhat of a neutral grip. And I'm still getting the stretch if I'm out here. Right. You're up should be okay. Just make sure. Just make sure. Just make sure. Yeah. Getting dumbbells. Should've been especially like I'm not going to tell you no. Okay. Yeah. Let me see what feels good. Because when you warm, change the things well. Big chest. And then press. Excellent. Control. Super deep. Big chest. Oh yeah. One after another just like that. Big chest. So push your chest up. I use the pecs. Pecs. Pecs. Oh yes. Pecs. Control. Pecs. Stop. Come on. Try to get it. One more. Just stop. Slow. You should control. Huge chest. The biggest one. Push up and in. Push in. Yes. Finish up. Go. And the back. Hey. You'll look at that. We go push them forward. Thanks a lot, Gary. Shit. You know, I love that reaching to you. It makes such a difference. All right. Oh my god. So you like arching on the incline. I should look. Really? Yeah. That's why we have varying degrees. Exactly. It's like an arch really fucking hard on a high incline and put the degree change a little bit. But the stretch is so much better for the pecs. Exactly. So it's better to do a higher incline and arch when I go lower. 100%. Then just keeping it low, but you're not tight. I think that sets up your chest. It sets up your scabs. It does everything to align you. It also collapses you down so that there's no movement possible. Because if you start with a flat back, pretty and then as you press, you start arching more. It's going to change the ship while you're doing it. Exactly. And that's kind of weird. We like to lock into the technique once we're locked in with staying. You're a beautiful man. Beautiful. One more. When you start struggling with your chest. I'll think Andy will just let me in. Up up up. Push it in. Push it together. Push it together. I'm on the back of my hand. Beautiful. Oh, my crap. I don't work. I don't fucking work. Thank you man. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just, I don't know to say. You're a hero. I don't know to say. Say, it's time for dips. We have a lot of time. Chest is pretty fried by this point. We had bench. We had dumbbell press. Dips are going to be done low and slow. Of course, a nice pause at the bottom for a big stretch under tension. And Alex has done dips with. I believe for playtaking before roughly this body weight. And this is going to be a big, big difference because we're asking them to go slow on the way down. We're asking them to get a deeper stretch than usual. We're doing it after two exercises, six working sets of quite difficult chest work. And he might actually only have to use like 45 or something like that. We'll probably do two sets of weighted dips. And then take the weight off of the last set and do a burnout set of unweighted dips to finish. To finish the psychotic chest workout somehow. Got the more. Yep. Yeah, go go go go go go go go go go go go and rack. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Maximum stretch. I would say you can get just as low as dumbbells. If not lower because there's no obstruction. Yeah. Feel it on your pecs. Always excellent. You are likely to get sore. Most likely. So I'm also damn intubate. All stretch based and squeezing across the body. Just free weights. Getting it in. I hate that shit. The day that's pointing now. That the length of position is generally best for hypertrophy. Yeah. And the pecs in particular have been proven to respond well to that as well as the calves and whatnot, right? Yeah. How relevant. It's to do like pick fly motions and all that kind of stuff. It's a good question. I think that there might be a chance where there's some regional hypertrophy through squeezing. But we'd have to get some good data on that to be sure about it. I think otherwise it squeezes mostly a waste of time but sometimes for variation. I think it's okay and it might turn out there's something there in the end. But it was something. We definitely know never squeeze of the expense of the stretch. Right. See if I have a machine that loads a great top hold but the stretch sucks. You got to change something. Right. That's what I would say. That's all. Deep. Swim it. Push. Push. Push it. Yeah. I'm good. No rush. Probably just take it off. Take the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Beautiful Alex. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Who's love? Big chest. Yeah. Who's love? Big chest. Yeah. Big chest. Push. Push. One more. Yeah. Go. That's it. Okay. And off the machine. One hand on each side. Oh no no out here all the way up here. This one here. Yes. Look forward. Super deep. Pause. And up. There you go. There you go. Slow. As deep as you can. Open this chest up. Yep. Up. Go. Go. Great. That's the little. You go. Go. Nice and deep. Ultra deep. Fuck. Up. You got it. You got the strength. Go. Go. Come on. Come on. And try regular push-up on the ground. I knew it. I knew it. Come on. This is just to embarrass the fuck out of you. Good. Push up. Chest to the ground. All the way down. And up. And one more. Look forward. Up. That's it. That's it. You don't know how we know the chest is done. That's how you work your backs right there. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, this is good. Thank you man. Dude. Good shit. Got me good there. Good shit. It's funny. When you go to failure and you're training with good technique, it's how it's done. First of all, it sneaks up on you. And second about how unimpressive it looks emotionally. People are like, expect like a fucking war. And you're just like, yeah, it's momentary musk with failure. That really is. And in some cases, like with pulling exercises and legs, it can be this like second-slung process that's hell. But for me with triceps and chest, I'm just like, it just stops. It just stops. I thought so. I'm just like the machine is feeling good. And then I'm just like, nope. Val's won't move anymore. So yeah, Alex, there's a huge pleasure having you man. Mike, huge pleasure. Jared, anything any advice for folks out there who want to build a big chest? Maybe you don't have a ton of machines. Listen, I build my chest off barbells, dumbbells, body weight training. Actually, the majority was built from pushups and dips. I ever used machines for my chest up until last year. And even then, I would not credit it. Any serious development. Except maybe the upper chest in the case of the Smith machine. Overall, this is a body built by the old school basics. The flatball bench press and climb dumbbell bench press. Wait a minute, dip. Literally stuff that I always do. We did it today. But with an extra emphasis on getting more out of less weight. And with Jared's special technique, but really reaching. And trying to go beyond your active range. Rather than artificially stopping it, because you don't have the mobility quote on quote. That's how you get results. You want to stay in this game long time. You got nobody to impress. Except maybe people at the beach. Once you have. Yes. And that's probably scared. There you go. And then they will fear you. As they should. I'll see you next time. I will. See you guys. Thanks for watching.
