Press! Go! Don't you? Nobody said, sorry! I accept your apology. Thank you. I would instead prefer five more reps. Do you know if they be sorry anymore? Wrap the handle? You're alternating between father figure and father figure that's not nice too. Yes, shitty older brother. All right. Same idea. Right. Slow. Hey folks. I'm Dr. Mike for Renaissance Pre-Dization. This is Adam Regusia. He has a mega cooking YouTube channel where he actually cooks actual food and he's actually good at it. Unlike me, who's a French chef trained in France. You know this, Cottonett Al-Quzine. But I'm no good at anything, especially cooking. However, I'm okay at making people or let's say suffer. Hello, Google term. Through resistance training. Got a thing for your suffering, right? You know, things have to happen. Part one right now. Adam is going to be getting beat up by me in a full body workout. First time on this channel, maybe. Look at how ready he is. One could say he's been ready. Oh, I... After this, Adam will push me through the pace to so to speak in the kitchen and we'll learn how to make a fun recipe that won't taste like shit because those are the only kind I can come up with. How are you feeling? Are you ready to train? I must break you. And you will try right now. We're going to warm you up first. Then we are going to do a technique, a tactic, a strategy, so to speak, that works really well for whole body workouts. And that is when we take one exercise that usually hits quite a few muscles. And we superset it with another exercise that uses pretty much none of those same muscles. So while you push yourself super hard in your hamstrings and glutes and lower back here on the stuff like a bedlift in a bit, we're going to superset that to chest presses, which means as soon as you're done to feel like a bedlifting, you calmly walk over to the chest press, begin to do lots of those. As soon as you're done there, maybe 30 seconds rest, you come back and hit this again. We're going to do that like three or four times in a row, let you rest and it will pick another exercise combo to hit other parts of your body. Unrelated parts. After four or five of these little superset situations, your whole body will be trained, fried, cooked, so to speak. You could really do that. Ready to serve. Scott, the camera guy is way thinner than me. I don't like that. He's fit. Can you fit in the knee? Can we get somebody else? This makes me uncomfortable. Scott, we're a fat suit. This is where we flip the script. Okay. And we turn the attitude from a leisurely tone into a business has to get done. Okay. Oh, I didn't touch. Here, oh. Chastes, slow. Up, three, and it's if you're going to do another ultra slow and then put the bar down. Beautiful, come with me. Slow, controlled, full touch. That was a bounce. No more bounce, sorry. Do it again, slow, pause, go. Good, couple more, you got this. We're supposed to be working hard. Quality reps only, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Slow is if another chastop. Slow, all the way down. Touch. Get out. Oh yeah, yeah, no, that was it. That was a bounce. Well, I heard a few years ago, everybody was saying, oh, it's all about the eccentric. It's all about the way back down. That actually builds your muscle way more than pushing. But now I feel like the, I don't hear people saying that is often anymore. Has the research kind of turned the other direction? No, no, the eccentric is important. Oh, it's probably like a 60, 40, where it's 60% eccentric is good, 40% concentric is good. But since not the end of the world, but also I think maybe the people just go through phases and exercise science where they like to talk about something, but then when they feel like they've been heard, they go on to another thing. Which thing now are the people are talking about? Post in the comments, what's the big thing now? Yeah, what's the, what's the, includes have always been huge in my world. Well, and the, and the are huge in your world. Aaaaand I've noticed. Let's go make them bigger. Good. Three more on your done here. Chest. Chest. One. Put back. Yes. Two. Knees back more. Put back and knees back. Yes. Up. You know, as if another big chest. Slow. That's it. Yeah, chest press. Now we're working. Oh yeah, a couple more. All day, Adam, all day big chest. Good go. One last one, slow. Chest stop. Big press. Go, go, go, go, go. And then slow as if you're going to do another. And then get out. Excellent. Back to that lift. Okay. Let's stop. Yes. Good. Two more. Chest stop. Good. Chest stop. Up. And is if another and then put it down. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Yes. That's right. Great. Press. Okay. Right away, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go. Ah, it's so far back. Yes, the stretch grows a lot of muscle. Keep your chest up at the bottom. Good. Keep it going. Nobody said break. Push, go, up, up, up, up, up, up, slow on the way down. Let's do one more. We'll do it together. I'll help you out. Big chest. Push. Do. Push. Use man's strength. You got to be like, don't eat this partner. Where? Oh yeah. Talking about how you're lifting like a grandmother or something. Yeah. Oh, I think it's the northern accent. Whoa, so compulsion. There you go, like that, like that. Well, how do you feel? I feel great. Amazing. I would like to not do either of those exercises. Great. Good news. We're done with that. Yeah. We'll give you a drink. Okay. Have you rest, and then we'll do our next pair. Great. Sounds good? Yes. Okay. The next superset is going to be leg press. With pull down, really, any muscles involved in those two. And it makes for a great trade-off. This is going to be fun because leg presses are so fun. The pull-down's kind of work as hitting your back and a bit of a break. We're going to do another three sets of this. And then we'll have one final shell I say now. I'll say it. Triple superset. Spooky, we're actually filming this the day after Halloween. So I was doing six exercises. Don't you worry about coming this. Three times two. I'm no doctor, but I know what three times two is. They stand on your math. I can tell you no doctor. It's like that Ronnie Coleman video. We're like they're getting every single plate from the entire gym. And no one can work out while this is happening. So... Oh, good. She's a car. Cracking. She had a crack in. That's a good thing. Good push. You feel okay? I'm 40, but the knee is 55. I'm going to look a day over 21. Ugh. Uh-oh. Down. Pull that fucking weight. There you go. Slow. And one more. Okay. Kave over as much. Use your back. Hold. Yes. Slow. One more. Bonus route. Go. One more. Again. Go! She's this. One more. Just for fun. Hey, just for fun. This time. Go. Yes. Slow. And... Rack. Quickly to the black press. Quickly to black. No time for share. You know, knee charms where we're going. Push. Go. You're on. Rest for a second. Oh. You can lock the knees out gently. Breathe. Five more. Begin. I can't. Fuck you right back. Go. All right. So if that have a big fucking machine, and you got nothing left. I don't. One. Slow. Go, go, go, go, go. Nobody said rest. Big push. Good two. Three more. Slow. God damn it. Still two. That was too fast. Okay. I'll give you a good hit. Hit it. Slow. Control. Press. Be strong. Go. Good. Three more. Good. Come on, you got this. Press. Good. Two more. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Control. Press. One last one. Down. Slow. Slow. Slow. Chauze. Up. Go. Wrap. Right to pull down. Amazing work so far. Amazing work. I couldn't do this work out. Come on Adam, you got this. Easy. No cave. No bullshit. Okay. Good. Chest up. Good. Three more. And you're done. One. Don't leave. Go. Two. Okay, that was the best one yet. Last one. Big pull. Yes. Slow. Stretch. Oh, amazing. Right to the light press. Last one. A light press. Press. Go. Don't you know what it's supposed to be? I'm sorry. Stay there. Ah. Rest. I accept your apology. Thank you. I would instead prefer five more reps. I'll trade you, okay? Do you know what to be sorry anymore? Wrap the handles. You're alternating between father figure and father figure. That's not nice to you. Yes. Any older brother. All right. Same idea. Ready? Slow. Begin. Press. Yoooo! Down right away. Slow. Press. Again. Press. Two more. Huh? Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Press. One last one. Go. Go. But ultra slow. Ultra slow. Pause. No. Out. Go. Wrap. Thank you. Last set of pull downs. Let's hit a quick. Let's hit a quick. Excellent. Five more good ones. And you get a chance to rest. Come on. One. Slow. Control. Big stretch. Again. Two. Slow. Control. Big stretch. Go. Three. Slow. Control. Big stretch. Hit it. Four. Don't you fucking cave over. Last one. Good. Technique. Yes. Slow. Rack. To pull your people the Italians. Ah-ha. Fucking beautiful. Oh, fucking beautiful. A fungal. Take a break. One. Have another drink. Thank you. Relax. And we'll do our last thing. I can't believe I felt like that was like two little plates on the thing. Yeah. I don't like that. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. First, you're going to do dumbbell upright rows. Ah. Nothing from the hips. Uh-huh. You just take your elbows. Huh? Push them up to the sky. Second exercise. Grab here on the inside. Yeah. Stand straight up. Okay. Coils. That's because of him and Judaism. That's right. Always. Controlling the eccentric. I'll let you try these in a second. Sure. And then lastly, Pinkies. On the non-nerled part. Open grip. Chest stays up. Ah. Push downs with your elbow staying in. And on the way down, you want your elbows to kind of back a little bit. Good. Five more in your dumbbell. My grip is going. One, we'll get you some chalk in a second. Two. Chalk makes my forearm stronger. Ah. Three. Go. Two. Four. And one more. Yeah. Slow. Back. Curl. Right away. Right away. I got one more. Go. One. Slow. Two. Slow. Up. Slow. Last one. Up. Slow. Right to push downs. Begin. Go. One more. Slow. Press. Press. Yes. Slow is if another. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Rack. Great. Ah. All right. Come over here to the chalk bowl. Go. Give me 20 of these. Go. I'm fucking, I'm fucking. Oh, please. I guess fucking. I guess fucking Fedachini arms. Ah. Regroup the dumbbells. Rip, rip, rip, rip, good. Go. Two. Stay upright. Don't let it punk you out. Three. Two more. Let's go. Up. Four. And right away. And up. Slow. Slow and Rack. Good job. 15 curls. Begin. If you take a rest at the bottom, we add one rep. Ah. Yes. Slow. Slow. Slow. Rack. Last set of push downs. 20. And it doesn't matter how it happens. It just has to be good technique. So you can lock these out. One. Stand close with a machine. Two. Come up higher. No long breaks at the bottom. Four. Up. Good. Three. Up. Good. Slow. Good. One more. Go. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Push. Push. Slow. Is it for another? Is it for another? Is it for another? Rack. This is too high. That was so sweet. I just want to hang it. You're going to reach up and hang what you could. Oh. I don't like either of you. You got you either. Take that YouTuber. Cook your way out of that one, mother fucker. So, decides say no cool down either. Can we cool down? We just don't stretch. Cool down, or something you can do? If you would like to be less sore. No, I don't know. I like, I'm enough of a massicist. I like this. I like me some dums. Yeah. But also it probably reduces adaptations. So cool downs are inadvisable. I knew that Dr. Mike was going to harm me in some way. But, you know, if you were to like say like point on the doll where Dr. Mike is going to hurt you, I would not have guessed the particular places. Okay. You're not going to be helpful in the police interview. Oh, sounds. I just, I thought you were going to strip throw more away. Didn't mean I was like babyweight, but it was. Don't like how it made me feel. I think you did great. Thank you. You feel. I feel wrecked. Excellent. That's crazy. Yeah. And I thought that I had been like, because I was like super totally out of shape for several years. And then like about eight months ago, I started kind of ratcheting it back up again. And I thought I was in hard on myself, but no, that's too hard. So you did really good. You tried hard. You maintained your technique. You bitched a an acceptable amount. Oh, thank you. Yes, there's definitely a buffer zone. And just make camera. And just for the cameras. And then now we go and we make tasty food. No, no, no, I don't process the teamwork. Yes, we make things beautiful. It's a painful food. That lead to gains. And we'll see you in the kitchen as of. So yeah, we're going to, we're going to refuel ourselves. And I'm going to show you a recipe that I used to make a lot. Back when I took my fitness much more seriously. Or the other way I'm looking at is that I had no children. And therefore I had nothing more important to do. But it's something I have made in a while. But it's a turkey meatloaf. Many meatloaf that you do in a muffin tin. And it's fucking gross. But you know, it'll make you look like this guy. Hey, and hilariously enough, they used to call me many meatloaf in high school. Let's get in there and buy some stuff. In my opinion, asparagus is the king of vegetables. And that's not just because it's shaped like a foul. But mostly because it's shaped like a foul. But also it's very delicious and nutritious. And it makes your piece smell real weird. And that's your one of the like 30% of people who don't have that gene. And you know, the people who have that gene, their piece still smells weird. They just don't know it. Oh, that's the worst. I know. Or is it the best? Is that like the better way to be? So the bodybuilders always want me to talk about. They want to say, how can I make my chicken breast taste better? My response? By the thighs. Now they don't distinguish between dark meat and white meats. My wife and I will not be able to eat them unless you make them disgustingly lean. Okay. So 93, 7, probably. All right, we'll do it. Although there is like 99, but that's not really food anymore, isn't it? You might as well just inject amino acids. How is that even possible? Yeah. You want to make anything taste good. The shortest way there is jippote pepper is in a dobbosauce. Dump it in. Anything is good. So the question is like traditional Quaker Oats versus instant oats. My understanding is that the processing they do for the instant oats, their starch damage, which raises the glycemic index considerably. On the other hand, if you're like, I specimen such as yourself, you want all that sugar to hit you really fast, right? I don't know. Let's go with the traditional. Okay, just relax. Let's get a muffin tin and then let's go to the kitchen. So this is something I used to eat all the time when I was much thinner than I am now. And it's totally disgusting. You're going to hate it. So step one is take any vegetable that you like. I like asparagus because I think it tastes good. Also, it's small and so it cooks quickly. So the trick for you, kids at home, is to come in a bundle like yay, is remove this, remove this, that was cool. Remove this, whatever the rubber band. Remember band, I suffer from the phasures. And then don't remove that one because basically once it gets down here, you've got a whole bunch of organic polysaccharides that are converting into a lignin, which is the stuff that makes wood wood. And like the older that the asparagus is, then the more woody the stems are going to be. So basically I just leave that on because it holds that part together. And then you can throw it away more easily. We don't want the woody stuff. Well, you want the, you want, can't box with this guy. He's too good. I am merely going to cut this into a teeny pieces. So you make it as small as possible so that you don't notice it as you cram it down your gullet. Are we still talking about the vegetables? Look at these. If there's one thing dogs love the spears. I have generally even, you know, in times when I was eating like a meathead, like Dr. Mike, I have endeavored to eat lots of vegetables just because I always feel way less terrible. Yeah, it's very good for your health. You know, purely for the fiber, if nothing else, you know. So we'll just let that soften. I'm going to put that part. How do you know when it's done? Done. Okay, trade secret. Yeah. I mean, the other thing about vegetables is that it's like they, in all seriousness, it's like the cellular decay that they experience, even after you take them off the heat, is really significant. Like they keep soft at egg. Yeah, you know. So always pull your vegetables well before they are as soft as you want. So once you pull out, you continue to go softer. Now here's the thing, I don't actually want to cook this yet. Like I want it to, because if I, if I cook it too soon, the whole loaf won't set in a disgusting little bowling ball, but you can take to work with you, right? So, you know, I've turned the heat off, and now I'm going to basically just overwhelm this pan with way more mass than it could possibly cook if it wanted to. And at the same time, what I'm doing is like cooling down the vegetables so that like, I can handle them, and I can toss this all together and turn it into repulsive little meatballs. It's all about efficiency here. I love the name repulsive little meatballs. Again, another high school make-day with my hair. All right, so if we're like eyeballing macros, how many oats you figure we want in here, Dr. Mike? Is there a real name issue here at this point? Or you want to do it again with my hand, it'll be fine. I mean, yeah, that's good. Yeah, all right, that's good. Dr. Mike has problems with peppers. So, we're only going to put in the adobosos, but that's fine. Like all the flavor is in the adobosos. Sprinkle sauce. Ah, it's the spanish? No, that's crazy. I've never used the spout feature. Oh, okay, yeah, good. There's a lot of fucking food here. Delicately massage this. God, I would never do this. Feel so good. Desert food, oh, yeah. All right, there's a complete meal right there. Where's that muffin tin? There you go. And it's not a real muffin. So you don't have to worry about it rising. So yeah, you just, you just build that sucker up as much as you want. Throw that fucking in the oven. We'll see what happens. Are you sure you want me to do this for fun? Come on, just throw it in the oven. You can do that, can't you? Well, let's find out. No, yeah, I can't because there are at least four distinct choices of where to put it. Just put it on the bottom one, there's room. You won't know that they're done because they look good because they won't look good. You're going to want to use the thermometer. And I would say go ahead and do a whole 160 Fahrenheit on these suckers. Say yeah, you wrap that sucker in aluminum foil. Take it to the work fridge. Throw it at somebody. And throw it at somebody. And at least you're not that guy like reheating fish in the work fridge. You know, let me like that guy. No, nobody like me. And these honestly, like in all seriousness, they actually are pretty good cold. See. No, too much salt, though. That's not bad actually. You have to eat it. I don't. Oh, he doesn't. Okay, poor guy. Poor guy. Well, you have to pull it out. But teeth poor bodybuilder. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, this is a taste of games, my friend. Folks, I'm not cut out for the kitchen. Oh, me, I'm cut out for an artistic place of preparing food. This man is, he's got his own YouTube channel. It's 10 times bigger than ours. Where he does cooking. He talks about food science. It's funny. It's fun. It's educational. It's a learn how to actually make food that doesn't taste like shit. And you get to learn some food science as well. Check him out. His shit is going to be right here. If Scott the video guy remembers to put it there, all here. And links in the description. Dude, thank you so much for coming down. My pleasure. If you start noticing that I'm more jacked in future videos, this is the guy you think. I'm going to think of the pain he caused me. I'm going to try to cause my, I'm going to ask. How would Dr. Mike hurt me today? Replicate the pain. I will replicate that. Folks, it's been real. It's been fun. See you later. Yeah.
