Can you guys hear that? Spring break is coming spring break spring break spring break spring break oh My god so exciting What you gotta get in shape which is why you're watching this video the all-in-compassing super guide I think it just beat a love a little heart love thing with that great how appropriate for spring break all encompassing guard to getting Lean jacked 10 everyone should fucking see how jacked and 10 I am and Fine as hell to make your spring break go as well as possible now we have eight things to talk about So be a meat potato's video So get your fork and spoon out. Let's get to it First we have to define the exact goal and time frame. There is a little bit of a mythology It's to how to train and prepare for spring break that of a few people get wrong So we're gonna clear the air there make sure we really really really know exactly what we're setting out to do We're gonna talk about the diet plan that you can take as a really good approach the training plan cardio plan then Point five is the vacation bloating problem because you can be in really good shape getting to a vacation Two or three days later of eating pure shit. Hopefully not literal shit. Otherwise. I'm not here to judge your vacation You will look bloated and terrible, but there are ways to make sure that doesn't happen It's a huge deal You don't just want to look good at the airport in cancun want to look good Well, we'll leave all the disgusting jokes for literally in five minutes when they begin Diet and training during the occasion because like you get there you're still hopefully alive for five to seven days And you might want to know how to eat and how to train so that you can let know Maintain as close to that really good look that you got when you're arrived as possible and We will absolutely cover you the sauce question for you saucy folks if you don't know what that means just skip over it No big deal and Number eight last point will cover is what to do after the vacation When you deal with a depression and sadness of coming back to Kentucky State University and it's Mid-March and snow is rotting the fucking trees out of the ground It's not cancun but it does have potable water coming out of the faucets here we go Defining the exact goal and time frame Big fact is that a thing scoffery guys that a thing could say now big facts You don't know what the kids say Who what up As as as as a hip and Scott the video guy gets we're gonna head it out all the other stuff. He said all right So here's the deal it is Totally awesome to be jacked and lean For spring break But you're very likely watching this video when we released it or hey a year or two from now great welcome back to the channel What's up new subscribers, but in any case? You got like four to eight weeks to get in shape for spring break fact Muscle cannot be added very quickly You can put a few pounds of muscle on in that time which is great for later But a few pounds of muscle doesn't exactly change your visual appeal at ton What does is something more like 10 pounds of fat loss? If you lose something like 10 pounds of fat It's totally reasonable within that four to eight week time frame especially closer to eight no problem 10 pounds of fat And also it's got the huge visual change visual appeal versus gaining even 10 pounds of muscle Which is impossible in these time frames unless you're completely new to training so really it's you know Maybe optimistically two to four pounds of muscle you can gain in this time and Versus 10 pounds of fat lost in a little bit of muscle gained there's no contest Getting leaner is absolutely the way to go for the best short term change So just to put kind of some Guard rails on what we're gonna talk about today It's really all about keeping your muscle on your body and getting leaner We're not gonna be like there's this is not the ultimate how to get jacked guide for spring break because That guide is something you should have been doing for like a year and eight months or a year and eight weeks before spring break and then you could look significantly different so With Four to eight weeks left hopefully you're seeing this video with not something like two weeks left and that case Just just be yourself and smile a lot the ladies love that sort of thing But not too much because then you look like a creep Geez, I'm really bad at this kind of advice I have no idea of never been a actor with woman but I've heard a lot of books about it So here check this out you can drop in four eight weeks in many cases 10 pounds of fat if not a little bit more And especially with proper water and salt manipulation which is what we're gonna cover later You can look pretty damn good alright put better much better than you've been looking in the weeks before this And that means that potentially you could have more lady friends on this trip make new friends airport Smile people get in the same cab same hotel same phone party Same love life In reality you'll probably just be masturbating with whiskey dick at four in the morning in your hotel room While your boy lays it down in the door next door the the room next door and you can hear all the shit That's how my can-kun trips work But you can do better you can do better and here's how you're gonna get in shape. So first the diet plan Real basic stuff four to five meals per day The core of the meal is a fist sized roughly You know like that in all the fisting jokes in the comments please. I got time for all that shit fist size portion of protein for each one And of course fisting practice is good to have on a spring break trip Maybe if you get into some weird crowds and cones crazy Two fist size portions of your favorite veggies preferably green veggies or something like that to get the fiber going It's a great anti-hunger effect it brings in tons of nutrients one to three fist size servings of fruits and or whole grains the healthy stuff More like zero or one if you really want to drop a lot of body fat you have a lot to go if you're already pretty Shreddy and you just want to sharpen up then two to three of these is great because you're gonna want to support training energy and so on and so forth Like if you're already pretty lean and you just kind of want to put the finishing touches on two to three servings is great If you have the energy and and the drive and the cognitive wear with all to survive the Almost exclusively protein and veggies only diet you can totally do that that will change your body really really fast Really profoundly it sucks It's difficult but it will work and it will make a very big change for your spring break So that's something to keep in mind so there's a range there you can choose On some combination of how lean do you want to get slash half to get Versus how much of you know wiggle room do you have like ostensibly still go to school or work spring break I guess just school You know you have to pay attention and past tests and stuff the instructors not gonna be like oh yeah, man You've got to f-line your test, but flipped it around for vernae because you're going to can't go in three days row have fun like that doesn't happen I mean that's kind of a faster I am not everyone's that cool huh so Yeah, it's all up to you a good suggestion here is start the diet in the first week with like two fistfuls of fruit slash Graams with every meal see how you do if you're like man I'm not even that hungry I love the results. I can do better drop to one fistful and then next week drop to no fistful So then the meals are just a fistful of protein and two fistfuls of veggies If you go it to and you're like, oh, this is tough diet I'm still getting shredded like stay at two or even bump to three We want to make sure that you actually succeed in your diet journey Starting at diet and after week just going and having 10 burritos then exactly prepare you for spring break although the burritos are large You know also all kinds of crazy shit happens spring break you got to be ready But the anatomy has to be ready right that down so number five Typically we would put fats in right healthy fats are a good part of a sustainable diet Notice it's sustainable this is not sustainable because it doesn't have to be It's four to eight weeks of dieting for your maximum ability to lose fat I would just take the healthy fats out so like the steak or chicken or beef or whatever that you have For your fistful servings of protein really will constitute the trace fats that you need Will you be having a great time during this plan? No If you're leaner and you don't want to lose that much fat you can absolutely do like you know like a two finger serving Of healthy fats good god We're in a spring break video that's clearly designed to get you laid more on spring break. I've already mentioned fisting out two fingers out Scott's video guy supposed to be a family channel Who proved this? Who wrote who wrote the script? The dream is gone as is the family. I don't see a family around it has got the video guy and an I in a dark room God that sounds like a terrible thing Also, there is no script there's a power point and it's right there so Yes, I do make most of this bullshit up on the spot tans are a long-weighted question in any case If you need help with the diet here's me up selling your ass The RP diet coach app 15 bucks a month in the first two weeks is free It was just lay this plan out for you. You say hey like I want to lose 10 pounds by this date go and it just goes Wham here's meal by meal all your macros you pick the foods it auto so it's it has pop up reminders to tell you when to eat Then if you're serious and you want to suffer a little bit the shit works like I wrote the code logic myself so you know should should work really well It's brutal it will take you seriously if you tell it I want to lose 10 pounds of fat It'll be okay my the fucker here's a little mouse My size portion of food you're gonna shit, but you will get shredded up for spring break Which is exactly an only water here all right next up the training plan I'm not gonna go into a ton of specifics on training because so many approaches work But the approaches at work have to check a couple of boxes and here are those boxes You should be training four to six times a week ideally because you want to make a full effort at this Right you don't want to be like hey Hey, stay so you do want to leave the phone party with me and come back my roommate terrible choices just like I kind of would but like your side-dulse just aren't like capped in our for me So I like bye And you're like fuck I shouldn't have trained twice a week, you know, that's a realistic scenario But in any case you want to look your best right and you're in college my fucking I've been to college. I'm still in college and professor. I know you're off shit to do get your home mark done and then go train Forty six times a week You'll make a really good visual impact can you train once twice or three times a week still get decent results sure But I'm trying to give you kind of the the best plan and you can always scale down from there if you want four to six days of training per week A bunch of different splits work like push pull legs works upper lower works That there's an example for six and a four day split for you Push legs pull upper lower works as well You can try all those splits but fundamentally if you hit every muscle Between two and four times a week and minimum two times a week Hit it pretty hard with three to eight working sets for that muscle per session So like if you're session for you know shoulders looks like you know four sets of ladder raises and then four sets of upright rows and you do that twice a week Like you're pretty much golden and remember the goal here is to increase muscle a little bit While really just providing this workout is an anti-cattabolic anti muscle loss stimulus so that as you lose your ten or twelve times a Fat your muscle stays roughly the same and maybe increases a little bit and so just a basic Effective program is all you need you don't need to get super fancy What about focus? This is a little bit more of a big deal Like there may be zero times in this world that like your plan soccer on the beach in Mexico and like you know Scott, let's see we make up some female names actually from Raleigh North Carolina I was like oh my god, I hear all my friends and I know it's your quads like so bad I'm sorry fellas. I'm sorry my quads are like my favorite muscle group on me I think it's awesome to have jack legs If you're trying to hit the statistical average of like spring break groupy interest Leg training is not highly prioritized. I know come get me in the comments and I deserve it I just blasted me against lifting god That being said, it's shit is true so my best advice to you and this isn't some shit I would ever be doing but also your boys not getting late on spring break so trade-offs Focus on your arms your delts Specifically side delts nobody ever looks at your fucking weird delts you're not a body going show chest okay, and it pains me to say this your abs Because like the standard for what is considered a fuck boy physique is actually quite low You just have to be lean little baby arms and a baby chest and some delts and just like do the shirt pull thing and like you have like a four or six pack and the girl Like oh my god, Connor Such a shake you're like then diesel Where to God who also isn't jacked in the grand scheme, but then Connor's 50 pounds smaller than Vin Diesel But abs are important Train them for hypertrophy they will marginally pop out more And because you're dieting for fat loss the fat around them will receive and you will have also abs and then You got abs and Spring break is the place where abs live that's where they they fall like that's where they Express their full potential so I would recommend training them in this case if you want maximum Fuck tensile and even wrote that down That's right the potential to have consensual Sexual relations with people of the Gender that interests you yes, it's 2023. I said that right okay Now the training plan Can be super basic but if you want something laid out for you shameless plug the custom training templates By them below their hundred bucks and they last for like Four months or some shit like that so you can use them way after spring break You just pick all the muscle groups you want a train and you can actually choose as priority muscle groups By some try-subs delts chest and abs. It's literally right there in the the ordering form and then it traps out a program for you That trains all of those exactly as hard as you need to make your best results. So shameless plug go get that shit now I'm not just gonna be By the fucker the toes you go buy shit and there's nothing else if you want to learn how to build your own high-perchary plan We have the High-perchary-free made simple YouTube video series that's 16 videos each one's like eight minutes long Going step by step as to how you can construct your own plan. So if you're in college You don't have a trust fund where you can get a hundred bucks from mom and dad or Grandma and grandpa whatever fucking east coast mansion built by Christopher Columbus you fucking ancestors live in If you're not like the Dartmouth type of mother fucker then just build your own program for free and The whole guide will take you like an hour and half to watch and you can fucking just make a program So enjoy But remember by shit because any Lamborghinis They are not free Which pains me to think about all right number four The cardio plan big news here cardio is persistently overrated as a fat loss modality Doing a ton of cardio has some effect on fat loss Before the energy and time invested that effect is not worth the trade-off in most cases So what you want to do is diet that diet is how you get lead Contest body builders or leaner than everyone else in this world If you don't do more cardio than like endurance runners and you think for all the cardio endurance runners Do it into pretty lean but turn out as lean as bodybuilder how In the answer is by the way Two things before you say bodybuilders are on drugs one endurance athletes it's a shit load of drugs top level And also drug free bodybuilders are leaner than endurance athletes so now that we've rounded that The reality is that the diet is the big difference maker and so when you guys are getting ready for spring break it and ready to get shape Just know that if you're the type of person To do like an hour or two of cardio a day and then not watch your diet so closely You're just gonna do a lot of work for kind of disappointing results But to be kidding think it'd be good But for the amount of time you spent doing that shit. It's not gonna be ideal and like you have homework and sorority parties to go to or whatever So you got other shit to do what I would recommend is this get a baseline decent amount of steps Your cell phone has a step tracker in it. I promise you can get one of cheap-ass step trackers It's like $11 It's from China. They know where I am at all times I like to notify the communist party where I am at all times in the United States So it's super cheap to track your steps just get a minimum of 10 or 12 thousand steps every single day and That hold up find which sites are gathering your info with personal data cleanup Scott, how do you say this isn't macophia macafia macafia macafia macafia? I pay for your fucking service You're the only people that spam me Thank you for preventing all other spammers stop popping up when I'm fucking at work Three times an hour shit Like they say shit to like oh like try look at look at who's trying to spam you Mom I'll the fuck this your job. No tell me about it. Just do it I love you guys. I'm kidding don't turn off the virus Protection on the back end and fuck me over in any case 10 to 12 Thousands types of day are just stay really active Let the diet do the rest of the work if you want to go and do some treadmill cardio or some elliptical that's totally cool I would say like six days a week Maximum 45 minutes at a time of like hard work it makes you sweat is the most I would ever do this whole two hours Do you have cardio nonsense is for the fucking birds and a thing is when spring break is getting closer When you go to your university gym you will notice that no less than one times 10 to the 15 million Surrody girls are in the cardio room chatting to try to get I don't know what look they want for spring break cocaine look and Boy do they get it because they don't really lift weights and the muscle sloths off their body and so does the fat you're Not going on spring break look like Kate Moss and if that reference dates me I'm old Google that shit. It's an interesting look in any case Supplements gotta say something about them first thing is you just don't have to take them They're just not a big deal If you're gonna take a fat burner or something like liposix or some shit like that no corporate affiliation here It works just fine stick with a recommended dose or even a little bit lower These things hit really hard Don't take the pills late at night and won't be able to sleep if you take pre-workouts just keep doing that You know in the extra pre-workout if you want creatine five grams of crazy amount hydrate You know every day is a good idea for the duration of of this whole exercise and do bring your creatine with you So you can take it in Mexico or in Thailand or where are the fucking going because It will keep your muscles fuller and it's a cool look And there's nowhere in the world where you get popped for powders that are just creatine So don't worry like oh, but I think I think it's cocaine It's not their first rodeo if it was that easy to fucking smuggle can an airplane Good god. Yeah, Scott new uh career idea Creatines smuggling Count me in in for a penny in for a pound Yes, yes in your person The old purse the universal purse as they call it everyone has one But the aperture is you know, I'm just gonna stop by behind Okay, we got plenty more shitty jokes to make in the rest of this video All right, we got your training we got your diet we got your cardio You're looking like you're getting in really good shape but hold on The goal of the trip isn't to look super awesome on the airplane going in there Girl walks by from the first class bathroom look so she's like oh my god What hotel are you staying like I don't look no I just go there and just go get wild any book Oh, she's like oh my god you're crazy. Ha, now that's cool But when you get to the place you We total shit You drink a ton of Fluids or call them and What ends up happening is you get as the French say and le bloated And then you got the puffy face look and the muscles are puffy the abs are puffy and It kind of sucks because like you're looking puffy two days in and your friends are like dude foam party tonight and you're like I guess But I look like shit and it sucks to look worse than you just did I mean confidence is a thing right and and ladies know it So if you go into the club like oh, do like come on, God or show us your abs Go to go to go to the field and go to whatever like you're for sure not getting late get the my god of here you want to look your best Problem How the fuck do we deal with this boy this bloating shit? It's a difficult thing however However If you want to avoid Doctors called dry dick disease and you want to stay nice and sharp you can do something It's wacky but guys I swear to God it works Two weeks before your trip not including your trip So if your trip's on March 15th or some shit March one you start the following process You double your salt and water intake Fuck if you don't know how much salt you're eating because who the fuck does outside of weird contest body builders Just eat a lot more salt put more salt in your foods and you don't even have to focus on doubling your water intake That'll happen automatically because your thirst will be like holy shit I need drink more fluids because I need so much salt But I would say double your salt intake or eat more salt and really make sure you're you're putting down the fluids like pretty well Don't over drink or some shit, but like don't go thirsty and have brown pea. That's all I'm trying to say For one week of this soon as you start doing it after a couple of days you will look way worse. Why? because You are have a normal Expression of what's called the diorotic response your body piece out Fluids normally and you shove the crap to no fluid and salt and so for a while your diorotic response doesn't catch up and you get bloated This is what would happen on your spring break vacation We're doing it early. Why we're gonna continue to apply this much higher salt and water All the way up until we actually get to spring break even before the flight You step on that flight before you have like you know two gatorid zeros and put some salt in there Person with the airports are correct. I forgot are you to we're kind of flight us this what are you getting ready for? And mile high club times 10 here's the thing After about a week your body is going to adjust and you're going to look normal and you're gonna say what the fuck am I doing this for? I look just normal. Why I do this keep going when you get to you know Panama Beach or whatever Mexico Scott where do people with friends go and spring break I never had friends? I mean it's got to be other places Okay, it's just can't cool. You're as you sure huh That's a little cold then for spring break I guess So wherever you're going you're gonna get there and You're just gonna eat and drink normally because like do that time for other shit then But because your body has been exposed to so much more salt and water than usual When you go in and eat some junk food and get a little dehydrated and also their stuff Your body's gonna be like man compared to what I have been doing This is actually like very low water and salt environment so automatically you're gonna get dried out And then you're actually gonna look your best Two or three days into your vacation Which is amazing because that's when the phone party is and that's when you get to fucking pull off the shirt and be like a lady Isn't that going on and then the Mexican bouncer like one hand picks you up and throws you the fuck out Decide on the wall sir. You can't take shirt off in the phone party. Do they even force that sort of thing? Scott you've been to a phone party Anything goes that's my line to my lawyer when I call him from a Mexican prison the day after you Will be low carbing it on your way in obviously High water high salt When your vacation begins you're almost certainly more carbs than you used to because foods gonna taste good And there's tons of it around and your water and salt are gonna come down Increasing carbs and dropping salt and water is like a contest body building peak You're actually gonna look fuller in your muscles and dry your underneath your skin. It's a fucking thing If you really give a shit about how you look like you really really give a shit Like if it's trying to get in shape fucking cares, but if you really give a shit Just at least remember to have a little bit more salt and fluids Maybe a lot more in the few weeks leading up week and a half to two weeks And you are gonna look really really good when it comes down to it and by the way The thumbnail hopefully it looks like I think it's gonna look has me a couple days before my recent Well, it wasn't on spring break it was a December trip with my wife and our older friends where we just go to bed early Have cocktail Less fun, but nonetheless still illustrates the point it was cancun You'll see that I look pretty fucking ultra shredded in that second picture and In that first picture I look not so ultra shredded is because that first picture was taken when I was doing the water and salt Intensional bloating and then when I got to the all-inclusive dude your boy was putting down us down 5500 calories of food Met like four or five meals a day snacks all the other crazy shit But I was fucking dry because I was so used to pounding in the fluids in the salt before it fucking works So give it a try all right now What about dieting and training during vacation? We got a couple rules three to be exact just follow these some semblance barely and you'll do better than not rule number one Try Try not to eat like a total piece of shit 100% of the time that you're there Light high protein breakfast when you wake up at 2 p.m. or some shit like that A reasonable dinner that's not entirely made of junk food and If you keep your dinner lighter and I shouldn't be saying this but here it goes if you keep your dinner on the lighter end You get drunk with last alcohol so mission accomplished I guess but a lot of times it's all inclusive so they all call Inclusive gives a shit But just don't run out there if you're gonna have a light dinner remember that your tolerance is gonna be lower now I sound like you're fucking bad Be careful out there Connor And cut holes and condoms I'm Woodstock was a terrible time in any case Just know that if you eat a lighter dinner you'll have the drink less could be a good thing could be bad thing It's up to you to make it a good thing but at least it's more convenient because you don't have to be like I'm on my 6th beer I don't feel shit During the day night try to hydrate well for two reasons Reason number one ooh three reasons Number one it's fucking hot and humid a shit and can cool you will fucking die out there if you don't hydrate Number two let's be honest your drunk a shit or you bought fucking molly from some weird hotel worker Now you're on meth andphetamine because it's not actual molly and that does not help the matters Because when you're drunk around drugs you have no fun clue it's going on and a bunch of them have a diuretic response So make sure you stay hydrated and lastly you're gonna want little Willie and start your friend downstairs to work really well That there is and you know he kind of needs hydration because he's kind of He does his best work when you're fully hydrated and if you can't put those two things together Could lock and can cool good god Second rule This is a bit of a departure from the first rule Do not or rather you don't have to eat like a contest body builder the whole time When you're at the fucking club You know it's bottoms up that's why you're there So don't try to be like oh I got to order the diet drinks and I sure But unless you're doing some purposeful gaining phase you just can't gain enough body fat in a week of Actual partying because remember the party is the number one thing To really make a huge impact or almost any visual impact on your physique so just don't worry about Because a lot of people are like who are a defintence or like oh man a Only diet mixers and only four drinks like just shut the fuck up and have fun Right, I'm here to tell you I'm obsessed with my body. I'm a little fucking career out of it It just doesn't make a fucking difference not for a week yeah for four weeks you don't fucking for sure make a difference but for a week of parting just enjoy yourself After the club gets you something nasty enjoy that shit and Good news it'll help soak up the alcohol so you don't die in Mexico alone Your parents have to go through customs to get your body back Ugh rough Third rule If you do choose to train First of all do not schedule early morning training that is insane You won't be awake early in the morning or you will be awake and fornicating with lots of other fun spring breakers Hopefully in an environment you all find pleasant to not overly dirty Midday training is where it's at another benefit to midday training is typically in these Locals the equatorial regions so to speak where you go for spring break is so fucking hot midday Is it like a path to heat strokes just go to the gym which is hopefully our condition If it's not don't go to the gym and get your workout then Amtrainings not likely After training you can get a good low pump get you a shower Put on your little fuck boy outfit go get dinner drinks club Face down in the street at 330 Wake up in a Mexican jail and it's just Tuesday, baby, and I'm here till Friday. Let's get at it Lastly you can totally just deal with the whole trip or not train at all You might want to train a little bit get them demons out a tad get pumped with your friends It was always the thing where they make some friends there and it's like six girls and they're like, oh my god You're early buff can you teach us how to do like jump stuff? We're gonna go left through of course ladies and you just spend The rest of the hour showing them doctor mic youtube videos which you should do because you're boy knows what he's fucking talking about JK Get in there and get some training going but I will say this Feel free to deal with just two or three upper body training sessions that whole week We'll keep you looking Exactly as good as when you got there you do not have to train two a days or seven times a week to look Your best to maximize your club performance and as a matter of fact if you want to maximize your club Performance don't train a ton train a little bit so you got that fucking nasty man energy for the foam party That's right the foam party and Christianity mutually exclusive Satanic things happen at the foam party and I hope you enjoy them all Pray Satan all right Quickly if you're on the business end of things if you're a saucy guy if you use an Special sports supplement so to speak You may have questions about how to manage that and I have a few answers for you The the power points says if you're a drug addict which is probably true for you and you really need to think about shit Growth hormone pull it out yes, it is a very powerful fat burner, but it also results in bloating and if you pull out growth hormone about Ah, you know a week to half a week before you go you're just gonna look way more shredded hands down Also growth hormone helps you sleep if you pull out growth you'll be less Apped to sleep on the trip which is good because you'll be partying your face off you won't be asleep anyway Another thing Yes, the drugs you were taking help you get your in shape Especially for shooting long-esters if you don't know what that means is just skip the next three minutes You should not having meaningful change and how much serum concentration of anabolic you have in your bloodstream in Any relevant capacity throughout this week of party Do not take drugs with you you can go a week without injecting I promise and If they're long-esters mr. whiskey deck won't have to happen everything is all gravy and the good thing is A lot of body builders pull out pretty much all of their gear almost all of it before contests anyway like a week or two out Because less engines actually make you look drier as well Will you have your best gym performance well if you shot a week ago? Yes, probably still Will you look your absolute fullest nobody who gives a shit you're gonna look sharper and drier So it's better to pull out all of your gear stop shooting it when you fucking get on the plane Don't bring fucking drugs with you to other countries look like you bring drugs into Finland They're gonna make this is very bad thing for you to do and who worried about the health so please just leave some here and go to Finland and enjoy Sorry finish people I fucked up your accent You know if you got a Thailand and you got steroids on you You may not be coming back Scott was that one video With the the movie with the people they go and broke down palace Bro watch that shit don't you fucking bring drugs anywhere else in this fucking world Mexico Thailand that's for you Aussie motherfuckers you Aussie guns always trying to bring gear everywhere cut it out You don't need it straight up and this is the honest advice I'm not trying to be your fucking parent here Who oh Yes, does she have the latex on note then the answer is she is no longer my girl Okay back in stale you were valid as a human in always but to me as a sex object only when you're in your Was that a movie called underworld outfit? woo I love vampires or werewolves or whatever you are Kate Mcnathkins Dale hello In any case She shows up without the outfit I'm like who are you? All right Lastly After the vacation assuming you survived of course most of the funnest spring breaks and in death Which is a good way to live until you're 22? I would take a week or two after the trip to just like eat clean like fruits veggies whole grains meets just to I'm saying a lot of toxins into your body time to let them float out as you put only good stuff in for a little bit ease back into training You don't want to just hit it hard right after because you just deloted Basically so you got to ease back in no crazy stuff three reps and reserve lower volumes etc and then keep training some next time You don't have to rush back into shape and you can be jacked and lean well in advance of spring break Go there and just mop it all up, baby and if I have to tell you what the it is you have a lot of growing up to do which is gonna happen on spring break for you You're in a few weeks so Lastly in that two week time span afterwards Hopefully had fun hopefully you were safe Go get STD test Because I'm pretty sure the foam party foam particles are actually made of the HIV virus This is just more fun that way and Take care of yourself folks have a good time if you have any questions comments concerns about specifics Shoot them in to the comments below and I will try to get to them and answer them and Have fun and be safe don't do anything stupid unless it has a high payoff and involves titties. I'll see you guys later You
