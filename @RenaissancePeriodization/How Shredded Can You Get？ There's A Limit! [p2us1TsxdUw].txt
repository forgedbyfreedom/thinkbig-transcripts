The approximate example here is that kidding your high school, we all had one. Just played video games and ate Snickers bars and had like apps and you're like, I hate you. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here with Renaissance Pre-Dization and today's video asks the question of how lean can somebody get how lean can you get and what are the inputs that go into such a thing? What are the determinants to say how lean you can get? Now the first thing many people will say nice to do a solid time is they'll hear something and they'll say, well it's drugs, Dr. Mike, you just take drugs and you get lean and that's what determines lean, this is how many drugs you take and this is actually not true. There is a common misconception almost exclusively within people who do not compete in bodybuilding in the misconception is that natural bodybuilders cannot get as lean as people who are using drugs in bodybuilding and that's false. If you pay attention to the sport of real natural bodybuilding drug free, you will realize that drug free bodybuilders get limit lean, psychotically, non-sensically lean. If you need someone to look to for that example just go and Instagram and type in Marvin physique, Marvin the Martian from Hong Kong, good friend of ours here at the channel and he's draw life time drug free. He's he weighs he's five nine anyways, 154 pounds before he started accusing him of drug use for over that and he's his lean as anyone could ever hope to be it's insane he has like lutes on his face it's really strange. So there's tons of other examples Peter Fitchen comes to mind, you can Google him, a bunch of people he coaches come to mind outrageously natural is absolutely possible. There is no drug that makes you leaner as a matter of course there is no drug that can make you leaner than an adjusted properly adjusted calorie deficit and good diet can make you. The only question is how much muscle do you have at the end of that process? If you diet to get ultra lean drug free because you're not taking anabolic and other or good-genic drugs you will not be as big muscularly before you start that diet as someone who was taking the drugs and also on the way down to getting as lean as possible you will lose more muscle than someone who is actually taking tons of drugs. So you may be weigh 165 pounds whereas your theoretical counterpart and alternate universe that's identical in every way except that they you took drugs in that universe weighs 200 pounds you can be just as lean on stage in both situations. So that is the deal now of course being 165 lean on stage versus 200 lean on stage the whole process involved with that is a way healthier if you do not take drugs so remember that big upside there is health it's not actually lean. So if you want to take drugs to get as lean as possible you have to understand if you don't actually need drugs to get as lean as possible. If you want to take drugs to be as muscular as possible you get a level of leanness then yes that is something that drugs can do. So if it's not drugs that we're going to be talking about here that's out of the way. We have five other reasons at least that determine how far you can go in your personal journey should you choose to take it all of getting as lean as you can and the first one is genetics. And interestingly enough in most circumstances outside of one which is appetite genetics. The genetic proclivity to store fat is not a huge determinant of how lean you can get because of how powerful the other factors we are going to discuss in a minute are. But genetics so to put this another way if you start it out with suboptimal genetics and you kind of just a little bit thicker and chunkier by default. Let's say you carry a 20% body fat just at your normal level your athletic you train you eat well just 20% that's what you are as a male 30% as a female with applying the other variables that we're going to talk about you actually can probably get strided with. How difficult that is for you is going to be very different how long it's going to take is going to be very different. So while that's a true statement it's also true statement to say that people with good genetics for being lean can get very very lean with much less work. The approximate example here is that kid in your high school we all had one who was like 16 years old didn't lift weights just played video games and eight snickers bars and had like abs clear six pack and bicep veins and he were like what that's where you start your life and then you know he decides to get into body will do when he's 22 and four weeks later he has stride a glutes and you're like I hate you. Ducks your Jackson famous example up until he was in his late 30s I believe he had already one tons of pro shows been to the Olympic a bunch of times he has never did cardio he just did do cardio he had not done cardio and he would die if I think like a six to eight weeks he would just clean up his diet and voila glutes strations have been two weeks contest conditioning within six to eight that's a real thing that's a real thing that's genetics. Second thing that determines how lean you can get is how long your fat loss phase is some people will do six weeks or eight weeks of fat loss dieting and you know half a percent or one percent of loss per week and it would be like oh man I got pretty lean but she was I wish I'd get leaner we could just die it longer up to 12 weeks of dieting can make a really really big change and a lot of times people in contrast prep for bodybuilding they'll do 14 or 16 weeks of prep sometimes 20 weeks of prep well 20 weeks of fat loss dieting is tough they're tough and very perilous for your probability to just rebound and get fat again but if you handle those concerns well you know people see that your transformation from offseason but you're showing you like oh my god how did you do it it's a what if you die it for 20 weeks losing 0.75 percent of your body weight each week on average you're gonna get a lot leaner it's kind of a no brainer but it must be sad like yeah this is how it happens and people ask you if you're really good at dart throwing and ask you how do you get so good at dart throwing like the chances obviously yes you have genetic and proclivity to be more accurate at short distances fine motor skill is very good fine motor control but also like you probably practice start throwing a while and they could after you practice anything a while you get pretty fun good at it right next and more importantly did a determinant of how lean you can be and this is the most meat one of the most real world things to say in this lecture is how many fat loss phase maintenance or even a little bit of massing in their phase sequences can you stack together over the long term because if you start at a 20 percent fat and you get down to a 14 percent fat to a nice long hard fat loss phase you're a lot leaner than you were but you're not objectively very lean for a male you're like you know like a flat I can healthy and everything's great look great but you could say to yourself after that that loss phase right you know maintenance and you say jeezing I don't know how to contest body builders do it I don't know how really lean people do it I just whole fat loss phase and I'm like where am I I'm like still 14 percent no but a lot of set you take two three four months in a maintenance phase maybe even a slow massing phase you restart your next fat loss phase at 16 percent body fat and you end up a 12 percent after that well significantly leaner maintain maintain maintain the next fat loss phase takes you to 9 percent I know it's possible because I've done this multiple times with people and a bunch with myself if you just don't mess up to the same percent body fat every time you do a fat loss phase if you can even shave off one net percent body fat in each one of those cycles hopefully something like two or three percent per macro cycle after a while because you never quite come up to the old level at your hat you can get really really lean and you can find yourself in a position where you're a 10 percent body fat at the end of a maintenance phase and you're like I think I'm in a position where I get show lean and you may very well be so a lot of times people look at people who are really mean here's the whole point of this part of the talk and they go oh my god that's crazy that's like I so mean out I just thought that's not in me a lot of how many sequential phases of fat loss half they gone through a lot of contrast body moving to report especially their later years in their late 30s and early 40s that are getting lean to them is actually very easy at this point because they've done it so much because they just never get very fatting in after their show when like you get down to 4% for a bodybuilding show you can eat like a fucking pig for two months and come up to 9% and they're like run out of room to eat I got to want to eat anymore I'm still have veins in my abs and a semblance of glute detail from the side this is just my life now but you earned that life because you did so many months and years of sequencing fat loss phase maintenance and mass fat loss phase maintenance and mass and that maintenance and mass doesn't come up to where that last fat loss phase took the fat off of you so that it's a net loss by a small margin every single time you structure enough of that together and all of a sudden it's like yeah I think about a few arustler and you went to a two week wrestling camp during the summer it's going to make you way better arustling for sure but how much better can one wrestling camp really make you not much how much better can one fat loss phase make you a much leader plenty but you know something it can't hold on to but if you do like four wrestling camps in a given season you're going to be a stud just the same way if you do four sequenced fat loss mass phase maintenance repeat and each one is two to three percent lower in body fat she was you know two years later you're going to be like 8% body fat lower just walking around that is one hell of a way to get really really lean it's the secret so make sure that you know that then if you ever doubt yourself about well I can't never get as lean it's not all one shot you don't start at 30% body fat and you're like what I just got to get to his lean as I can and that's all I can get ah ah that maintenance phase at the end the little slow mass means you don't have to come back up to the level of body fat used to be and the next diet is easier and easier and so on but easier not psychologically easier if you get better results with it your leaner everything will time next concern point number four in determining how lean you want to get is how much muscle you want to trade off this is point that's pertinent especially to folks in competitive bodybuilding folks that are trying to get really lean for holidays or something like that like for the summer everyone reaches at some point this maybe four or six weeks out where their training is not of a very high quality anymore it's uh many not slipping but it's like my training could be better if I ate more food my training could be better if I slowed down my rate of loss I would not get as a little bit weaker during the end of prep as I could be and that's a fork in the road if you choose to go right and you eat a little bit more slow nine rate of loss you're gonna get very lean and you're gonna keep all of your muscle and it's gonna be amazing if you take the fork in the road that leads left you're going to lose potentially a little bit of muscle you can get back all of it within weeks after the items and you go back into an intelligent massing phase so don't worry about not long-term loss but if short-term you can sacrifice a little bit of strength and a little bit of fullness you can continue that deficit and you will get fucking lean to a level that you thought oh yeah this is crazy I did this at my last show where I got nice and dry for the first time in my life and lean enough to where I started the diet at some point around 240 pounds I was on stage at 2,16,217-pew. That's really small I did not like seeing I stopped those scales to 16.5 or something and I was like fuck I'm tiny but oh my god was I shredded to the fucking book do you want to get lean or not? Ideally would you get lean and be like big Romney where he's too 90 on stage yes but you might not have that for the other reasons you're in at extorges etc and thus if you really want to get lean and you're willing to trade off a little bit of short-term muscle and strength it'll be worth it is what I'm trying to say because you'll get so much leaner that the overall look will be like wow if you see guys that's per if you're into competitive body then you see guys pretty lean but not very very lean you're like oh I got it's great how much does he weigh 220 great you see you got this very very lean and it turns out he weighs 207 you don't ask him for his body weight you don't care because if you walk down on stage and actually got it's pretty lean you're like there's one guy in the show and that's the lean guy first place get out of here nobody cares how much you weigh when you're that lean it's worth it it's worth it for that last little bit this is a lesson I wish I knew 10 years ago when I started body building formally in competing I wish I knew that that extra bit of muscle loss at the end and strength loss was worth that insane huge difference in stage look training for muscle growth is never going to be the same lastly the last variable to determine how likely is it that you're going to get very lean is of course psychology and it's a really really big one not everyone has it in them at any given point in the life to push hard and long in a deficit to push hard and long in sequential deficits that are separated by maintenance and or massing phase another thing about psychology is how bad your appetite gets ravit as appetite can really just prevent you from getting into that last weird low single-digit area which is like a strange bizarre world the thing is appetite is mostly genetic as well so that actually goes back up to genetics but nowadays we have drugs like some agglotite and tris appetite that can probably just knock that out and it's not really a concern anymore so back to that in most cases not all some genetically you have to people really can just get insanely lean with minimal effort or they just locked out that their appetite isn't that high so just kind of like train and eat high protein foods and voila they have stridey foods but in most cases the people who get extremely and in almost all cases the people who started out not very lean to get extremely lean they're just very mentally resilient so if you ever asked like when how does that guy so lean a part of the answer is I got fucking balls as balls have balls and I girl she's got all reason to operate some shit like that it just takes a lot and it pays off and it's not the kind of teeth grinding resilience like I'm gonna do this it's more of an ability to remain calm as the world around them crashes apart they feel like they don't have any energy that's okay I didn't expect that energy I feel a little loopy and lost at work that's okay I frontloaded most of my work for because I knew the last four weeks is gonna be terrible they're training they're not as strong as they used to be that's okay I know that I've calculated this trade off 2.4 I'm willing to trade it off it's okay that I'm not I very best in every other area of life and then I'm entering into this very dark desperate world of exotic leanness and I can you know what is that like Christian prayer like yay she'll walk through the valley of the whatever the fuck and not be whatever because God's got my back you know I'm saying that shit I said wisdom you gotta have that shit to go in with you because shit will get really hard and the people that survive that to end up on the other side lean a shit they can be calm and relaxed when everything around them and inside them is screaming stop the diet this isn't worth it you don't want to get this leave if you can do that if you're genetics are decent if you can do it over the long term with multiple sequential phases you too Mr viewer miss is viewer miss viewer and miss mss viewer can get much much much leaner than you think and I'll leave you with that and see you guys next time you
