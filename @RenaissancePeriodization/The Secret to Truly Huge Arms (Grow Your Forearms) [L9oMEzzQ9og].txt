masturbation just isn't enough and you need bigger forms so you can feel more masculine and have giant arms Well good news. I have five of my favorite form exercises and none of them involved flicking the bean What let's go check them out You might already know this but big arms are the unlocked to everything you've ever wanted in your life a new career a new girlfriend a new boyfriend a new family A trip on the blue origin rocket to the edge of space you can have all of them with jacked arms If you want to get juicy forms, there are two ways to do it One way is the old fashioned way. That's right the M word the thing you do online by yourself with the websites You're not supposed to go to in the evening and in the morning sometimes just after lunch But the other way is to actually train your forms if you want bigger forms I promise you filling them out is gonna make everything about you look better You'll feel better. You're gonna be awesome. You're gonna have friends this intro is way too long Mike shut up and show us your top five favorite form exercises. You got him The first exercise on my list is the seated two arm at a time dumbbell wrist curl One thing that really helps in wrist curl and then forearm training is really Accentuating at least for the first few months that you train that peak contraction just to connect with your muscles It's helped me a ton is I used to need a lot of volume on these But now I need much less because I'm just better at contracting that muscular jerk He called for a second and then a nice slow eccentric lowering of the weight until they're just to the edge of your fingertips And then back up and again You can use any range of weights for this, but in my typical experience with almost all of these exercises sets of 15 to 30 repetitions per set are really where it's at why the range of motion is so small The total amount of time spent per repetition on forms is tiny if you think about well five reps in the squat Can get you to grow muscle, but if you time out five reps in the squat Let's take 25 seconds and if you do these reps that's like 20 reps of wrist curls So sets of 15 and above are usually very good anything below that ends up being heavy and weird and kind of feel strange And your wrist that doesn't give you a pump it doesn't get you very sore so my best advice for all these exercises go light and for this exercise My next Favorite for our exercise, well, they get the job done anyway is the barbell wrist curl I prefer to do it in a power act because it's the most pathetic small muscle of the human body Which no one cares about and then you occupy the rack of competitive power lifters and peach gang muscle Monty is the people that really need to be using the rack. I kid of course, but if you're a trillionaire like me in your own Want to 500 of your own gyms and every minute of powerly in the world you can afford to do this sort of thing Let's talk about this exercise. There's not a lot of Glamour to this exercise and it's done almost exactly like our last exercise except with a barbell The thing I would say that's challenging about this exercise is you don't want any friction of the barbell running up against your thighs So if you're gonna do this thing where you come forward with your hips just enough to let the barbell hang You're gonna go all the way down until it's on your tippy fingers and you're gonna come up for a one second Possible top and that's basically the barbell risk curl and this setup is excellent for my reps Do as many of these as you can rest two to three seconds do as many as you can rest two or three seconds Do two or three rounds like that rest a minute do that several times your forms can take a huge Meeting and they need a bunch of reps and they need a bunch of failure proximity So just do three sets of eight and leave the gym a bunch of sets of total per set with all the my reps in there 15 to 25 reps you'll be money If you have a free motion dual cable cross machine you are in luck Because you can purchase a cross bar attach it to both ends and do the free motion Straight bar wrist curl what sounds ridiculous why Mike you're an idiot You're short and you're balding you're in your 40s your Jewish on top of that not an insult, but could be Are you having just gone insane why not you're to regular cable risk rolls well a good cable attachment You could do the problem is a lot of cable attachments on a regular cable station Have a lot of friction when you try to spin the bar But with this attachment we have almost none this is an exercise I love it's a nice thick bar and I'm able to just get a really good purchase on it. It's well Merle and I'm able to crunch at the top and do a real big stretch at the bottom It sits in a mid range. It's perfect for my reps This is a phenomenal phenomenal way to train forms and here why so much variation? Couldn't you just do one of these you could but you get bored your body gets used to the same thing So exercise like this so the one we have after a really good thing to throw in your program every now and again Just switch things up keep you fresh mentally keep you fresh physically keep your forms growing in a Gorge with blood Fiends in the girl the fucking the good girl bad girl machine. I'm like, oh my god like if ours luck like to giant Well, you know what you're gonna say Exercise number four is the one arm bench wrist curl This one's really cool Because it allows you to experience significantly more tension at the stretch most of the other movements do And that's really awesome because it probably grows you more it also allows you to really maintain an awesome Mind muscle connection because it isolates everything out you can only focus on your forms Make sure that you're going all the way down for deep stretch But as you come up you don't have to come all the way up could just stop right at parallel and come right back down sets of 15 to 25 reps or really really good here on a first set But what I like to do is do whichever arm for me is the kind of the weak arm my right hand for obvious reasons Has bigger forms so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do my left first Let's say I get 17 reps immediately with no rest. I pass over to my right 17 reps immediately with no rest. I pass over and do however any reps I can with that left and back and forth and back and forth Why one the weaker arm anchors the repetitions and make sure that it gets closer to failure Because it's more capable and thus over time it'll balance out your forearm size another thing is While one of forearm is resting the other one is working and vice versa Which is super cool because then you can squish a lot of time down when as soon as you get the dumbbell in your hands for this exercise You were working working working either with one arm or the other arm when I like to do I last tip as as I'm working out my Forms if a guy Especially or maybe a girl walks by that I happen to like and they make accidental eye contact with me Which never see me in public never do I like to do a couple things like The give one of those are just one of these Or my favorite the double wing or My personal absolute favorite the cold stare as they walk by ready It creeps people out Last forum exercise that I have to share with you guys is what I call the bar push off It's a weird exercise against weird you're gonna get stairs with gym people and I ask you questions You're not gonna answer them just send us some of those people to our YouTube and maybe we'll just monetize I don't know how to help you but at least you don't have to explain a weird exercise, but I do Jesus here We go this exercise you basically get into a push-up position and you press off of a bar that's somewhere between Nehyde and kind of upper tummy height Depending on how strong you are how blasted your forms are already for all the other extra curricular stuff You've been doing it you know what I'm talking about You're gonna do a partial rep to a really deep stretch and you're gonna come back up about the midway point After the midway point either slip off the bar or there's basically no tension So it's these weird half reps you're doing at the full stretch midway point full stretch midway point If you hold that full stretch for a second or two it really helps the good news is is tension at a very good stretch The not so great weird news is that counting reps is kind of weird You don't really know if it's a rapper not so what I would recommend is this choose a total number of reps That is typical of your form workouts. Let's say earlier in the week you did some dumbbell risk curls I got 62 total reps on for all sets set of priority of 60 repetitions And with as many myorep breaks five second breaks or so between sets get 60 total done I'm even have to split these up in the sets and make sure you're really milking that a centric and milking that bottom stretch for a few seconds That is gonna get you crazy pumped how do you periodize this and progress through it and Reps every time 60 and week one 65 and week two 70 total week three and so on and so forth Is this something you do all the time know if you're bored and just tired of doing all the other form stuff This thing ribs and it's actually quite effective make sure you're nice and stable So you don't slip off the bar and bear yourself from another muscle mommy But if you do embarrass yourself just act with you really really upset so shouldn't maybe you'll come over and how do you Folks those are some of my favorite form exercises feel free to try them try my reps Try my rep matching try different reps try different sets One quick tip is you just don't need a lot of rest between forearm training sets as soon as your forms aren't so Pumped out of their mind and so crampy and so full of lack to gass a that you can't contract your hand You're good to go really five or 10 seconds maybe 15 seconds rest between sets is awesome for most of these cases And the best news is you're gonna get bascular you're gonna get better endurance and then that one hobby You love to do that you do all by yourself. You're gonna be better at it go go go do that hobby not on YouTube another kind of tube See you guys over there
