I'm good. I know a vomit I see one. I was just a cough. I don't like my legs dude. That was good. I'm good. What up, Warping YouTube. I am here with Bree. Who is two things? One. A current champion. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Who is two things? One. A current champion of NPC show. Who will be getting a pro card soon? And two, still my training partner. You guys recently saw a video of me and her training together. Unfortunately, my late training is over with for my prep. I have a show in about a week and a half. So she has to train legs alone today. But me and Dr. Micah are here for moral supports. She'll cheer her on and put her through hell. Because she has about how many more weeks of hard training before? And it's what shows it you say? Yeah, you say. So three weeks until USA, this means she has about four or five hard leg sessions left. Want to want to wish you all we're doing here with us? Yeah. I'm excited. Mic. Looking good. Thanks. Thanks to you, GSP. Revenue that shit. Folks, there's a mentality that bodybuilders close to contest have to put arm in body. And then mentality, you may think is a lion. Wolf, no tiger, no bear, get out of here. Minutes your docks. Why? Because the minutes your docks are not very big. It doesn't have a lot to go with. So it has to compensate with anger. Anger that as it's pushed further gets more intense. A breathe try to come up closer to me. That's how we're doing shit today. Kick it. So breathe my training partner, meaning I do her training for her. We oftentimes train the same things. And like I said, we talked about this in the other video. We did together. Sometimes at the ad in volume for her or she will add in other muscle groups at the day. She does a five day split and I do a six day, but we always train together. So today what she's doing is a lion hamchen curl. It's her lighter hamchen day. So we're actually doing an intensity technique on this one. We're a myorematche. She'll have three or four sets of the Leica Program. Three or four sets first set. She's going to get the tone and the next two sets she'll rep match. Probably going to suck, but she's here. She's ready for it. Yes. Good low. Good low. Good. Now you might wrap 15. I see a couple of sets. Okay, that's doable. I think. Yeah. That was a good. I like this machine. Yeah, it's very slight.

For those of you folks that are in the pop culture, at one point Cardi B claim that you neither cook nor cleans. Interestingly enough, that's what Cardi B and this Atlantis hack leg press select Christ combo. Haven't commented. No. It does not cook. No. It does not clean. It's a bit of a wonder. Internet of science. Jim and now is a permanent feature in our home. It's so wonderful and new. No one but Scott the video guy has broken it in yet. And since he doesn't count because he's always behind the camera, Bree is going to take a shot at the title. Folks will she survive? Let's find out. Probably like four, maybe five sets. Ultra deep. Super squats. Sets of 10 to 20. Let's make it. There you go. It looks like it's like a stealth helicopter was a machine. This is fucked up man. Yeah. We'll be good for it. Oh, we're going to come up. Four, four, three big rest and then if you get two, three more. Good. Come on. Yes. Slow is that you're going to do another. Wow. It's still sweaty. You can try for one of those on there. It's like you fucking with them. I think it's good I do. We're going to get you more in your motion. Let's make sure. Sorry. It's just fucked up. I know. Yeah. So we put a pad under this. Great piece of equipment, but we're all kind of super ultra full ROM addicts here. Put a little pad in here. It gives us an extra. And Mike, Dr. Mike's penis world. This is six inches. It's an extra six inches. And let's brigo deeper and. I think I've said enough. Maybe too much. Oh my god. Oh my god. One more. Go. Slow. Shull. Oh, it's that three. Three. Keep breathing again.

It's all quite no need. It's not an amazing. Yeah. Yeah. The second me and Mikey is this. I'll be a see. It's like one of my favorite leg pieces. Immediately. Yeah. Vans and I'll be a see again. What you go. Vans. Let's go. Let's go. Coyne. Let's go. Fizz eat. Coyne. Procard. Yay. This is your training for your procard in Michigan. A wall places. Yeah. Me. I always hit a wall. Me too. And it's it comes. I don't feel it coming on. Yeah. It might basically finish my session for me earlier. It's like time to go. I'm like, okay. He's like, archworm like, you're right. I can't. I can't. Shek come on. Who. Oh shit. Come on. Wow. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Five. Three. All fucking day. One. One. Oh, it's supposed to hurt. Push, breathe. Three, two more.

Three, big. Let's go. You do this yourself. Yep. Yeah. Go! Three, get it together. One more. Go. Gentle. Press. Speed. Up, up, up, up, up. Slow. Slow. Yes, gentle. Oh, yeah. So your first sets are like Dr. Mike Sets, and the last one was like a Charlie Johnson. Oh, my, try to learn. I'm not even the first sets. I'm a little shim. Do we have a... I'm good. I know a lot about that. I was just a cough. Oh, my god, my fucking legs dude. That was good. You pushed out on those. This looks like an anti-vaping commercial. You really does. What we're doing, did to this camera. We're on camera. Dude, I might hold body is fucking wet right now. She might be sweating this much. A minute ago, Bree was hanging out with her friends at the movie theater, hitting this fake, and now look what happened. Folks, listen to me when I say this, nicotine kills. Hey, girl, you're trying to hit that shit. I'm better now. Oh, yeah, no, dude. Welcome to RPG. You want to have hip thrice up, not checking it out? Yeah, absolutely. Dude, I've been doing 25 on that fucking machine. Yeah, I know. Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on. I don't know. I know how to work with prisoners. You never hear their complaints for help. I'm a Drake that shit. Can't help you. As I mentioned earlier, oftentimes we'll throw extra volume in for Bree. I don't need more good volume. Bree does to an extent. So on both of her leg sessions, we add in either a London thrust variation. We did have lunges today, but she had a little issue in the back portion of her Hampshire word. She's weak. So we are going to do a thruss today, probably barbell, since we don't really have to be in the variation of that here. She uses a machine of dragon there that is comparable to this. So she'll be elevated, shoulders up on there. And I got her a little pad for her. Her nice and frail waist because you're so lean. But it's going to be a giant set. 50 reps total. We might take some weight off. We'll see. This should be fine. Two. Let's get 10. Three. Four. Five. Way to hold that peak. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Good shit. Trust up. I made an audible because the machine is a little different. We're doing actual hip truss. But we're just going to do a superset. The lunges, she decided felt pretty good. So we're going to do bodyweight lunges after we do about 10 to 15 on the hip thrust. She's going to do two sets here. Thought I'll make up for the volume that we're going to do on the machine. If trust that we do dragon layer. She's enjoying it so far. So let's see how this next thing goes. Don't give over too much to the upright. Yeah, there you go. Turn all the way back. Slow around the way down. Yeah, there you go. There you go. Good. Long steps. Go, go, go. Yep. And all the way back and you're done. Quick. Quick. Come on. You should take it easy. Breathe that way. You can lose and fucking style. Go. Go. Go. Up. Good. Control. You do that. Great. This is easy fucking work. Another step. Good. Stay upright. Come on. Stay upright. Yes. Two more steps in your done. Let's go. Let's go. Stay upright. Good. Last one. Long step. Stay upright. The whole way through. One more shit per cent. One more. You're good. That hair makes everything you do look so cool. I feel like that just says athlete. You're like, oh, win. But I'll complain every step of the way. Every step of the way. But I'm going to do it. Completing and making jokes about how miserable I am makes it better. That makes it better. Yep. Eight. One more. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. I mean, you feel like everything is going to throw out. Is that? That pressure on my fucking style. Yeah. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. 25. Slow. I'm a decent. Yes. 26. Sinjeon. Let's go. 27. Good. 28. Don't you push off with that fucking hand. 28. Finish up strong. 29. One more. Up. Yes. Yes. You did it. We're all done. How long was that fucking workout? That felt like you went by way too fast. 45 minutes to an hour. Yeah. Yeah. You want us to take longer? We can add some shit. Fuck now. You're good. Straight up saying the wrong shit. Three. Good workout. Great. Great session. Sweet. Good job, Bree. It's me, Nwitch. Who is Bree? You lost. Who? What's up? She is. Now folks, I know some of you are thinking before we outro this that like we set the shop. legit. She just laid down after lunges and hasn't gotten up. We got to do an outro at some point so we just did it with her lying down. It's real life over here. Rana Somsjim. Jared Feather. Rianny Terry. Out here doing it. Trying to throw that pro card. Shit has to get done. Hell yeah. I'm going to stock your crystal back there too off camera and shit. Hi honey. Anyway, see you guys next time.
