Hit it, go, go, go, go, slow, slow, slow, pause. I did some RP bodybuilding today. Stick with me. Stick with me almost there. This is gonna be a bad week. Folks, we are in Cookville, Tennessee at CrossFit Mayhem. Me, as you know, I'm pretty good at CrossFit. I'm up there. I'm gonna come and say it. I'm in the conversation. Top 10, there's it. I was gonna say it. Top 10. Okay. This is Rich Frowning. He's essentially the best of all time. Certainly in the conversation for the best of all time. Me, I'm just the best kind of right now, but he's a legend. I'll be taking a back seat. Tyler here made an enormous mistake. He will learn that very soon. He jumped into this workout. You've worked out here. You worked out here. Oh, you barely had that. He's not much so fit. He's running around here. He's got his shirt off. He did. He's ready. We're gonna even start a training. In any case, Rich is gonna take a shot at the title to do an RP style hypertrophy quadriceps workout. Which actually only means we do two exercises. Because it is a CrossFit gym. We are bereft of machines, but we have one squat rack and a whole lot of open space. Do you sharp folks out there, probably thinking we're gonna do a whole lot of high rep squats and a whole lot of high rep lunges. We're gonna do a super-setted similarly to high rep squats. And that would be crazy of you to think. What an insane idea let's go do it. All right, so first rule is keep your chest up higher. The entire time, especially at the bottom. Excellent. Second rule is at the bottom. Very bottom. When you get all the way down, stop for two whole full second is each in every time. Perfect. Rule number three is descend. Three times. Lower than that. So you're gonna milk the descent. Yes, excellent. Good, just like that. Slow. Warmer's have been done. The guys are ready to go. The idea here is to do squats for lots and lots of reps. People talk about 20 reps squats. It's kind of the way to build legs. That used to be a thing people talk about all the time. They're probably more efficient ways to do this. But since this is a CrossFit gym, I think it's a good idea to do that. They're probably more efficient ways to do this. But since this is a CrossFit gym, I'm winning room. We are here for the pain. And by we, I mean these guys. 16, one more. Chest up. Up. 17, rest breathe a little bit. Don't go anywhere. Let's finish up these big three. Whenever you're ready. Awesome. One. Stay upright. Stop. Up. Two. One last one. Let's finish out these 20. Hit it. Chest up. Slow. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Rack. Fordless. You know, yeah. Whenever you're ready. Wait a control. Wow. Tyler, that was excellent. One. Again, slow. I'm going to be really insistent that the guys go down slow. But they keep their chest up. But they take full pauses at the bottom. And then they're trying to use their quads by not just squatting back and down. But by squatting back and down and then letting the knees drift forward on the way down. Staying as upright as possible. It's going to put maximum tension on the quads. It's going to be a. It's going to say bad time, but that's not really the case. It's going to be a good bad time. These guys are an excellent cardio shape. So if we want to my a rep this, which means at the top of after you do five or six squats and get tired. If you want to sit here for about three or four seconds, take a cup of breaths. And then begin again. Who does? We'll agree between the two of us one at the time to rack. Up. Good technique. Slow. Chest up. Pause. Up. Rack. Beautiful. And that's one here in the bank. How are you feeling? Yep. It's a good answer. Yep. Feeling. Feeling. So you'll sound the clans taking my time. Slow. Control. Pause. Up. Last one coming up. Right now. Right now. Right now. Go, go, go, go. Slow. Control. Chest up. Stand up. Up. Rack. Good. Good. Good. Back. Feeling your back on this, yeah? Yeah. You're like, yep, bad. Just tired. Yeah. Ideally, we don't do barbell squats for sets of 20. Why? One of the reasons is that other factors than the quadriceps tend to become limiting. These folks are international elite level crossfitters. So there are lungs, you notice, did not become limiting. They never even breathe heavy during sets of 20 in the squat. Which is kind of crazy. Think about it. At all. However, their backs did start to take over. And it became more of a lower back limited exercise. And a glute limited exercise then it was a quad-limit exercise. So what we did was we lowered the weight here. And we put the guys up on plates. Put heels under the plates. You can stay more upright. You can get your knees more forward. It becomes more limiting by the quad. Then it would be by the lower back by the mid back. By even the upper back after a while. That's a 20. Just holding the bar. It becomes irritating for the arms and the traps. You can lose some function in your arms for a second. There's the nerves get a little caught up in there. It's rough. If you only have a rack at home, you only have a barbell. Can you do this for hypertrophy? Yeah, sure can. It will absolutely grow everything in your lower body. Most of your quad glutes in lower back. But with these little modifications, we can get it to be just a little bit better. Up. 18. Say up right. Go go go slow. Slow. Pause. Up. Again, last one. Hit it. Go go go go go slow. Slow. Slow. Pause. Up. Back. Beautiful. You. A little better for the back. Better. Yeah. Excellent. Good. Good. Good. Again. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Up. Last one. Make it perfect. Slow. Slow. Excellent. Up. Rack. There you go. One. One. Up. Breathe. Good technique. Good technique. Only. If you have to dump no worries. 300 done. Hit it. Slow. Up. One. Slow. Up. Two. Last one. Think chest. Slow. Up. How are you, Rack? How are you? Last set of this exercise. Chest. One. Move it with your legs. Not with your back. Stand straight up when you get out of the hole. Up straight. Two. Three more. And three. Good. Two more. Up. One more. Stand straight up. Rack. Okay. Nope. One will be messed up to the problem. The guys have done five sets of 20 in the squat, which is fun to think about. And now it's time for the lunch to squat superset to really finish out the quads. Really finish cooking everything. They're going to have a weighted best son because holding weights for that many lunges is annoying. We're going to talk about how to do the lunch technique in a second. Let's get to it. Lunges. Hey, here's what we're going to do. Good news, bad news. We have a particular way of doing lunges at our pee. It's going to suck more probably. You're going to hate them more. Good. So again, the focus is on quality instead of just quantity. Every single lunch step. You just want to keep a couple rules. One is within reason, step nice and long. So none of this, this, right? Long step. And especially on the way down. Keeping your upper body upright. If you have to keep forward a little bit on the way up, not a big deal, but none of this bullshit like that. So a bad lunge wrap would look like this. And then a good one would look like that. Alternating. No rush. We're just going to do this shit at the same time. If you guys are okay with that, little friendly competition between the boys. Then we'll get in the locker room later. No, not takers. Every day in locker room. 40 steps. And then after 40 steps, set up your squat set up. Slow and controlled up. Slow and controlled up. No rest at the top. If you have to rest, you rest in a full bottom position. 20 squats. 40 slow quality lunges. 20 squats. And if you guys can time them to do roughly the same. Great. If not, no big deal. Slow or on the way down, gentlemen. Excellent. 14. Slow or 15. Good. Especially on the descent. 16. 40 turn. Phase four. Hands up. Squats. One. 19. 20 reps. Breathe for a second. I bet feel. Yep. 30 lunges. 30 and then 15. 25. 25 and 12. Begin when ready. Slow lunges. There's no rush to complete these. The purpose is the pain. 22 doing great guys. 23. Nice to slow on the way down. Gentle touch with the knee. 24. 25. Stay facing forward. Face the camera. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. Couple breath. Great guys doing great. We got two more sets left. And that's the whole workout. 25 and 12 again. Slow. Gentle touches of the knee. Begin now. 24. 25. Okay. Bonus round. I want you to squat and stay at the bottom with your chest upright until I say up. That's how every squat is going to work until we're nice and cook. Good to go. Down. Up. Heels and toes. Tyler, there you go. Down. Chest up. Up. Down. Hold. Up. Up. Down. Hold. Up. Again. Slow. Chest up. Up. And last one. Slow. Up. Up. And last one. Slow. Up. And last one. Slow. Up. Up. Up. Hold. Keep your chest up as much as you can. Stick with me. Stick with me almost there. Up and done. Good shit fellas. That hurt. That was solid. That hurt me watching. Good stuff. Good stuff. Good stuff. Here's our stuff. Feels overqualified. Look at them legs. Couple observations. About elite level crossfit. One is as far as I can tell they don't have a gas tank. I don't know where the stuff comes from, but they just keep going. It's strange. Nothing is nobody really took a lot of big breaths the entire time. Nobody's out of breath. Again, very strange. Another thing. They do tend to revert back to sport style technique of getting the job done quick and efficiently versus exposing the muscles. So there has to be lots of queuing to make sure we do things on purpose inefficiently to get the target muscles hit versus just doing the job. That being said, these guys take instruction like machines and zero complaining. And at the end of every set at which I thought they were for sure going to die. They were just like, yeah, that sucked. And then they just kind of walk off. It's weird. It's surreal. This is not their first workout. It's not their first 1500th workout. Unbelievable. Gentlemen. An honor. An honor. And I'm sorry about what happens to your legs in the next few days. Are you guys competitive bodybuilders now? Is it official? Oh, yeah, we're there. This is the transition. This is all the attorney's 22. Yeah. So what do you guys think of a workout? It's good. It's hard. Definitely something I'd be to do more of just what you've got. It was left knee just where I tore that man's head and just tried to strengthen everything around it. You know, just like you're saying, we do more sports specific stuff. A efficiency. It's not really worried about isolating a particular muscle or older I get. And it'd probably be more advantageous even when I was younger to do more target. Sure. I think you know, fine things that are going to target and strengthen things around that knee. Sure. Any type of injury? That's something I've learned with this shoulder. You know, I've got a couple of stairs on the rotator cuff just from 13 years of competitive CrossFit. I get it's going to happen. So I can strengthen the delt, the packs, the rhomboids, everything around it. Keep serving. It's everything stable. So that's something that I've learned over the last. I'm not. I've known it. I just don't like to revert back to that. I think it's not as fun as it's not as easy as what we do. I want to come in here and hurt because that's where the way we're programmed. And so it's good to do this type of stuff. Slightly more focused. Yeah more focused. Think about what muscles are getting, uh, innovative and, you know, a little bit of kinesthetic awareness of thinking about, all right, we're no, I'm trying to target something here. I'm trying to, you know, strengthen and grow. Yes. Different science. Yes. What's the secret to the hair? Why is it so luscious and why is it so full of volume? I don't know. I haven't said it in a while. Just genetics. Just raw talent. Yeah. Thanks, Mom. Yeah. Of course. Cheating. Um, I'll have hair tips later. You guys know this. I'll see you in the hair channel. Yeah. What are you asking me? I'm like, look, I'm trying to get to that. I'm just gifted. Yeah. I'm just saying. Gentlemen, thank you so much for your time. Thank you for humoring my absurd nonsense of humor. Thank you.
