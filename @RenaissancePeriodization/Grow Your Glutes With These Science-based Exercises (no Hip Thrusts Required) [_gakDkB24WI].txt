That was awful. Grab the bar, do it again. Do you want to be on the channel? Here you are on the F*** channel. Ha ha ha ha ha. Hold on a cry, seriously. Good, you can cry on camera, it's okay, you won't be the first or the last. I'm the one who's been on the channel. Folks, I'm Dr. Mike. This is a lot of us that link you with it. I may be one of the only people in the world to be able to say that because I am from Russia originally. She is from Lithuania, otherwise known as Lithuania, which is a sure, how actually easier to say in Lithuania. Here's the thing with Lithuania. They have at least a lot of who is an IFB bikini pro. But Lithuania actually has like maybe half of the world's strongest humans of all time and the strongest man to ever walk there. So as a journalist of these guests, who is just is King and God and Emperor and everything that is man. The real cool question before you introduce the rest of the video. Have you ever run into him in real life? Actually, yeah, I believe I did, but it was very long time ago. But you never forgot because now you know how true romance feels, seeing a real man. Exactly. Exactly. This is how it flies. Perfect. Reading Romeo and Juliet, but in real life. Excellent. When I saw him, it was much the same. Folks, good news is Lada is an unbelievable shape. She is two weeks out of a show. Almost two weeks out. We're going to go hard. We are going to train glutes. We are going to train hamstrings. We're going to do a little bit of quad work. Because the judges are like, your quads are too big or whatever. What a win of A no. Just kidding, judges. She's great. But that's the upside. The other upside is this. Anyone else we have on the channel, you can try hard and it's totally cool. Yeah. You cannot try anything other than the maximum. Because Lithuania has a strength lineage and you're at the very top. This is why I need to show off. Time to show off. Time to show off. Time to show off. Time to show off. Front foot on. Back foot wherever's comfy. Nice and far back. It doesn't have to be forever back. And here's the big deal. This will be easier when you have the bar in your hands. You want almost all of your weight on the front foot. The back foot, you stand on your toe, it's just for balance. Yeah. So front foot slow and controlled gentle touch on the ground. I'm still putting all of the weight in the muscle. I can, my foot back here is doing almost nothing. And then come up and then again make sense. Everybody on the front right. Everything on the front. Smith machine. Front foot elevated lunge. The critical thing here is to put as much weight in the front foot as possible. And as little weight in the back foot as possible. Slowly controlling the descent, slower, slower, slower, slower. Then you think no matter what you think it's slower on the way down, go real deep, pause for a second and come up. Narlie and here's the other thing. People like to do one leg and then switch into the other leg. Don't switch right away. It's systemically fatiguing. Do one leg. Rest like at least 15 seconds. 30 seconds to be still strong and then go to the max leg. It's like one arm row. You don't switch right away. It's one separate set from the other. 15. Three more. Slow. We only count good reps. 16. Again, don't rest. There's no rest. 17. Down. Slow. Up. That was too fast to do it again. Slow. Yes. It's more hypertrophy for you. That's why you're here. Yeah. Hell yeah. There you go. Perfect. Good. Rest it out. I'm going to just cry in the corner. Oh please. Wait for me. 16. Two more. Slow. Pause. Up. One last one. Make it good. Right away. Slow. Pause. Up. Yeah. Hell yeah. Rack. Oh shit. Oh day. Oh my. You're doing us as smiling right now. He's proud. He's so proud. Yeah. You feel he's okay. Quads a bit. Yeah. I've got some of my plants always turn to do quite a bit of job with any exercise that I do. Yeah. You do imperils. You feel your ball. Exactly. Hold on a try. Good. You can cry in camera. It's okay. You won't be the first or the last. Yes. 13 down. 14 down. 15. You got to pause the bottom to get the next one. Slow as hell when we do it again. Yes. Rack. Good. Good. Stop. Okay. Rack's it out a little bit. 12 amazing. Almost there down. Slow. 13 down. Slow. Slow. 14 down. Down, down, down, down. Slow. Oh god damn it that was terrible. Come up. That's 14 again. Lotta. Fix it. You can do better. Go slow. Up. Beautiful. One more left. Slow as hell. Wait. Up. Rack. I'm so glad we are done here. Oh, to the turf to do deadlift. Yay. Yay. Next exercise is the sumo deficit deadlift. A couple cues here. Why do they show to a stance? Toes pointing further out than you think is reasonable. Usually the cue. Because if you point in this way your knees go over if you point him out your knees go out. Your back stays nice and flat. You're going to feel your glute stretch already. The deficit is to put that fucking nasty stretch on them and then stand back up and then slow on the way down with a gentle pause at the bottom of every single breath and come back up. If grip is an issue, use versegrips or straps. Double overhand is totally fine if you're doing it for hypertrophy work. Do not bend your arms. So when you first get the bar straight in your arms out, put tension for your shoulders and then come up. It is not a fucking bicep exercise. I think it trains the suffering muscle. Do you have dishes for like tears? You're lifting the waning. The blood of your enemies will be your tears. We'll go slow. Slow work doesn't count. Wait. Up. Go. Go. One more bonus round. You're lifting the waning and wake up. Slow. Slow. Newsy. Breathe. And then slow it. If you're going to do another one. Chest up. Slow. Slow. And drop. Good stuff. Oh my god how many sets are we doing here? Like 80. We're bigger for hours. I'll find 90. You talk me into it. One more. Chest up. Slow. That was awful. Grab the bar. Do it again. Two more reps. Chest up. Stand up. Good. One more. Slow. Slow with a pause. Come on Latter. Slow. Slow. Slow. Wait. Up. Up. And then slow it. If you're going to do another. Go. Slow. Slow. Slow. Wait. Wrap. Woo. Where about eight? Two more. Look forward. Begin. Slow. Slow. Slow. Wait. Slow. Up. That was terrible. Do it again. Good technique. Hold onto that bar Latter. Hold onto the bar. Squeeze the bar. Slow. Wait. Up. Get the bar. Up. Up. Up. Up. And then slow. As if one more. Slow. Slow. Slow. Rack. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. The slow motion of it is the best part. Doesn't even have the enemy movement. There you go. That was great. That was great. Now we do RDL. Oh no. So the first rep I want you to pick it up just like a deadlift. Just regular. Yeah. Now, chest up, hips back, knees back, slow. Yes, except like three times lower. Yeah. Yeah. Chest up, slow, low, low, low, low and up. Good. And again, fought back, knees back, knees back, yes, and up. Very good. And rack. This is so easy. Too heavy. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's a little less grace. That was very good. You were too hopeful. Too hopeful. Well, we beat you up so bad on the deadlift. So there's nothing left. Up. Good. Good. One last one. Again, go, slow. Knees back, knees back, tension on the hamstrings. Don't let it go. Up. Go, go, go. And then if you're going to do another one, slow on the way down, begin. Chest up, fought back, knees back, knees back, knees back, slow, weight. Up. That's it. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. And glutes. And glutes of force. For the next set, I want you to come down and almost at the ground. I'll tell you when to stop. I want your knees to be back and I want you to wait for two seconds. But the way to stone your hands, you're not unloading it. You're just folding it. Like a centimeter above the ground. Go. One more. Go. Go. Go. Slow. Knees back, knees back. Up. Nobody's set up yet. Again, go. Go, go, go, go, go. We hear the train. We hear the lift weights. You said you wanted to be on the channel. Here you are on the fucking channel. Wait. Up. Down. Slow. Slow. Knees back. Knees back. Knees back. Knees back. Knees back more. Up. Oh, that's it. That's failure. Woo. One more set left. Whenever you're ready. Take a nice long break. The series you want to kill me today. That's my job. Killing people. I mean, killing. You don't look dead. I don't want to call it. Almost killing. Up. Good. Two more. Again, slow. Back, knees back. Up. Yes, one more. Hit it. Slow. Knees back. Knees way more back. Now wait. Up. Up. Up. Up. And then slow is it. You're going to do another one. Good technique. Knees back from the start. Knees back. Back. Back. Back. Knees back. Slow. Slow. Wait. Rack. Oh, my goodness. This was the last one. That was the last set of stiff leg of deadlets. You can die in the floor again if you want. To finish off the workout. One set of squats for the quads. But it's a fun RP style set. We'll clue you in when the time comes. Fun doesn't sound good. Well, fun's relative. You're going to stand on the plate. Toast point it slightly out. We'll give you the bar. You'll have the bar on your back. You're going to squat down. And the main thing is two things. Chest always up. Knees always forward. If you squat like this. Pause at the bottom until I say up. Come up. And then again, you're going to do as many reps as you can with the bar. Lose a bit. It's going to come over and we'll spot you. Oh, please. After you've done like 80 reps or something, we'll take the bar off for your hands up and you keep doing squats until you cannot do squats. Wait, look forward. Up. Stand up. Oh, you got another one. Begin. Go. It's only pain. Look forward. You're going to do more. We rest. The more reps we have, you just keep bucking going. Up. Go. Go. Go. One last one in your dung. Roll the bar up on your shoulders. Roll the bar up. One last rep. You better do it right. Or it'll be two more reps. Look forward. Look forward. Slow. Deep. Deeper. Rest. Wait. Up. Stand up. Stand up. You can do it. You can do it. Let go of the bar. Stand up. Hands forward. Hands forward. Right now. Right now. Let's go. Right now. Hands up. Look forward. Go slow and low. Slow. Slow. Wait. Up. Stand up. Again. Two. Down right away. Good. I'm going to help you with these. I'm helping. Go up. You're not. Down. Slow. Control it. Up. Up. Up. One last one. For fun. Resist me on the way down. Begin. Resist. Resist. Let me feel some of that with the waning strength. Chest up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Oh. Oh. We'll count it. That's it. Please. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Down's great. That was really good. That was really good. Aw. You really tried. I'm sorry. I'm fondly thing we ever asked on the channel. Two things. Good technique. And you try. And then both. And now you can't walk anymore. I'm supporting my punch sheet. Of course. And you didn't. Tell the folks how you feel. Well. I feel fine, Dan. But it feels good. I feel pumped. My grooves are pumped. Hamstrings. Quads. Legs. You've complained to the average amount, but... ...avers? Below average actually. For bikini, way below average.
