Oh, you got more. Keep going. Go! Three, don't you fake it Amanda. You got two more at least. Up. Hey folks, it's me Dr. Mike for YouTube, 4 Rattason Spearization, and an interesting tangent that I promised I'll leave back in. There is a Japanese heavy lift construction machine company called Komatsu. And we got a little bit of our own flavor at that shit because Amanda got hot soup. Has a bit of Japanese in her, yes? 50%. 50% that means she's 50% industrial grade lifting machine. I wish I would have come up with you. Clearly, we go well on your way. Now, this workout is going to do so much straight damage to the gym. We were not allowed to legally do it without an officially licensed fellow sports medicine doctor. And she had to be so close. She had to actually do the workout. This is Dr. Crystal. And no relation. But I got one of them. I got my eye on one of these girls. I don't flirt ever, ever, ever professionally on set. I may make an exception today. In any case, I just love we meeting you ladies. But we're going to do a little back workout, little IFBB pro and a little IFBB pro. And just going to be tons of giga-going, tons of room or meal bullshit. And tons of me trying to train these young ladies to have bigger backs. And a shit, girls with them. All right. Watch for the technique. Watch for the effort. Watch for Amanda's traps. They're not that hard to find. And watch for Dr. Gavara's straight animal intensity. Let's get in. All right. First exercise is the Atlantis chess supported row. It's a great machine. There's a truly different ways to use it. We'll be using one of them. The ladies are probably going to be doing some wide grip growing. Oh, big deep stretch. Arch all the way at the top. And a full sweaty center troll. Set up 10 to 20 here. I want to start with this movement. Because the rest of the workout is going to be much more vertical pull and the last focus. So this is going to hit a lot of traps, middle traps, rhomboids, rear delts, all that stuff. You can go there, went with, with up there. And then we can meet with the last. And then you go into the world. And people say hello to you for the first time. Because you have a big back. They're nice to you when you're like that. Let's get into it. 12. You build that stretch. We don't count it. 13. Two more. Pull up high. Use your body. Yes. Slow. Attack the egg last one. Slow. Control. Control. Control. Stretch. Woo. We're tearing. Fire. Good. That was really good.

Couple more. Two more. One last one. Good. Attack. Go. Slow. As if another big stretch. Got it. Yeah. I'm sorry to yell at you. I have a trouble. I feel like we're really good match up for training together. Because we're both like, like, babies, but we're stuck for the whole time. Like, like, like, like, she makes ugly faces and it's going to be hard. Good. Three more on your done. Big, good. Slow. Watch. Up. Slow. Stretch. Big stretch. That's one. Two. Slow. Big stretch.

Stop thinking it'll ever be over. You just fucking pull it. Pull again. Slow. Pull again. Got damage. One more crystal. We're going to burn up. Let's go. Into the place. Amazing. One more last one. Let's see. Set that energy. Move. Yes. Slow. Slow. Slow. Big stretch. And here. Good. That was a whole legal ceremony. That was good. That was good. That was good. That was good. She was like, I want to go on YouTube and have a fun work. That was like, oh, you're crazy. You know, I've been bitterly like, complicated. Just thinking about working out of my life. That's a lot of things we're not training legs here. Safe. Yes. Next up, we have assisted pull ups. Assistance allows us to get more reps and focus on really good technique. After the row is the ladies of tradition, shambled up. So sets of 10 to 20 reps. High quality is important here. Slow on the way down. Cook on the way up. Make sure you're in your motion that deep stretch at the bottom. Try four sets. 10 to 20. We did four sets of 10 to 20 rows. You guys see a theme today. That's the theme. Let's get into it. Oh, you got more. You got to go. Three. Don't you fake it, Amanda. You got to more at least. Up. Slow. Up. Slow. Slow. Slow. Pause. Stretch. Unwrap. Yes. Yes, one more. Pull straight up. One more. Fire. Go. Slow. Slow. Big stretch. Hold it. One wrap. There you go. That little leg was like a little. It's like a little. On the road. She was doing both. I know. Can yours after do that? Mine can.

Slow. On wrap. That's a good last set. Good. Oh, the. That was a little bit. Okay. Oh, we got, we neither said any. Nobody tried on that fist bump. No. That was no. In short. Lat first. Great. Wonderful. We trained for our last, but we also pray for them. I'm praying for my last right now. For sure. The lat prayer. A couple things you want to keep in mind. One is you want to lean over here at this top part so that your lats are stretched a ton. You don't want to stop here. You want to reach overhead. Up there. Somewhere I can't do that. I'll be back in here. As you come down, I want you to come down and hit in just a little bit, a tiny little bit. And then as you go down, I want you to lower your chest to get a big stretch. And then come on. We pause here. And then we pause gently here. Okay. Keep those arms pretty straight. Three more in your duck. One slow. Go! Chest down. Six slow slow slow slow. Good slow. One more. It's easy work today. We're here taking a fucking off. Slow big stretch chest down. Rack. Down. Go. Yes. Go. Slow. One last one. One last one. Open and pause. Down. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Slow. Rack. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Shit. I'll turn away from the camera. You turn into that camera. We proud of yourself. Slow. Deep. Yes. That was the perfect wrap. Again, do it again. Perfect. Slow. Build that shit. Again, hit it. Yes. No bad thing of the elbows. We're here only to protect you. That was a stupid, awesome wrap. I hate myself for looking at it. Chest down, chest down, open off, yes, stout. That's it, that's it, that's it. That's it. Ah! That's it. It's good, stop. This is looking at my stout. Good, yeah, yeah. These are perfect, Chris. So I got nothing to say except P.P. And perfect. Oh, yes. Milk that shit, stretch that shit. Ah. Ah. Ah. Oh, yeah. We got a re-all. Yeah, I got a re-all. Chest down, big reach. Ah! Yes, one more. Good technique. Only good technique. Go, go, go, go. Slow is it for another. Slow is it for another. Slow is it for another, chest down. Open up, open up big and control. Wrap. Fuck. Howly on. Do that with sweet. Man, don't say any of her another side of those. That was really good. I don't want to do those anymore. That was yours. Maybe ever. You guys did amazing. You showed up. You did great technique. You ground yourselves into a giant fault boat. Flash and bats. There's a lot of bats. Dr. Crystal, what did you think? I was, that was a lot of work. That's all I had to say. Great. Amazing insight for a doctor. Where do you think? I think I am more pumps than I have probably other things. I never thought I would cry doing assisted pull-ups and lat prayers. But I shed a little tear today. Doing what most people would, like, in the county of the world with college accessories. But I think that's going to be a big lesson for me, shifting from housing today is there is no accessory. All the movements are the core movements. Folks, while of these ladies on social media, the planning is to stop some customer medical shift. I see pro man. She's been around for forever, even though she's only 22 years old. Somehow, she's been around for generation. I think it really is. Tons of good stuff. And I mean, physique is like, when she turned pro, she turned pro in like six different divisions at the same time. Bitch had their pro card out. Amanda had her shit and she's like, I'm gonna have that too, bitch. I'm gonna have that. And hey, hey, come here. What was you in Cynthia? That bitch. I got 18 pro cards. I'd pour pro cards on me like it's fucking raining. Oh, my nose. My nose got bugger's in it. I blow it even another pro card. You got a pro card? That's just mine too. They were given him out. There was a bogo that year. People were clutching out of them for fear. And she still ripped. There was one eight year old. They got a pro card and Amanda's like, come here. Hello. The chaps look kid. I'm gonna re-sought the my own arts. He was there, but none of that happened. I'll see you guys later. Hey.
