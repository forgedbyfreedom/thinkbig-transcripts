The reps and reserve are giant question mark. Sometimes it's total failure sometimes it's like 10 reps and reserve and it's a set today I'm working on feel bro a lot of times they say they do five sets, but they'll do three and just off that shouldn't happen to all the Hey folks doctor Mike here for Renaissance periodization today's video is gonna tell you Suggest to you rather in the spirit of scientific inclusivity that you should probably train more than the pro body builders You follow that is do more sets per workout Potentially and almost certainly do a higher frequency of training a given muscle if your favorite pro trains Chest one so we can you might be able to get away with training it twice and getting better results for your own body But this is curious what a curious stance I'm taking typically you might have heard that the pros Train a ton and you don't want to train as much as they do because Because hashtag there on drugs and they can recover there is absolutely something to that But there is more Because you guys come here to get that smart smart shit begin smart smart shit now first of all The reasons why you should consider training more than your favorite pro bodybuilder I'm on average if your favorite pros doing 20 sets of workout and maybe no ever do that fiber type your favorite pros Probably are more fast twitch fiber dominant which means Faster fibers usually have smaller volume requirements They get so stimulated from so little volume and they're often so big and strong per fiber That they just really don't need much volume to grow and if they try to do more They would start to get fatigued and grow less a Lot of the pros that you follow the reason they could have gotten so big among other factors Don't you worry we'll get to those is that they're gifted and having a higher proportion of faster twitch fibers And those folks cannot recover from any more training often than they're doing and what they're doing is just not that big So in many people the hamstrings tend to be a little bit more fast twitch than other muscles How many of you can do 10 sets of hamstrings of good technique and remotely recover for a week later? Almost no one no imagine having fast super fast twitch chest and side delts and biceps and triceps It's kind of like a whole hamstring body Yeah, I'm getting like gotta go to a an art GPT art AI generator and be like the body as a hamstring and turn somebody try that Let me know how it goes But in any case it just turns out you just don't need much most of us are not like to pros We have a broader range of fibers all everyone has a broad range of fibers, but we're more evenly split faster twitch and slower Twitch some of us are more slow twitch than fast twitch and we can benefit from even more volume Precisely the people that are not pros are more likely to be a little bit more on the slower twitch end Then the group of people that are gifted and or pros So watch out for that because what is good enough for a pro because they're gifted and fast twitch muscle fibers may not be enough for you Next Pros are big they're strong and when you get really strong Your ability to damage and stimulate muscle growth is just really not this not that hard Like using myself in an example even though I'm not a pro I did I had a hacksquat PR earlier at the dragons layer where I might be the only person that's not a pro there at that gym and I did a six plates on the hacks. What the arsenal hack for a set of ten was a really big PR and I like I only did Four sets of hacks and then like a drop set of body weight stuff like what's our cooked for four days? Why four sets of you fucking survive? Sift total for the workout one of them being bodyweight bullshit. How's that possible? Well fuck man you put six weights six plates on the bar you take it through four range motion for a couple sets of like around ten reps There's just so much fucking damage because it's fucking plates and I'm not even a pro I'm not that strong you got guys using the 160 pound dumbbells doing good technique for sets of ten A fun inclined dumbbell press you just don't need that many of those to stimulate so much growth That you can't scale pros to the rest of you the same thing happens in power All the very strong power lifters big strong guys in the 275 to 42 weight class, etc You look at their volumes are like he doesn't do that many sets You'll go do a set with 800 for five and like oh, yeah, okay just kidding that would probably kill me It indeed would so there's another adjuster to take how much pros do understand you're not as strong as they are You may need more sets to stimulate more growth next Bigger muscles can not only generate more force to damage themselves and stimulate themselves more, but they also take more time to heal if You know back in the day Marcus rule who is one of my favorite pros of all time just on a sheer audacity of this was he Google him if you You want he used to do one chest workout a week but his chest was so fucking big that it's bigger than most people's glutes Oh, just categorically and strong if he hits his chest It's just gonna take a long time for his chest to recover So either as to truncate his volume and time to do a twice a week or do what looks like a normal volume once a week That's all they can do Look at big ramen shoulders Bro, that's a lot of muscle if that muscle gets stimulated and fatigued It's just just come back the next day and do shoulders again It's gonna take time to heal and thus either the frequency has to be lower or the per session volume has to be lower You don't have that problem. You have shoulders that are much smaller than big-rimeists Sorry, I'm taking a guess here as to who our viewer is. I'm right about almost every one of the world You can certainly train shoulders more often because the muscle is smaller It doesn't take as long to heal to recover back to baseline or more and then when you can hit it again Now, so he asks you should train more than the pros, but not too much more for at least two reasons first Pros take drugs and Drugs help you recover Better and faster in an asshorter time frame But I'm gonna tell you the real real that real shit because other people speculate Maddie speculate they assume Your boy's not Maddie. I don't have to speculate or so we should I'm around a ton of top athletes that are not natural neither am I Drugs absolutely make a difference in recovery But not that much of a difference. It's a big deal If you can recover from seven sets on average that's your MRV for a muscle group without drugs Taking a whole bunch of drugs layering up to what is it the top end of Reasonable not I'm gonna die next year kind of dose you might be able to heal from 10 or 11 sets or something like that In the same time frame it's not 14. It's Shit not 21. There's no drug to get on where you triple your volume. It just doesn't happen It's occasionally an happen very unlikely It's a very uncorrecteristic so if you're looking at pros and you're like yeah, but drugs like Definitely if they were not on drugs they could recover from less however I put this to you Drugs do a couple of things in the acute term in the short term when you take them for a few weeks few months They boost your recovery like crazy, but watch this Take them for a while and the drugs increase your strength and the increase your size and those two things feed back in to Reduce your volume requirements even though your recovery has come up Your volume requirements have come down because you're now bigger and stronger So in the end the drugs F if a pros been taking them for a few years They kind of level out and then the net balance the pros not doing any more sets than he was four years ago before he started drugs Same number of sets at first it was more than he had to crank it back down because he got so big and strong I can't do 12 sets of quads anymore. This is fucking crazy because big strong quads can't Take 12 sets of damage. They don't need it and they don't have to have it. They can't recover from So there's limits there Yes the drugs help, but not as much as the strength and fiber type and the muscle size push them into that other realm of not leading as much volume Next effort okay Pros on paper train a lot I'll say this in other way that's more actors Pros say they train more than they actually train on average not everyone of course But you'll see what the training looks like and it's like all 15 sets for back And then you go and train with that pro where you have them on your YouTube channel and train them or you see them at the gym every fog and Monday do their workout The reps and reserve are giant question mark sometimes it's total failure or sometimes it's like 10 reps and reserve That's a set today. I'm working on feel bro a lot of times they say they do five sets, but they'll do three and just fuck off That should happens all the fucking time and Jared Feather was on this channel a while back and he kind of is even more in tune with what the pros do he is a pro And he's like bro almost all these people just fucking will say how much they train and it's like it's like half of that or two thirds of that So when I'm telling you to train more than the pros and you see that the pros train with 10 sets per muscle Let's say they really train with like six or seven So you will still train more than the pros, but maybe if you just copy the pros you're actually doing the right amount of volume So that brings that figure down a little bit gives it some more context So yes, you should be training more than the pros a lot more than what they actually train and maybe a little bit more or close to what they say They train especially on per set Per session volume how many sets of how many hard sets of chest for example They do in on a Monday Now here's your path here's how to take all this and do better with first You probably in general want to stick at most times between Five sets per session and 12 sets per session per muscle group most people will find their best results somewhere within there If the pros do 20 fuck them if the pros do three fucking next your per week or per muscle frequency Should be at least one time higher than the pros if the pros train their chest twice you could probably train your chest three times If they train legs once you could probably train legs twice it is usually the frequency is the pros Can't handle the most because when they get so big and strong their workouts beat their joints up a little more. I could have added that in as another reason Lots of other Secondary reasons a lot of times they don't train with great technique So with ends up happening is they're like hey like I train shoulders once a week and you're like why not twice? Like man my shoulder was can't handle it like okay, you're fucking getting it in on a train But also yes, that's a good point. So if I see my favorite pro with big shoulders trains shoulders once a week I know that maybe in part it's because of all these other reasons we talked about and because it just can't recover because it's shoulder joints are fucked up But I don't lateral raise the 80s. I sure shouldn't do it with terrible technique Which is probably why I'm not using the 80s in part using the 15s or whatever And then you can train shoulders at least twice a week so give that some thought and When you start whatever training you have whether or not it was inspired by a pro or inspired by a pro and modified according to this video You know add some frequency Potentially increase the volume over time You want the most important feature of that isn't where you start it's how you auto regulate for more You go if you're training seems like it's too much you're just getting tired or not progressing well you're sore all the time you never heal Train less and you will grow Let me tell you guys about the RP high-perchography app with over 28 preset programs already in the app You could choose to make your own you can modify an existing program or you can just run the programs Exactly as they were written by a personal this app programs everything for you exercises weights sets reps Frequency the whole thing after every single workout on every single week The app adjusts to your unique parameters with every single input we have over 250 exercises in the app with detailed video tutorial links to every single one You never have to be confused about technique or form ever again Guessing right now you're pretty interested in the app download the RP high-perchography app today On the other hand if the training is pretty easy you think you could do more and still recover train more Increase by little decrease by little find that place for a few weeks of a mesocycle where you're getting sore You're getting tired you're recovering just on time and you're still progressing That is your formula for success no matter what the pros do Folks give that some thought if you want to upgrade your nerd level shit Just talk about all these braiding concepts and even more depth consider the members area It's five bucks a month extra videos every week and a whole bunch on their bonus stuff and if you really want to ask myself Personal questions like excuse me Mike is it true that you at one point had the third largest penis in the entire Develop world I wasn't gonna tell you because I should as a members area.
