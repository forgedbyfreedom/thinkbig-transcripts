Oh yes. I'm gonna be a hard lock-out man. Up and back, up and back, go. Go, go! Feel a week just from being sore. Yeah, make sure. It's okay, it's all I tested my roof wing. Yeah, yeah. It's sh**. I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be... You're what up? Dr. Mike here. For a second. Yo, what up? Dr. Mike here. For a second. For a second. Jared, for other I-FB pro. Super Coach. Tristan Lee. Mega soccer player. Mega influencer. Dare I say tick-tocker. That was just... That was just... That was just my apology. I've been coaching Tristan here for about two months now. It's been really fun. He's eating all kinds of carbohydrates. And he's training very, very hard. So today we're putting Tristan through a push session. We're gonna be utilizing the RP Hyperch3 app. It's gonna be a good time. You're gonna see all kinds of cool screenshots, cool little features. We might add in there. We're gonna change out exercises since we're in a new gym. But it'll be good to go since... Just coaches literally here guiding him through. Oh. Like a bird. That goes... They get spurs. Oh. Let's get to the workout. For a part we need to... I don't know if you look anymore. You know what I mean? Yeah, you go to the dressing. I want to do some crab walk. Yeah, soccer warm up. I see that. Hi, ladies. Some pushups on up. That's what you're... I don't... I don't... Scabs though. Oh, we're a crab. Yeah! Wow! Alright. Exercise number one is the low incline dumbbell fly. The elbow angle here is something you choose that feels comfortable. Two straight is gonna be weird on your elbows. Two bent is just gonna be kind of more of a press than a fly. 135 degrees is a real good start. But play around with it. What you want to make sure is that the degree of bend is as stable as possible. That's all range of motion. You don't want to do a situation when you lower the bend at the bottom. You'll notice that sometimes, trust him, during this exercise, we'll start to lower the bend. But then he knows not to do that, so he'll straighten it out a little bit. Those micro corrections can be very, very important. As you go down, you want to go super deep or track your shoulder, weights back to expand the chest. And you want your chest to stay super up so as you're taking your wrists and lowering them as deep as you can. You're also lifting your chest as high into this guy as you can. Very slow at the bottom. This is not an exercise when you choose a ton of weight, beef, hoe. Never any fast transitions out. Go down nice and slow, cause, and then accelerate out of the bottom slowly. Let's get it done. Yes, good. I was always pushing your chest to the ceiling as it goes down, getting a much larger range of motion of stretch to the chest. Let's go. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Let's go. So next exercise was technically a Smith machine high incline bench. We are doing same high incline, but just with a barbell. This is a fine way to swap out exercises. And if you're going to do that on the app, basically what you're going to do is exactly what we're doing today. We're going to work up to a weight that was similar as you guys know most Smith machines are a bit easier. You can use the bit more load and we usually count the Smith machine implement as 45 pounds anyway just with a barbell. So we're going to work up to a load that feels similar to the 165 that he used last week. He's going to try to either rent match with probably 155 is my best bet. That's about usually my shift is about a 10 to 20 pound shift depending on the Smith machine to the barbell. So likely it'll work up to 155 maybe a little lighter depending on how he feels. And we will try to beat reps. I believe there's probably an added set in there as well. So this is still a few letting volume the way you would want. So that's how you swap it out on the app. If you don't have access to something good access to an approved, yes, micro cycle or week. Alright, let's go. πε.... Ah. Well. Oh, it's down there. Yes. Get him, alright. I guess that Smith machine is lighter. Oh hell enough. Smith is wii. No, I mean then even then we thought. I didn't have the ability to pick back her. And we just trained chest to you as well. The camera doesn't know that. I didn't know. I feel like we just from being sore. Yeah, make sense. It's okay. It's all like chest is my weak point. So what Tristan is doing right now is he's taking the two sets that were still on this exercise, skipping the weights or getting rid of those two sets that were at 150. And adding two down sets instead to keep them in the reference that we're trying to keep them in. So instead of just decreasing performance like you got a and the first set, then making it six, then you might get four. We're going to take those two sets and remove them. Hit the add down set feature. Go to 135 and try to keep them in that 10 plus reference. Oh, one more. Go back, back, back, back. So he's in normal benches where you're like slide my way on. Yeah. See. Beautiful way to push it back. One more. Control. Go up. Good. Good. Excellent. Next exercise. J.M. Press style skull crusher. But with the twist, Matwist is a physical twist. Super set. The deficit push-ups on my god out. This is going to hurt. Tristan is going to grab the ultra comfy handles here with an open palm grip. And he is going to go down to his next slash face area. I'll be close to the neck. And see if he can't get his neck close to touching this. Why are we doing this? Because tension imposed a deep stretch. It's more muscle growth promoting than tension imposed at other ranges of motion. And this level of depth is going to be a ketoclysmic in nature. Tragedy or triumphant. To the next for deficit, skull crusher, jam, press. Albusin. Yes. Beautiful man. Keep it up. Oh yes. Motel after these centers really use that stretch. Use the punch out of the fist up now. One more. Let's get it. Albusin. Big stretch. Big stretch. Use it. Go. Yes. Press. Okay. What's over? Look forward not down. Some can pause at the bottom. There you go. Time for a hug. Up and back. Oh shit more. Yup. Cored. Up and back. Good. Good. Tristan. Press. One more. Tristan. Slow on the way down. Everything. Go modify your technique. You get this. Put it up and back. It's going to be hard luck on man. Up and back. Up and back. Go. Go. Yes. Good. Might say every tip that we give you is going to make you harder. That's the motivation I needed. On three tips so far. Alright folks. Tristan is done with all the pushing exercises. Now he's got to do a dealt exercise. We are doing some free motion. Why raises here? We're going to do them reverse. You can do them one way or the other. You can do them straight on. Where you can turn and do them reverse. If you have to set it up. You just grab both of them like normal. And then step over both with the leg. Turn around and get going. The reverse ones are probably objectively a little superior. They're both good from a variation perspective. What you'll notice is. Vector wise. There's basically no force up here. But down here the force magnifies as the stretch is produced. See if the highest degree of tension at the stretch. Very rare shoulder exercise in which we can actually get a piece of stretch on that lateral head. And then coming all the way up. You're going to know exactly when to stop. Because up here it's going to be like, oh, I could just hold this forever. And then make sure to slowly control that eccentric. Give it a second at the bottom. And then come up in an athletic way. And then you can do it with a half exercise. Make sure that you've got verse grips or straps or chalk or something. Don't want grip holding you back on this. If you institute some kind of grip fix, whether it's chalk straps or verses. If you get five or six more ups per set. That means your RIR was whatever you thought it was. Plus five or six. Not very hyper tropics. So make sure grip is sorted. Do your best job. These are a great exercise. If you have a free motion machine. If you don't, you can do them on regular cables. But the free motion one allows you a lot of options. In any case, let's get a duck. Oh yeah. Come on. Slow off your foot. Oh. That's one that's good. Come on. Go. Slow. Fuck it. Good fuck yeah. Yeah, we've got it on the app. Last exercise here for Tristan. These free motion curl. These are best done. Not facing the machine. Facing is a fine option. If you face away from the machine. Most of the tension is imposed at a deep stretch. Just excellent for muscle growth. Another thing is this. If you're really close to the machine and the handles are here. This really just like a normal curl. You want to walk a few steps forward. So you're really stretched back here. Come up to here. You don't have to come all the way up to here. There's not much utility there. So here you just come up here. Control. Big stretch at the bottom. And come back up. These are great for my rep matching. They're great for my reps because all you do is back up. You can even let go of the handles. But if not, you just drop your knees a little bit. Drop into this position. On low the handles. Wait five or six seconds. Come back up. Crank up more reps. You're there. 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 1, 1, 1, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 2, 10, Here's some how fence I walk off you're. Great. But as great as I walk off the fence, do you guys pitch painful? Pain is the word. They're kind of great. You pay a diamond at可是e four. And are shamed of what you still show up every Thursday night?
