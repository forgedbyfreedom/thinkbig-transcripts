Let's go. Big push. Yes. That's it. Good stop. Good stop. Wow. You guys need to pull it underneath. Right? There we go. Jimmy House. Bill like a brick effin house. He shows up to the gym today and I'm like just kind of walking past. And he's like, get out of my way bro. And I was like, I'm sorry. What? So he knee barred me and my knee flew off my shit because he's a black belt and your jutsu. No joke. And I was in the bathroom. He was like, oh, at least he's on a touch of drugs. Stupid drug addict. And he's like, I'm actually drug free. And I was like, can you just leap? Why you in the bathroom? I mean, here crying. I locked the door. He ripped the door off the hinges. But that as he was about to do a final finishing blow. A Mazo aka Jared, father, I feed pro teleported in, picked up Jimmy, teleported him to the moon, let him cool off for a bit, teleported him back, couple seconds of out of breath. And then he was like, why don't we just, hey, let's just do a push workout so we can get chest. We really messed up maybe a bit of tri steps and everyone was like, okay, fine. So let's just do that right now. Let's just go do that. Exercise number one is the cambered bar bench press. Looks like that except for the camber. Really tough exercise. Critical to descend slowly and take a pause so you maximize that stretch under load. You might not be able to touch your chest. If you can't go for it, but if you can't, just go as deep as you can and as you're coming down, you want to reach your chest up to meet the bar, which means you have a nice arch in your back, but from with planted on the seat, feet really stable to generate a lot of power and stability. And then you're going to go, we're going to be doing sets of all five to 15 reps, feet to 12 more like. And should have been going to get crazy. Tax are going to be pretty destroyed after this and then probably another pack exercise. Let's do it. One more, big arch. My mark. Go on. I call it, reach that chest. Oh yeah. Mark, yeah. Great. Thank you. It regards to minimizing the explosion. That's just more like time under 10 changes for safety. Okay. Exploding out of that big of a stretch could be the last exploding you do with a full pack. Okay. Sounds good. This is strong, especially with this variation. You want to ease it up and then accelerate. Okay. I've got that. At the bottom is cool with regular bench, but with that big of a stretch, it'd be something probably you'll be saved. But the fractional probability of injury goes up. It's important to have your pecs still attach to your body. Right. Definitely for powerlifting because you'll never press heavy ever again. And for sure for bodybuilding because the pecs look weird when they come apart. That was fucking great. Thanks. You doing any more top sets? Who the dumb? Do a scare on your side. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. You do it. You do it. You do it. You do it. You do it. I forgot to tell you. Yes, man. Okay, it was natural, but I went home and I just fucked it. Bye. Yeah, thanks for the first day. The bottle of testosterone oil. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. That's why it thought it goes in the eyes. 100%. Then you can see. You told me that you're more intelligent. You told me that you're more intelligent. You told me that you're more intelligent. You told me that you're more intelligent. You told me that you're more intelligent. Yes. Good chest. Yes, one more. Let's go. Oh, shit. One more, Jimmy. All fucking day. Big chest. Reach. One more. You got it, you got it. Reach off. Yeah. Oh, that was beautiful. Yes, yes, girl. How are you? Beautiful. Wow. Good enough on the pressing. Yeah. Let's do some dumbbells. Mike isn't training today because he did the two and a half to one paradigm. Two and a half weeks of hard training. And decided he needed the deal a week. So he's a steel loading all week after two weeks of nothing. I'm going to be on the other side. See the barbell shoulder press is not an exercise really to me today. I'm just sitting down because I'm tired. You guys real talk, I'm going to get an old. I hate when people say their shut up old man, still got a train. Anyway, ran to side. Incoming dumbbell presses hit the particular portion of the pecks. The cues we're going to be looking for here are big reach up and we want the dumbbells to come to the outside of the shoulders. I did a lot of GDTS today. So I can't move my fucking shoulder. But it would look something like that. Big reach. Pause at the bottom. That super deep stretch sets up 10 to 15, 10 to 20. Anything less is going to end up being a requisite of stability for that low of reps. That high of a load. That we can't achieve with dumbbells. Dumbbells aren't inherently unstable and thus better for slightly higher reps. Because the lower up training is only best when you can get stable enough to produce maximum forces. Because lower reps are producing maximum forces. Because with dumbbells you really can't get that stable. That sets up 5 to 10 for the dumbbell press. Not the smartest thing in the world. Good control. Reach up. Deep pause. Yeah. One more at least. Reach up. Deep. Oh shit. Hell yeah. That's good enough. Thank you. Look at how big as fuck Jimmy is. Big ass, pecs. Big ass arms. Did you imagine a world in which you walked up to him before his workout and built it. You do it in Climbup. You're like, how much you press bro? What are you thinking he's going to say 131-41-50? He says 70. Proper execution. Good technique. Slowest centric. Deep pause. The outside of the chest. Needs you don't have to dumbbell press. Ultra fucking heavy. And you still get these maximum, amazing effects. Minimum stress on your joints. Maximum stress on the muscles. It is fucking humbling. The ego will not like it. Yes. Yes. Oh crap. Ooh, that extra milk. Oh amazing. Oh yep. Big ring. Deep. Yes. One more. One more. One more. Chess. Chess right here. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Huge Chess. Yes. One more. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. That's it. That's it. That's it. Boom. Thank you. Let me tell you guys about the RP Hyper-Trophy app with over 28 preset programs already in the app. You can choose to make your own.

Super-setted to some close grip push ups. I think we'll try a deficit. Let me see if I get some blocks for a sub-fifc push-up with. Ouch. Pain is impending. Set of 15 to 20 here on a first set hopefully. And then all the way down. How about three or four sets? Really get some good tri set volume. One thing you can take away from some of this advice is when you do chest first but you have a chest tri set session. You want to give good stimulus to tri sets. A lot of times it will be like three sets of chest in the first section. Three sets in the second and then like four or five sets for tri sets in the last. Why? Because you're already tired. But you can make up some stimulus by just doing a higher volume of work at the end. Give that some thought. Let's go do these push downs. You. Yep. One more. Good. Got any body. Down the body. Yes. As if you're going to do another. Okay. More. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Yep. Strict. More Jimmy. Deep. Let's go. Big push. Yes. That's it. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Wow. You guys need to pull it already. Right. There we go. So terrible. I stopped there. So jerk. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I didn't understand how far away. Okay. Oh. Oh. Oh. My shot, man. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Big push. Shoot. Finish up strong. Oh. Oh. Oh. Shoot. Amazing. Right away. That's it. No. No. No. Let's go. Yeah. Oh. Right away. Go. Slow. One more. Slow. Up. What the fuck was that? Lock it out. Jimmy. All the way. One wrap. There. Good. And. Woo. Like this. When. Good. Like this. Good. Good. And. Woo. Good. Like this. That was awesome. That was awesome. Thank you. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. You know what they say is get you a man that can blank. We get you a man that can do slower control these centrics and my rep. Try to set push up. Super set. You'll be eating good. Got to. Got to. Man. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I think my biggest takeaway from the day was the alteration on the dumbbell presses as far as. For one kind of taking my power. I think set up out of the equation. Not being as. Driven with my legs. But still using my legs to get to upper body position that allows for more information. Like I was telling you with the bigger dumbbells. I generally press neutral. Try to get down lower. But then after talking to Jared. And some of the alterations that he makes still go. Really flared. But not necessarily let the dumbbells get in the way. That's something I'm going to take home for sure. And then going from something like a isolated cable push down. Going to true failure with that. And then going to more of a compound bodyweight movement to put push even more volume to the triceps like the push up. That was a huge takeaway for me too. And just understanding what true failure of a muscle group is. Is something that I think I've gathered. Blask a couple of days. So I appreciate you guys. That awesome. You did incredible. Thank you. Jared you're looking big. Me. Kind of washed up. Don't. I'm done lifting forever. We're never going to be back. There's a last video on this channel. It's been real. We'll see you guys never. Peace. Can we ever deal with thoughts like thoughts you shouldn't have. Maybe like jack and off and like think about a girl. But then like can't transcend their guy at the end. Oh, your mother. You're not. You really like it. Grandma. Of course not honey.
