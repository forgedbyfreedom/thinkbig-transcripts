If you get to two minutes and 30 seconds or she's like Like yes, you're trying to go do another set like no, it's not about the You are not ready your cardio's not ready. What are you doing? Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Curization, I think tracking your rest time is might be a bad idea on the net balance in the most cases Uh-oh But what that's crazy We need to keep track of our rest times between sets, but then we know all the things in the numbers You will notice if you are using the RPI Pertrifi app that As of the following in this video at least we do not have a rest timer in the app There is also no plan to install one In earlier hypothesized versions of the app we had a rest timer As something we were going to make and we ended up stearing away from it and I want to tell you why and whether or not use the app Why it might not be the best idea for you in most cases to track your rest times between sets But first let's talk about what the benefits could be and might be of tracking a rest times between sets. I can think of at least two things First Tracking a rest times between sets can keep you on task because sometimes if you don't track your rest times You have a tendency to screw on your phone Flirt with the girls, flirt with the guys, flirt with grandma, flirt with grandpa, get yourself an orgy Typical gym stuff and 5 7 or 8 minutes later you still have a done your set if you had a rest timer every two minutes every three it would be like hey Idiot go back to work. So in that sense it can be very helpful It also can help in a related way of letting you know roughly how long you need to rest because of last week You know you led press and you rested in sort of two or three minutes between sets This week if you're now getting to three minutes and 30 seconds on your timer you're like all right Time to get back to work so it can really ground you in that sense and that's a good thing In addition to that It can let you use a variation a training modality where you intentionally constrain yourself to certain amount of rest It's totally fine to curls and then put the dumbbells down and rest until you're ready to go Or it's totally fine to say okay, I'm gonna take 15 seconds or 30 seconds between every set of curls for the next six sets and that way it build up a lot of metabolites It's kind of like my a repition of certain sense. I'm just constraining myself to rest times If for nothing else in variation it's fun to do something different and also you know it can drive along But metabolites as long as I get a total number of reps it's really high It's gonna yield pretty much the same growth that as resting long group You left to do more sets but because you're only resting 30 seconds between sets and the reps in each set are Lower number you end up doing the same amount of work even It can allow you to constrain the time so if you're time crunched and you're on a lunch break and you know Okay, I got to get at least sets done and I got to rest only 45 seconds between sets It's gonna be a great thing for you so in those respects Rest time tracking Watching the clock can be really good So I said the beginning of this video I said I don't think it's a good idea on the net balance Which means I have more reasons coming up right now of why I think and when I think and how I think Tracking the rest times leads you maybe a stray of what you should be doing instead first There is no need for the data You want to track your rest times Let's say it's not just to give yourself a certain rest time as a different modality or because you're in a right and those senses Rest time tracking is great, but that's not almost tracking is it's like the rest time is a specific amount of time and as soon as that time It's you go again Tracking means like you figure out how long that you're resting and you sort of write it down or the out-app keeps track it for you and you're okay This is how long you're resting What you really want to know during your rest break is is it time to go again? And how much time that takes has nothing to do with if you're ready to go again If you're ready to go again and have another another productive set is based on the Four factor formula the four factor rest time model we have like three other videos on YouTube about it But I'll sum up what they say and if you're curious type in four factor rest is we're tell Hit search on YouTube and you'll find a few videos about it Here's what the four factor rest model says You are ready to do your next hard set of an exercise if four things are true One you're not breathing heavy anymore your cardio will not be the limiting factor on the next set Two your neural strength how you feel how strong you are you capable you ready for another heavy set Feels good because like right after a set of curls you grip feels weak everything feels uh After a few minutes you're like you know what yeah, I'm ready to crush your shen out again all right check number two Your synergist muscles are ready so if you're doing a set of curls you put it down and your biceps are healed after a minute They feel totally fine But your forearms are still shaky and really tired and really crampy I am all right. I'll rest longer because I'm not targeting forums but forums are synergistic and I don't want forums to be the limiting factor Another good analogy here are good example rather Is if your lower back is still fried after a set of squats you don't squat for your lower back You squat for your quatt so if the situation is such that After two minutes of rest after squats your quads are good to go But your lower back is still fried you got to wait longer because as a synergist you don't want it to take the disproportion amount of being the limiting factor you don't want it a situation where you stop that next set because your lower back is really fried Even though your quatt could have done more work because then as far as quatt stimulus They didn't get close to failure actually just your lower back did that's why you're acting So they didn't get a good stimulus so if synergists have to be healed and lastly Most of the time We're doing sets of at least five repetitions and lengths because five reps have enough stimulus enough of volume Five total repetitions is enough of a muscle growth signal that we counted as like a real hard working set If you're doing sets of two and three that's good for strength But if you're resting so little that you're doing sets of two and three each time Dude you're gonna be doing like a hundred sets to get to your total rep goal rest longer have higher quality sets of at least five repetitions or Put even better rest long enough that you get into the target rep range for what you want to do So if you're doing lat pull downs and you're saying you're doing them for sets of ten to 15 reps If you did 12 on your last set you go 30 seconds of rest you can do like six that's out of the rep range Your target in the mind muscle connection will be all off Nothing is gonna be great your technique might be off because it's just way too much of a rush if you rest for two or three minutes You might be able to get a set of ten or a set of eleven that takes you into that ten to 15 range again in all as well. So just to recap You are ready to do your next set When your cardio is good When you're not breathing heavy anymore when you feel strong again when your synergists are cooled off and they won't be the limiting factor and when the target muscle itself Can do either at least five repetitions on the next set or as many repetitions as gets you into that target rep range and chose This is when you know you're ready to go again and I was a little straight and just a little bit The time it takes doesn't matter because you know when you know when you know a quick analogy just to drive this point home Do you ever time How long on a road trip that you've been driving so that you know when to get gas? No, why? Cuz you have a fucking fuel gauge for that you know to get gas when it drops below a quarter tank or whatever There's a gauge for that you don't need another time someone say how long will be driving before do we need gas yet You're like what do you mean look at the fuel gauge and say yes or no? This is a thing you could be driving for two hours, but it's like mostly downhill and you're like that actually We've been driving two hours, but we're like at more than half a tank or you could be driving two hours But you're like crossing you know from Utah and to Colorado and out of road trip and like All right, you're down to an eighth of a tank and you should have pulled over fucking light years ago And now you're gonna be stranded in the middle of fucking Utah and you know being in Utah at all is terrible But stranded in Utah even worse. I'm kidding you talk Ian's Mormon We're good. It's all jokes. So in any case, it's like if you have the four factor rest time formula to tell you when to go again And when it's not checked off all the four boxes It doesn't matter what the time says don't go and when you have checked off four boxes Doesn't matter what the time is it's probably time to go You get what I'm saying here. It's data that you don't need collecting rest times No, what you lost nobody found there's no reason to have Next, you say okay, okay, okay, okay I still like to see how long this takes. I still like to collect my data. I have two problems with that My first question to you is why In sport science Really in all engineering style endeavors You never want data that you don't use because collecting data Processing data and storing data are all bandwidth eating And you want as much bandwidth for doing important shit that actually works and actually makes a difference in your project or your goal Your endeavor and you want to minimize clutter Data stream clutter is what you're gonna get if you collect rest times it means you have to tell an app or a stopwatch like it I feel like here's the thing you're done with a leg press you finished your rack. You're oh god And I click my shit and I put it down okay, okay the rest time's gone I'm gonna look at it every time again. What am I looking at it for? I don't fucking know You should be looking at your breathing and your strength and your synergists and your Mut target muscle there's nothing you're gonna see on that clock that's gonna tell you anything You don't have to check back with anyway for how you're actual body's feeling and then Before you go on on your next set you need to be getting your mind right cranking up that gangstrap and your headphones But instead you're like oh, I'm gonna put the rest time and put that away and then I go why? It's clutter the data stream is clutter the data collection is clutter the act of actually collecting the data by clicking the fucking button is clutter You need to focus on the task at hand And you need to forget and try to eliminate all of the extra noise When you are collecting data for data sake you are not being a nerd you're not being a scientist You're not hashtag pop med warrior you're just doing something fucking stupid and it makes you look smart because you're mr Rest time maybe like oh, I got to be real smart Except if other smart people in there who know how to train or look at you they're gonna be like what's the clock for You'll come to honor him arrest times, you know, you're like no, I don't know can you explain to me what advantage like well, you know I'm trying to keep things Try to keep things organized why Why not seriously why and you will not have a good response to that very likely because it may be no good response to them Next big problem. Why is there no good response point number three attends to one of the concerns You need a different rest time Between different types of sets So the idea that you say to yourself look I'm gonna rest two minutes between sets and that's my rest time Rear keeps me on track This is already a problem remember the four factor rest time formula tells you when you're actually ready And what that formula ends up sonnating to is different based on all kinds of different conditions for example Set one to set two rest break There's a bit of a shock there Very high reps in the first set Maybe you need three minutes to check all the boxes of the four factor rest times that you're ready to go again Set two versus set three you might be in the groove set two you did do as many reps and your your blood flow and everything's great Maybe you need last rest Maybe it was three minutes For set one to set two and then you're ready to go maybe it was two minutes and 30 seconds for Satu to set three so you're resting in extra 30 seconds for nothing Because you assume the same rest times every time Which you shouldn't have done that between different sets you guys will notice this As you do a set if you're doing the RR math of reps and reserve your first set will be like 15 Your second will be like 10 then it'll be like eight and seven and six and six or something like that There are not a rest you need Between a set of six and a set of six is usually way lower than a set of 15 and a set of 10 For obvious reasons you're not Exerting as much cardiovascular demand so you're breathing never gets as heavy So that you don't have to wait for your breathing and come now Your 9 it's that set of six is not as fatigious at a 15 so your neural drive is gonna be back sooner Your muscle is not gonna be fatigued the synergist aren't as fatigued So a lot of times you need more rest for the higher reps and less rest for the lower reps if the weight is the same and you're just getting more tired Or you have an interesting different response to fatigued and you actually need more rest between each set who knows? You never can tell unless you try and if you've got a rest timer and you're like I got it There's two minutes between each set you are needlessly decreasing the quality of some of the sets Because you're not resting long enough and you are needlessly Increasing the time over the workout because you're resting too long for some of them is just a great way to get a lot of wrong answers Next different exercises for the same muscle group can demand a lot of different rest Resting between sets of rows three minutes made the un-average on average There's point number one there the the set's still very For pull downs maybe a minute and 30 you're ready to go because pull downs you don't have to brace yourself You don't have to fight gravity you just it's just a vertical only there's not as much muscle being stimulated So even if you say okay for back stuff I typically rest three minutes it's like okay Typically though isn't a formula typically means you still some sets not resting enough some sets resting too long What about different muscle groups? Oh my god, this is totally nuts when people say like I rest two minutes between sets I've like one of the rest time videos There's a comment that came up early. It was like don't watch this video too long and boring just rest two minutes between sets I sort of got choked that got in that I'm kidding But like that is a moronic buck and statement because if you train quads properly and it takes you two minutes to rest between sets of quads Does it take you two minutes between sets of biceps are your biceps Estesistendically fatiguing and draining as your quads of so you have the biggest buck and arms in the world and the smallest most pathetic legs You like Harry Potter legs and Rick Piano's arms is shit like that In almost every case quad and glute and back training is gonna fry you You're gonna need way more rest than between sets of calves or sets of biceps That's a forum sets of triceps even sets of doubts There are huge differences between sets between types of exercises And even between muscle groups and so the question I have for you is how many different rest times are you gonna keep track of And there is an intelligent response to this you say well, I'm gonna keep track of everything week to week to week because it is is an auto saw self-solving problem at You know set one to set two I have a rest time that I write down Or I have an app the tracks of for me set two to set three have one and it's you know Compares biceps to biceps quads to quads set one to set two set one to set two in the next week all right fine. We got that salt totally Here's where problem number four comes in if Let's say last week You took two minutes and 35 seconds After one set of leg press to be ready for your next set you're using the for-fact rest model You're just timing you're so okay. I'm ready to go up 235 okay my app has noted that does this mean this week Set one of leg press you need two minutes and 35 seconds again Why do you have that number to stare at because inevitably if you say will look? I don't actually want to stare at that number on the second week. It's like the fuck are you collecting the data for So you clearly if you want an app to do this sounds like I'm being very defensive right Clearly if you want an app to do this you're gonna want the data like in the next week like last week after set one of leg press I rest two minutes 35 sec What is your bringing in a do inevitably will this time? I need rest two minutes and three guys But hold on a second What if that violates the for-fact arrest formula what if after two minutes and 15 seconds your fucking good to go? Do you still wait another 20 seconds sure it's not a big deal but if you're gonna wait another 26 Here's the real kick if you're gonna use the for-fact Rust formula anyway What the fuck do you even bother collecting the fucking data? Let me tell you guys about the RP high-perchography app with over 28 preset programs already in the app You could choose to make your own you could modify an existing program or you could just run the Programs exactly as they were written by a personal this app programs everything for you Exercise is weights sets reps frequency the whole thing after every single workout and every single week The app adjusts to your unique parameters with every single input we have over 250 exercises in the app with detailed video tutorial links to every single one You never have to be confused about technique or form ever again Guessing right now you're pretty interested in the app download the RP high-perchography app today If you get to two minutes and 30 seconds or she like Okay, I guess it's time to go do another set like no it's not mother fucker You are not ready your cardio's not ready. What are you doing and you're good? It's two minutes and 30 seconds It's so what that's just a fucking number you wrote down last week was last week This is this week you are using more weight this time things are different Maybe you're mass gaining your cardio's not as good maybe you're cutting your glycogen is not as high your morpheteed who knows? In the end the four factor rest formula is the right answer anyway It is the ecologically best answer I think I made this analogy on another time. I was the given an interview about this and so I was really very hurt about this It's uh, I think yeah, so sound our RP podcast with mr. Nick Shaw There are all kinds of activities that if you time them and you try to compare your times week to week to week It's gonna be nonsense. Guy go garbage in garbage out If you time how long it takes for you to make love to your significant other and then the next time you make love you're like all right And 37 minutes hit it. I'm sorry. What is that? 32 minutes you guys both knutted like crazy and everyone Smoking a cigarette and bad you're like I really should continue for another five minutes. She's like you're right You just have like dry like You haven't found she's like no okay times a time diligence is diligence or you're at like 36 minutes and 57 seconds in his like the most passionate shit of your life and you're like you we could do this for fucking hours and then 37 heads you know like and we're done Shelly was your name you've been great here's the door What what Who cares who gives a shit love making I'm trying to be politically correct here It's a code for anal Love making takes as much time as it's gonna take Because there was a definitive star point in a definitive very unequivocal end point and both y'all not a They've been accomplished and it's gonna take a different amount of time based on about a trillion different things Or based on nothing at all it's just gonna be the situation as a situation and you know everything You need to know about whether you're well on your way to hit and whether you're done Internally you do not need a clock for this Training is much the same way you know that when you're done breathing heavy when you're feeling nice and strong again When you can do the synergists are not limiting factor when your muscles ready to go for at least another five reps or it's time to rep range You're fucking good if you're not good yet you need a rest longer for best results If you're good you don't need to rest any more time you can arbitrarily but why it ends up being arbitrary so at the end of the day if you really think it through yes, there are some compelling reasons To get some rest times going if not just to ground yourself or build up the habit of taking the right amount of time And as a beginner you might benefit from some rest time tracking and your coach as a girl's two minutes between every set You'll start to learn after a few weeks like well, I don't need two minutes after biceps I need more than two minutes after quads but coach does this two minutes That just builds kind of good habits if you don't float around and waste time or rush into the next set clients do both things Once you are like a late beginner mid beginner even for sure an intermediate advance rest time tracking not always It's always nuanced always shades of gray, but it's usually just data for data sake and there's no good reason to collect the data or use the data and Because it's data it occupies your cognitive stream to some extent and your work stream if you're click on the timer on and off It's actually not negative because you're collecting data you do not need Anyway, let me know if that makes sense Let me know if you guys have any really compelling reasons because I'd love to hear from you About why maybe we could track rest times and ways in which they're good that I didn't talk about or let me know from your experience a few of some thoughts about like well actually yeah, I used to track rest times and I realized it was just like a road to nowhere It was fucking pointless Let me know what you guys think see you guys in the comments RP Hyperature V app link below and of course I remember's area where nerd stuff like this is just a daily occurrence See you guys there peace you
