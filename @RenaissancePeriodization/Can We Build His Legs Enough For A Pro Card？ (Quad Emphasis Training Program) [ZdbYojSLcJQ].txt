The Nines and slow on the concentric, slow on these concentric, slow on the first low. Up, up, up, up, up. You've got a good job. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Autostampspearization. Jared, father here for Autostampspearization as well. And we're here with our friend Cameron. And he, uh, is this kind of, he was a backstory. He's Jared's friend. He made a terrible mistake. He started lifting weights at some point. And I like he, he's now he's on the channel about to do legs. And luckily, well, not luckily for him. He just Jewish. So, you would have, you would have a family, you would have a family. But now that that's where that is. You nervous yet? Yeah, it's like a, a make a wish, but I'm not terminally ill. Oh, okay. You will be soon. Let's start leg training. What's your working weight? Run 2.25. Not a lot of cues. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 1.35 on. Yeah. I'm just getting, that's perfect. I got another say. Hopefully, I can make myself useful. I just stand around to be like, yep. Good job. 2.25 is top. 2.25 top. So when your week is shit, you can do higher SN movements first. Kind of a damn. What a piece of shit. What a ruthless asshole. Why would you say some show? Because we're all friends here. Did you got to be mean to your friends? That's where a whole back door. That's the motivation. Mike, people have been watching the channel for a while. They know we're mean to our friends. No, by the fucker, you mean the our friends to anxiety poops this morning. So, solid. Hey, listen, just do your best. No pressure at all. You got to honestly. Fake the RIR if you have to. Like I do. Oh yeah. First thing we're going to do today is do high bar. Strict weightlifting style squats with a wedge. Probably throw a pause in there as well. This is such a five to ten really more like seven to ten reps. That nasty high tension stimulus at the beginning. We're going to be watching our technique. Cameron's going to be staying super upright. He's going to be telling us he's going to fall really far forward. Wild his heels are pressed into the wedge. It is going to be a slow eccentric control. We're going to get everything done right. This is going to be heavy. I just have these against a bodybuilding but with good technique. Only. Speed. Look up. Oh shit. All right. You want to size butter? Good. Good. Good job. Good job. Good job. Cameron is actually a competitive plastic physique athlete. We'll call it athlete. We'll call it a sport. I coach some few last show. He's currently massing on his own and working on his weak points. Legs are one of those. This is why he wanted to film the leg session with us. So he's going through this current massing phase. I believe he's in this last massing mess of cycle. The end of the massing block before he goes into maintenance and in a show prep. It's been about a year and a half since he's been to the last time. So we're going to see what we can do today. Really cap off this last massing phase for him. And then hopefully he and him are prepping again together soon. And we can display the, I think it was legs and back where what he used to work on. So display that on stage here in the next year or so. Yep. All day. He's going to be just. He'll suit us one more. We're right here. Stand up Cameron. Stand up. Come on. Beautiful. Beautiful. Good stuff. Hit it again. I'm just kidding. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm just squat. You want to be funny, you hear it? Jesus. It's like the same, the same diameter is my bottom like. Yeah. Bigger even. Yeah. All right, folks, 2.25 for sets of well, technically eight to 10, eight to nine. And now one down set at 185 pounds. Hopefully we're getting over 10. That's kind of the goal here. We'll see what cameras capable of. We're going to push him, but push him within the context of good technique only. And then after that, we are going to go do leg extensions. Super set in two walking lunges for wards. He knew that on the horizon. Oh, that's pain. That's pain. It's, it's going to be here real soon. One in a time. Big chest, man. And the one. Look off. Yes. When you get in trouble, look up. Save it. You told that. Look up. Yes. One more, one more, one more, one more, one more. Okay, keep right. Take the time. Right. One more. Oh, you all fucking day. Look up. Yes. Good shit. Wow. Yeah. All right. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, have me come have me come. Holy fucking shit. Let me all my seconds. Yeah, get up. Okay, let. Hold on. I'm going to take your extensions as soon as he hits real close to failure on these. Probably failure. We're going to usher him out and he's going to do walking lunges with a completely upright upper body to make sure the focus is really on the quads. It's going to be very painful. Probably sets a 10 to 20 on both. Not ever sure about that second exercise though. It could be a set of three of any falls over. But multiple sets here. The goal would lie your extensions as quality. So whenever banging him away, it's a slow eccentric lowering. Pause at the bottom every rep. That pause is awful because with the prime leg extension it stretches you the most at the bottom. To painful pause. Up at the top. No pause at the top. But just a quick loop into that top position in order to register that you did hit full range of motion. For full muscular development, et cetera. But we're really milking that end range. And you guys know much of studies came out. The show the end range is better. The top range will be prime leg extension machine has a setting in which you can bias the end range. Amazing. Amazing for us to be a rise about. Very terrible for Cameron who is going to die soon. Pray for Cameron. Hashtag, pay for Cameron. Let's do it. Up. Oh God. That's it. Good job. Rest. Very good. Very good. Good. Good. Good. Cameron. Don't let me talk to you because we tried doing these on camera. That's true. That was fun. Breathe. Breathe. You're not a serious person. She's just crying. You're not a nice job. Stop telling people they're pathetic while they're lying in front of you. Come foot. Stay upright. Stay upright. Stay up right. Come on. Come on. Up. One more. Okay. Just kidding. This is probably really clean in front of the bathroom too. Which is a bad dimension. Oh, that's a bad spot. The first few drips that didn't make it to the toilet are probably right there. At least four more. One good accelerated. Salarina. You got me. That beautiful. Accelerate. Yeah. One more. Don't get away. Not going. Salarate. Slow. Slow. Wait. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. One time, baby. Up right. One. Up right. Two slightly narrower steps there. You go. Three. Up right. Come on. Four. Two left. You got this. Up. The knife. And slow on the concentric. Slow on the concentric. Slow. Up. Up. You done. Good job. Good job, man. My nervous system is like fuck you. Fuck you. Shut up. I'm done. I'm done. I'm on. My heart's like 180. Holy. That's bad. Right. I'm going to die. Haven't never gone to Disneyland. No. That's a good job. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Very, of course. We're not done yet, but the final success, boy. Oh. Oh. You get one ready. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, sure. Oh. Oh. Oh. Take a time. Oh, you see. We done broke the disblock. Cam has done four sets of squats. Three sets of longer extension, a lot of superset. He can't really walk so well. So we're going to plug him in on the seated leg curl machine and he's going to do two Myorepsets. Basically like each one with probably two pauses. That's a total of like six mini sets, which equates to roughly about four sets of straight sets stimulus. And then that's it. No. When you do your quads this hard first, but workout, hamstrings are usually going to have to be something you deep prioritize. So because you don't have the systemic energy to get it done and he's pretty dead. But he's still going to get a good stimulus. Definitely enough to progress his hammer a little bit. Next time he trains, he might have more ham emphasis at the beginning. Quads at the Enkind of situation. And yeah, yeah, that's that. Let's look for a really good technique. Control these centrics for range of motion. Let's get it poppin. Great one. Last one. Oh. Yes. Rest. Two. Begin. Here it is. So. One bonus one. Go in your done. Ah, shit. That's it. Good. Very good. Very good. One more set left. Oh, fuck. That was a way. Last. Three. Three. Rest. Breathe almost done. Two. And you're done. Yes. One more. Just like that. Yes. Beautiful. Oh. Oh. Yeah. That's it. That's it. Just you can. Damn. That's that mindfulness. Toast. Jared, would you think cameras work out? Intense. I think it's a volume and a lot of people direct. What did you think, Cam? It was what I expected. It's the hardest and ever channel legs. All right. Yeah, of course. Dude, a huge pleasure having you. Best of luck on your male physique aspirations. Your legs are pretty big. Legs can always be bigger. And that's really the point that this whole episode. Your legs can always be bigger. Until you, the entirety of the universe is filled up by your legs. You just go in the universe, make another one. Little universe is inside of your leg. It's not cool. It's like a delicate. That's what we're in the leg right now. Oh, we're in the leg right now. Catch your guys next time.
