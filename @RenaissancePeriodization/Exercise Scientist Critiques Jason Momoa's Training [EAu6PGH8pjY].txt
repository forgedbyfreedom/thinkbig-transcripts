His coaches needed to come up with a resistance training program that Jason could do and has a little time as possible. It's also packing enough punch to turn him into the sexiest fish translator out there. Oh my god. I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight. It's working. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Pyrridsation. I am also a professor of exercises for science at Lehman College in the Bronx in the United States. And I'm going to review Jason Mamo as Hollywood diet and training program plan approach method madness. Mr. Jason Mamoa. Let's see how you died in train. I must do bitch. I must use squat. Nothing. I do not like lifting. I don't touch away unless they're paying me to do it. Damn, respect. So he doesn't like training, but he does have the manliest voice ever. And I've for years my therapist and I haven't telling me that I'm definitely straight. And I'm not in to guys. I'm not in to guys. Remember that? I have to say that a few times when I self-during the day. Jason Mamoa, I'm in love with you. Beautiful beyond words. Where can I meet you? And I mean M.E.A.T. Let's just get to the video. I don't enjoy lifting. I don't like going into a gym. Okay, so honestly, I respect the fucking people that are just straight up honest. It's cool to be like, hey, I really like lifting. But if I need to get a shape for a roll, your boy's honest doing that shit. There's all kinds of stuff I hate doing. Leaving the house for any reason whatsoever. She might teeth. Going to the doctor's office. Pain taxes. Yeah. I don't know what I do that. I do that anyway. That's what I'm trying to say. Don't skip on your taxes and don't skip on your way training if it's a part of your job. Yeah, that's just genetically Hawaiian. I hate it. Damn, it's cool to be genetically Hawaiian. Now notice something. The interviewer lady has said nice. And then she closed her eyes while smiling. What do you think she's imagining? Jason, if you're listening to me, forget all the things. All these interviewer, beautiful women. Look at this face. Yes, it's an ugly face. Miss Shape and you might even say, but it's a face that loves you. Gosh. Just like one of my DMs, bro. You don't even have to say anything. Ooh, I got even one better. I know you're a busy guy. Just left me on scene. I just want you to see by you, Jason. Ideally, in the nude. Honestly, let's skip. Let's get to review in this already. Enough. Enough. How many calories when you're Aquaman? What's your workout like, split look like? When you're Aquaman, not the character. The actual super-earsing hunt. I don't know. I think I eat fish. No, wait. It wouldn't eat fish. You can talk to them. You imagine that shit? Aquaman's trying to eat some like seafood place. And the fish is like, don't kill me, Aquaman. He's like, they're like sushi. He's like, uh, they're like, yeah, vegetarian. I guess the probably land animals in that field. Do you guys think the cows can talk to Aquaman? The fish is like, hey, Aquaman is like, hey, fish. He walks by. And the cows are like, hey, Aquaman. He's like, I got nothing. He eats the cow, instead of burger. Uh, I'm really bad at this. He has no idea. He has no f***ing clue what he does. That's the trainer's job. He's like, yeah, like, what's your split? What's your diet? What's your training? He's like, that's some other guy's paid to tell me what to do. I'm really good. I'm really good at just working hard and doing I need to do. So my trainers are generally like, they just, they make all that. They format everything. That's f***ing sweet. Again, I'm loving it. Honesty. Just tell me what you do. And I'm going to do it. I don't have to be in love with it. I don't have to endorse some bullshit. I don't believe in slash like Jason Mamoa. How is it going to say you're finally waiting to my heart, but you've been in my heart for some time. And other places in my body. That's very challenging for me to work out for vanity. It's very challenging for me to work out for vanity. You have all the f***er if I look like you had say some shit like that. Damn it. You were born Hawaiian. A dare I say perfect. I was born Ashkenaziju. Fill in the blanks. I had to work for this. Beautiful body. Now I can even hide in my muscles. He-he. But God damn, dude. Yeah, it's a shirt off for half the phone. Yeah, but I just, I'd rather like sit my, because I love climbing and surfing. So it's like climbing and surfing. Those are fun things. Yeah. Climbing and surfing, you're dare to say on, for the population level on average, are objectively more enjoyable than lifting weights. Can you imagine like, hey, climbing like you get to like, surround these obstacles and get this crazy view and it's a challenge and it's scary. You're like, okay, yeah, I love it. Like surfing, you're f***ing the man and up and down and using your balance, there's water and babes and bikinis. You're like, I love it. What else? You're lifting weights. They're like, okay, like, it's metal and it's heavy and boring as f***ing everyone's smells. It's the same week to week. But what do you get when PhD sports scientists collaborate with pro bodybuilders? The most effective muscle growth training I've ever made. Get yours now. Yeah, the opportunity for you can tell you how to train and make it a little bit more fun and more organized, but hard to compete against actual fun activities. I feel you. And look, almost all of us watching this video, we love training with weights, but just got a point like to speak in a regular people that's really... If I really need to get to climb a really hard route, I'll have to die and I'll have to train really hard so that I just try to wrap my head around like, what how it works for me. Oh cool, so he's kind of relating like if he gets into better shape, his climbing gets better, which is how he uses that to inspire and motivate himself a bit. That's dope, that's respect. And I really love beer, so it's... A lot of people like beer. Most of them don't look like Jason the Moan. I will not eat a carb all day long. I want to eat carbs and this is probably the healthiest thing. It's not the healthiest thing. Not eating a healthy carb all day, to save up for beer. Look, every now and again, it's totally fine. Daily? Yeah, you might have some issues. But you gotta remember, I'm like, I'm away from my wife, away from my kids. He has a wife and kids. What about you? Divorce happens? Kids grow up! I'm still here for you, Mr. Mammolat. I'll always be here for you. Hey, I'm eating no carbs. I'm on some crazy diet. Not exactly no carbs, I'm all the f***er. What do you think beer is made of? I have to work out in between Busting my ass and doing stunts. Yeah, stunting my ass and doing stunts. Guys, Jason Mowl is job as hard. He's an actor. I'm being a dick. I got to rass him a little. This is with the pickup artist community called Negging. You do a little bit of scot the video guys. No stranger that shit. You get at him other f***er in this case. In a f***ing other cases. Most cases. A little bit rass him a little bit and they get all defensive and you give them a little copper and they're like, yeah, it's a little push and pull and have a little push and pull for time done. I'm done and not going to get into the literal mechanics of intercourse. Right now. Hey guys, if you liked all that, there's more in the extended version. Not all of it is PG but that's where you got to sign up to be a member to see it. So give that a thought to fear. Missing weird stuff. So I was really depleted and we had water all the time and then the last 24 hours there was just like a couple ice cubes. So you're just trying to peek for one day, right? It's like a bodybuilding. That's cool. I'm really happy to know that they do this for Hollywood because like in those shirtless scenes in Aquaman, there's a huge premium frame looking as best. Luckily they have some folks in there that like will dry them out, carbon up and it'll temporarily make his muscles look really full. Temporarily make his skin look a little thinner. That's all really good stuff. I'm glad they're doing this. It definitely enhances the Hollywood effect. I tried so I was doing that whole thing and my body wasn't showing up and it wasn't happening and I go to my trailer at the time I go give me a Guinness. Like give me a Guinness. And so right before we did the underwater thing I cracked to Guinness pounded them. Can my body's like, that was your car. My whole thing, my whole body can see like my veins and like the whole. I don't want to offend anybody but Guinness is a f***ing disgusting beer. For people I don't like to ever talk about because I'm not a big fan of them, the Irish. I'm kidding Irish people. You guys always take a joke really well. Scott the video guy is dare I say mostly Irish and entirely a degenerate beer drinking. Just a stock. It's not a good guy. Guinness is awful. Scott you have anything to say for yourself with Guinness specifically? Inexcusable Guinness. Yes, a higher volume of fluid and carbohydrate and I will say the Paris empathetic inducing relaxate and nervous system response. All of having some alcohol can absolutely get your muscles nice and big and your blood vessels nice and fainy and give that last little peek. Not the best way to do a peek but it can definitely work especially if you like beer. I hate it this wouldn't work that well for me. But if you like beer then pick something better than Guinness. What's your favorite beer actually? Why don't you hit us up in the comments tell us your favorite beer and the winner will get alchohallism. Jason Mammola hates working out but you still able to get ripped for alchohman but using this unique workout hat. unique workout hack. Column me interested. Since Jason despises the gym, his coaches needed to come up with a resistance training program that Jason could do it as little time as possible. Cause he's so strapped for time. Waffle packing enough punch to turn him into the sexiest fish translator out there. Oh my god. I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight. It's working. So they had Jason use a celebrated result 7 which is a circuit based training program. What? We take 4 compound movements and perform 7 sets of 7 reps with 7 seconds rest in between each movement. Oh my god that's a lot of work. That's accelerator. Then what you complete with all the sets you take some rest and do the same. But the 6 is on everything and then again with 5 is on everything. This is a little f*** goofy but I guess it works. Oh my god I love that review. The guy himself said it's a little f*** goofy. Here's the thing. If you give people a lot of highly effective exercises, compound heavy basics, multi-joint multi-muscle movements to economize an effort. So like for example, if you do a close grip bench, you get a lot of triceps and chest stimulus in one exercise. So you don't have to be there for wide grip bench and push downs respectively. Have as the time of the work. You do slightly higher reps, you do very short rest breaks. And ideally you do antagonist muscle supersets. So for example some close grip bench, then some under and pullups, then some close grip bench with very short rest breaks. You can train a crap load of the body, get people amazing results in very short amount of time. Sometimes 30 minutes in the gym, three or four times a week and it's huge total body workout. The exact protocol here is wacky. Of course, 7 and 6, 5, whatever. That's f***ing totally arbitrary. I put my scientific integrity on that. But even though it's arbitrary, it's still well within the range of things that work. So this is actually a fairly good way to do things because remember, most of these how it folks. They train question mark question mark question mark and they eat also a series of and then for like 12 weeks before movie roll, they'll really lock down their eating and lock down their training 12 weeks. So this kind of training can transform a ton of physics. So I highly supported. Again, Mr. Memoa isn't exactly saying the right stuff. That's so close to the right. He gets a pass in my book. There's a lot of other stuff in my book about Jason Memoa. Mostly doodles on the margins of how I think is, um, genitals look. What? Did I say that? How loud? Ooh, Jason Memoa sample workout plan. First round seven since of seven reps. Seven seconds rest to be checked your size. The sevens are arbitrarized. Six, three, five. If you really want to go to the extremes the way Aquaman did, that not Jason Memoa the actor, Aquaman the actual hero, you can perform these routines up to three times a day. Don't do that. Don't do that folks. Once a day is good. See, if he hates working out with that f***ing he's doing it three times a day, Jesus Christ. We should also mention that Memoa reportedly did 100 pushups and 100 squats as a warm-up for his chest workout. Folks, if you follow our channel, and if you don't, welcome, please subscribe. You'll realize that 100 proper pushups is the f***ing chest workout in a half. So I can guarantee you his pushups sucked. I think Jason wants to hear this limb. And so I get like two and a half months of just doing like a fight choreography. That sounds fun. And then indoor climbing. Probably just climb a lot. Whoa, he jumped up onto the thing. He's so beautiful. And his hair's like sort of black, but sort of blonde. And he says, I don't know what it is man voice. Who cares what he's saying. My God, what the hell is this video about anyway? So like, your body is constantly working. Climbing is good. Climbing is good for fitness. It's not whole body, but it's close. Way by a thing, the pulling musculature. But having big shoulders, biceps, forearms, and a big back. So good start to an excellent male physique. You combine that with a bit of pushing work and some tri-subship. You got yourself a great physique for Hollywood. So climbing, uh, I can't hate on it. And then this is, some meat. He had a container of wrapped turkey in his gigantic homeless guy coat with a f*** going on. I said, ran out of my house and just, just me, my pocket. There are a number of jokes I could say now. So many of them in my head, I don't know which one to say first. I was just gonna go with the classic, hey Jason, I've got some meat in my pocket for you as well. But it's not turkey. Oh no. How does that meet my pockets? Oh my god. Oh Jason. Can you show us what your workout looks like? Well, I like to do. I sit here and I just try to move all these with my mind. Like that was standing up once. And then you were in order. And now I was over there and that was up there. And just like, this is the answer I would give in an interview like that. The men's health guys were like, yeah, that's funny. Ha ha ha ha. We have an article right in a video to make. Just start answering it for real. I really just seen your eyes. Not about the extent of it. He's drinking a beer. I f***ing love it. He, you know what, I'm not gonna talk shit. I was gonna say, he's taking men's health exactly as seriously, as they should be taken. But, uh, I love an respect for those all jokes. I work out nice. I love the guys response. DICE! KELOLAND BELSAMINERAL HUGE MY LIFE. I travel KELOLAND. KELOLAND SONGS BILD EXPLOSIVE POWER. You know what would be unfortunate if you spend a lot of time building not explosive power. What the f*** is that even? It's a redundancy. Explosion or power the same thing. In sport training. But men's health is so authoritative. And there's such a not really little bands. So, let's do bandwork. KELOLAND BELSAMBANS. The two least effective tools in the gym. KELOLAND BELSER OK. Dumbbells are generally more versatile. Bands don't reload the stretched part of the muscle, which is the one that grows you more. So bands are generally inferior to training with cables, machines, or weights. K, stupid, bare-crawl bullshit with dumbbells is a f***ing waste of time. It's a way to spend energy. I don't know what it does. When it's very unclear what muscle is being trained, and your outcome is physique, because that's the only thing that they care for actors, is how they look. It's probably not a good sign. So if you have to look at something for a little while and try to figure out what they're trying to train, not good news. Sort of back. This dumbbells are preposterously light for his back. He can't even get a big stretch because he's in a half-plush-up position. It tires out as thresholds and triceps. But the contraction for them is largely asymmetric. So not very stint a little bit of growth. F***ery. File under F***ery. First of all, that's a techno-jim machine. Techno-jim is f***ing total trash. Second of all, he really could benefit from a slower control on the way down. From a deep, painful stretch that hang, and from coming up as high as he can, all the way up to chest level. It'd be better for his climbing, better for his physique. But it's more challenging. Most of us can only do a few pull-ups like that. Those are real, real pull-ups, and they have real good dividends that they pay. Wow, he transitioned from pull-ups right into rear-doubt flies. Odd pairing. I can't tell if this is sped up. I don't even know what that's training. Triceps, ish. Let's do some underhand pull-ups. Again, not going all the way down. Not even close. I would say this is a major downside at this point. This is him like in the early phase of trying to get in shape, because he's looking a little rotund. This is my official day and model of the guy. From six feet. It's the best on his position. So when you try to flex in his position. Oh, this is official. First hard workout after six weeks, post-turning surgery. Okay, I was being a dick. He looks great. Post-turning surgery. Then he gets he looks great all the time in my eyes. Depending on the type of harney you have in the type of surgery they have, you can return to working out very hard as it is little as three to four weeks. You can return to working out easy and as little as two, especially if you have it like an umbilical hernia. It's mild and they have a mesh repair. A lot of times if it's lapar scoppy only. It's really quite easy for you to come back with just a few weeks or start coming back in a few weeks. For most hernious surgeries, six weeks later, you realistically, there's nothing you're going to do to the incision side or anything. Modern surgical techniques are really, really impressive. So I think he's totally good to train like that. You know, maybe something to ease into for a few more weeks after is like really heavy intramum tumble pressure. Type exercises really heavy squats, really heavy deadlift, really heavy leg press and act squat, where you can re-thin and generate ton of intramum pressure. He was doing essentially all pulling movements which you can do with zero intramum tumble pressure just as effectively. So I think he's totally cool on that regard. For coming back from hernious surgery, I give that work out of 10 or 10 for everything else in which we wait, rate workouts on this channel as the health factor of the offer of hypertrophy and how scientifically based they are. I would give Jason the Moll is an entire approach, a six out of 10. Because you know, it's in the right spirit of things just not all the right ingredients. But for his carefree attitude about training and diet, I give him a 10 out of 10 and for his manliness and sectioness and infinity out of zero, think about it. It's all Jason, my whole world. Mr. Jason Moll, the Sinole I'm nobody, but if you could find it in your heart to think of me at least once, I'll think of you at least all the time. See you guys next time.
