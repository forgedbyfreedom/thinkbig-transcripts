Okay good technique. Suck it. You don't like any jerk on this. No jerks. Your back looks twice as big as when you walk in here. It feels twice as tough. I don't even know what to say because everything is wrecked. Yo, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Godization. Jared, Father here, all of us for Renaissance Godization. Mr. I, you pro. Mr. Steel your girl. Ish, in any case, there are two things we do not have for you today. We do not have alpha destiny. Nobody liked that by any name anywhere. But we do have Alex Leannitis. And we don't have 300 warrior trained. Oh, oh, oh, oh, type my fucker Spartans. Cause we only needed one. He called me on my rotary telephone. And I picked it up. And he was like, people get into these back workouts without understanding how basic back sizes built, trying to do fancy cable ship. I need to hit my outer lats. My fucker, you don't have any lats. That's right. So for real, hardcore, no biomechanics, circa 2021 BS, which as it's place, we'll talk about them in a second. We're doing a hardcore for real back workout today. Alex Leannitis, pleasure having you on the channel. How do you feel about all this? Mike, it's pleasure to be back on. I'm so excited for this. And what's cool is where it's at. That's how I built this back. Pull ups, rows, the basics. You have to never go wrong. And although I'll put Destiny's gone, I'll let you know that it's an bare mode. A state. How's fucking good? How you doing? Let's go. Alright folks, so you'll notice that we were starting to work out with weighted pull ups. But we're actually starting to pull about. Because if you just go right to pull up, especially weighted pull ups, that's how you go into your regular working weight and bench with no warm up. That's nuts. You're going to get shit performance, probability of injury is going to go way off. Fuck that. So we do pull down, light, then pull down is a little heavier. Set a 12, set a eight. Then the next thing we'll do is probably unweight it. It'll do a set of two to four pull ups with this body weight. And then the next set will be a working set where he actually puts weight on and goes to town. When we do these pull ups, watch for slow control, standardized height, and a big stretch at the bottom of the little pause, that's where we're going to get it right. You're going to build a shit load of back width, doing the fucking pound heavy basins. Now, I'm just going to dress this right up front here. What about that casual shit? Richard. Not your match ship. It's fucking great. It fucking works. But it's not an either or. A lot of your masks will be built through conventional shit. That fucking overloads a dick out of the muscle. When you're really big and you want to focus on part of it, this cash shit is awesome. This workout is hardcore because it uses effective movements from back in history. Not because it's historical. Look at old school guys, Edder Rado, a lot bullshit. They had a lot wrong, but they had some shit right. This shit they had right. That's my view on the ship. Jared may be less nice about this and we'll see what Alex is the United States. It's on the one hand, he's Canadian. That many other hand, he's great. The Greeks keep it real. The Canadians are all nice. Keep the stretch feeling good. There. Couple more. Come on. Oh yeah, slow. Big stretch. And right. The pull-up is a movement that often gets facetized with a ton of momentum. Yes. And no four-range motion at the bottom or top. In fact, this can be taken from even further level by doing chest bar. And for that, I would reckon that nobody else would go weighted. Yeah. Like, even Frank will crumble. Who, uh, thing was five and five. You can get out one, eighty five. Yeah. You never went with a 25 or 45 off of it. Yeah. It's waste. Just high reps. It's light as possible. Bull range of motion. Chest bar. Chest bar full stretch. So hard to the sternum right here. Oh yeah. Oh the great. Beautiful. Great. Please fun more. Go. Yes. Slow. Stretch, break. Crack. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Good. Good. So, it's a long pause at the bottom. Yeah. That's bleeding my strength quite a bit. Oh yeah. Like a plate is hard right now. This is fake intensity. No, yeah. How wide. That would be. That would be weird. Yeah. And like my arms are even pumped right now. It's awesome. So everything. Sure. You form has got bigger since your shell. Dude, you've been checking off a lot. Absolutely. On the daily. The problem is it's been a crusade against the basics. Yeah. It's not entirely. Yeah. I've fed up because we know what works. Yeah. And pull ups are not going away. Yeah. So when I see someone saying, look how strong I am, he's on my 15 sloppy reps. I'm like, no, this is, you can't say that you're going. It's a bad genetics. Yeah. It's bad for. People talk shit about pull ups and betrows. Our precisely the people I've never seen them demonstrate a well-executed pull-up or bent row. That's right. And it's like, properly, like, high-green does where he bends all the way over. Fucking full stretch all the way in. Pull-up same way. You're going to be like, oh my god, my fucking lats are back completely blown up. And you can go, yeah. One more. Go. Yes. Slow. Slow. Beautiful. Right. Ha. That's it. That's it. Alex did three sets of weighted pull-ups. Now we stay doing pull-ups, but we take the weight off. It's an automatic down set. We're going to do it for two sets. Then we're moving on to pull-downs. So basically, we have vertical pulling. That starts out heaviest. And as the body tires, we go lighter, lighter, lighter. It's just a succession of down sets. And the pull-downs are essentially down set for pull-ups, sort of. It's a bit of a different curve, a bit of a different feel. We could use a different grip to increase the variation of somewhat. But here to be same grip, same everything, same to the other side. And so we're going to do maybe 10 to 15 reps on a first set. We'll see. Nine. Ten. Nice and easy. Cool. They're not tail-dance. That's it. When you use high-purchar-free steps, you can use the same grip. You can use the same grip. When you use high-purchar-free specific technique. Chains to the bar, no pausing at the top will put chin, slow on the eccentric. And a full big stretch pause at the bottom. The pull-up will humble the living fuck out of you. I, at a bodyweight in anywhere between 225 and 250, can typically do about 10 to 15 pull-ups fresh. And I swear to God, everyone in Instagram is like, really just 8 pull-ups on your second set. I thought you were big and I'm like, motherfucker, you have no idea what you're saying. You come trained with us. We'll teach you how to do pull-ups the right way. You make it zero. Bitch, that's you, Frank. You stop commenting on my stuff. Jesus Christ. Six. Six. Oh. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, I'm not that good. Good. Can you set this man up on the pull-down? That's three sets of weighted pull-ups. Two sets of unweighted pull-ups. That's five total sets of pull-ups. Well, in our way with the fucking vertical pulling muskowature. Last, here is major. Long ahead of a chy-sepskits hit, rear doubts. Biceps, warm, flex your forms. It's all cooked. Three sets of pull-downs are up next. And then we go into the rows. These pull-downs are going to watch for some cues. Going to really expand at the top of the big stretch. Chest up big to crunch at the bottom. Just the gentle touch at the bottom. We don't want to hold it. Not a very advantageous position. So put a lot of stretch underload from the last. So gentle touch here. Just for consistency. And then a slow eccentric with a big stretch at the top. Beautiful. Now we're going to be doing slightly higher reps here. We already did a low rep work. He did basically everything with sets of five to ten roughly. Already. We're going to do sets of ten to twenty. For these pull-downs, probably the first set is going to be like fifteen to twenty. And then we'll have the reps drop off that. Yes. One more. Come on. That's it. Slow. Big stretch. Slow. That's it. Raps. Aw. Feel a pump. Y'all. I'm still pump right now. This is amazing. All right. Bent rose. Last one last exercise. Sort of combo. It's just with the dig now. Won't take much. No. I don't know. And the lower back will never be a limiting fact. Yes. Especially for your vertical pulling first. That's right. It's all up or back. Lack. Back to lat limiting fact. Yeah. Fete inside shoulder width. You're going to hit hinge right into it. Tommy out chest up, arch lower back. When you get down to it, you're going to want to take the bar out here a little bit wider than shoulder width. No movement. So you're going to take the slack out of it, just flow here. Touch right below your sternum for a quick second. It gets stretched, touched the ground. As soon as you're done, take a quick break. Move in, one fist. And then regular rose touching the top. Good. Good. Fuck it. It's a work set. Keep going. Good. Good. No swinging. Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, swing don't judge. There it is. I forward. Yeah. Big shot more. It's just the same time. Yeah. Let's it. And down. There. There's a big stomach. No swinging. We got the endurance of a fucking box here. Big chest. Rack. Rack. Rack. Rack. Is the ox meant to be a good or bad thing? Uh-huh. Um, you know, it is men. We'll do three sets this and then three sets of vent row. Same way. Uh-huh. Super set. We were going to plan on doing the superset of chest support. Sorry, chest support. I got rose to the chest. Far down. Super set to regular rose to the tummy. But I thought that Alex is the tire. So we're going to do a couple sets of rows to chest. Rest in a roll-mount of time. And then a couple sets of regular rows to the tummy. Yeah. Good. That's it. On my own. Okay. Good. Tech me. It's not good. You don't like any jerk on this. Yeah. No jerks. But you know what makes it hard because it's not lengthened by us, man. So it's like the cheat helps smooth out the resistance career. I feel. So I actually have a recommendation for I do that. Don't. Don't superset relax. No superset. Oh yeah. We'll do it. Yeah. So Alex made a very good point. He pointed out the fact that the bent row was not lengthened by us. And if you fail when you can't touch a chest anymore, you have a lot more left here if you wanted. But you're being limited by this week position. Totally valid. If you're an advanced lifter and we'll have this. This is not a to-do list of RP videos somewhere. It's own breakdown. If you're an advanced lifter and you already know how to do a strict bent row, you can take it to the next level and make the bent row. A little bit more lengthened by us by doing this. So normally you would touch. And when you got to failure, that's it. You can do an in-norl bent row to make it a little bit more challenging and interesting. If you can do the regular version. Is as the row becomes a little bit more difficult for you or even from REP 1. You come back down to the same bottom position. But the top position is slightly elevated to the right position. But the top position is slightly elevated to allow you to have a mechanical advantage to track into touch your tummy. So what you can do is here we start here, notice my position. As I come up, I tilt up a little bit. Tilt up. Tilt down. Tilt up. Tilt down. And you can do this regular until you get tired and you're like, okay. And the next one. Tilt up. Tilt down. Notice the tilt is still coming for my hips. Yeah. So I never swinging. It's not an athletic motion. It's a smooth adjustment. Rise up. One more. I'm throwing nothing to slice. That's it. That's it. That's it. Yes. What's it more? What's it more? What's it more? I'm swinging too far. Control. Control. Yes. One more. Control from the top. Oh. Control. Stretch. I'll do it for it. Rack. Good. I just got to show you the back bump. It's unreal. Your back looks twice as big as when you walk in here. It feels twice as fucked up. I appreciate. Form guidance. Keep it in your check. Guys, check this out. Alex is one of the strongest motherfuckers on social media. Do a crazy ass weighted pull ups. Bench and three 15 for 10 shit like that. I saw that by the way. I checked off. I didn't. I didn't not to it, but I got me to where I needed to be to where that next video. I knotted to. And today at the end of the back workout, he's using 115 pounds for sets of five to ten on that road. So you think you're strong, amazing. Use precision technique for hypertrophy, control the centrics, touching your tummy every time, bending away the fuck over. You can lean up the two on at the top. You will understand that it does not take a lot of load. You get a fucking insane workout. Alex, any wise words for our viewers and the folks came from your community to see this video? What do you think? Well, first of all, I think I'm going to love it because we focus on the basics. Ultimately, that's what many of us should be focusing on. As you described perfectly, I've legal a lot heavier than this, even for lower repetitions. Less volume. My technique is always good, but not to this extent. This is new level. This is control. Yeah, but long pods, because one thing to make it brief a second, but when you're holding up for three seconds at the bottom, and I just much more contracting, low back, oh, the lights you up. And right now, man, like, I don't even know what to say because everything is right. Yeah. And none of this was acted. Like the faces, the straining, like, RP training works. And you guys got to try it out with stuff like this. And you don't need a fancy gym. This one's nice, but. Very nice. Oh, yeah. It was an easy move. But I want to fancy a gym in the world. We use like 2% of the fancy. Or in the section where it's empty. He was in a basic Olympic bar. You know, so if you can get by with a Pola bar, a simple lap Pola machine, a bar bow. A couple dumbbells. You're fucking gold. Your money. Focus on the technique. Focus on that steady progression. You have the high-perrophy app. If you don't like the app, fuck it. Don't use the app. Use your own shit. You'll get where you need to go. Drug free, not drug free. 50, 50. It's all going to work out. Focus on good technique. Do your best effort. Check out Alex LeNido. He's got his own YouTube channel. He puts out great shit. He's got his own Instagram. He puts out even better shit. He's got his own only fans. We should probably not get enough of them. He's got a lot of shit. Because that's the best lap heavy art. Mixed together with champagne. On a percent. Anyway. Peace on you.
