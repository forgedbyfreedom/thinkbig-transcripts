Scott, you know that guy that's always banned and he's up his knees and he's about to leg press after squatting and it's been like an hour because it take him forever to squat set up Yeah, and you're like already on your 15th set of like belt squats or something your quads are cooked and he's like up Just getting the leg press. What is it that we're here for? What are you doing? Are you trying to get jacked in a decent amount of time or are you trying to see how injured you can make your back while quote on quote squatting? Because it's a squat such a bad match up for your biomechanics that had barely hits your quads at all But you heard you got a squat first heavy first and you're doing it religiously So you're not leaving anything on the table. That's not a good thing Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for RP strength and you might have heard before that doing compounds first before Isolations and your lifting is better for results, but is that true? Let's find out Do you probably heard before Things like you got to do squats before leg extensions or leg press's compound movement multi joint first Isolation later you got to do pull ups before straight arm lat pull down You got to do dips before you do try set push downs no doubt many of you have heard this a ton But is this practice worthwhile? We have four questions to answer today and we'll answer all four of them question number one is Why is this advice given out like why do people say this kind of stuff is there any merit to it? Question number two how in what circumstances can this advice of compounds before isolation be true? Question number three how can this advice misapplied lead you a straight? Is it ever not true and why and then lastly number four a very super quick guide to making the best Exercise selection choices and strength physique and General lifting for overall physique and health outcomes Let's talk about it. So number one. Why is this advice given out? One reason is that it started being given out a long time ago and So many people said it that everyone just kind of assumed it was received wisdom like Mother's has just what you do and most people just don't question it that doesn't mean it's Completely baseless in fact. It's based on a few really really good ideas If This advice is a good idea. It is a good idea for a few different reasons It is correct if you want to lift as much weight and as many reps with that weight in a compound movement as possible So if you do isolation's first you'll limit your performance on the compound either you have to lift less weight and the same reps or You can lift the same weight, but you have to get fewer reps If you need to demonstrate and train maximum coordination and speed and athleticism During a lift it had better be compound and it had better be early or first in the workout We'll talk about why in just a second and If you are trying to train athletes to be better at sports with weights or you're trying to do overall Strength training making a person stronger Then this advice of compounds first isolation's Isherylations isolation's later is generally really good advice Specifically Here's how the logic works if you are trying to get a strong as possible overall Compound movements are king Multiple muscles are used to the same time just like in real world strength feats in Real world strength you generally try to summon a lot of muscle to do a specific task like pushing or pulling or lifting something One muscle at a time is kind of weird strength training and so compounds win Because you can use more weight because it's more real world for strength because it transfers better to all kinds of other Move performance and because you're using multiple muscles and joints Summing up how much force you're producing total which means you're actually just stronger the more compound and exercise is you can deadlift a whole lot more than you can curl So if you're trying to get a strong as possible overall compounds really are king If you see someone who's like I'm in the gym for strength, they're just one arm curling all the time You're like what you're doing if they're doing close group benches that makes a lot more sense Now if you are trying to get Stronger on a specific compound lift like I'm trying to get my squat going or my deadlift for my bench press or my overhead press or my pull ups The ability to have much of your training for that lift get you maximum weight and maximum reps for whatever target Rage of weight and reps you're doing is critical That's gonna make you stronger. Let me put this into perspective If you are trying to squat 350 pounds three plates on a side for the first time in your life and you are trying to 125 pounds for reps after leg presses after leg extensions You're just not getting any more close to the amount of weight on your back 315 That you would need to in order to train the balance and coordination at such heavy loads The integration of muscles at such heavy loads the nervous system at such heavy loads You would be met at much better off training something like 275 2 300 pounds four reps, but for that you would have to be fresh So if you're very serious about squatting 350 pounds for a single I want to see you hit 250 to 75 300 pounds for reps fresh That's a much better way of training to squat 315 Then if you do all your squats the same way but tired after isolations than it's to 25 on the bar It's 195 pounds on the bar it's to a five on the bar There's gonna be some transfer. It's gonna still make you stronger But not as much as doing it fresh So if your goal is strength maximum strength improvement Yeah, you got to do compounds the ones you're being tested on fresh as much as possible If you do isolations first both your maximum reps and or your weight are impossible and Thus compounds first are a great idea for maximum strength overall and for specific compound lifts Almost overall maximum strength you want compounds first and if you really care about increasing your bench press You should be doing a lot of lifting where bench presses first facts now for athletic coordination using lifting to make athletes stronger at sports If for example, using squats for improving your jump height Isolations slow you down after you fatigue your softly isolations your slower on the compound lifts your rate of force development is lower and the way you're activating your body to jump or to push your to pull Has to take into account that one of the muscles let's say your quads from leg extensions is now fatigued That changes the nervous system's way of activating all the muscles to get you to jump or to get you to push a slide as hard as possible For sports stuff Thus it's teaching you with a body that's kind of weirdly tired in one way and so the amount of transfer of training you would get from doing After isolations squat jumps versus fresh squat jumps is just much lower And so if you're interested in maximum carryover of athletic performance Compounds are really big deal first not second not third so you keep being your isolations to the end if you're training for strength If you're training for specifically some strength on a lift compounds versus really good and then also if you're training for athletic performance And so for now, man, sure shit seems like compounds before isolations is kind of a really good thing However, this is where we get to point number three How the advice of always do compounds before isolations can lead you astray in physique training training to get jacked There are two main kings two variables you have to attend to to get your best results Specificity and SFR stimulus to fatigue ratio Specificity just basically means targeting specific muscles with the most stimulus that they can grow Like if you need bigger biceps you should be training your biceps a lot Our compound lifts the best for biceps some might be pretty good, but maybe there's not the direct answer to that question specificity matters And stimulus to fatigue ratio means maximizing how much growth Stimulus you get how much the muscles will grow after training, but minimizing things like joint and connective tissue stress and Psychological disruption and axial back fatigue and all so stuff So keeping your fatigue lower, but your stimulus higher if in high-perchurfied training We can get Excellence specificity and the highest stimulus to fatigue ratio is possible We don't care if it's isolations first or compounds first that let us do that And if it happens to be isolations first that let us maximize Specificity and maximize stimulus to fatigue ratio We get a lot out of the exercise by paying a small fatigue cost Then that's the correct way to do it and the rule of compounds first before isolations no longer applies for us Now sometimes for physique training compounds first is great advice Especially when the compound is limited by the target muscle and has a great stimulus to fatigue ratio for example If you're doing incline dumbbell pressos, that's a compound movement. Let's say you're doing it first If incline dumbbell presses fail because of your chest and Stimulate your chest like crazy and They don't really beat up your shoulders at elbows much you love the exercise. It's not super fatiguing That means it's amazing on specificity amazing on stimulus to fatigue ratio and then you can absolutely do it first compounds Before isolations later, may you maybe you'll do some flies. So in that case, that's totally cool Now this also has benefits because luckily you have a good stimulus to fatigue ratio Specific exercise as a compound that means it's going to come in and bring a high muscle activity Like compounds can do because of their stability and the weight used Your faster twitch motor units are gonna turn on because of the stability and the heavy weight and that's gonna be really really good stuff But If your compound exercise of choice is Limited by other muscles then the ones you're targeting for growth from that compound exercise and if it's stimulus to fatigue ratio fresh and raw and heavy isn't ideal Then isolation first can be better for example If your lower back is the limiting factor in your barbell squat and And you're strong strong enough that you're squatting a lot and those heavy squats are really starting to beat you up They take a toll familiar lower back from your hips from your knees Systemically they make you get crazy out of breath the super crushing weights psychologically drains you and even if squats don't be you up A ton a ton but like they beat you up some and they're already kind of kicking the dead horse that is your body Because you've done dead lifts early on the week and overhead presses and rows and now you're entire core Your back your posterior chain is so fried that like heavy squats on top of that is just like oh man I'm never gonna recover from next week If that's the thing Doing leg extensions or leg presses isolation stuff first before squats can help How the leg extensions or leg presses maximize Specificity in the quads by directly training quads when the fresh no debate right? Leg extensions is just quads leg presses. It's mostly quads and What they do is they really so the stimulus there is already really good and the specificities amazing Then you move on to doing squats afterwards Remember now that your quads are super pre-exhausted for me their tons of extensions are tons of presses when you're doing your squats You're using either less weight or doing fewer reps But since rep ranges are kind of independently fixed we want to target whatever upper range went to target anyway We have to dial the weight down. So instead of squatting three plates on a side maybe it's two plates and some change Now when you squat that weight It's gonna have this huge impact of being even more specific to your quads Because remember how your lower back used to give out beforehand well now your lower backs fresh It's got reps in the tank but your quads are damn near close to failure As soon as you do rep number one so after six or seven reps of squats even with two 25 Your your lower back might be completely I do this is easy I do three 15 for five or six reps no problem But your quads because of the 80 reps of extensions or presses you did before that summing up Really cooking which means now the specificity of the squat is Higher for your quads in Credible incredible that's amazing now In this instant for the squat as the exercise the raw stimulus magnitude how much high Perchryffy stimulus the squat actually gives you just the squat by itself as an exercise Is gonna be lower than if you did a fresh of course it will be if you did squat fresh You might be able to do a couple of sets of eight with three 15 and that's one hell of a stimulus couple of sets of Eight reps with two 25 if you do squats after five sets of leg presses Let's say I mean just the squats alone the raw stimulus is not nearly as high But how could it be if you're doing like a plate less on the side for the same sets Perhaps no way right However the lower weight and or lower reps in the squat done post isolation Means much lower fatigue Because to 25 for sets of eight does not beat up your body remotely like three 15 for sets of eight does not even close And tiny bonus here and it's a smaller acute injury risk as well Like if you were gonna snap your shirt up with three 15 for reps you probably don't snap it out for two 25 for reps So the stimulus to fatigue ratio of doing squats after isolations is Probably higher than doing them fresh The fatigue is way lower the stimulus is lower to but check this out the stimulus is just a bit lower Their fatigue is substantially lower that's a big deal So the SFR of leg press before squat Might be much higher than squat before leg press as a total sum of exercise squat and leg press and one leg press Then squat on the other if it's leg press then squat the stimulus to fatigue ratio is higher If it's squat then leg press the stimulus to fatigue ratio is lower But the raw stimulus magnitude might be higher so for example if you force sets of heavy squats and then four sets of lighter leg Presms you might stimulate more muscle growth then if you do four sets of lighter leg presses first and then four sets of heavy or Squats but they have to be later cuz you're more tired now the overall stimulus might be better from that Compounds first squat first exercise. Yes. That's absolutely true. However The stimulus to fatigue ratio because you have to lift so much less weight in the squat with your Overall body and systemic fatigue pay in the price in that condition of leg press first and squat Whereas squat first leg press second you got to go max out on the weight This the fatigue is so much lower and the stimulus just a little bit lower That the stimulus to fatigue ratio how much good you get for the cost you pay is just much better it's like If you pay a hundred dollars for really good meal Big Stimulus but the fatigue quote unquote of paying a lot of money. That's a lot of hundred dollars. It's holy shit Now if you get a meal that's not as good as the hundred dollar meal, but pretty damn good 80 90% is good But it costs 50 bucks You're paying half the quote unquote fatigue cost for that meal the money But you're getting 80 90% of the benefit on taste and on food experience in just the same way that workout that you do Isolations first compound second may very well not be the hundred dollar meal worth of fun But it's 80 90 dollars worth of fun. That's how much muscle growth stimulus you get out of it And it might cause half of the fatigue because fatigue works on an exponential and so if you're doing very close to your fresh one rep max That's unbelievable amounts of fatigue per rep If you go to three 15 which you can do let's say for sets of eight that's still a shit little fatigue the way less than if you did 365 you're wondering what max or something When you go not a 2 25 the amount of fatigue that isn't your back shoulders everything is just Way way way way way way smaller. So you can have literally half However you measure it of the systemic joint connective tissue fatigue in injury risk From doing squats after leg presses then before and 80 or 90% of the same roster in the last bag You say hold on doctor Mike has made any goddamn sense. I don't think Jim to grow as much muscle as possible So why would I settle for less fatigue? What's the bet of the less fatigue if I'm trading off? A you know 10 or 20% of my growth will hold on a second you just take an extra leg press set Error and extra squats set and you tack it on and you get 55% of the fatigue Into 100% of the stimulus Compared to that other workout of squats first leg press second Will you do maybe one or two fewer sets but you get double damn near the fatigue and right around the same amount of stimulus Stimulus to fatigue is so important because if you find a good stimulus to fatigue Set up for example leg press then squat versus the other way around You can just crank the juice out at a little bit just do a few more sets and you get this crazy Just machine that does out stimulus at very low levels of fatigue that's a big deal So if you're always sticking to compound lifts before isolations You're risk having needlessly low stimulus to fatigue ratio you're that guy Scott you know that guy that's always banded you up his knees and he's about to leg press after squatting and it's been like an hour because It's taken forever to squat set up and you're like already on your 15th set of like belt squats or something your quads are cooked and he's like Up just getting the leg press What is it that we're here for? Are you trying to get jacked in a decent amount of time or are you trying to see how injured you can make your back? While quote unquote squatting because it's a squat such a bad match up for your biomechanics That it barely hits your quads at all but you heard you got a squat first heavy first and you heard compounds first And you're doing it religiously so you're not leaving anything on the table. That's not a good thing You risk having needlessly low stimulus to fatigue ratio and Trouble specifically targeting a certain muscle like your quadriceps your triceps your lats or whatever you're ready to hit If your goal is targeted Maximally effective muscle growth training then It doesn't matter if it's isolation first or compound force both can be the correct answer The true correct answer is which one is most specific hitting the muscles you want the most and which one of those gives you the best stimulus to fatigue ratio Sometimes it's compounds first sometimes is isolation It's just not a dependable rule in physique to do compounds for or so Let's sum all of this up For strength training compounds first is usually the best for maximum tension maximum training response maximum gains in strength If you're serious about training for strength, I had better not see you do five sets of electric Sensions before you squat that's in backwards For athletics you need speed and athleticism and coordination and maximum force production compounds first almost always in athletics big bonus For physique it depends on specificity and stimulus to fatigue ratio Sometimes compound for a compounds first works Sometimes it doesn't work as well as doing some more isolated work first It's just not a dependable rule But you can find out what hits you best whatever gives you the best pumps whatever gives you the best Sonus whatever gives you the best progression and whatever it feels easiest on your joints Easiest on your spinal cord easiest on your psychology that's the thing you're probably gonna want to do Because it's dependably gonna make you more jacked over time. It's like a lot of IFBB pro body builders do this If you see either workouts a lot of times they'll do cable push downs Then they'll do some Smith machine score crushers then they'll do dips and then do a close grip bench for triceps And you're like why you start with close grip bench because of like Derek Lunsford started with close grip bench first He would be doing close grips for sets of 12 with 405 and there's elbows with last a few weeks and then throw up two middle fingers And never show up to the party again in the real world as you get bigger and stronger You got to sometimes be like all right Accelations first here just so I can cook this muscle a bit without using very heavy weights and without having to use compounds for heavy weights and Some combination of that and high reps to really cook my central nervous system my peripheral nervous system my cardio, etc Some point compounds first are not the good answer at some times they are and I'll end this on a funny note To me funny, we'll find out if we have a similar sense of humor in mere seconds For general physique over all looking sexy look in your best being healthy and Especially if your time constrained you train a couple times a week 20 to 40 minutes each time Rapid fire exercises my best advice to you is use Only compounds if you can do it a couple of sessions here is totally fine But the problem of isolation is for anyone unit of time One rep you train one muscle biceps biceps biceps If you're doing underhand pull downs you train biceps and rear delts and back all in each rep the amount of time efficiency is like Multiple's higher than doing isolation so if you want a great routine the safe time And to get their best shape that you can and just maybe an hour or two total of working out per week Almost everything if not everything should be a compound minimum rest for high reps between compounds Alternate compounds something that pushes something that pulls so on and so forth That's how you build the best plan for general fitness so this whole compounds first isolation thing for general fitness It's almost always just compounds when or anything where I'm compounds But in advance hyperchryffey training sometimes isolation first is best when it maximize the Specificity and it really maximize the stimulus to fatigue ratio because it makes a really heavy brutal compound No longer is heavy no longer and brutal and almost as effective but much less fatiguing If you guys want this kind of programming to be done for you you customize the AI helps and then you Execute the plan after that the RP hypertrophy app exists There are links to it right in the description below go get it. It's gonna be awesome. You're gonna get so jacked They you'll have a hard time understanding how you ever lived life smaller and that's on you and your psychotherapist to deal with folks I've been Dr. Mike and I'll see you next time
