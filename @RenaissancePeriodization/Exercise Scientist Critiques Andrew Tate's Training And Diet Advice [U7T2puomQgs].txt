Most people can do that. In fact, I would damn guarantee I'm stronger than you. Probably in Russia than you. I would actually recommend most of you people's songs. You people. What the f***? Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Prisation. The creator of the RPI Perchuvy app and a professor of sport and exercise science at Leem and College in the Bronx in New York City in Manhattan in the world. And guess who else lives in that world? Mr. Andretate. Successful professional kickboxer. Successful semi-professional person who, I think, sells sex workers or something like that. I'm not sure I'm a controversy. But I do know he's in the Manus Fear and I also sometimes identify his mail. Let's review his workouts and see if his advice is up to Master. S***. Seven days a week, no rest days. It's actually a bad idea. Your body needs rest and recovery. It's when it actually does most of its growth. I would recommend that the most advanced folks that are seeking the highest levels of adaptation to their physique's and muscularity train at most six days a week. But most folks would get the best results training somewhere between four and five days a week. So seven days a week is generally a bad idea. Well, a lot of people are not sure. I'm so sorry. Oh, no more. I haven't read them. I haven't read them. I haven't read them. They, there's a term for this in the hypertrophy training literature and it's called junk volume. It's doing lots of reps, but each rep is so profound that easy and you never really get very close to failure. So none of the parts of your muscle that really grow the most, the fast-witch motor units they're called, they never really activate much. And so you spend a lot of time doing this. You accumulate plenty of fatigue in his case. Not even that many things. So easy, but you don't get a huge stimulus. If he did 30 total repetitions, but each one of them was very, very heavy and very hard and was done in a very controlled cadence with a deep stretch, he could get all of the benefits and more of his workout with that spending. I don't know how long doing this takes a long time to do a thousand reps. Tates Prison Beast Mode. God, it's everything I ever wanted out of workout. In that jail cell, I had no access to a gym, I had no access to any kind of workout equipment who was just me, in a jail cell with you, who was a director of totally numb out as long as I could hold them out for and then that dropped to the ground and was a push up and had the time. Every single day you train, you woke up at the point and we slowed it in to point and we got the training. I'm a misery against psychology. The thousand trillion pushups and nail clattles are what I heard. That's just don't go to jail and you won't have to do that kind of stuff. Every single day. What is your excuse? Ah, what is your excuse stuff? Look, training every single day is not a good idea again. Six days a week, four days, five days is better, but sure makes for good memes. And what else is? Enderate other than a good meme. I don't know. Welcome to the Tate Fitness Course. There's a Tate Fitness Course. I'm unbelievable. Now this fitness course has a very unique angle to it. And the angle to this course is staying in shape. Having a good physique, growing your strength in this little time as possible. Sounds really good. This is not going to be one of those courses that talks about, f***ing, this muscle, that muscle, eat this, eat that. There's nothing with actual content to information. Just hard core stuff. This tendon, this joint. There's like, I don't know any of that stuff. And I don't actually know things. I just want results. I'm uninterested in all of that shame. Even when I was a professional fighter, I was completely uninterested in all of those things. Almost all professional fighters are. I can assure you. Even as a world champion, I was uninterested. I believed in hard work and dedication. I don't understand how hard work and dedication are antithetical to knowing what you're doing. I'm supposed to be from mental band with this small enough, that's one or the other. And I believe in this muscle, that muscle, that muscle, that muscle, that muscle, that muscle. So looking for a fitness course is going to sit there, talk about a whole bunch of f***ing science. Science. And garbage. garbage. Yeah. And go buy another one. F***ing another one. No, wait, wait. Go buy another one. Hey guys, if you really liked that, what you might really like extra is our extended edition of this video. And I'm actually a lot of our videos occur in our member section. Hit that join button and you will be whisked away into a portal of magic and by magic I mean extended video additions are what you just saw. This is my fit to teach items to stay in shape. And the reason where my f***ing bedroom. My f***ing bedroom. His bedroom looks nice. You could take away the civil rights of at least 20, 15 year old Romanian sex workers there, I imagine. Have you get canceled? If you want to go to the gym and train for three or four hours a day, that's fine. Idiot. But I know a whole bunch of people who dedicate their personality to being a gym rat and having a good physique. But they don't have anything else. Okay. Apparently the other hours of the day, the three or four hours of the day is all of them and they don't have anything else. They just sit around and play video games or at the time, fine. What do you do with the rest of your time, Mr. Andrew Tate and Friends of yours? Okay, yeah, you're a shape. So. Nobody cares, right? Unless you're making money, I don't see the point that it can get back much time to it. Okay, that's a fair play. You gotta know what you're getting out of the gym and you can actually get a great physique if you have a minimal, list of, you know, intelligent pieces of equipment that you're using in an intelligent way. Let's find out if intelligent supplies here. Well, you need our two mats. Two mats? I bet you don't even need those, but we'll get to that, Miss Suckers. You need a bar, which you can pick up for 10 bucks. And you don't even need a lot of weight. I'm a strong guy. Really? In fact, I would damn guarantee I'm stronger than you. I'm likely. And I use 30 kilos of weight. Okay. Dope. Max. The mats are all for you. The mats are for your fools. Because I don't know if you're flooring into my mind, but I'm f***ing expensive. Yeah. The target demographic that buys these things probably does not have expensive flooring. But it's nice that he is expecting them to get richer over time. I'll still adhering to his work out routine, because they have all the time the world to get rich and import people against their will from various countries forcing them to have sex. But whatever else you do for money, I don't mind business. Or, you know, do other kind of entrepreneurial activities. Then you get the bar. Now, this is gonna look easy. Maybe because it is. I'm kidding. I don't even know what it is yet. But I promise you it's not. Promise received. So, I would actually recommend most of you people start. You people, what the f***? With 20 kilos. This is 30 kilos. The reason we do these two standard exercises is a lot of graphic and view of f*** rational. You're a seep. No. Those are such cool graphics. I liked that he didn't. Not really like science. And shit. But like he's got science graphics. Every muscle over the body. Your legs, your abs, shoulders, your chest, your arms. Everything's gonna be done with these two exercises. Really? So you start here. Burpee. Back. Lift it up. Over your head. Camera guy. We're doing. That's one. We're gonna do 25 of them. Okay, so a burpee supersetded to a knot. Athletic, clean and press. Does work a lot of the muscles of your body. Well, it's probably mostly cardio workout and doesn't really get you very jacked or very strong. If you're very out of shape and you want to become sort of skinny and have some muscle like entertainment, then that's fine thing to do. That's 25. So we can tell them about breath. We're probably better shaped than you. Probably better shaped than you. I love the advertising. This is a quite direct. You suck. What you could be like me if you did this? In fact, you're doing 30 kilos. Most of you won't be able to do that. So you can start 10 kilos, maybe 20 kilos. I like the progressive element that respect. Then 25 jumps. And aim with these jumps. They don't look pretty. So your knees up high. So. Either way more efficient ways of training whatever the f*** the jumps train than doing the jumps. And way less taxing on your joints and connective dishes. So. Almost anything else. Well, I do them. I'm attracting my hands up. Let's just, uh. Let me guess. From your kickboxing days, just good old muscle memory. Old fighting habit. Wow, how do I know that? This is great for his demographic because everyone and his demographic thinks they fight even though they don't. So again, they had f*** always keep my hands up rather than just f***ing. Because you know, like I've seen a couple of entertainment videos. I've kind of like a K1 fighter. Yeah. Yeah. If you're sitting there going, well, why burpees take? Which muscle does my dismiss maximum mean by f***ing shut up? Now that shit matters. Damn, they're not f***ing bodybuilders. You know, science keeps. You try to have a good physique. Good physique means you're building the body in a specific way. Which means your body builder now. And if you want to have the best physique, then you want to know what you're actually training. Which means you're a science geek. It turns out if you want a certain appearance, you are actually encouraged to think about it a little bit. And try to pay. I don't know what this has to do with making money. B*** by the way, for the record. Almost everyone who does this will not have a good physique. Andrew Tate did not get a good physique. Doing this, he got it training for years and years and years in combat sport and having generally good genetics comparable calorie intake to his expenditure and moves around a lot. That's it. My personal experience. Girls don't find a whole body builder shit attractive. Drew, they find money attractive and they also find the potential that you will sell them down the river and they'll never have homes again attractive too much. It's too much I'll back off.

Very good way to make a critique that has no substance at all. It's just call it a name. I'm in. How the f*** around changing weights? Changing weights. That's for science geeks. So what we're basically looking to do is three exercises in one set. I like that his facial expression during this video was like he was woken up at three in the morning and told to film this in prompt too. He's like this. Go on my f***ing face, bro. Why now you son? I'm up. So 10. Oh that's the worst technique I've ever seen. God damn I wasn't ready for that shit. Don't folks don't hide in your app right now. Open up into them, get your elbows up and out. That will train your shoulders like it's supposed to. It looks like he's dying in there. My lead to make these jokes a Jewish workout. He just like recorollet the bill. I. It's $100 for breakfast. I. The stock portfolio came back and you had less return than you want. I. All day. I'm here all day. Terrible. awful. And he's using his legs too. I don't know why he's trying to make it easier for a shoulders. Maybe he doesn't want jack shoulders. Adam. If I saw him doing this at the gym and you pointed him out, I didn't know who he was and you're like does that person know what he's doing? I would say no. No he does not. Straight away, change your grip. Straight away, mate. No f***ing wait for it. Just moving stuff around. I would make a critique but that would be filed under science and nerd and gay. Oh shit, that was so f***ing athletic. You guys ever seen some shit like that? That's world championship. I throw it up to change my grip. We're not comfortable with that. You can hold it and change it slowly. My hand in our reverse. Guess what the advantages of reversing your hands. You get to lift any slightly less comfortable position or accomplishing nothing on net balance. Now I'll change grip back to the original grip. Ah. So once again I throw it. Oh. I've seen more athletic catches in my life. And back again. Between those three exercises, that is all I use to stay in prestige this will condition. Yeah. Oh, think he looks exactly like he's in pristine physical condition. He's like a guy that like is tall and skinny and just like smokes a lot of cigarettes and drinks and sometimes hits the gym and you're like, yeah, Frank, he exists. Androate is probably great for hustler advice. How to pick out cigars and advice on how to take people who previously had genuine life trajectories and hopes and dreams for themselves and imprison them against their will at use them for sex. Other than that, I wouldn't go to him for work out advice because while it's not terribly wrong, you can do better almost anywhere. Anyway, if you're interested in your life, please don't beat me up. But um... 4 on 10. 4 to 10. 4 to 10. That's it. Don't cancel us. See you guys next time.
