Okay, don't let that breakfast stuck here. I'm sorry, what? Don't let your breath get stuck in your f***ing neck. You would die if that happened. Peak nonsense. With a f***ing these people come from. Ahhhhh! Hey folks, I'm Dr. Mike Isor-Chalofranis-Sons-Purutization. I'm a professor of exercise and sports science. Leave in college in the Bronx. And I am the creator of the RP Hyperchewy app. I'm going to be praising Mark Wahlberg's Hollywood workout. I can't wait. Let's get to it. I've traded Mark Wahlberg for 13 years now. Gotten Ready for... Brian Winne is an athletic performance coach. Mark Wahlberg's not an athlete as an actor. So, fault number one. If you guys have been through these videos with me before, this is probably going to be a giant disaster. But I'm getting out of myself. Maybe it's great. Gotten Ready for several movies including painting, gain, shooter, the fighter. Hey, it's training for a long time. Good. Good. He knows Mark's body. I know Mark's body pretty well too. Mostly from pictures and videos that I have in my collection. The other day, Mark's got to be able to move like a cat. Like a cat. And still wield heavy ass gun. Okay, he's aren't real guns. They're prop guns for the 50th time Hollywood. But maybe they're good prop guns. And they're actually regulation weight. That would be dope. Mark needs to be strong for that, I agree. In order to do that, he's got to be athletic as heck. He didn't swear. He said athletic as heck. Very nice. Mark Wahlberg always has gardening gloves on when he trains. I just don't know why I can't figure it out. Folks, when you wear gloves, when you train, it does nothing for your calluses. How do I know that? I used to wear gloves when I was younger. It did nothing for my calluses. And also it's just gunky and ooey and gooey and sweaty and gross. Just don't do it. Don't do it unless you have a compelling reason. I don't know about which made him arc does. But it's unlikely. Oh, god, the f***er rebigins are ready. Train like Mark Wahlberg. Others are very young picture of him into older picture of him. So we work out in two days split, meeting that we have a day a regiment and a day b regiment. Two days split, day a and d b makes sense. So let's say on Monday, we do upper body pushing and lower body pulling. Then on day b, our focus is on the flip side. So now I have upper body pulling and then lower body push. Okay, so he does upper body pushing and lower body pulling on one day and then upper body pulling and lower body pushing. This is a very strange way to construct a split and I'll tell you why. There are exercises like cable rows, bent rows, almost any kind of row, almost every kind of stiff like a deadlift in good morning, which pretty severely tax your posterior chain, including your back. But also tax other parts of your posterior chain like your glutes and your hamstrings and your lower back is a big limiting factor in many cases. So what I would like to see and as much more commonly done for well sort obvious reasons is push upper and lower, which means pressing exercises and then exercises mostly for your quads like squats like press, etc. And then on the other day pulling exercises with lower body pulls as well. Stiffly, another good morning's deadlifts, things like that. Now when we talk about form from arc, a lot of what we do with is that upper cross syndrome. Upper cross syndrome, not a real syndrome, by the way, this is make belief PT bullshit. A lot of that little slouch that all of us are developed. All of us are not developing a slouch from the sedentary lifestyle and texting, right? Texting does not promote folks. Poster is the single biggest cesspool of bullshit ever. Poster is mostly genetic is almost nothing to do with muscle strength. It's just how usually sit. If you want better posture, check this out. Just be attentive, sit more upright, and over several weeks you'll learn to buy default, sit more upright. There's no exercise you need to do in the gym. Nobody has bad posture because their pecks are too strong and their back is too weak. If that was really the case, your back would be constantly pulled into eccentric load and then hypertrophy and grow to respond to get better and auto fix that posture. And also, you'll notice something about your muscles. They're not just on all the f*** time. If your pecks are really big and strong, my pecks are rather big and strong, if I say so myself. What are they doing right now? Not deadly dick. I'm not sitting with my f***ing pecks activated. With a f***ing these people come from. Wait a minute. Hollywood. Why we use this particular exercise? Spine band overhead hold. Why do you use this particular exercise, Mr. Wind? Is the chaos that you have to control? What? It's the chaos you have to control. No, my friend. If you open up your gym door and three rot-wilders run in, that's chaos you have to control. This is you laying down with a f***ing band all around your body. It's a shit mini band too. It's barely any work. Back to the, you asked a whole dad band apart. Really accentuates the muscles that have to be on the stay tall. No, this you want to accentuate the muscles that have to be on to stay tall. Otherwise, you would be accentuating the ones that keep you short. And short kings know a fence, but that's a bad thing. Absolutely press this low back to the ground to keep these ribs down and tuck. Engaging that anterior core and tighten it up with that breathing. This is one of our big bang for your buck. Warm up exercises for the post-year chain. Absolutely. The focus on good breath. Innose out the mouth when you breathe. Guys breathing in with the nose and out through through the mouth is nonsense. Almost any breathing technique that doesn't involve vipassana meditation is f***ing nonsense. Evolution designed you to breathe, you do it real f***ing well. Believe it or not, you even do it automatically and you're asleep. This is high grade BS. And that pole part crap is not a great. Warm up for the posterior chain. You know what does a great warm for the posterior chain? Deadlifting. Stiff like a deadlift. Bet rows and any other exercise that uses a f***ing posterior chain. Aaaaaaah. Okay, don't let that breath get stuck here. I'm sorry what? Don't let your breath get stuck in your f***ing neck. You would die if that happened. It always goes to your lungs. Peak nonsense. We've achieved it folks. After like seven episodes of whatever the f*** exercise science show we got on this channel, we're here. You're gonna die. I'm not being able to breathe properly. If you're not doing wha- Whusaw bull shit. Kill me Scott the video guy. No wait wait I'll do it myself. I'm breathing normally. Oh shit. Oh my god that was so crazy. Of course mountain climber, or which is f***ing pointless unless you're warming up for field sports and a f***ing power plate folks. I was actually directly involved in research on the power plate. No offense power plate company. Though I do think you sell a product that's entirely needless and insanely overpriced. The power plate was a vibrating platform. What it does is it actually helps you while you're on it to be much more flexible than you would be if you were not on it. It's great for stretching. What's happening here isn't stretching. It's warming up in a power plate. Does precisely the following to help you warm up. Diddley dick. When we start getting to any pushing motions, a big thing that can happen is that. Okay so his technique sucks. His f***ing dive bombing onto his chest. His pressing up visibly asymmetrically. He has the dildo bar ab thing in case what you hurt your chest dive bombing. Hang on idea. Control the centric and you won't have to have that stupid thing on there. Limiting range of motion. Limiting the centric load. Limiting the stretch. Limiting your growth. Damn, am I an a tear today. It's important to get the core part of the pushing complex. What? If you get the core part, you now contract your abs and even more extremely push into a f***ing folded over crab. When you're doing a proper bench press, you retract your shoulder blades. You actually relax your abs so that your chest can arch and then you're a good pushing position. Is the very opposite of what he's saying? It's as if it's all f***ing make belief in Hollywood. That actually makes lots of sense. Now as Chad Sessa first push up, I have my perfect plank position. I'm going to get him to bring your chin over this fence. There you go. So now I have a direct line. Rist under the shoulder. You don't want to be anywhere else. You don't want to be anywhere else or else what can happen. I don't know. So go ahead drop into your push up, chat by falling forward. Notice that forward fall creates that 90 you've been here in the army. 90 f***ing degrees it had to happen at some point. What happens when you go below it? I'll tell you you get more tricep hypertrophy. What happens if you go above it? Nothing magical again. 90 degrees is as Arnold would say. Bullshit. Get out of here. No. What's we've worked on our breath, worked on that posture. We've round out our warm up with some verse of climber. By the f***ing warm up, then lasted 50 f***ing minutes, bro. We've got to leave. What does this 10 minutes left for the workout? Versa climber? You know, f***ing hard to Versa climber is to do. You're going to be gasped out by the timing it to your workout. You may not have a Versa climber handy in your gym. It's still work on your crossbody patterning. Crossbody patterning. A make-belief term by a person who does not have an advanced degree in coaching athletes. Here's a couple of exercises that I love if you don't have Versa climber. I'm a bear crawl. I'm a bear crawl in a figure eight pattern. So he's going to be crawling around. I'm sorry. I'm a bear-rape pattern. I've done this once to great benefit. I paid my regular 380 pound dominatrix to put a ball gag in my mouth, where I summarily crawled on the ground in front of her in any pattern. My mistress desired. That was a lot of fun. Outside of that context, this is the equivalent of the embarrassment only a dominatrix can provide. But with another fucking sexual relief, I'm kidding by the way. She was more like 400 pounds. Notice I can put an object here on the chads back, and that keeps him more mindful of. I can't believe this is happening. He's putting in a object on the guy's back to demonstrate that his back is so stable and so plateau-like. What the f*** are we even doing here? I thought we were trying to lift weights so we can look like Marky Mark. None of this so far. And I mean, none of it will make you look remotely like Marky Mark. And he looks great. This is nonsense. No way. No, he just used the bear crawl as a potentialation to a 4.0-point mountain climber in the middle of a warmup. He did a warmup for the next warmup. God strike me down. Now that we finished our warmup and our body's ready to go, let's do day. Okay. Now that we finished our warmup, 10 fucking years later, maybe we'll work out. Oh God. Barbell floor press with a dead butt. This is if you want to limit the stretch on your chest and triceps, because the floor prevents you from going deep enough, thus limiting the muscle growth healed of this exercise, and also to further reduce the load from making your muscles bigger. Just strap yourself through doing some weird dead bug bullshit with your feet. Classic Hollywood nonsense. And this is actually the workout. Chad's gonna squeeze his low back to the ground before pushing the bar up. It's gonna squeeze his low back to the ground. What are we even training here? Is this just like learn how to move weirdly with a barbell hour? As he pushes the bar up, he's gonna in control drop one leg and hover the ground. This isn't even lifting weights anymore. This is like a circus act with no entertainment value. Good God. I can't tell. Is this till the warm-up or not? I can't tell. This is if you're so weak that an actual single leg already, L isn't enough, seen a band to hold your dumb ass up. Chad's gonna pull back into tension here. Pull is that big tension. He's gonna kick that left leg back, hinge at his hips, and drop towards the tension. And then he's just gonna pull and stand right back up. Okay great. So even assuming this exercise has any hyper-trophic yield, which is basically not true, he's actually leveraging in such a way that the band tension reduces as he goes down, but he's even making it worse by extending his hand forward. So at the very point that the hamstring is most likely to be growing, which is at the very bottom stretch, he is reducing the amount of load on the f***. I can't stand this shit. After those two, I always throw in a corrective exercise. Always after throwing a corrective exercise. This is just day one stuff, guys. So will farmers walk a figure eight pattern? Oh my god. Scott, do we need a guy? Is this a f***ing joke? This is a real workout? Figure eight. F***ing walks. With an unbelievably light load in the farmers carry, give you nothing at all. By the f***er, I get better training, walking my grocery to my f***ing car. Literally in every respect, it's a more complex pattern. It's more distance, and I sure a shit have more groceries than he has f***ing kettlebells. I'm just walking a figure eight pattern for about anywhere from 50 to 100 yards. This is just wasting energy. Sorry, I've been so light on the exercise science. There is no f***ing science in any of this. kettlebell deadlift. In case you're weak enough, for a kettlebell to be a good load for deadlifting. Guys, a kettlebell that weighs 150 pounds is profoundly heavy, very rarely there are the heavy. And most adult men, after several weeks of training, can do 150 pounds in the deadlift for 20 plus repetitions. Marky Mark has been training with weights. For the vast majority of his life, he should be able to pull 225 through 15 even more for reps. What the f*** is he getting out of a f***ing kettlebell? I submit to the answer is very low. We did humanilater on the lower body pull last time, so we're going to go biilateral on the lower body pull this time. That makes sense. It makes as much sense as any other string of a random f***ing word strewn together. Let me tell you guys about the RP Hypertrophy app. With over 28 preset programs already in the app, you can choose to make your own. You can modify an existing program or you can just run the programs exactly as they were written by 8 person on this app programs everything for you. Exercise is weights, sets, reps, frequency, the whole thing. After every single workout, every single week, the app adjusts to your unique parameters with every single input. We have over 250 exercises in the app with detailed video tutorial links to every single one. You never have to be confused about technique or form ever again. Guessing right now you're pretty interested in the app? Download the RP Hypertrophy app today. Half kneeling, unilateral overhead press. If you want to focus on anything other than the front delts and triceps, which are actually trying to train, you muddy the waters by making this an exercise that's also difficult to stabilize during. What are we training for? That's right. It's to make Markymark as nimble as a cat for ways doing fake guns and fake scenes of fake shootouts. Half kneeling position. When we get to a half kneeling position, we're really helping the body to understand a little bit of a different base. Getting the hips to split really helps to accentuate that posture because the core is more active. Getting the hips to split helps accentuate that posture because the core is more active. If you type in random letters and numbers as a chat and GPT prompt, you will get a more cogent string of words back than this by a f***ing long shot. Now you're into your corrective exercise. Oh, thank god. Finally corrective exercise, which by the way is a term series scientist, basically don't use because it f***ing nonsense. What we're going to do today is our power plate figure 4. If you want to, you can be on a post-suit. Of course, on a bosew, everything is better. Figure 4 pattern is a big stretch for your hip. Why is a hip stretch good? And whenever asked, and whenever answered. We've done all this work on pieces and patterns. Pieces and patterns, check, check. I have a feeling it's time for some battling ropes. Now let's play some music with the body. He really just said, now let's play some music with the body. That used to be one of my dog shit pickup lines that never got me laid. But I can't believe he's actually saying this in a training context. And you know what music looks like? It looks like f***ing battle ropes. Kill me! Now please! This is metabolic work. Of course, random exercise term generator came up. Metabolic work. Guys, every single act of physical work you do involves, you guessed it, the metabolism. There is no work that does not metabolic work. It is sheer impossibility. Because how do you move if your metabolism doesn't allow you to process the energy requirement to actually f*** move? My head! So if you're in half the end of your third book, he is grooving in that video though. Marky Mark makes everything look good. I take back all of my criticisms. The second, and you're not feeling that. Yes, that's being out of breath. By the way, Mr. Wind, you're not breathing properly. I didn't see the nose in mouth out stuff. You're going to die soon. The heart's not thumped in. Maybe you want to pick up a rope that is a little thicker. I like picking up a thick rope. I did I mean rope, not I didn't. Or a little longer. Who's thicker and longer? The black rope. Am I allowed to say that's got the video guy? F*** it will keep it in. Our favorite finisher. Oh, and you're getting pushed around. Is the sled push? Why? Number one because it's super challenging. Yes, of course. You want to put the most challenging thing at the end. When you have the least energy. Makes sense? And number two, it's super corrected in nature. Super corrective in nature. That makes a lot of sense. If we assumed that corrective is an ebulous term that has no definition. Which is actually true in this case. Okay. Uh, instead of doing the traditional rating system, I'm going to go off myself.
