Oh, it's so good. Ah, go, God. Rest, breathe. Ah, ah, you're a f**k. This sounds like sex. Ah! Hey, folks. Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Pyrridsation. I'm here with Genegiri, AKA Muscle Mommy, AKA Wonder Woman Dunwright, AKA... What if Wonder Woman went super-same? She's M. Now, Gen is a goddess in a statue-esque, but one of her deepest, darkest secrets, her vulnerabilities, if I may say, is that she thinks her quads just need to be a lot bigger. And she just didn't know where to look for big quads. And then she was like, are p, what is that? She made the mistake of her life again, because you've seen her train quads last year when Hacks wats a stuff this time. She's in for glutes and Hams and quads. We are going to do some dead lifting for glutes, special deadlift technique. One or two sets of stiff leg adults at the end, they hit the Hams. That's easy. Then leg presses until something happens. And then probably some lunges, because why not Gen? How are you feeling yourself today? I am great. Excellent. We'll see. I was going to say we're going to break you down, but you never do lose your little charm, do you? No. Well, that's the case, folks. Let's get into it. All right, folks. First exercise is a glute deadlift. It means it's a deficit deadlift. It looks like a stiff leg a deadlift starting out. Once the Hams get to a stretch, want to take them out of the equation by bending our knees. Typically for a stiff leg a deadlift, that would be really stupid. Because it takes the Hams out of the equation by no longer stretching them under load, by allowing them to ease to come forward. Taking the tension off the Hams, but here we want that. Because if your Hams can no longer do the work, your quads are fairly in a position to exert much leverage. Your hips are hinged to the max. Because of the deficit, guess what muscle is the prime mover? It's absolutely glutes. Will you get an erector pump? Spinal erector pump? Absolutely. Laptomp? Yes. This is a great 70% of your body exercise, but it really does target the glutes. If you want glutes and you want to do deadlift, this is one of your best choices. Again, it's going to do a couple sets of 8 to 12. We're going to do one set of stiff leg a deadlift at the end because this does hit your Hams strings just one set of SLD. It should cook them completely to golden brown perfection. And then we're on two quads. Let's get it done. Slow. Yes. Up. Good. Good. Two more. Slow. Good. One more. Slow. Good. You got more? Slow is that for another? Slow. And. Crop. Good. Good. Feeling your lower back a little bit? Good. That's a deadlift. Three kinds of guys in this world. Type one. Denying that they love the muscle mommy. But secretly they at home jacking that dick thinking about muscle mommy. Type two are guys that just don't do it. That's just not their thing. No big deal. Type three is guys that embrace the shit. Caves. You know what I'm saying? And you're saying you're as a mismedium. Bitches single. So fellas get in the hands. You know what I'm saying? About our DM's got damn it. We don't need that shit. Perfuck in the hands. Slow. That was a best laugh at a whole fucking set. Two more. Two more good ones. Slow. Good. Slow. Up. As if another. Brilliant. Brilliant. Get used to that shit. Alright. Stifflegged deadlift. Regular. Just like a set of eight nice and tough. Same que is last time except when you break your knees. Push your knees even further. Cool. You're ready? You need a break. You're still breathing heavy. Four factor rest. You need to rest more. Relax. Relax. How do we figure out how much rest Jen needs? We have a little problem with Jen. She's a fucking warrior princess. So she's kind of like ready all the time. Even though she's got like a axe gash through her body. She's like, I'm going to go. Let me back in. We're like Jesus Christ. So the thing is we want to check a couple boxes before we do our next set. One box is, are you still breathing heavy? Is your cardio thus going to limit you and your next set? We're not here to do cardio, but he just stimulate the muscles. So if you're breathing super fucking heavy, don't go yet. Wait until your breathing is more back to normal. The other thing is, do you feel strong and ready? If you are fucking in touch with the reality of what you're feeling, that answer is not always yes to that. After a super hard set of delifts, someone's like you feel strong. You're like, I'm fucking, no, I felt like I'm going to die. But a minute or two later, you're like, alright, feel my slack. Then you're going to go. Is the target muscle itself ready to do at least another five reps. If your target muscle is still cramping and squeezing and burning, relax, take a break. And the thing is, synergists, if your lower back is still killing you, lay down, lean on something until your lower back is good and then you're ready to go. And we check those four boxes. Then we're good to go. And when Jen is ready, she's not breathing heavy. She feels her swag. The muscles are healed and recovered. Then we go again. Typically, that takes about two or three minutes. And then, let's take a longer, if you're really strong, really big, or my case really fat. I said, I had two things to say. That was thing one. Here's thing two, you guys ready? Let's make this the deepest one, yet of all of them. Super slow. Knees back. Deeper. Deeper. Pause. Wait. Wait. Up. And then, as if another. Super slow. Slow it. Tell me you felt your hamstrings. You felt your hamstrings a little bit. Yeah. Good. A lot of it. Okay. All right. All right. Like best. I don't have shoes. I do have that foot. Excellent. Couple rules for the leg press. Number one is you want to push through your whole foot. Don't come up on your toes. Don't just push through your heels. All foot. Mass them in muscle activation. Maximum stability. Maximum safety. Maximum growth. Another rule is to make sure your hips are down square in that pad. And then they're not coming up off the pad. It's okay if they rotate a little bit. Totally fine. If your lower back doesn't hurt or feel super awkward, you're totally good. Don't go down the rabbit hole of me. I'm like, buckling, it's going to kill me. You're not that fragile. Nobody is. And over time, you're biting a few special. Also, if you're treating your back properly with deadlift stuff like it of good mornings, you're not that fragile. You are way good enough to get a little bit of rotation or fight. But if your butt is coming super far off the ship, if your lower back is invisibly around me, not just buckling like the whole back is going like that. And if it feels painful or weird, you probably have to take your foot. And adjust them down. Jenna's super flexible. So she's going to be able to do this without weightlifting shoes. Your boy here's not that lucky. I use weightlifting shoes and the versalift inside my shoes to get that extra leverage. The pads help me. That's what I need. Those are the main rules of leg press. Today, we are going to do slow eccentric. Not the only way to do it, but a fun option. And full one second positive body. Every rep. That means Jenna isn't going to need to use a lot of weight. But she's going to pray to God that you have to throw the fuck out of here. Because it's going to hurt. Lastly, another two rules of leg pressing. And these are non-negotiable. Three rules. One scream of fuckload. Just all the fucking time. Two, use your hands to help yourself on every single rep. Leg press is not leg exercises. It's a full body exercise. And three, grab about your leg press PRs with shitty technique to everybody. You know, call up grandma. Tell the hey grandma what he up. You said, well, I have a shut up. Listen to my leg press PR. Grandma, I was going to say to be weird. But that's not nice. Let's get into some fucking leg press. Good. Slow. Rasp for a second. Two more in your done. Begin now. When a bum rushed a muscle, go. Slow. Slow. Ah, ah, ah, ah. One more down, down, down, down, slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Pause. Press. Rack. Rack. Beautiful. Oh my god. Oh. Amazing. Amazing. Oh, yeah. Oh. She'll feel it in the closet a little bit. Yeah. Ah. Of almost all the leg presses I've ever used, the arsenal leg press is essentially one of the best if not the best. But like every other leg press except 50 times worse than those leg press cases at this one, the leg presses typically do not have the kind of shape of back pad that you would want to keep your lower back from rounding while getting full ROM in the quads. So what we do is we do a modifier. Flex Lewis's gym here, Dragons layer, have this thing laying around. I bought two of these actually just a few days ago and they we brought them over to the gym. A permanent gift from Mr. Flex Lewis. Point. You're bringing stuff to me fucking gym. Oh, fucking eyes out. That's literally what he told me when I tried to give him a gift. Get a fucking shite away from me. Fucking purple. You're fucking 30. I was like, I'm trying to help in any case. He was like, it's cool. We put one down here and then we put one down here and what it does is it crops your hips up so if they're not slimy, I'll over the place of generating a ton of unwanted movement in the lower back. Keeps it on the quads, keeps it safe, keeps it effective, keeps it at mega ROM. She probably doesn't need the help but with it, she's going to get psychotic range of motion. Bad news for her. Great news for us. Enjoy. Up. Press. I'm not here to do opera. I wrote one more. One more. Get your shit together. Take a little break. Take a little break. Take a little break and we'll do two more and you're done for this set. Okay. Begin. Slow. All you have to do is try your fucking best. Deep. Up. One more. Down. Slow. I want fucking pain, Jen. We're not leaving before pay. Slow. Pause. Up. Go. Yeah. I need an half-tell. Brax. Good job. Good job. Wow. Sorry, Dragons. Oh, man. What you apologize for? I was loud. So, Jim. You did say that was one of the rules. One of the rules got me wrong. No, I just got a call grandma. Holy fuck, that was horrible. That was worse. That was worse than the hacksquad. That was. Okay, I can last that. I got it. Fuck. Up. Slow. Oh, shit. That's so good. Go, god damn it. Rest breathe. You have to hold. It sounds like sex. Okay. Two. Two. Go. Push. One more. Rest. Don't go anywhere. Don't go anywhere. Don't go anywhere. You wait. I'm taking some weight off. I'm taking some weight off. Let's finish off strong. All I need is five more reps. And you're fucking good. Go. Slow. Go. Slow. Go. Slow. Slow. Slow. Up. Down. Down. And last one. Down. Don't you fucking touch your legs. Slow. Slow. Now it's going to sit this one out. I'm gonna pause. Power. Rack. Oh. Oh. Oh. Huh. Doing that. She's speaking in time. Okay. I'm gonna try to stand up. I physically cannot make my body move right now. We got one. Drink your water. I can't do it. Don't like. Don't touch. Hey guys. I want to take a minute to tell you about our team full-rumb membership. You get six programs every six weeks.
