For example, if she's like fine, you want it hard, crazy mouth shit, cycle eyes, and eyes roll the back of her head. You're like holy shit, that's too much. I hate to say, my de isn't trained. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for NSW. Today's video topic is a little bit of an intellectual journey to figuring out why we should be trying to train harder just about every week during a normal progression in a mess of cycle. There are some folks that say, look, you know, hit two reps and reserve more or less every week. You're totally fine. Some folks say you got to go hard every single week and every single week is maximum hard and don't worry about ramping it in. I say ramping it is a real good idea and I have both good scientific and logical reasons. And also a completely absurd analogy for you at the very end. So stay tuned. Or just fast forward right now to the very end and have no fucking clue what I'm talking about. Anyway, here we go. How hard should you start your mess of cycle? You put a new program together. It's week one of your program. You just deloted. You could start at zero R. R. Like pretty close to failure or failure for everything, but that's going to come with a huge fatigue cost. Higher probability of injury going from zero to 60 super fast. And the best thing is you don't really need that level of effort to occur because you just deloted and spent a week not training hearts. You're more sensitive to training. In addition to that, you probably move to matrices around introduce some new ones. Got rid of some old ones, changes of ramp ranges so that the novelty alone is going to be really stimulative. So you don't need to go to crazy failure all the time or in this first week. And so under these conditions, something like three reps and reserve is actually, perfect amount of training. Perfect stimulus to get you right in that zone gets you a little pumped, little sore, a little tired and the next week you can go up and up and up. All right. Next question. Why if R R are three training is really good for week one, why is it not good to just do week two and three and four? If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That sort of thing. Well, hold on a second. So why should you scale up? Couple reasons. You want to make sure you're not sandbagging your training. So making your training a little bit challenging over time until you hit an absolute limit into how hard you can push ensures that you're within that zero to three R R band. Because if you start at three R R and you tell yourself you're three R R, you could be here and actually four or five reps in reserve and that ends up not being very effective especially for intermediate and advanced. So you want to make sure you're not sandbagging your training and regularly challenging yourself a little bit more is basically a guarantee that that doesn't happen at least not for long. So what you do is you increase your repetitions per set and or your load a little bit week by week by week and that means you're pushing the pace so that you're not in a situation where I call am I really training harder over time am I really getting better? Well, you literally are so that question is answered. What happens is as you go a little harder each time and as your fatigue accumulates, you end up having to drop how close to failure getting rather increase how close to failure you're getting and your R R starts to drop you start a three reps in reserve then you add five or ten pounds you add a wrap the fatigue is higher next week maybe you know some neurological adaptations your technique is better so it's still three in reserve then the next week is two reps in reserve then one then zero and then you're basically going to failure. It has to happen this way unless you plan on getting stronger forever and never actually reaching your limits that would be sweet but if you tell yourself every week I'm going to put a little bit of load on the bar or add a set here and there eventually you get to zero R R on failure it just has to occur that way but this is really good because we want more challenge as our body's adapt to previous challenge in the previous week it's just not ideal to repeat the same exposure think about getting good at anything like if you have some kind of like French language app and you're like oh yeah listen complete time yeah see that's the only French I know and you're like oh I said a phrase or word and in French I'll just do that again next week and then a few weeks later I'll be able to speak French I gotta hear that's not works you learn some words you learn some phrases you learn some conjugation you do more complexity it's more challenging kind of regularly until eventually you can speak French like me a person who studied in France for years during the war to be a professional chef you guys know all this already I don't have to bore you with my history you want to go a little bit further into the fray with each successive week because that's how you make the best games plain and simple so you can't just keep that first week effort you gotta increase effort over time lastly why is it at least in many cases a good idea in that last week or the last half of the last week before you do load to really just go for broke with good technique blow it out and on the exercises which are not going to kill you like a machine chastras go all the way to failure why could that be at least theoretically a pretty good idea a couple reasons first that last week before right the second to last week was maybe one or zero reps in reserve this next week just with the addition of five more pounds or a rep to every set it's going to be basically failure anyway so it's not like you're doing anything super different you're just finishing what you start first point second point the are theoretical reasons hypothetical reasons that you can get some gains by really pushing hard all the way to your limits, on occasions and it's not the kind of gains that you would get just from doing great training it's a level beyond and is it possible that that's the case yes is it likely I don't know but I wouldn't rule that out and if there's not a huge amount of downsize to really pushing it every now and again at the end of every mesocycle I think it's probably worth at least trying or at least thinking about another reason you want to test your max rep abilities to make your gaining strengths for reps over the last time let's say you worked up to 200 pounds in the squat for reps last mesocycle you know six weeks ago and you got a set of 12 as your top set and your average you know for four sets was 10 reps you're coming back up again with squats as the first exercise and you're at 205 or 210 pounds this time you want to see if you can do better than 12 or at least match 12 so you gain five or 10 pounds of strength you want to really push the pace so that you don't have to be like well I think I got stronger but like last time it was a one RR this time was like twos you tried to do that in your head just that mathematics is on nonsense it's just a whole lot of pretend the only real good way to compare performance to performance is of both of them work push to the limits then you can say that's equated my effort was maximum the whole time if I did better now then back you know six weeks ago clearly I got better and I'm doing something if you didn't get better I'm free to think about there is the puzzle piece of like okay is my nutrition lacking is my sleep lacking is my programming bad are just my genetics the worst ever should I just quit should I take up tennis those are all really good questions you want to ask if you're not improving so this ability to go all out to get a good metric cycle to cycle to see if you're improving that's a pretty compelling thing another one is you are theoretically going from like three reps in reserve through the mathematical all the way to zero reps in reserve are pretty close to failure how do you know that's the case in reality if you never push it like if you finish your last week of training and you're like oh yeah that's a PR and it is you got stronger better than last week but in two months ago you rack the weight that could have been three RR and you've been telling yourself you're training in an average of two RR the whole time that's wrong and you started a week though with three RR you know six weeks ago but it was really six RR because it's just been sandbag want to push on occasion very close to if not too true failure itself just to test yourself you say okay I think because I did 11 reps last week at three hundred pounds in the leg press this week at three ten I should be able to get 12 reps and that's going to be failure if you get to 12 and you do the 12th wrap and you're like as easy I'm going to do three more reps then you know you got a lot better first second you know you've been bullshitting yourself on what your RR was on the other hand if you did 12 reps this time but 11 last time and it took everything you had and your body had to like stay next to the machine to make sure you didn't kill yourself that last rep was like 50 trillion you know extra seconds of super slow contraction you can be pretty sure you're pushing it to failure in that last week and thus if you discount all the weights and reps before the three weeks back you're like oh I really did start at three RR I'm I'm training completely on track that's a really good thing it sets you into line to make sure you're actually trying as hard as number one you think and number two the research suggests is best which you know as anywhere between three and zero reps reserve another compelling reason why not that you should do this but that it's okay is that you have a deal a week after like you kind of have the whole fucking week to recover anyway so it's not like someone could be like hey man don't go to failure today bro you're like it's week five week six ideala this is the Thursday of week five I have one more training day tomorrow why shouldn't I give my all these leg process week you can need it for next week brother you're like neat what dumb motherfucker I'm deloading he's a champions don't deloge I have fucking my face you don't know what you're talking about so you got to deal in next week it's okay to go out no big deal right it's like a few um oh this is terrible analogy if you go to Las Vegas is it okay to get super fucked up the night before you fly back out to let's say Europe well yeah you're in a 12 hour plane ride what could go wrong having a hangover that was a terrible analogy don't do that and if you do that make sure to at least throw up into the person's next to you lap and if they get upset you're like they is they guess whatever happens in Vegas doesn't really stay in Vegas especially if it's your in any case this means that it's maybe a good idea to do your last half week kind of all out and at the very least is your the second half of your last week because let's say you have a workout a leg workout on Tuesday and then Friday of that last week you all out all out all out Tuesday and you're pretty jacked and pretty strong Friday we just not happen the way you plan to sort of do beat up you just fail all your PRs everything goes to hell so maybe that second to last leg day that last week first part you go just as you're all I are you know five or ten pounds heavier in last time same reps whatever's prescribed and then that last workout Friday you really you know listen to this get on the way to the gym turn your turn your baseball hat around before you do your set sunglasses for the radiation at your admitting she liked that really really get a fire up so some compelling reasons there the unifying theme here is that when you start your training mesocycle your program you want to just get the easy games going and get that momentum going right you know just like run through brick wall your first fucking session of of the month that's kind of stupid you're gonna get great results trying not so hard and then you increase difficulty over time via auto regulation that means if your leg presses are really coming up then you can put 20 pounds for some weeks on the on the leg press more than the weeks before if it's try some extensions maybe two and a half or five pounds but a little bit more maybe you're up here and there a little bit more every single week just a bit to keep going up and up and up and up and then that last week or last half of the week you can really just fucking poor all of your childhood demons out and just do what it takes to go all out as long as you're safe and your technique is good just leave it all out there in the gym potentially blood sweat and vomit as well chunks of your hair on the bar kind of technique you're doing there but that's probably okay too and may even be an advantage so the unifying theme is you start a little easy progressively work your way up and end on a really high note and what is that sound like sex that's right that's right so let me make it an algae for you as to how sex is so much more like lifting than we all thought or some of us knew already that lifting was exactly like sex here we go let's see if we can get the ban hammer on YouTube for this one is not right Scott the video guy all right so here's the analogy you're in the club clearly you're a man of taste girl comes up to you at the club you're a dark corner just screw them by yourself she just reaches for your fucking dick and just grabs the shit and looks at you that's kind of cool and all but like a part of you's like damn bitch slow the fuck now hold the shit you're like let's maybe chat for a little bit even okay that's too prude let's make out and do touch you touchy that shit has fun as hell and he gets everything going and you find out if it's the right groove and all that that part's so fun right so damn hold up and I'm saying grab my dick so that fucking hand I got it here what was your name anyway in any case such a thing is too much too soon I know crazy it may seem that is the reality next probably not a thick club though maybe if you have bottle surface you can get away with this year let's say back at your place or her place with her like chains and shit and pictures of guys with targets on their faces and dark you know little little darts on there and some of the darts have fallen off and the fuck is going on so anyway you're there and you're getting the beach the old beach google that if you have to and let's say she's like fucking hitting you up and she's gone like a great pace for a foreplay but like if there's a difference between like hey this is fun and like your boy is never gonna nut at this pace similar idea here to adding load and reps over the weeks is like RIR3 is really cool to begin with just like a nice slow beach or some making out's cool to begin with but if we all want to try to get to the end of this thing which means nothing this is gonna have to be some progression better ideas to kind of ramp it up slowly and for an eye at what the intensity increases are doing to the receiver of said beach so for example if she's like fine you want it hard and like the crazy mouth shit cycle eyes and her eyes roll the back of her head remember Satanist girls are the best you're like holy shit that's too much that's a shit that's just to play this fine line of going a little harder seeing how you're feeling and and going up and escalating so on from there all right same ideas and training there is no avoiding hard training if you want to grow but if you want to grow the most your training needs to be hard and smart RPI per trippy app will make sure you're progressing on track monitoring and adjusting your workout at all times so for all that work you're doing you can be sure you're getting the best results towards the end if you're like basically you start nutting and as soon as you start nutting she removes said penis from said mouth and just looks at you with like dead eyes you're like a dead she's like what's that fun to do make you happy and you're like man why did you stop at the end damn it and stopping at the end is kind of similar to getting to that last week of training and just not fucking going at it you got to finish out of fucking high note right you can't just leave and say oh man we're just gonna you're just gonna mail it in so mailing and you're training is like you know the girl you're hooking up with mailing in the end of the end of blow jobs that's that's that's not good for anyone that's terrible what a rip off I want to refund in any case I got another similarity that still relates to sex that hell's wrong with me we'll get to that very shortly in training even if it's that last week some exercises have a super high stimulus to fatigue ratio let's say you're doing a axe whilst it just heals like money your knees feeling credible your quads are blowing up load additions have been done every single week you went from 300 pounds to 310 323 30 but your RIR isn't reducing like you're getting such crazy neural adaptations is such insane hypertrophy because that exercise is so amazing for you that like it's just about as hard a single time it could start at 3RR and still kind of feels like 3R even though you've put 40 pounds of weight over the course of five weeks out of the fucking shit your pumps are unbelievable you get so sore from this hack squat that you barely heal on time for the next time it's time to train legs the question is if you do blow it out in the last week and just go for broke exactly how do you plan to improve that you're getting ideal training and when the going is good there is a thought that just don't fuck with it just leave it alone just add another 10 pounds that last week just like you did the week before or add a rap to each sat and set to the exercise whatever you do normal additions no need to add 30 pounds and 3 reps just because you can chance of injury there goes up and also even if it doesn't go up what is it that you want more than incredible training that's right on the money don't spoil perfect so if you have an exercise that's going super well and you just add another 10 pounds and do 18 reps because you started at 14 four weeks ago and now you're up 40 pounds and 4 reps you don't have to go I get to 23 and how my tricep and I should have never done that just if it's perfect and you don't need to put the cherry on top just don't do it ride it out right similar in the sex department there as if you're getting the perfect beach you guys don't talk about like but she's doing that shit and you just want to have like a psychic moment because you can barely speak anymore you're like just don't change anything you just keep doing it's actively way mythical weird satinist chick shit that you're doing and I'm gonna be there you don't need to change a thing your boys already think there's the orgasm threshold I'm right here and it's gone it's gonna happen right change nothing because the alternative if she's like she notices your close to nutting and she's like oh sure I'm gonna really fucking go out of your like oh fucking god damn it you're ruined it then you got to you know play chess with each other for an hour so that your natural juice is start flowing again into lateral conversation it's nice maybe go out to eat I'm kidding that night is fucking over call yourself a newber all right that's the analogy what a terrible terrible episode why a few questions let's do a few questions first why not use a female stimulation example doctor Mike why did you use like a female giving a male a little job why not like kind of lingers a few answers first because my kind of lingers advice is extensive and scientific and meticulous and well developed and not free go on my only fans for that shit jakey the real reason is that honestly the patriarchy as a social institution prevents us from centering female pleasure and it's just like not okay to do that it's like not just kidding I have never been with a woman I wouldn't know what to do and I have in theory pretended that I received blood job so that's easier for me to talk about and that's really it question number two what happens after the BJ and then we do this whole stupid sex analogy why not finish it up here let me guide you through this you close your eyes right after you not you're like oh that was the best and then you hear from upstairs your grandma going bailing did you say something down there and then you open your eyes there's just you you're dicken your hand paper towel staying now computer screen again you were never with anyone and maybe you'll never be just like me was that weird yes but I'm here for it all day and if you want more this type of ship subscribe notifications turn them shit's on I guess that's what people do we have membership thing which is much less possibly zero sacks talk and much more scientific nourish it about how to actually get jacked and also if you look at the links in description we have a whole company that sells you stuff that helps you get uh more jacked more lean and cheese dare I say even happier but on the sexual front we got none for you that's all you including I'm your help so I'll see you next time
